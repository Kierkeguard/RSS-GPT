<div> publish, capacities, cross-zonal trade, congestion management, TSOs <br>
The EU power grid is congested, TSOs need to meet 70% capacity requirement by 2025, and improvements in cross-zonal capacity calculation are needed.<br>
The European Parliament and Commission highlight the urgency of meeting the 70% requirement by 2025 to avoid significant challenges. The EU power grid is congested, with the cost of managing congestion reaching EUR 4 billion in 2023. TSOs need to take coordinated actions to calculate capacity, manage congestion, and improve grid developments. The European Commission’s Joint Research Centre forecasts significant worsening of power grid congestion in the coming years, even in an optimistic scenario. ACER and JRC will hold a webinar on 10 July 2024 for further discussion. <br><br>Summary: The report emphasizes the urgency of meeting the 70% requirement by 2025, the congestion of the EU power grid, and the need for coordinated actions by TSOs to manage congestion and improve grid developments. <div>
<p>Today, ACER publishes its&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtTCQcJUFACUExdB1JbHVYBBlUdU1gGABoCBgZVAFBXBVdTVQMdAwJQAgsCDFIdVgwHAx0GWwMAGg1XB1EZUgVSU1QDAVFSVlsDRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">2024 Market Monitoring Report</a>&nbsp;on capacities for cross-zonal trade of electricity (including the progress in reaching the so-called &lsquo;70% requirement&rsquo;) and congestion management.</p>
<p>ACER highlights the urgency for Transmission System Operators (TSOs) to meet their obligation of making 70% of transmission capacity available for cross-border electricity trading by the end of 2025.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are ACER&rsquo;s key findings?</span></p>
<p>Already in April 2024,&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtXAQVTV1QHWkxbVFdRHVYPAgEdUwAAUBoAAAcBDQUAAlABU1IdAwJQAgsCDFIdVgwHAx0GWwMAGg1XB1EZUgVSU1QDAVFSVlsDRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ACER alerted</a>&nbsp;the European Parliament and Commission that there is much at stake in not meeting the minimum 70% requirement by the end of 2025 and that there are still significant challenges ahead to do so.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s report by ACER finds that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The EU power grid is increasingly congested (remedial actions like redispatching rose by 14.5% in 2023). The cost of managing this congestion in 2023 was EUR 4 billion.</li>
<li>Some TSOs in highly meshed areas of the EU power grid made available, on average, between 30% and 50% of the physical capacity of certain network elements in 2023, thus far from reaching 70%.</li>
<li>There are still significant benefits from improving how cross-zonal capacity is calculated in the EU, as demonstrated by the introduction of flow-based market coupling in the Core region.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, the recent&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsCVAYABVIBV0wIDwFSHVZbAFIdCggIAxpTAVZWVlADBw5QDgIdAwJQAgsCDFIdVgwHAx0GWwMAGg1XB1EZUgVSU1QDAVFSVlsDRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>&nbsp;by the European Commission&rsquo;s Joint Research Centre forecasts that power grid congestion will significantly worsen in the coming years, even in an optimistic grid development scenario.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How to meet the 70% minimum requirement by the end of 2025?</span></p>
<p>Meeting the 70% requirement needs a unified approach &ndash; each Member State&rsquo;s actions (or inactions) impact others and ultimately EU consumers. ACER calls for the swift implementation by Member States and TSOs of the 3 tools foreseen by EU rules to reach the 70% minimum requirement:</p>
<ul>
<li>TSOs to swiftly implement coordinated processes to first calculate capacity and then manage congestion. Moving toward a more regional approach will ensure that the Member States causing loop flows will bear their cost, allowing for more capacity to be made available.</li>
<li>TSOs to undertake targeted grid developments, focusing on most congested areas of the grid.</li>
<li>Improve the bidding zones configuration: if consistently unable to meet the 70% requirement, better align the bidding zone borders with where the structural grid congestion occurs.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<title>PIMFA Calls On Financial Ombudsman Service To Address The Economic Imbalance Between Claims Management Companies And The Financial Services Sector</title>

<div> Financial Ombudsman Service, PIMFA, Claims Management Companies, case fees, regulation
Summary: PIMFA calls for FOS to increase case fees for CMCs, ensuring a fair burden between firms and CMCs, considering consumer outcomes.<br><br> <div>
<p><span>PIMFA, the trade association for wealth management, investment services and the financial advice and planning industry, has called&nbsp;on the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) to take advantage of the opportunities presented to it in the Financial Services and Markets Act and level the playing field between Claims Management Companies (CMCs) and financial services providers.</span></p>
<p><span>In its response to the FOS Consultation &lsquo;<em>Charging Claims Management Companies and other Professional Representatives&rsquo;,&nbsp;</em>PIMFA argues that whilst the decision to levy a fee to CMCs is welcome, it will not achieve the policy objectives set out by the government when this power was given to the FOS. PIMFA argues that a case fee of &pound;250 for CMCs and Professional Representatives does not act as a disincentive to bring forward targeted block cases against firms that have little chance of success.</span></p>
<p><span>In its response, PIMFA suggests that FOS should review its approach and seek to levy a higher charge, which would result in firms and CMCs sharing the burden of case fees. Assuming a case fee of &pound;900 as outlined in the consultation proposals (&pound;250 case fee for the CMC and &pound;650 for the respondent firm), PIMFA suggests a 50-50 split between both parties, meaning that respondent firms would be required to pay &pound;450 as would CMCs and professional representatives.</span></p>
<p><span>PIMFA believes that in doing so, the FOS can put forward a framework which is more equitable for respondent firms whilst also recognising the limited role that CMCs play in advancing cases on behalf of consumers.</span></p>
<p><span>PIMFA is unconvinced that raising case fees for CMCs would result in consumer detriment, given that there is little evidence that the use of a CMC results in a demonstrably better outcome for consumers. It would also point to the presence of a fee cap for CMCs regulated by the FCA as evidence that the case fee would not be passed on to the end consumer. In considering this point, PIMFA would also urge the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) to accelerate its plans to adopt a regulatory framework for CMCs which mirrors the FCA.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Simon Harrington, Head of Public Affairs at PIMFA, commented:&nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;We would never advocate for the FOS to be anything other than free of use for consumers. It plays a valuable part in the financial services ecosystem, and we will always defend the right of consumers to access it.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;In accepting the principle that the FOS is and should always remain free to access for consumers, we find ourselves questioning why it is that CMCs should be able to insert themselves into a process for their economic benefit where there is little evidence to suggest that their presence is in any way contributory towards consumers receiving a good outcome.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;Whilst we are pleased to see that the FOS has accepted the principle that CMCs and professional representatives should be required to contribute towards case fees which they bring forward, we strongly believe that the FOS should review its proposals in order to set out a more equitable settlement between CMCs and respondent firms.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span><span>&ldquo;The FOS has a unique opportunity here to be bold and address the economic imbalance which currently exists between CMCs and the financial services sector. In doing so, the FOS can set out a framework which is equitable for firms and recognises the roles of both parties as &lsquo;customers&rsquo; of the FOS.&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<div> partners, industry reports, analysis, investment, collaboration
Summary:<br>SET collaborates with partners to produce 70 industry reports, benefiting companies and investors, promoting sustainable investment, and market development. <div>
<p class="Default">The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET), in collaboration with four key partners - Krungthai COMPASS, SCB Economic Intelligence Center, Kasikorn Research Center, and TRIS Rating Co., Ltd. &ndash; has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for the "Industry Analysis Reports by Business Sector." The initiative aims to issue more industry reports covering all business sectors, benefiting listed companies and providing investors with crucial decision-making information. The project raises awareness and highlights potential industries. With a target of producing 70 reports over 18 months, SET will start distributing these research papers through its channels and those of its partners in the third quarter of this year.</p>
<p><b>SET President Pakorn Peetathawatchai</b> said that SET committed to enhancing investor knowledge and disseminating information for making better investment decisions. Companies listed on SET and Market for Alternative Investment (mai) operated in diverse industries with promising business potential and growth opportunities. However, many of these companies lack comprehensive analyses or reports. Currently, most available analyses focus primarily on popular industries that attract a lot of investors&rsquo; interest.</p>
<p>To bridge the gap, SET has collaborated with the four expert partners to launch the "Industry Analysis Reports by Business Sector&rdquo; to promote industry analysis report production while raising awareness and showcasing the attractiveness of high-potential sectors. This initiative also broadens investors&rsquo; understanding.</p>
<p>The "Industry Analysis Reports by Business Sector", supported by Krungthai COMPASS, SCB Economic Intelligence Center, Kasikorn Research Center, and TRIS Rating, will deliver 70 industry-specific analysis reports over a period of one and a half years. These reports will feature content such as business structure overviews, value chains, key industry turning points, one-year business and competitive outlooks, short- and medium-term supporting factors and risks, and essential business summaries. Distribution of these analyses through SET and partner channels is scheduled to commence in the third quarter of 2024.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the concept of &ldquo;Make it &lsquo;Work&rsquo; for Every Future&rdquo; as SET&nbsp; approaches its 50<sup>th</sup> year, SET is confident that the collaboration will benefit both listed companies and investors with useful information for better analysis and investment decision-making, fostering sustainable investment and capital market development.</p>

<p><span>Mr Miller retires after a 35-year career in roles across the UK financial services and mortgage industry.

<p><span>Iress&rsquo; incoming Managing Director, Sourcing, Jennifer Rafferty said: &ldquo;Dave has been a driving force in the industry and leaves Iress at a position of strength. I&rsquo;m delighted to be taking on this role, having inherited a fantastic team, products and clients.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>On confirming his retirement, Mr Miller said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m extremely proud of what we&rsquo;ve achieved at Iress, helping the industry stay at the forefront of change with technology that makes mortgage, protection and retirement sourcing better for everyone. We&rsquo;ve worked alongside the industry to help close the income protection gap and help more people find the products that will prepare them best for retirement.

<title>Vienna Stock Exchange - HY1 2024: ATX Total Return Hits New All-Time High, Equity Turnover Increases</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>The Vienna Stock Exchange looks back on an upward trend in the first half of 2024 The performance of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wienerborse.at/en/indices/index-values/overview/?ISIN=AT0000A09FJ6&amp;ID_NOTATION=22786867&amp;cHash=a93e9c7943ca5db75889d75f69422292" target="_blank" title="Opens new window">ATX Total Return</a>&nbsp;has picked up strongly in the first six months: The national benchmark index including dividends hit a new all-time high and remains close to its peak. Equity turnover is rising again in Vienna, even though trading activity remains subdued across Europe. The Vienna Stock Exchange remains in a special position in terms of bond listings, where the historically strongest first half year ever was recorded. The listing of MWB AG marked a recent addition to the SME segment&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wienerborse.at/en/stocks-direct-market-plus/">direct market plus</a>. Another international trading member, Jump Trading Europe B.V., was connected to trading in Vienna.</p>
<p><a class="has-image" href="https://www.wienerborse.at/uploads/u/cms/images/fotos/presse/infografiken/vienna-stock-exchange-hy12024.jpg" target="_blank" title="Opens new window"><img alt="Trading in HY1 2024 on the Vienna Stock Exchange" height="322" src="https://www.wienerborse.at/uploads/u/cms/_processed_/b/8/csm_vienna-stock-exchange-hy12024_b14e0deaca.jpg" title="Trading in HY1 2024 on the Vienna Stock Exchange" width="514" /></a></p>
<h2>ATX including dividends ranks at record level</h2>
<p>The leading national index performed very well in the first half of the year. The ATX Total Return (including dividends) gained 10.17% year-on-year (as of 28 June 2024, ATX excluding dividends: 5.08%) and has already set several new records in 2024, surpassing the previous high of 9 February 2022 (8,251.98 points). The most recent all-time high was reached on 21 May at 8,566.58 points. With its performance, the ATX TR outperformed the German DAX (+8.86%), which also includes dividends. S IMMO AG (+76.00%), Addiko Bank AG (+49.81%) and FACC AG (+38.94%) achieved the strongest performance in the ATX Prime in the first half of the year. The market capitalization of all companies listed in Vienna amounted to EUR 130.21 billion at the end of June.</p>
<p>"Dividends must always be taken into account to get a complete picture of an investment's return. In this regard, the Austrian market has performed well despite ongoing economic uncertainties and is on a new record level. The average dividend yield in Austria is 5.7%. This underlines the resilience and dividend strength of Austria's leading companies, which traditionally pay out high dividends and are therefore very attractive to international investors," says Christoph Boschan, CEO of the Vienna Stock Exchange.</p>
<h3>Historically best first half-year for bond listings</h3>
<p>Bond listings in the Vienna MTF continue to grow. By 28 June, 6,116 new bonds had been listed in Vienna, more than ever before in the first half of a year. The Vienna Stock Exchange thus confirms its position as one of Europe's most active bond listing venues and currently serves over 1,000 active bond issuers from 39 countries with a total volume of around EUR 800 billion.</p>
<p>The Vienna Stock Exchange continues to score with issuers focusing on ESG: in the first half year, UniCredit Bank Austria AG with EUR 750 million and the domestic utility VERBUND AG with EUR 500 million have successfully issued green bonds. These are included in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wienerborse.at/en/listing/debt-securities/vienna-esg-segment/">Vienna ESG Segment</a>, which is specifically designed for sustainable bonds and has already seen more than 100 listings with a volume of around EUR 27.5 billion. This once again demonstrates the high importance of the capital market for the green transformation of the economy.</p>
<p>A significant change was made to the trading procedure for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wienerborse.at/en/trading/market-segmentation/bond-market/government-bonds/">Austrian government bonds</a>: Since March, these are tradable all-day on the Vienna Stock Exchange. Private investors in particular benefit from the continuous liquidity and high price quality ensured by the market makers Erste Group and Raiffeisen Bank International.</p>
<h3>Equity turnover on the rebound</h3>
<p>Trading activity and trading volumes were at a subdued level in the first half year &ndash; as on most European trading venues. In the second quarter, equity turnover increased again compared to the previous year, reaching EUR 5.21 billion in April (2023: EUR 3.83 billion), EUR 5.10 billion in May (2023: EUR 4.52 billion) and EUR 6.37 billion in June (2023: EUR 4.55 billion). The average monthly equity turnover amounted to EUR 5.16 billion in the first half of the year (2023: EUR 5.00 billion). The strongest trading days in the first two quarters were 15 March (EUR 813 million), 31 May (EUR 553 million) and 21 June (EUR 802 million). The most actively traded Austrian stocks as of 28 June were Erste Group Bank AG (EUR 5.1 billion), OMV AG (EUR 4.4 billion), VERBUND AG (EUR 2.8 billion), Wienerberger AG (EUR 2.7 billion) and CA Immobilien Anlagen AG (EUR 2.4 billion).</p>
<p>"In order to sustainably increase the liquidity of European capital markets, we need the political will to create substantial capital pools. For instance, pension funds should invest more in listed companies. Capital market-oriented pension provision is a very effective approach, as several European countries have shown. Austria should also take this step," demands Christoph Boschan.</p>

<title>Australian Equity Market Cleanliness A Crucial ASIC Priority - Supervising The Integrity Of Australia’s Equity Markets Is One Of ASIC’s Most Important Functions. A Clean Market That Is Fair, Orderly, And Transparent Is Critical To An Efficient Economy, Writes ASIC Chair Joe Longo</title>

<div> Australia, ASIC, equity markets, insider trading, market cleanliness
Summary:
ASIC supervises equity market integrity, targets insider trading, and promotes market cleanliness. It addresses privatisation impact and the handling of confidential information.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>Supervising the integrity of Australia&rsquo;s equity markets is one of ASIC&rsquo;s most important functions. Our market is among the cleanest in the world, and we are constantly seeking out any misconduct. While we are targeting leaks ahead of market announcements and insider trading, listed entities have a role to play in protecting their confidential information and reporting misconduct to ASIC.</p>
<p>A clean market that is fair, orderly, and transparent is critical to an efficient economy. It facilitates Australian businesses to raise capital and manage risk, and gives investors confidence to participate.</p>
<p>With most Australians having a stake in our listed equity markets &ndash; if not directly through their own investments, then indirectly through the nation&rsquo;s $3.8 trillion superannuation pool &ndash; the health and cleanliness of our markets have direct impacts on the financial wellbeing of Australians.</p>
<h2>Market cleanliness and insider trading</h2>
<p>Australians and listed entities should rest assured that we continue to have one of the cleanest equity markets in the world. ASIC&rsquo;s latest work to measure equity market cleanliness (suspicious trading ahead of company announcements) is nearing completion and we will have more to say in the weeks ahead.</p>
<p>As part of our efforts to keep Australia&rsquo;s markets clean, ASIC has been actively targeting insider trading through our new award-winning system which automatically hunts for and detects suspected market misconduct<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/articles/australian-equity-market-cleanliness-a-crucial-asic-priority/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span>[1]</span></a>.</p>
<p>We are also monitoring developments in innovative data science tools, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, to consider potential applications for surveillance. These measures will enable us to enhance our capability, for example, to detect other forms of insider trading not driven by announcements, such as front running.</p>
<p>At present, six insider trading criminal prosecutions are before the Courts, and multiple insider trading matters are under active investigation or have been referred by ASIC to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions for assessment.</p>
<p>Our recent successful court actions include the conviction of former Tesla director Kurt Schlosser<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/articles/australian-equity-market-cleanliness-a-crucial-asic-priority/#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><span>[2]</span></a>&nbsp;and corporate adviser Cameron Waugh<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/articles/australian-equity-market-cleanliness-a-crucial-asic-priority/#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><span>[3]</span></a>&nbsp;for insider trading.</p>
<h2>Keeping information confidential</h2>
<p>To avoid insider trading and breaching disclosure obligations, entities should consider whether their controls &ndash; policies, procedures, training and monitoring &ndash; are appropriate and meet legal and regulatory requirements. They should also carefully consider the handling of confidential information and conflicts to ensure the risk of insider trading is being managed.</p>
<p>We continue to see media reporting ahead of fundraising and merger and takeover activity. Some securities have had trading halts after media articles divulged confidential information about deals. Announcements in the transaction space are often highly material and price sensitive.</p>
<p>Leaks of this kind undermine market integrity and may negatively impact the value of securities as well as the attractiveness of Australian markets as a place to raise capital and transact. This impacts all Australians.</p>
<p>Listed entities should have a formal leak policy outlining steps to prevent, monitor and react to any leaks of material price sensitive information. Their advisers should also have policies and appropriate controls to limit access to confidential information to only those who require it. We have provided recommendations in the past on good practices in managing confidential information<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/articles/australian-equity-market-cleanliness-a-crucial-asic-priority/#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><span>[4]</span></a>.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, management of inside information does not only apply to listed entities. It also applies to entities operating in private markets where they interact with information about listed entities and securities. These parties should also have appropriate arrangements to identify and manage confidential information they receive.</p>
<p>ASIC is actively targeting leaks and we will take strong action to address this poor practice. Listed entities should be part of the solution and hold their personnel and advisers to account.</p>
<h2>Our response to an uptick in privatisation</h2>
<p>The global financial landscape for entities is changing. Some offshore markets (e.g., the United States) have had a long-term trend of declining public listings, with companies being taken private or consolidated into other entities. Australia has had a recent drop in listed companies, and fewer entities are lining up to come to market.</p>
<p>A reduction in the number of large, strong performing listed entities limits opportunities for Australians to participate directly in the potential future success of Australian companies. There is also likely more concentration in large institutional investors in these companies. This dynamic may pose risk to the equitable participation in listed entities by smaller investors.</p>
<p>Private markets do not only provide fewer investment opportunities for retail investors, they also have reduced financial reporting, disclosure, and corporate governance requirements. There is an associated risk of insider trading because there can be many contact points between listed entities, consultants and experts.</p>
<p>In response, ASIC is expanding its focus to respond to changes in the structure of capital markets. This includes examining other products and markets, including debt markets, when we conduct our market cleanliness work and further consider how firms are managing inside information.</p>
<p>Entities should report concerning behaviour to ASIC. Institutional investors should ensure they act in the best interests of their investors and/or members and promote equitable investor outcomes using their influence, including to enhance market cleanliness.</p>
<p>ASIC is committed to ensuring that Australia&rsquo;s markets remain among the cleanest and most transparent in the world. This requires collaborative effort on the part of ASIC, market operators, listed entities and market participants.</p>

<title>New Zealand Financial Markets Authority Censures deVere For Breaching Its Licence Obligations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> compliance, record keeping, financial advice, UK pension transfers, censure
Summary:
DeVere New Zealand Limited censured for inadequate record keeping, unsuitable advice, failure to ensure client understanding, and lack of diligence. FMA requires action plan. 
<br /><br /> <div>
<p>The Financial Markets Authority (FMA) &ndash; Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko &ndash; has censured Auckland-based financial services firm deVere New Zealand Limited (deVere) for failing to comply with obligations under its Financial Advice Provider (FAP) licence.</p>
<p>DeVere provides advice on insurance, investments, and retirement planning, including KiwiSaver and UK pension transfers. The censure relates to issues concerning deVere's conduct while advising clients on UK pension transfers.</p>
<p>Following a complaint about deVere's conduct, which has now been resolved, the FMA conducted a review of its client files. The review found deVere:</p>
<ul>
<li>Had inadequate record keeping in relation to advice given to its clients</li>
<li>Was unable to demonstrate that the recommendations made to clients were suitable</li>
<li>Failed to ensure its clients understood the financial advice they received and any limitations of the advice</li>
<li>Inappropriately limited the nature and scope of its advice and failed to clearly articulate those limitations to its clients&nbsp;</li>
<li>Failed to exercise adequate care, diligence, and skill in providing advice to its clients.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In particular, the FMA found deVere's advisers failed to adequately consider the client's investing experience and financial product knowledge, their risk profile in their advice on pension transfers, and the investments they recommended to the client. Some of the advised investment products were complex in nature and higher risk. The advisers did not consider the suitability of the recommended products, including whether the customer was fully aware and understood the risks involved in these types of investment products. In some cases, the recommended products were higher in risk than the clients' risk tolerance.</p>
<p>DeVere accepted there was an absence of proper records, including no records that the adviser discussed the advantages, disadvantages, risks, and benefits of switching from their clients' current plan to the platform and portfolio recommended with their clients.</p>
<p>There was no analysis or other documentation to show that deVere considered the comprehensive advice from a UK licensed adviser recommending the client not switch out of their current defined benefit pension plans, and demonstrating that the customer understood a number of disadvantages and risks in doing so, for example the loss of an income stream that a defined benefit scheme provides that the FMA would expect an adviser acting with care, diligence and skill to do so.</p>
<p>FMA's Director Specialist Supervision and Response, Peter Taylor, said: "FAPs have a duty to comply with the standards of ethical behaviour, conduct and client care as set out in the code of conduct. When advice relates to switching one pension product to another, we would expect an appropriate analysis and comparison to be performed considering the complexity of the product.</p>
<p>"In respect of the pension products deVere advised upon, these decisions made by customers are crucial to their retirement. Significant customer harm may occur if the advice is not suitable, and the adviser has not taken reasonable steps to ensure the customer understands the advice and the risks associated with it. DeVere's conduct falls short of the standards we expect and had the potential to cause harm to the client's long-term future as it involved irreversible decisions about their retirement savings.</p>
<p>"The FMA acknowledges that deVere has taken significant steps to improve its compliance and to implement improved record keeping practices. Nevertheless, we consider deVere's breaches warrant a public censure. Censures hold firms to account while serving as an important reminder of their obligations to their customers. I encourage all FAPs to take note of this censure and the FMA's expectations that they meet the standards required.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DeVere must submit an action plan to the FMA outlining the steps it will take, and by when, to remedy the breaches and ensure it does not breach its obligations in future. The FMA acknowledges deVere's cooperation to date, its desire to meet in full all its obligations, and its efforts to remedy the breaches. The FMA will monitor deVere's compliance and completion of the action plan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Notes</span></p>
<p>DeVere's breaches relate to its licence obligations as follows:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Standard Condition 1 of its financial advice provider licence by failing to create and maintain adequate records in relation to its financial advice service;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Code Standard 3 of the Code of Professional Conduct for Financial Advice Services (the Code) by failing to ensure that the financial advice is suitable for the client, having regard to the nature and scope of the financial advice;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Code Standard 4 of the Code by failing to take reasonable steps to ensure that the client understands the financial advice;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Section 431J of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 (FMC Act) by failing to ensure the client understand the nature and scope of advice; and</li>
<li>Section 431L of the FMC Act by failing to exercise the care, diligence, and skill that a prudent person engaged in the occupation of giving regulated financial advice would exercise in the same circumstances.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<br />
Summary:<br />
Guy Gentile found liable for violations as a control person of unregistered broker-dealer SureTrader, SEC will continue to hold accountable those evading securities laws. <div>
<p class="xxxxxxx">Today, after a ten-day trial, a jury in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida found Guy Gentile, the founder, owner, and CEO of MintBroker International, Ltd., f/k/a Swiss America Securities Ltd. and d/b/a SureTrader, a Bahamas-based broker-dealer, liable as a control person of SureTrader, which operated as a broker-dealer in the United States without being registered, in violation of the federal securities laws. The jury also found Guy Gentile liable for inducing SureTrader&rsquo;s registration violations.</p>
<p>Statement of SEC Division of Enforcement Deputy Director Sanjay Wadhwa:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are pleased with today&rsquo;s swift jury verdict holding Gentile accountable for his violations. Registration requirements play a critical role in protecting investors. SureTrader&rsquo;s years-long failure to register as a broker-dealer deprived investors of significant protections, including SEC inspections, financial responsibility rules, and recordkeeping requirements. This trial underscores that the Commission will continue to hold responsible those who seek to evade the registration requirements of the federal securities laws.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="text-align-center">###</p>

Summary:
CalPERS invests $10 billion in climate transition, including a new index, private market investments, and a plan for decarbonization.<br /><br /> <div>
<p>The California Public Employees&rsquo; Retirement System (CalPERS) announced today almost $10 billion in new actions aimed at investing in the global transition to a low-carbon economy, including new private market investments and a customized public equity index to enhance the pension fund's climate-aware investing.</p>
<p>"<a href="https://www.calpers.ca.gov/page/investments/sustainable-investments-program/net-zero" target="_self">The CalPERS Climate Action Plan</a>&nbsp;is designed to take advantage of the rapid growth in climate transition investment opportunities, the kind of high-quality investments that are essential in paying the retirement benefits promised to our members and their families," said CalPERS Chief Executive Officer Marcie Frost. "As we continue to measure the portfolio risks posed by climate change, our long-term strategy must also include providing some of the capital needed to finance the decarbonization of the global economy."</p>
<p>The announcements represent important early steps toward implementing the sweeping climate investment plan presented last November to the CalPERS Board of Administration. The plan calls for investing $100 billion in climate solutions by the end of 2030, while instituting an enhanced accountability process for companies to disclose and strengthen their plans to navigate the energy transition.</p>
<p>The new actions, totaling more than $9.7 billion, include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A customized Climate Transition Index, committing $5 billion in public equity investments to a scalable alternative to capitalization-weighting. The index will evaluate both the risks and opportunities of the global energy transition.</li>
<li>Nine signed commitments of more than $1.1 billion in private market investments in sectors supporting energy production and distribution as well as freight and supply chain optimization.</li>
<li>Additional private market investments, currently under review, totaling $3.6 billion. Some of these investments are expected to be final in the coming weeks and months.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Investment officials will provide additional details on the Climate Action Plan during the CalPERS Board of Administration meeting on July 15.</p>
<p>"The CalPERS Climate Action Plan is designed to make our pension fund the global partner of choice in climate investing," said Peter Cashion, managing investment director of the CalPERS Sustainable Investments Program. "To do that, we need a diverse set of investments and tools to generate the excess returns that are achievable during this historic transition to a low-carbon future."</p>
<p>CalPERS also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTLuCLAJjpQ" target="_blank" title="Opens in new window">released a new video</a>&nbsp;that expands on how the plan will work and its benefit to members&rsquo; retirement security.</p>
<p>CalPERS had approximately $47 billion in climate solutions at the inception of the plan in November 2023. By the end of 2030, that number will more than double, and the carbon intensity of the pension fund's portfolio is expected to decrease by at least 50%.</p>

<title>ISDA derivatiViews: Rules Must be Considered In Combination</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/usda-derivativiews-rules-must-be-considered-in-combination/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/usda-derivativiews-rules-must-be-considered-in-combination/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Treasury securities, SEC rules, market resilience, clearing, prudential framework<br />
Summary:<br />
New SEC rules mandate clearing of US Treasury securities. But US Basel III and G-SIB proposals may hinder market resilience and liquidity, impacting banks and end users. Regulatory framework must align for successful implementation. <div>
<p>In about 18 months, the first US Treasury securities will be mandated for clearing under new Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules. As demonstrated by the efforts to introduce clearing in the derivatives markets a decade ago and, more recently, the implementation of margin requirements for non-cleared derivatives, a structural change of this scale will take time and careful thought. But we also can&rsquo;t consider this requirement in isolation &ndash; we should think hard about the impact of various rules in combination to ensure policymakers achieve the outcome they want: a resilient, efficient Treasury market.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2023-247">SEC&rsquo;s Treasury reforms</a>&nbsp;&ndash; which include a requirement to clear certain cash Treasury securities from December 31 next year and repo transactions from June 30, 2026 &ndash; are part of a program of work to improve market resilience following a series of stress events, including the dash for cash in March 2020. Proponents say broader clearing of US Treasury securities will help reduce settlement risk, enhance liquidity and increase balance sheet capacity.</p>
<p>However, certain aspects of the US prudential framework are inconsistent with those objectives. For example, the current US Basel III &lsquo;endgame&rsquo; proposal and changes to the surcharge for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) would constrain balance sheets and could force banks to scale back or withdraw from certain intermediation activities. Nowhere is this more evident than central clearing. According to an impact study by ISDA and SIFMA, the proposals would increase capital for clearing businesses at US G-SIBs by more than 80%.</p>
<p>Implementing central clearing as a risk mitigant has been a key regulatory objective since the financial crisis, and we think it&rsquo;s worked very well in the swaps market. So, it&rsquo;s completely unclear to us why US prudential regulators suddenly think this activity is so risky that it warrants a near doubling of capital. A tax of this size will inevitably affect the ability of US banks to offer client clearing services, reducing capacity and increasing costs.</p>
<p>The US Basel III proposal will also make it more expensive to raise funding for meeting margin requirements on cleared transactions. That&rsquo;s due to the introduction of minimum haircut floors for securities financing transactions (SFTs), putting the US at odds with other major jurisdictions like the EU and UK, which have opted not to enforce this requirement.</p>
<p>This is compounded by the US supplementary leverage ratio (SLR), which serves as a non-risk-sensitive binding constraint on banks and can impede their ability to act as intermediaries, including their capacity to clear for clients. That&rsquo;s particularly the case in times of stress. At the height of the global pandemic in April 2020, this was a serious enough concern to prompt the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20200401a.htm">Federal Reserve to temporarily exclude US Treasury securities from the SLR calculation</a>.</p>
<p>We think regulators should closely consider the impact of various rules in combination to achieve consistent policy goals. In this context,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/01/16/isda-and-sifma-response-to-us-basel-iii-npr/">ISDA and SIFMA have proposed several calibration changes</a>&nbsp;to the US Basel III and G-SIB proposals to better reflect actual levels of risk. These include changes to certain aspects of the rules for credit valuation adjustment and modifications to the complexity and interconnectedness categories of the G-SIB surcharge to reduce the impact on client clearing. We also proposed changes to certain aspects of the rules for SFTs, including removal of the minimum haircut floor.</p>
<p>Separately, we&rsquo;ve called for a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/03/05/isda-submits-letter-to-us-agencies-on-slr-reform/">permanent exclusion of US Treasury securities from total leverage exposure</a>, which would free capacity for banks to participate in US Treasury markets and facilitate access to cleared markets, especially during periods of stress. A permanent exclusion would better promote the stability and resilience of the US Treasury market and give banks more certainty to expand balance sheet capacity than a regime introduced during market stresses that will later be reversed.</p>
<p>We strongly believe the capital rules should be consistent, risk-sensitive and appropriate. Disproportionate increases in capital could force banks to retreat from certain trading and intermediary businesses, creating capacity constraints and raising financing and hedging costs for end users.</p>
<p>The US Treasury market reforms represent a major transition for a market that is critical to the functioning of the global financial system. That means market participants and regulators need to work together to ensure this change is managed appropriately and the regulatory framework is calibrated and aligned to avoid potential impacts on liquidity and market capacity.</p>

<div> Enforcement action, fraudulent scheme, restitution, forex fraud, CFTC<br />
Summary:<br />
The CFTC announced a supplemental consent order against Dwight A. Foster and K.E.L. Enterprises, Inc. for a fraudulent forex scheme.<br /> <div>
<p><span><span><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced Judge Sean F. Cox of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan entered a supplemental consent order against&nbsp;<span>Dwight A. Foster</span>&nbsp;and his firm&nbsp;<span>K.E.L. Enterprises, Inc</span>., both based in the West Bloomfield, Michigan area.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The supplemental consent order requires Foster and KEL to pay, jointly and severally, $4,548,390.51 in restitution to defrauded victims, $803,126.83 in disgorgement, and a $1</span>.<span>6</span>&nbsp;million&nbsp;<span>civil monetary penalty in connection with a fraudulent foreign currency (forex) scheme.&nbsp;</span>O<span>n July 18, 2023, the&nbsp;</span>c<span>ourt entered an initial consent order of permanent injunction against Foster and KEL. The initial consent order impose</span>d<span>&nbsp;a permanent injunction against Foster and KEL</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span>ban</span>ned<span>&nbsp;them from trading in any CFTC-regulated markets and registering with the CFTC.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Additionally, the initial consent order found from January 1, 2017 to July 3, 2023 (the relevant period), KEL acted as a commodity pool operator (CPO) without being registered with the CFTC as a CPO as required, and Foster acted as an associated person (AP) of a CPO without being registered with the CFTC as an AP of a CPO as required. Also, KEL failed to make disclosures and maintain books and records as a CPO is required to do.<br /><br /><span>The initial consent order and supplemental consent order resolve the CFTC&rsquo;s enforcement action Foster and KEL. [See CFTC Press Release No.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8744-23"><span>8744-23</span></a><span>.]</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Case Background</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The initial&nbsp;</span>and supplemental&nbsp;<span>consent order</span>s<span>&nbsp;stem from the CFTC's June 28, 2023 complaint. The initial consent order f</span>ou<span>nd</span>,<span>&nbsp;during the&nbsp;</span>relevant period, Foster and KEL engaged in a multimillion-dollar fraudulent scheme through which they solicited $13,214,327.88 from 50 people to participate in a commodity pool operated by Foster and KEL for the purpose of trading in commodity interests, including forex pairs on a leveraged, margined, or financed basis with participants who were not eligible contract participants (retail forex) and forex futures contracts. Instead of trading pool participants&rsquo; funds as promised, Foster and KEL misappropriated all of the pool participants&rsquo; funds by depositing them directly into KEL&rsquo;s corporate bank accounts, which Foster controlled, rather than depositing the funds directly into an account in the name of the pool at a futures commission merchant and/or a retail foreign exchange dealer. Foster and KEL misappropriated the participants&rsquo; funds to pay Foster&rsquo;s personal expenses, including, but not limited to, a car loan, insurance, credit card payments, and other daily living expenses. Additionally, Foster used not less than&nbsp;<a name="_Hlk160644687">$8,665,937.37</a>&nbsp;of later-in-time participants&rsquo; funds to pay earlier-in-time participants purported &ldquo;profits&rdquo; and/or &ldquo;redemptions&rdquo; in the manner of a Ponzi scheme.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The CFTC cautions that orders requiring repayment of funds to victims may not result in the recovery of any money lost because the wrongdoers may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The CFTC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Eastern District of Michigan and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this case are Timothy J. Mulreany, George H. Malas, Kassra Goudarzi, and Paul G. Hayeck.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p>Representatives from United Capital Securities highlighted how the students can access the market with technology to key into the opportunity provided by the ongoing banking recapitalization efforts. They also emphasized the importance of taking a longer-term view to investing in the market.</p>
<p>Clair Jemide, Executive Director of NHEF, expressed gratitude to the facilitators from NGX, led by Mr. Babalola, for the invaluable experience provided to the students.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published its Q4 2023 quarterly dashboard on minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL), which</span>&nbsp;<span>discloses aggregated statistical information for 333 EU/EEA banks earmarked for resolution.&nbsp;All banks are meeting their MREL requirements in line with the Bank Recovery and Resolution (BRRD) deadline of 1 January 2024, except for 3 banks that reported technical shortfalls against this deadline. 23 banks have been granted a deadline extension. The amount of instruments coming to maturity over the next year for the sample reached EUR 207bn.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>As of 31 December 2024, 307 banks out of a sample of 333 were meeting their MREL target.</li>
<li>3 banks reported a technical shortfall of EUR 226mn or 0.6% of their combined risk weighted assets (RWA), 0.07% of the total RWA of the sample &ndash; the shortfalls are understood to be resolved since then.</li>
<li>23 banks have been granted a transition period beyond 1 January 2024. Their combined outstanding shortfall reached EUR8.0bn or 1.6% of their combined RWAs or 0.1% of the total RWAs in of the sample.</li>
<li>Banks in the sample reported EUR 207bn of MREL instruments becoming ineligible by the end of 2024 for maturity reasons. Those represent around 18.1% of MREL eligible instruments other than own funds.</li>
<li>The number of banks earmarked for resolution has increased over the past year with 352 external MREL decisions received by the EBA in force as of 1 May 2024, against 309 as of 1 May 2023. This increase is essentially driven by small banks moving from liquidation to resolution.</li>
<li>Transfer strategies continue to be the preferred option in terms of number of decisions (55%), while bail-in is the favoured option in terms of RWAs covered (94%).</li>

<div> Elections, Spectrum Markets, Retail Investors, CAC 40, SERIX<br />
Summary:<br />
Retail investors respond positively to French election results, boosting trading activity on Spectrum Markets. Confidence in CAC 40 and FTSE MIB remains high.<br /> <div>
<p class="xxmsonormal">Michael Hall, Head of Distribution at&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.spectrum-markets.com/en" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Spectrum Markets</a>, the pan-European trading venue,&nbsp; has commented on how European retail investors responded yesterday ahead of the first round of French Parliamentary Election.</p>
<p class="xxmsonormal">&lsquo;<i>Trading activity on Spectrum Markets, the pan-European trading venue for financial instruments, boom on the CAC 40 after the first turn of the French elections, which reignite the interest of retail investors on the main French index. After the election day, trades related to CAC 40 saw a boost on Spectrum Markets, peaking on Monday, with trades executed on July 1st&nbsp;almost doubling the daily average over the past weeks.</i></p>
<p class="xxmsonormal"><i>The results seem to have pleased markets, which reacted positively to first verdicts of the polls. SERIX data, the pan-European sentiment index elaborated by Spectrum Markets, related to CAC 40 reached the level of 115 on July 1st, reaffirming a sense of confidence towards the French benchmark.</i></p>
<p class="xxmsonormal"><i>Elections results, however, did not seem to have taken retail investors by surprise. SERIX data ahead of the election day already showed a positive outlook: the SERIX value for the CAC 40 increased from 101 at the end of May to 106&nbsp;in June, while the value for the FTSE MIB, which is important since Italy is the second market particularly exposed to the volatility caused by French turmoil, went up from 98 at the end of May to 102&nbsp;in June.</i></p>
<p class="xxmsonormal"><i>Investors do not seem to believe that the potential changes in the French government are going to determine significant modifications to the French economic policy.&rsquo;</i></p>

<title>Purdue University/CME Group Ag Economy Barometer: Farmer Sentiment Drifts Lower On Weaker Future Expectations</title>

<div> sentiment, farmland values, interest rates, investment, energy production
Summary:
The farmer sentiment decreased due to concerns about high input costs, lower product prices, and rising interest rates. Investment sentiment also declined, with less expectation for farmland value increase. Interest in carbon capture and storage projects and leasing farmland for solar energy production is increasing. Energy production and nonfarm investor demand are seen as potential drivers of farmland values. Farmers are cautious about making large investments due to concerns about high breakeven levels, potential weakening of crop and livestock prices, and rising interest rates. They are also exploring opportunities in carbon capture and storage projects and leasing farmland for solar energy production, with increasing payment offers and lease rates. <div>
<p>Farmer sentiment drifted downward in June as the&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4203672-1&amp;h=4215149614&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fageconomybarometer%2F&amp;a=Purdue+University%2FCME+Group+Ag+Economy+Barometer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Purdue University/CME Group Ag Economy Barometer</a></span>&nbsp;reading of 105 was 3 points lower than a month earlier. The overall decline in sentiment was due to a five-point drop in the Index of Future Expectations, which fell to 112, while the June Current Conditions Index increased to 90, 1 point higher than the May index. High input costs, the risk of lower prices for their products, and rising interest rates continue to weigh on farmer sentiment. This month's Ag Economy Barometer survey was conducted from&nbsp;June 17-21.</p>
<p>"The impact of rising interest rates on their farm operations has become a bigger concern for producers in recent months," said&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4203672-1&amp;h=771989589&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fageconomybarometer%2Fteam%2Fjim-mintert%2F&amp;a=James+Mintert" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">
James Mintert</a></span>, the barometer's principal investigator and director of&nbsp;Purdue University's&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4203672-1&amp;h=1864552616&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fhome%2F&amp;a=Center+for+Commercial+Agriculture" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Center for Commercial Agriculture</a>.</span>&nbsp;"Interest rate risk and high breakeven levels combined with concerns that crop and livestock prices could weaken are holding back producer sentiment and making producers cautious about making large investments."</p>
<p>This month's Farm Capital Investment Index declined by 3 points to a reading of 32, just one point above its historical low. More producers indicated this month that it is not a favorable time for large investments compared to May, while the percentage of producers who viewed it as a good time remained the same.</p>
<p>The Short-Term Farmland Value Expectations Index remained steady at 115 for June. However, there was a notable shift in producers' longer-term outlook on farmland values, with the Long-Term Farmland Values Index dropping to 152, down 7 points from May. Fewer producers expect that farmland values will increase over the next five years, coinciding with a rise in those anticipating values holding steady. Among those expecting a long-term increase in farmland values, 57% attributed their confidence to nonfarm investor demand, while 16% cited inflation as a driving factor. June marked the third consecutive month to include "Energy Production" as a potential driver of farmland values, with 10% of optimistic respondents pointing to energy production as a key driver of farmland values.</p>
<p>This month's survey also explored respondents' interest in carbon capture and storage projects introduced by ethanol plants. Eight percent of respondents reported being approached about such projects, with the majority (93%) noting they received payment offers for less than&nbsp;$25&nbsp;per acre and only 8% receiving offers exceeding&nbsp;$50&nbsp;per acre. Additionally, 16% of respondents reported discussions taking place within the last six months about leasing farmland for solar energy production, a slight decline from April and May survey responses. However, lease rates continued an upward trend, with 69% of respondents being offered long-term rates of&nbsp;$1,000&nbsp;per acre or higher, compared to 27% in&nbsp;June 2021. Notably, 27% of respondents received offers of&nbsp;$1,500&nbsp;per acre or more, with 58% of leases including an annual escalator clause, typically between 2% and 3% per year.</p>

<div> Evaluation, securitisation market, risk retention, prudential requirements, FSB

Summary:
The evaluation by FSB found that risk retention and prudential requirements have improved securitisation market resilience without significant negative effects on financing to the economy. Redistribution of risk to the non-bank financial intermediation sector is observed. Further analysis is ongoing. <br /><br /> <div>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Evaluation finds that risk retention and higher prudential requirements have enhanced the resilience of the securitisation market, without strong evidence of material negative side-effects on financing to the economy.</strong> </li>
<li> <strong>The</strong><strong>&nbsp;reforms have contributed to a redistribution of risk from banks to the non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI) sector</strong>. </li>
<li> <strong>Further analysis will be undertaken, incorporating feedback from this public consultation, before publication of a final report at the end of 2024.</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) published today a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/07/evaluation-of-the-effects-of-the-g20-financial-regulatory-reforms-on-securitisation-consultation-report/">consultation report with interim findings of its evaluation of the effects of the G20 financial regulatory reforms on securitisation</a>.&nbsp;The evaluation focuses on the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) minimum retention recommendations and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) revisions to prudential requirements for banks&rsquo; securitisation-related exposures. These reforms aimed to address the vulnerabilities in the securitisation market that contributed to the amplification of losses during the 2008 global financial crisis (GFC).</p>
<p>The analysis thus far suggests that risk retention and higher prudential requirements have enhanced the resilience of securitisation markets. Securitisation volumes containing complex structures that contributed to the GFC have declined significantly. The quality of collateral in securitisations has improved in some asset classes (e.g. residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS)), though not in others (e.g. collateralised loan obligations (CLOs)). Credit performance has been strong post-GFC, and the market has not faced significant stress. Some analyses suggest increased resilience of the senior CLO tranches despite the deterioration in lending standards and no obvious misalignment of incentives between RMBS issuers and investors in recent years. However, it is difficult to attribute these outcomes directly to the reforms given confounding factors.</p>
<p>While securitisation has diminished in relation to private-sector credit since the GFC, the decline has not been uniform across all segments and much of it took place in the immediate aftermath of the GFC, before the reforms were implemented. It is also not clear that overall financing to the economy has been negatively affected, if one considers growing corporate and household indebtedness and the growth in alternative financing instruments over this period.</p>
<p>The reforms have contributed to a redistribution of risk from banks to the NBFI sector, with banks now holding higher-rated tranches. This shift is not unique to securitisation, given the increased reliance on market-based intermediation since the GFC.</p>
<p>The FSB is inviting comments on this consultation report and the questions set out. Responses should be submitted via this&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.fsb.org/survey/411667?newtest=Y&amp;lang=en" rel="noopener" target="_blank">secure online form</a></strong>&nbsp;by 2 September 2024. For questions, please contact the FSB (<a href="mailto:fsb@fsb.org">fsb@fsb.org</a>). Responses will be published on the FSB&rsquo;s website unless respondents expressly request otherwise on the online form.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The evaluation focuses, in terms of scope, on the effects of the reforms on the CLO and the non-government-guaranteed part of the RMBS market segments. It draws on a broad range of information sources and analytical approaches, including responses to a questionnaire by FSB member jurisdictions; input from stakeholders; a literature review; and quantitative indicators and descriptive analysis using data from commercial providers, FSB members, and other sources. These sources taken together form the basis for the conclusions in the report. The FSB will continue its analysis and expects to publish the final report at the end of 2024.</p>
<p>The evaluation was undertaken using the FSB&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2017/07/framework-for-post-implementation-evaluation-of-the-effects-of-the-g20-financial-regulatory-reforms/">framework for the post-implementation evaluation of the effects of the G20 financial regulatory reforms</a>. The framework guides analyses of whether the G20 reforms are achieving their intended outcomes and helps identify any material unintended consequences that may have to be addressed, without compromising on the objectives of the reforms. This is the fifth evaluation under the FSB framework; all completed evaluations are published on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/work-of-the-fsb/assessing-the-effects-of-reforms/">FSB website</a>.</p>
<p>The FSB has developed a comprehensive&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2023/09/enhancing-the-resilience-of-non-bank-financial-intermediation-progress-report-3/">work programme to enhance the resilience of NBFI</a>, which aims to ensure a more stable provision of financing to the economy and reduce the need for extraordinary central bank interventions. The FSB will report to the G20 on progress in this NBFI work programme in July 2024.</p>
<p>The FSB coordinates at the international level the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies and develops and promotes the implementation of effective regulatory, supervisory, and other financial sector policies in the interest of financial stability. It brings together national authorities responsible for financial stability in 24 countries and jurisdictions, international financial institutions, sector-specific international groupings of regulators and supervisors, and committees of central bank experts. The FSB also conducts outreach with approximately 70 other jurisdictions through its six Regional Consultative Groups.</p>
<p>The FSB is chaired by Klaas Knot, President of De Nederlandsche Bank. The FSB Secretariat is located in Basel, Switzerland and hosted by the Bank for International Settlements.</p>

Summary: 
- 24% mortgages have rates of 5% or higher
- Spike in VA refinance share to over 30%
- Lower payments through VA refinances resulted in high prepay speeds
- ICE Borrower Insights Survey shows preference for lowest mortgage rate
- Lenders need to stay attuned to borrowers' needs<br /> <div>
<div class="bw-subheadline-wrapper">
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li>According to ICE Mortgage Technology data and analytics, as of May, 24% of mortgage holders had current interest rates of 5% or higher, up from 10% two years ago</li>
<li>Four million loans originated since 2022 have rates of 6.5% or higher &ndash; 1.9M at 7%+ &ndash; providing modest opportunity for growth in the number of mortgage holders with incentive to refinance as rates ease</li>
<li>An average of ~240K mortgages sit in each 1/8th of a percent rate band from 7-7.625% providing only modest increases to the number of in-the-money mortgages as those loans gain refinance incentive</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s a spike of 690K loans with rates just below 7%, driven in part by borrowers buying down their rates for the comfort of an interest rate that starts with a 6, which could be a tipping point to more meaningful, albeit still modest, refi activity as those borrowers gain incentive to refinance</li>
<li>The VA share of rate/term refi activity experienced a noticeable upswing in recent weeks, accounting for more than 30% of recent rate locks, according to ICE originations data, up from less than 10% last year</li>
<li>The average VA refinance borrower is early into their 30-year term (average prior loan age of ~1 year) and benefitting from a 1pp cut in their first lien mortgage rate, for an average savings of $230 per month</li>
<li>Refinance retention hit its highest level in 18 months in Q1, driven in part by a tripling of rate/term retention &ndash; from 15% in Q4 to 46% in Q1 &ndash; among borrowers refinancing their VA and FHA loans</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE:ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today released its July 2024&nbsp;<a href="https://www.icemortgagetechnology.com/resources/data-reports" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">ICE Mortgage Monitor Report</a>, based on the company&rsquo;s industry-leading mortgage, real estate and public records data sets.</p>
<p>This month&rsquo;s Mortgage Monitor looks into the dynamics behind the changing makeup of the active mortgage market, which is gradually shifting toward higher average rates. As Andy Walden, ICE&rsquo;s Vice President of Research and Analysis notes, the overall market remains heavily skewed toward lower-rate mortgages, but that is changing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As of May, 24% of homeowners with mortgages now have a current interest rate of 5% or higher,&rdquo; said Walden. &ldquo;As recently as two years ago an astonishing nine of every 10 mortgage holders were below that threshold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All in, there are 5.8M fewer sub-5% mortgages in the market today than there were at this time in 2022. This has been a slow-moving change, as borrowers with lower rates have sold their homes or, to a smaller degree, refinanced to withdraw equity. The entire market is acutely aware of how elevated rates have been constraining origination volumes. But seen from another angle, the same dynamic is also serving to gradually enlarge the population of folks with high-rate mortgages, who are actively waiting for the moment a refinance makes sense. This would benefit both a growing number of homeowners and lenders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As noted in the report, 4M first lien mortgages originated since 2022 have 30-year rates above 6.5%, with 1.9M having rates of 7% or higher. On average, there are ~240K active mortgages in each 1/8th of a percentage point bracket in the 7-7.625% range; however, there&rsquo;s a noticeable spike of 690K loans with rates just below 7%. Walden explains:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The concentration of active loans just below 7% has more to do with borrower psychology than concrete savings. There&rsquo;s clearly something appealing in today&rsquo;s market for a homeowner to see a 6-handle in front of their mortgage rate. From a rate/term refinance lending perspective, this group is worth watching as they represent a potential tipping point for a return to more meaningful, albeit historically modest, refi volumes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For now, refi volumes remain at a fraction of historical levels. That said, we have seen some notable shifts in who is taking out refis in today&rsquo;s market. Consider, for example, the recent rise in VA market share, from less than 10% of rate/term refis a year ago to more than 30% in recent weeks, according to ICE origination data.</p>
<p>The rise in VA refinance share seems to be due, in large part, to streamline refinances. Some veterans, especially those who had taken out mortgages within the past year, availed themselves of the streamlined refinancing program to lower their interest rate by more than a full percentage point, for an average savings of $230 per month among April originations, according to a before-and-after analysis of ICE McDash +Property data.</p>
<p>That makes sense, considering the ICE U.S. VA 30-Year fixed rate mortgage index is down nearly a full percentage point from its peak in late October, with the average rate offering among such loans notably below that of FHA and conforming mortgage counterparts. VA refinances also helped improve the servicing retention rate in Q1 to its highest level in 18 months, with retention of FHA and VA refinances tripling from 15% in Q4 to 46% in Q1.</p>
<p>Those lower payments come at a cost, however, as the average borrower increased their loan balance to buy down their rate and/or finance closing costs. The quick turn also resulted in unusually high prepay speeds, which can negatively impact investors in VA loan backed securities.</p>
<p>The recent activity among VA loans supports the findings of the recently released 2024 ICE Borrower Insights Survey, which showed that finding the lowest mortgage rate trumped all other concerns when choosing a lender, with a 20-point delta between that and the next most frequent choice. But, while borrowers want the lowest rate, they typically don&rsquo;t consider many options.</p>
<p>In fact, 84% of borrowers surveyed considered only one (36%) or two (48%) options before selecting a lender. This, as well as the successful proactive retention of FHA/VA borrowers in Q1, shows how important it is for lenders to stay attuned to their borrowers&rsquo; needs and make first contact when a beneficial refi opportunity arises.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>The annual report, based on a survey of over 400 security professionals in the U.S. involved in their organization&rsquo;s approach to cybersecurity and digital risk, reveals organizations are making significant strides in digital risk management compared to previous years.

<li dir="ltr"> <span>Nearly half of respondents describe their risk tolerance towards AI as very high (17%) or high (29%), while only 12 percent report a low (9%) or very low (3%) AI risk tolerance.

<title>RILA Re-Form: Statement On Registration For Index-Linked Annuities And Registered Market-Value Adjustment Annuities - Amendments To Form N-4 For Index-Linked Annuities, Registered Market-Value Adjustment Annuities, And Variable Annuities, SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce, July 1, 2024</title>

<div> Securities, RILAs, Disclosure, Investors, Rulemaking <br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
Commission's success in meeting deadlines, support for RILA registration, concerns about bias in RILA disclosures, need for new communication methods. <div>
<p>In the last few years, the Commission&rsquo;s staff has often had to complete rulemakings on tight deadlines. Even with aggressive time constraints, the staff succeeded admirably in meeting the congressional mandate to provide a tailored form to register the offerings of registered index-linked annuities (&ldquo;RILAs&rdquo;).<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-rila-070124#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;I support the Commission&rsquo;s general approach to implementing the congressional mandate but would have preferred a more merits-neutral approach and a greater focus on facilitating the use of creative disclosure techniques to foster deeper investor understanding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The congressional mandate that prompted this rulemaking appropriately spurred the Commission to rethink the registration forms used for RILAs. Allowing RILAs and registered MVA annuities to register on Form N-4 instead of on one of the S Forms will benefit non-variable annuity<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-rila-070124#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;investors and issuers. As commenters highlighted, the Regulation S-K disclosures were ill-suited for RILAs and costly to boot. The new N-4 regime provides a number of benefits. Unlike the S Forms, Form N-4 is designed to provide investors with particularized information concerning variable contracts. Filing on Form N-4 will allow insurance companies to file financial statements in accordance with statutory accounting principles when the insurance company does not otherwise prepare GAAP financial statements. Investors likely will have an easier time comparing non-variable products to other annuity products. Finally, allowing insurance companies to use a summary prospectus will simplify investor research. The new approach should help the many Americans that consider purchasing RILAs better understand the products. As with many other investments, RILAs can be complex and potentially have consequential downsides,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-rila-070124#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;so investors need to have good, clear disclosures. Today&rsquo;s amendments are a step in the right direction. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Tempering the rule&rsquo;s positive aspects are the traces of anti-RILA bias. Our disclosure rules should be designed to elicit objective, realistic disclosure of a product&rsquo;s potential benefits, risks, and costs. We want disclosures that neither give unduly short shrift to a product&rsquo;s upsides, nor exaggerate its potential downsides. This rule, to turn an old classic on its head, accentuates the negative.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-rila-070124#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;RILA issuers, for example, will have to disclose on the front cover page &ldquo;the maximum potential loss that an investor could experience in connection with a negative contract adjustment.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-rila-070124#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;The Commission insists that the disclosure &ldquo;is not intended to suggest the maximum loss is likely to occur,&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-rila-070124#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;but, absent necessary context, the disclosure seems designed to dissuade investors from purchasing RILAs. As commenters rightly point out, no other securities offerings are burdened by the same disclosure.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-rila-070124#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;The disparity is almost certainly going to confuse potential RILA investors and lead them to conclude that these products are riskier than they are.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-rila-070124#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Investor confusion will also arise from the absence of realistic data points with respect to caps and buffers. The RILA prospectus will include a bar chart showing each index&rsquo;s annual return, coupled with &ldquo;a hypothetical example alongside each index return that reflects the return after applying a 5% cap and a -10% buffer.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-rila-070124#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;As commenters remarked, these hypothetical caps and buffers do not reflect industry practice.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-rila-070124#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;As an alternative to these fixed hypothetical rates, one commenter quite naturally suggested that the bar charts should have &ldquo;an overlay of&nbsp;<i>actual</i>&nbsp;rates.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-rila-070124#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;To do otherwise, as the commenter suggested, compels insurance companies to publish &ldquo;misleading&rdquo; information.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-rila-070124#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;The Commission points weakly to an accompanying legend that will inform investors that hypotheticals do not reflect &ldquo;an investor&rsquo;s returns[, which] will differ from that of the index perhaps significantly.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-rila-070124#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mischaracterizing a fundamental feature of RILAs as a&nbsp;<i>fee</i>&nbsp;will contribute to the confusion. RILA investors knowingly give up potentially higher returns for &ldquo;some ability to customize a level of risk with which they are comfortable.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-rila-070124#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>&nbsp;That give-up is no more a fee than the downside buffer is a rebate. The Commission acknowledges that &ldquo;contractual limits placed on an investor&rsquo;s gains, such as a cap rate or participation rate, are not fees or charges in a&nbsp;<i>conventional</i>&nbsp;sense,&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-rila-070124#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>&nbsp;yet requires insurance companies to include these caps under the rubric of &ldquo;Ongoing Fees and Expenses.&rdquo; By characterizing these caps as &ldquo;implicit fees,&rdquo; we have abandoned the plain language we demand of registrants.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-rila-070124#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>&nbsp;Our regrettable homage to Humpty Dumpty in&nbsp;<i>Alice in Wonderland</i><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-rila-070124#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a>&nbsp;could confuse investors, thus making it more difficult for them to determine whether a RILA is the right product for their portfolio.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This rulemaking would be stronger if it included a formal transition period for rule 156, the interpretive rule that we have amended to include non-variable annuity sales literature. As the Commission acknowledges, &ldquo;these amendments . . .&nbsp;<a name="_Hlk170215000">could result in insurance companies reviewing their sales literature in light of the final amendments to rule 156</a>.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-rila-070124#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a>&nbsp;Our rationale for disallowing a transition period with respect to the rule 156 amendments springs from longstanding investor protection concerns,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-rila-070124#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a>&nbsp;which I share, but those concerns will be addressed most thoroughly if issuers undertake careful reviews of their sales literature in light of the Commission&rsquo;s newly applicable interpretation. I underscore the Commission&rsquo;s stated readiness to assist insurance companies that might have questions about how to navigate rule 156.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-rila-070124#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a></p>
<p>More generally, the Commission needs to stretch its ninety-year-old self and explore new ways for firms to communicate with investors. Our standard disclosure formula needs retooling.&nbsp; Because of their features, RILAs provided a unique opportunity to try new things, like decision trees and interactive technologies, and shed old ones, like requiring issuers to file ten copies of forms.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-rila-070124#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a>&nbsp;My hope is that the Commission will commit itself to working with the public to see how our disclosure regime can be improved to take advantage of approaches and technologies that will enhance investor engagement and understanding. Part of that work should be investor testing, such as the testing that preceded these amendments.</p>

<p>Thank you, Lukasz [Chyla],for that introduction. And thank you to the Jagiellonian University and to Catholic University for hosting this conference. Let me begin by stating that my views are my own as a Commissioner and not necessarily those of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or my fellow Commissioners.</p>
<p>The last time I was in Poland was approximately three decades ago. It was a brief but memorable stop on an unfocused American student&rsquo;s hop across Europe. Among other things, Poland provided me my only hitchhiking experience. Some kind soldiers in a military jeep driving through the richly beautiful, deeply wooded Polish countryside picked my traveling companions and me up in the early morning hours. They were ferrying, in addition to us weary travelers, freshly baked bread, the smell of which still lingers in my memories. On that trip I did not get any of that bread and I did not make it to Krakow, despite the allure of both. All those years ago, I never would have guessed that a conversation about environmental, social, and governance (&ldquo;ESG&rdquo;) issues would allow me to visit Poland again. I certainly never would have imagined that I would be a securities regulator spending much time thinking about these issues.</p>
<p>A hitchhiker, as I was that one time in Poland, is someone who &ldquo;travel[s] by standing on the side of the road and soliciting rides from passing vehicles.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-esg-062924?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;Today, we are seeing a lot of ESG hitchhikers&mdash;people hopping into one of many passing ESG vehicles without much thought for where they are going. As some of these hitchhikers have discovered, however, they are in for a wild, expensive, unpredictable, and unending ride. Asset managers, companies, and governments are embracing ESG without considering the long-term consequences to, respectively, their clients, shareholders, and citizens. So today I step out on the side of the road, not to hitch a ride, but to wave a cautionary flag.</p>
<ol>
<li><span>ESG is a hopeless muddle.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>The divisiveness of the ESG conversation in today&rsquo;s capital markets stems in part from fuzziness around what ESG means. Greater precision might narrow the differences or at least focus discussions on the issues where views really do differ. In the meantime, some bad behavior hides behind that ambiguity.</p>
<p>ESG encompasses everything that sounds good in the moment: climate, biodiversity, clean water, oceans, employee well-being, labor rights, community engagement, the circular economy, the list goes on. No firm could identify&mdash;let alone evaluate&mdash;every issue that might fall under the elastic definition of ESG. The fluctuating views on whether something garners ESG cheers or derision further complicates any analysis. What is ESG-friendly one year may not be the next. After Russia invaded Ukraine, for example, assessments of whether weapons manufacturers were consistent with an ESG investment strategy changed.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-esg-062924?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;Whether natural gas or nuclear ranks well on ESG scales differs over time as well.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-esg-062924?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Some of the issues on today&rsquo;s ESG list historically factored into assessments of the long-term financial value of companies without a special label or a special set of regulatory mandates to spur their inclusion. Companies, striving to be profitable by pleasing customers, employees, and communities, considered a wide range of environmental and social factors. Investors, trying to maximize their returns, looked at how companies in which they were investing approached these issues. Whether and to what degree an issue mattered was company-specific, so government needed only to provide the broad framework within which companies could share the factors they considered material to their long-term financial value.</p>
<p>ESG debates would be fewer if each ESG item once again could rise or fall on individual market participants&rsquo; assessments of its link to long-term financial value at a particular company, not on its prominence in societal debates of the day and its consequent ESG label. ESG becomes most divisive when it mutates into short-hand for forcing companies to ditch long-term value maximization and cater to the current, loud demands of so-called &ldquo;stakeholders&rdquo;&mdash;that amorphous collection of non-investors clamoring for a say in how all public companies operate and how their resources are spent. This version of ESG is political, not financial. Samuel Gregg explains that today&rsquo;s ESG&rsquo;s &ldquo;goals and methods are characterized by an incoherence sufficient to call into question not just specific features of ESG but the conceptual integrity of the entire ESG endeavor.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-esg-062924?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p>Lumping disparate items into a single ESG bucket creates an analytical muddle. Claims about the efficacy of corporate sustainability programs or the success of ESG investment strategies are suspect because something as imprecise as ESG cannot be studied with precision. Running a test to demonstrate a linkage (or sometimes simply identify a correlation) between one or several ESG factors and a company&rsquo;s profitability does not support a conclusion that ESG broadly or other unrelated ESG factors specifically will have the same effect. Nor does the fact that one set of ESG managers performs well mean that we can extrapolate their results to any other manager that claims to use an ESG methodology, which may be entirely different even though it shares the ESG label. The difficulty of determining whether and how ESG links to financial value makes it easier for people to make sweeping claims that it does. Moreover, a convenient invocation of reputational risk sometimes stands in when a linkage proves elusive.</p>
<p>ESG targets are also ambiguous. Obtaining accurate and comparable data to assess whether an ESG objective has been met is difficult. Greenhouse gas emissions are one example, but methodological ambiguity around other more esoteric or newly popular ESG metrics is even more pronounced. Even if the relevant data are available, people may come to different conclusions about whether meeting a particular target is positive. For example, a company&rsquo;s decision to move a factory to a location with abundant hydro-power may lower carbon emissions from production but increase them from transportation.</p>
<p>The ambiguity surrounding ESG serves people trying to use corporate or investor assets for their own ends. Asset managers, companies, and governments, often at the prompting of interest groups with a clear stake in a particular issue, do things in the name of ESG that they otherwise could not get away with doing.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><span>Asset managers sometimes hide behind ESG ambiguity to evade their obligation to investors.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Asset managers sometimes have hidden behind ESG&rsquo;s ambiguity to justify behavior that may not align with their fiduciary duty. Investors care about many things aside from financial returns, but the objective that unites investors is maximizing risk-adjusted financial returns. Absent a directive from or assent by its client to consider other factors, an asset manager should focus on financial returns. ESG commitments can interfere with this singular focus.</p>
<p>In seeking maximum financial returns, asset managers serving investors routinely consider ESG factors that they believe affect financial returns. Asset managers are not serving investors well, however, when they make an unsupported claim of a causal connection to financial returns so they can consider an ESG factor that they want to consider for other reasons. Sometimes an asset manager does so to fulfill a promise to a third party to manage money consistent with ESG objectives.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-esg-062924?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;Or sometimes a large asset manager has multiple clients, some of whom care a lot about non-financial objectives, and these clients end up driving how the asset manager serves all clients. A large asset manager, for example, might centralize voting and engagement decisions rather than entrusting these decisions to its many funds&rsquo; portfolio managers. Such a centralized voting and engagement model may serve some funds well, but run roughshod over other funds&rsquo; objectives. Consider an asset manager that advises both a massive passive index fund and a tiny renewable energy fund. If the asset manager&rsquo;s centralized sustainability team visits a portfolio company that is considering a foray into the oil business, advocating against oil may be consistent with the renewable fund&rsquo;s objectives, but not with the passive fund&rsquo;s simple objective of tracking the index. Ironically, the company is likely to listen to the asset manager precisely because it manages such a large passive fund, not because it manages a small renewable energy fund. The passive index fund, likely unbeknownst to its shareholders, is used to give voice to the renewable energy fund.</p>
<p>Asset managers of course do cater to investors who have objectives other than or in addition to maximizing financial returns. An investor might want, for example, to minimize the carbon footprint of her investment portfolio or invest only in companies with a unionized workforce. She should be able to try to invest in a way that is consistent with those goals and find professional financial advice to facilitate her chosen investment approach. Asset managers should be able to serve this kind of investor as she wishes without dragging other investors unwittingly into supporting her non-financial causes.</p>
<p>Asset managers need to state clearly whether and how they will invest in, vote in, and engage with portfolio companies on behalf of their individual and fund clients. Then investors can select an adviser or fund that accords with their objectives. For example, if an asset manager claims that prioritizing particular ESG factors is consistent with or conducive to long-term value maximization, it should have a basis for that claim. Alternatively, if investors might be sacrificing financial returns to meet an ESG target, the asset manager should make that clear. On voting, a manager of a passive index fund could pledge to vote the fund&rsquo;s shares with management, not to vote, to delegate voting authority to fund shareholders, to follow a third-party&rsquo;s voting directions, or to vote consistent with a set of non-financial ESG objectives.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-esg-062924?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;If an asset manager will use a passive fund&rsquo;s votes to add heft to a sister fund&rsquo;s efforts to change a company&rsquo;s behavior, it must tell the passive fund investors of the fund&rsquo;s activist plans.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-esg-062924?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;Many fund managers are making helpful disclosures already, but ambiguity regarding investment, voting, and engagement processes remains. Having different options available&mdash;some of which focus only on financial returns and others that also or instead concentrate on ESG targets&mdash;is fine, but asset managers should explain their plan clearly and stick to it.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><span>Companies sometimes hide behind ESG ambiguity to evade their obligations to shareholders.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Companies sometimes have hidden behind ESG ambiguity to avoid accountability to shareholders. Shareholders generally want company boards and managers to focus on maximizing the long-term value of the corporation, a focus that may include issues bearing an ESG label in today&rsquo;s parlance. A value-maximizing company is keenly attuned to meeting a societal need for a product or service effectively, and that objective often requires consideration of issues that fall within the ESG label. Companies, for example, might ask: How can we outcompete our rivals by offering better benefits to attract the best employees? If we can clean up our production processes and drill water wells to serve the local population, will more communities welcome our factories? Would putting better windows in our office buildings and instituting a product return program cut costs? Would expanding job fairs beyond universities as prestigious as this one provide access to a richer talent pipeline?</p>
<p>Companies sometimes target ESG goals that are inconsistent with financial returns. They point to the interests of an expansive set of stakeholders to justify doing things, some of which may conflict with shareholder interests. Catering to non-shareholder interests, which at bottom is what stakeholders represent, if not done to maximize long-term value, weakens board and management accountability and enhances management&rsquo;s discretion. A pliable set of ESG metrics gives corporate managers more latitude than an unyieldingly objective profitability metric.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-esg-062924?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;Moving beyond the numbers in favor of malleable ESG metrics dilutes managerial accountability to shareholders. Managers that prioritize ESG metrics garner acclaim from non-shareholder beneficiaries of the ESG priorities, members of the public seduced by high-sounding ESG rhetoric, and a growing sector of ESG specialists who work to elevate the importance of ESG considerations in corporate decision-making. This acclaim can be short-lived, as there is always another ESG target for a company to meet. Companies sometimes acknowledge the ESG objectives to investors, but claim&mdash;sometimes without a sound basis&mdash;that they are linked to financial returns. And sometimes, in a phenomenon called greenhushing, companies spend time and resources on achieving ESG goals without telling investors that is what they are doing.</p>
<p>Even a decision to collect and report on ESG metrics without an attendant commitment to achieving ESG targets can divert substantial resources from uses that would contribute to corporate value maximization. The direct costs of ESG disclosures include tracking, analyzing, and assuring data. Building the requisite data collection, information technology systems, internal controls, and assurance systems around all the new data elements is more challenging than similar efforts in financial reporting, because ESG data are harder to come by, people have not had centuries of experience thinking about these metrics, and ESG data lack the precision and consistency in measurement that characterizes commonly reported financial data. Companies routinely hire ESG specialists, require other employees to devote some of their time to ESG data collection, and assist suppliers with ESG data collection.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-esg-062924?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;Further, emphasizing ESG reporting could harm financial reporting, about which investors care very deeply, by diverting corporate attention or normalizing the weaker standards and looser practices that are accepted by necessity in ESG reporting.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-esg-062924?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p>A company that sets up an elaborate ESG data collection infrastructure, whether for regulatory or other reasons, threatens its own dynamism. Integrating ESG data collection efforts into financial reporting, corporate internal controls, audits, firm structure, performance incentives, employee job descriptions, and supply chains not only changes how companies operate day-to-day, but adds inflexibility to corporate decision-making. The ESG processes that companies are integrating into everything they do today will impede their ability to react to changing market conditions. ESG data management and ESG target-setting bureaucracies within companies become one more obstacle to change, sometimes just slowing it down and other times preventing it altogether. Want to build a new factory? Add the internal ESG team to the list of required sign-offs. Want to sign on a new supplier? You will need to add a whole new set of due diligence questions related to the supplier&rsquo;s ability to provide good ESG data. Want to pivot your product line to meet an emerging consumer demand? Not so fast; the ESG department needs to analyze its effect on the company&rsquo;s greenhouse gas, water, and biodiversity metrics. Green tape within companies will become as paralyzing as red tape.</p>

<li><span>Governments sometimes hide behind ESG ambiguity to evade their obligations to citizens.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Governments too have figured out how to hide behind ESG ambiguity for their own ends. By mandating increasingly granular ESG disclosures, securities regulators draw boards&rsquo; and managers&rsquo; attention away from objectives that would maximize corporate value and toward objectives in line with government objectives. ESG disclosure mandates fill company prospectuses with information regulators want to highlight. Requiring companies to consider ESG factors or even merely to collect and report data on ESG issues encourages boards and managers to devote resources to considering ESG matters and facilitates activist pressure by non-shareholder groups on companies to pursue ESG objectives.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-esg-062924?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;The effect here is to provide the government with indirect control of corporate resource allocation decisions. Prescriptive disclosure requirements for companies are sometimes paired with required or encouraged investor consideration of ESG issues in making their investment decisions. In this way, detailed ESG mandates have become a subtle mechanism for conforming corporate behavior to regulatory objectives and shifting capital flows.</p>
<p>Claims that all manner of socially and politically contentious items are linked to financial returns have provided securities regulators the cover to demand more granular disclosures about a growing list of issues. These disclosure mandates often lack a traditional materiality trigger.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-esg-062924?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;As ESG metrics multiply and become increasingly attenuated from metrics that a company would otherwise use to manage its business, their effect on capital allocation will intensify. For example, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (&ldquo;CSRD&rdquo;) will require almost 50,000 European companies<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-esg-062924?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>&nbsp;to report approximately 1200 ESG-related data points across twelve broad categories.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-esg-062924?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>&nbsp;ESG data challenges with respect to certain mandated elements could cause companies to produce different products and services than they otherwise would, switch to a supplier that can comply with data demands, or slow their product and service innovation. Intense regulatory ESG disclosure demands are altering companies, including by driving decisions and making them more brittle and less able to respond to changing conditions in the marketplace.</p>
<p>Sometimes regulators point to investor demand as a basis for their ESG prescriptions. Yet when I talk to companies, they often cite a decided lack of investor interest in the issues on which regulators seem most focused. Retail investors themselves, as distinct from asset managers, do not seem willing to sacrifice financial returns to achieve non-financial objectives<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-esg-062924?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>&nbsp;and may care about ESG data primarily if it influences a company&rsquo;s financial returns.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-esg-062924?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>&nbsp;In the United States, traditional securities disclosures have focused on supplying investors with financially material information they need to understand companies through the eyes of management. An investor-centric, principles-based disclosure regime rooted in the concept of financial materiality (as opposed to double materiality) provides investors with tailored, relevant information, rather than mechanical responses to a set of items prescribed for all companies. Under a principles-based approach, ESG items that factor meaningfully into value-maximizing decisions are reported in the same way other items are. Public companies, for example, already disclose material risks, which may include rising sea levels, a more fragile supply chain, or shrinking water access, and litigation, which may give investors insight into employee and consumer product safety issues. A principles-based disclosure regime does not need to change with every new issue that captures societal attention and accommodates many types of companies, each facing its own unique set of issues. The goal of principles-based disclosure is to get investors the information they need to make decisions, which can vary by company and over time as a company&rsquo;s circumstances change.</p>
<p>Some ESG advocates argue that externalities&mdash;the costs imposed on society by inadequate corporate and investor attention to issues like climate change&mdash;justify ESG disclosure mandates. If the market will not force internalization of such externalities on its own or solve the underlying problem with technological advances, government intervention to address them should come by way of direct lawmaking through a transparent political process that targets the particular externality of concern, not indirect attempts to use ESG reporting to shift capital flows away from the offending activity. Legislative bodies have ready access to the expertise helpful to identify and weigh difficult trade-offs and to design tools narrowly tailored to address the externality at issue. More importantly, unlike securities regulators, legislative bodies hold the democratic legitimacy and legal authority to enact legislation designed to address the issues. Legislatures also have a broader perspective than specialized regulators, which enables them to consider how a well-functioning, prosperous economy forms the basis for better schools, a cleaner environment, a more effective social safety net, and stronger civil society institutions.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><span>It is time to stop hiding behind the ambiguity and confront the high stakes of the ESG endeavor for global well-being.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>The global embrace of corporate ESG reporting and target-setting comes at a price: reduced economic growth, which in turn makes it harder to improve society. As the world unites in a mandatory ESG regime of unparalleled intricacy, global economic prosperity will suffer.</p>
<p>Driving my concern is the role that even a mere reporting framework, divorced from what matters to a company&rsquo;s long-term economic value, can have in changing the responsiveness of the economy to real people&rsquo;s needs. Mandated ESG metrics reflect the regulator&rsquo;s view of what should be important to decision-making. But the regulator sees only a small sliver of what markets observe. Markets composed of countless people making independent decisions based on their daily experiences are better than regulators at identifying important information and, thus, directing money toward its best use. They also adapt more quickly to changing market conditions. People, whether acting individually or jointly through companies, respond to what they and others value.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-esg-062924?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a>&nbsp;For example, I love honey, but, having recently donned a beekeeping suit for the first time, I realize that I have to rely on others to satisfy my sweet tooth. If, however, someone discovers a new use for honey that drives its price up, I might cut my consumption and intensify my effort to join the ranks of producers to help meet the increased demand. That sweet example is but one of the countless decisions that undergird our economy. The beauty is that nobody needs to plan anything other than her own activities for this free economy to work. An economy that draws on everyone&rsquo;s knowledge and experience can do much more important things than supply me with honey; it can solve hard technological problems and generate the prosperity that improves people&rsquo;s everyday lives and then creates the demand for an even better world for everyone.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-esg-062924?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a>&nbsp;When regulatory codes, instead of popular demand, drive corporate behavior, we lose the dynamism of the unplanned economy.</p>
<p>Because of the direct and indirect costs, jurisdictions that have adopted stringent ESG mandates will find themselves competitively disadvantaged. To blunt these adverse competitive effects, an effort is underway to standardize ESG reporting and ESG practices so that companies everywhere bear the same reporting burden. We see that in the United States where California has adopted stringent ESG reporting rules, which it plans to impose on companies outside California too. Most notably, Europe is trying to impose the costs of its particularly draconian regime on foreign companies so that European companies do not suffer alone. I care about these developments because they affect many American companies, but I also care because increasing the rules&rsquo; reach will make it easier to fool people about the costs of an intense ESG regime on economic growth. Consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>The previously mentioned CSRD will require companies to report across their value chain&mdash;which includes suppliers and buyers&mdash;on ESG issues ranging from climate-related disclosures, like Scope 3 emissions levels and recycling practices, to workforce disclosures such as those relating to demographics, collective bargaining, and &ldquo;adequate wages.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-esg-062924?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a>&nbsp;Companies must report on a double-materiality basis, meaning in assessing materiality they must think about how their activities influence the community and environment around them.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-esg-062924?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a>&nbsp;Approximately 3,000 American companies must eventually comply.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-esg-062924?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a></li>

</ul>
<p>Similarly, the International Sustainability Standards Board (&ldquo;ISSB&rdquo;) was formed in 2021, among other things, &ldquo;to develop standards for a global baseline of sustainability disclosures.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-esg-062924?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33">[33]</a>&nbsp;The ISSB issued its first two sustainability standards last summer and then embarked on a global public marketing tour to encourage global adoption of the new standards.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-esg-062924?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34">[34]</a>&nbsp;The International Organization of Securities Commissions (&ldquo;IOSCO&rdquo;), in an unusual move to push global convergence, issued a swift directive to member jurisdictions to embrace the ISSB standards.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-esg-062924?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35">[35]</a></p>
<p>A single global disclosure framework would ease compliance costs for companies that otherwise would be subject to multiple regimes, but it also would aggravate the problems created by such a mandatory ESG framework. If common a global framework guides companies world-over to prioritize things other than corporate value maximization, creates a convergence in global decisions about capital flows, and imposes a universal layer of rigidity on corporate and investor decision-making, markets will lose the heterogeneity and adaptability that they need to fund innovative solutions to new and intractable problems. If every hitchhiker gets in the same jeep, we might all drive off the cliff together.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><span>Conclusion</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Asset managers, companies, and governments too often use the ambiguity swirling about ESG to their advantage and to the disadvantage of the constituencies&mdash;investors, shareholders, and citizens, respectively&mdash;they serve. What can we do to free ourselves of the ESG constraint on economic growth? First, we can reject the highly prescriptive ESG frameworks that so many jurisdictions are imposing on companies today in favor of a return to a principles-based disclosure regime that does not isolate and elevate an issue simply because it bears the ESG label. Second, we can insist that asset managers, corporations, and governments using other people&rsquo;s assets to further an ESG objective show the link to financial value of that particular ESG objective or explain clearly that obtaining the ESG objective comes at a financial cost. Third, let us heed another hitchhiker&rsquo;s guide, this one to the galaxy: Don&rsquo;t Panic!<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-esg-062924?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36">[36]</a>&nbsp;We can solve the panoply of very serious problems we face. The best way to do so is to allow capital to flow in response to all of humanity&rsquo;s input, rather than in response to regulatory directives, even ones calling themselves ESG. A free economy encourages people to think carefully about what is important to them and to care deeply about what other people need and want.</p>
<p>Corporations will survive or fail depending on whether they serve others well. A sprawling maze of standardized and inflexible ESG mandates is likely to undermine, not add to, companies&rsquo; natural inclination to meet the needs of others quickly and effectively. These ESG metrics only divert their attention to issues that&nbsp;<i>regulators</i>&nbsp;care about.</p>
<p>Let me close with another hitchhiking story, this one not about me, but about a family I know. On vacation, the family had hiked seven miles out of town. While the parents were investigating non-walking options for getting the exhausted family back to town, their two pre-teen daughters took matters into their own hands. The older one, without explaining why, urged her little sister to stick her thumb out. A car stopped, and the driver offered the family a ride. The girls&rsquo; parents, not aware that their daughters had hitched the ride, after an assessment of the situation, gratefully accepted the seemingly unsolicited kindness of a stranger. My friends are savvy travelers, and I am happy to report that their inadvertent hitchhiking adventure worked out well, but inadvertent ESG hitchhiking, where people have hopped into the ESG-mobile without much thought, has led us to a bad place. Conferences like this one are an opportunity to stop and think about whether there is a better way of getting to our goal of a safer, cleaner, healthier, more prosperous world.</p>

(&ldquo;One of ESG&rsquo;s many difficulties, however, is that its goals and methods are characterized by an incoherence sufficient to call into question not just specific features of ESG but the conceptual integrity of the entire ESG endeavor. Another ESG problem is its tendency to blur ethics and sound business practices with the promotion of particular political causes. This mindset has spilled over into the outlook of financial regulators, and consequently threatens to facilitate widespread dysfunctionality in these agencies&rsquo; operations.

<title>Statement On The Registration For Index-Linked Annuities And Registered Market-Value Adjustment Annuities, SEC Commissioner Mark T. Uyeda</title>

<div> Securities Act, registration, Form N-4, RILA Act, amendments <br />
Summary:<br />
Securities Act requires securities registration. Specific forms for fund and insurance products adopted. Amendments to Form N-4 accommodate RILA and MVA offerings. Commission updates regulatory infrastructure. <div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>While the universe of securities is broad, the Securities Act of 1933 (&ldquo;Securities Act&rdquo;) generally requires that any offer or sale of a security to the public be registered with the Commission. For that reason, the Commission should take steps to ensure that registration statement disclosure is material and informative to prospective purchasers. By the same token, the Commission should avoid requiring disclosures that are irrelevant and distract readers from the important information.</p>
<p>Purchasers of fund and insurance products have different disclosure needs than investors in operating companies. Previously, the Commission has adopted specific registration statement forms for these products. For example, open-end mutual funds, including exchange-traded funds, register on Form N-1A, closed-end funds register on Form N-2, separate accounts organized as unit investment trusts (&ldquo;UITs&rdquo;) that offer variable annuity contracts register on Form N-4, and separate accounts organized as UITs that offer variable life insurance policies register on Form N-6.</p>
<p>When there is not a specific form, the default form for general registration is Form S‑1, which has been used by registered index-linked annuities (&ldquo;RILAs&rdquo;) to date.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-registration-index-linked-annuities-070124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;While Form S-1 has specific disclosure requirements for securities such as capital stock and debt, it is not specifically tailored for products like RILAs. Thus, Form S-1 does not have specific disclosure requirements for RILAs and their complex features.</p>
<p>However, Form S-1 requires the disclosure of extensive information about the registrant issuing the securities that may be less material to a RILA purchaser than information about the annuity contract&rsquo;s features, risks, and expenses. Required information about the registrant includes management&rsquo;s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, disclosure about executive compensation, and financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which may be less important to RILA purchasers relative to disclosures about the product itself.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-registration-index-linked-annuities-070124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;To date, RILA sponsors have been allowed variances from the express requirements of Form S-1 in order for the prospectuses to focus on disclosures most relevant to RILA purchasers.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-registration-index-linked-annuities-070124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Today, the Commission is adopting rule and form amendments to implement the bipartisan Registered Index-Linked Annuities Act of 2022 (&ldquo;RILA Act&rdquo;).<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-registration-index-linked-annuities-070124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;Accordingly, the Commission is amending Form N-4 and modifying that form to accommodate RILA offerings.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-registration-index-linked-annuities-070124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;In response to comments received on the proposal,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-registration-index-linked-annuities-070124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;the Commission also will require offerings of registered market-value adjustment annuities (&ldquo;MVAs&rdquo;) to register on Form N-4. RILAs and registered MVAs share similar features, and thus the amendments to Form N-4 will provide registered MVAs with a more tailored form to register these offerings. The Commission is also adopting other amendments to facilitate the registration of RILA and MVA offerings, including the use of optional summary prospectuses and calculation of filing fees.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-registration-index-linked-annuities-070124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p>As a member of the Senate Banking Committee staff during the 117<span>th</span>&nbsp;Congress, I was pleased to work with the offices of Senators Tina Smith and Thom Tillis when they introduced the RILA Act. While I am disappointed that the Commission did not meet the 18-month statutory deadline, I am pleased to support this rulemaking.</p>
<p>The amendments to Form N-4 being adopted today provide RILA issuers &ndash; and more importantly, investors - with a form that elicits specific disclosure about these products. In addition, the package of amendments, including the ability to file post-effective amendments<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-statement-registration-index-linked-annuities-070124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;and permitting RILA issuers to use a &ldquo;free writing&rdquo; prospectus under the conditions of rule 433 under the Securities Act, will help smooth the transition for RILA and MVA offerings.</p>
<p>I recognize the staff&rsquo;s efforts to identify and recommend &ldquo;good government&rdquo; technical amendments to update the rules and Forms as part of the rulemaking. These amendments may not generate headlines, but they are necessary improvements to keep the Commission&rsquo;s regulatory infrastructure up to date. For example, the Commission is amending Form 24F-2, the form that permits investment companies &ndash; and now non-variable annuities &ndash; to pay the registration fees for an indeterminate number of securities. One of the Form&rsquo;s legacy instructions dates back to when open-end funds and unit investment trusts transitioned to the Form. As such, this legacy instruction permits a credit for any non-claimed redemptions in a prior fiscal year that ends no earlier than October 11, 1995. It is long past time to remove that outdated instruction, and I laud the staff for their attention to these details.</p>
<p>My thanks to the staff of the Division of Investment Management, the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, and the Office of the General Counsel for their efforts. I also thank the Office of the Investor Advocate for their diligent work on investor testing which helped to inform this rulemaking.</p>

Many of these issuers and crypto digital assets have characteristics for which Form S-1 may technically require information that is not relevant or applicable, but does not require certain information that may be material. This approach for crypto digital assets is problematic because it neither facilitates capital formation nor protects investors. Consideration should be given to allowing variances from Form S-1 for crypto digital assets, similar to that given for fund and insurance products and other securities products. Such an approach may ultimately result registered offerings containing more tailored information that is relevant and material for crypto digital assets and their issuers and has the accompanying investor protection and remedies under the Securities Act.</p>

<p><span><span>The&nbsp;<span><span>Commodity Futures Trading Commission today issued&nbsp;</span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/10801/cftcstresstest061724/download"><i>Supervisory Stress Test of Derivatives Clearing Organizations: Reverse Stress Test Analysis and Results</i></a><span><span>, a report detailing the results of its fourth Supervisory Stress Test (SST) of derivatives clearing organization (DCO) resources. Among other findings, the 2024 report concluded the DCOs studied&nbsp;</span></span>hold sufficient financial resources to withstand many extreme and often implausible price shocks<span><span>.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The Risk Surveillance Branch of the Division of Clearing and Risk conducts periodic SSTs to assess how DCOs might fare under extreme stress. Staff previously conducted SSTs in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/7483-16">2016</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/7630-17">2017</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/7921-19">2019</a>. The 2019 SST included a reverse stress test component, and this 2024 SST is a major expansion of that, which includes nine DCOs, representing 11 clearing services across four asset classes (futures and options on futures, cleared interest rate swaps, credit default swaps, and foreign exchange products).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The purpose of the analysis was twofold: (1) to identify hypothetical combinations of extreme market shocks, concurrent with varying numbers of clearing member (CM) defaults, that would exhaust prefunded resources (DCO committed capital, and default fund), and unfunded resources available to the DCOs (this represents the reverse stress test component), and (2) to analyze the impacts of DCO use of mutualized resources on non-defaulted CMs.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Staff analyzed both house and customer accounts of all CMs using actual positions as of September 1, 2023. Eleven volatile dates since 2020 were selected as base market stress scenarios. These dates captured a diversity of extraordinary market stresses associated with: the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and the period of elevated inflation and related interest rate/banking impacts. These one-day market shocks were then expanded incrementally by multiples to well past plausible levels.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In the process of conducting this reverse stress test, the interconnectedness of DCOs through clearing members was explored.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The results of this 2024 stress test analysis show:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span>All individual DCOs hold sufficient financial resources to withstand many extreme and often implausible price shocks, along with multiple defaults of their CMs. In some cases, DCOs can withstand the default of all CMs that have losses resulting from highly implausible price shocks.</span></span></li>
<li><span><span>Potential costs to non-defaulting members do not appear to be problematic. Under a very extreme and likely implausible scenario, with shocks three times one of the most volatile days in recent years, concurrent with three synchronized defaults, costs at the clearing members paying the vast majority of default funds and assessments represented only 0.07% of the Tier 1 capital of their parent entities, on average.</span></span></li>
<li><span><span>The effects of interconnectedness were muted across DCOs, except for extremely implausible scenarios. Extreme events for one DCO are not commonly extreme events at the other DCOs, nor are the extreme losses for clearing members at one DCO experienced to the same extent at other DCOs at which they are a member.</span></span></li>

<title>Statement On RILAs And Registered MVA Annuities, SEC Chair Gary Gensler</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/statement-on-rilas-and-registered-mva-annuities-sec-chair-gary-gensler/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/statement-on-rilas-and-registered-mva-annuities-sec-chair-gary-gensler/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> RILAs, registered MVA annuities, SEC, amendments, disclosure <br />
Summary:<br />
SEC amended registration form for RILAs and registered MVA annuities. Provides tailored disclosure for complex products and ensures consistency in disclosures. <div>
<p>Today, the Commission adopted amendments to provide a tailored form to register the offerings of registered index-linked annuities (&ldquo;RILAs&rdquo;) and registered market value adjustment annuities (&ldquo;registered MVA annuities&rdquo;). I am pleased to support this adoption because it fulfills the congressional mandate to adopt a registration form specific to RILAs.</p>
<p>RILAs are a complex product sold primarily to retail investors. While they&rsquo;re generally linked to the performance of a market index, such as the S&amp;P 500, their performance is not the same as the underlying index. Rather, investor returns often are subject to caps and floors set by the insurance company. Further, features such as these caps and floors may change over time, and investors can experience losses if they withdraw money early.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The market for these complex products has grown significantly in recent years. Sales of RILAs reached approximately $47.4 billion in 2023 alone, more than quintupling since 2017<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-rila-070124#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>￼ It is important that investors receive the information they need&mdash;in plain English&mdash;to make informed investment decisions.</p>
<p>Implementing Congress&rsquo;s mandate, today&rsquo;s rule will require RILAs to use Form N-4, the same registration form currently used for variable annuities. Thus, today&rsquo;s final rule also amends Form N-4 to address the features and risks of RILAs.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s rule also will apply to registered MVA annuities. Similar to the amendments we are adopting for RILAs, these amendments will benefit investors by providing a tailored disclosure regime and permitting investors to compare and contrast different types of annuity contracts.</p>
<p>These changes will streamline the registration process for issuers already using Form N-4 for other investment products. Further, this would make disclosures among similar investment products more consistent.&nbsp;This adopted disclosure regime is informed by investor testing conducted by the SEC&rsquo;s Office of the Investor Advocate (OIAD).</p>
<p>Finally, today&rsquo;s rule will provide both RILA and MVA issuers guidance on when sales literature related to their offerings might be materially misleading under the Federal securities laws. In particular, today&rsquo;s rule will require RILA issuers to comply with Rule 156, which addresses truth in advertising in sales literature.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Taken together, these amendments will improve the disclosure process for these complex products to benefit investors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank members of the SEC staff for their work on this proposal, including:</p>

<li>Natasha Greiner, Sarah ten Siethoff, Brian Johnson, Amanda Hollander Wagner, Brad Gude, Christian Corkery, Pamela Ellis, Rachael Hoffman, Michael Khalil, James Maclean, Amy Miller, Laura Harper Powell, Andrea Ottomanelli Magovern, Michael Kosoff, Elisabeth Bentzinger, Sonny Oh, Jenson Wayne, and Nicolina McCarthy in the Division of Investment Management;</li>

<title>ISDA Proceeds With Development Of An Industry Notices Hub</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-proceeds-with-development-of-an-industry-notices-hub/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-proceeds-with-development-of-an-industry-notices-hub/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> support, ISDA Notices Hub, termination notices, S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, buy-side institutions <br />
<br />Summary: ISDA will develop an industry-wide notices hub for instantaneous delivery and receipt of termination notices, reducing risk and potential losses. <div>
<p>ISDA will proceed with the development of an industry-wide notices hub, following strong support from buy- and sell-side institutions globally. The new online platform will allow instantaneous delivery and receipt of critical termination-related notices and help to ensure address details for physical delivery are up to date, reducing the risk of uncertainty and potential losses for senders and recipients of these notices.</p>
<p>The decision to move ahead with the ISDA Notices Hub follows an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/04/25/isda-launches-outreach-initiative-on-proposed-notices-hub/">industry outreach initiative</a>&nbsp;that began in April 2024, in which ISDA sought indications of support for the proposed platform from dealers and buy-side institutions. Of those firms that indicated they would use the ISDA Notices Hub in principle, 57% were from the buy side, including asset managers, insurance companies and hedge funds. In addition, two thirds of ISDA&rsquo;s global primary dealer membership category stated their intent to adopt the platform in principle. Support was received from across the globe, with 39% of positive responses from the US, 47% from Europe and 14% from Asia Pacific.</p>
<p>ISDA will now work with S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence and Linklaters to build the platform, draft the necessary documentation and commission legal opinions in priority jurisdictions to confirm the validity of delivering notices via a central hub. The ISDA Notices Hub will be free for buy-side users and available via S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence&rsquo;s Counterparty Manager platform, with implementation targeted for 2025.</p>
<p>Under the ISDA Master Agreement, termination-related notices must be delivered by certain prescribed methods including physical delivery, using company address details listed in the agreement. However, delays can occur if a company has moved and the documentation hasn&rsquo;t been updated with the new details or if delivery to a physical location is not possible due to geopolitical shocks.</p>
<p>Just a small holdup in the delivery of a termination notice &ndash; for example, from Friday afternoon to Monday morning &ndash; could result in an uncollateralized loss of $1 million[1]. Bigger portfolios and more volatile conditions could increase the risk significantly.</p>
<p>The ISDA Notices Hub would act as a secure central platform for firms to deliver notices, with automatic alerts sent to the receiving entity.</p>
<p>Multiple designated people at each firm would be able to access the hub from anywhere in the world, regardless of the situation at its physical location. The platform would also allow market participants to update their physical address details via a single entry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re delighted that so many financial institutions recognize the benefit of having a secure digital platform that allows termination notices to be delivered and received in the blink of an eye. As well as increasing certainty for users, the ISDA Notices Hub will eliminate risk exposures and potential losses that can result from delays in terminating derivatives contracts,&rdquo; said Scott O&rsquo;Malia, ISDA&rsquo;s Chief Executive.</p>

<title>SEC Adopts Tailored Registration Form For Offerings Of Registered Index-Linked And Registered Market-Value Adjustment Annuities</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-adopts-tailored-registration-form-for-offerings-of-registered-index-linked-a/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-adopts-tailored-registration-form-for-offerings-of-registered-index-linked-a/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today adopted tailored disclosure requirements and offering processes for offerings of registered index-linked annuities (RILAs) and registered market value adjustment annuities (registered MVA annuities, and collectively with RILAs, non-variable annuities). The final rule will require issuers of non-variable annuities to register offerings on Form N-4, the form currently used to register offerings of most variable annuities. This change will provide investors with tailored disclosures and key information about these complex products and modernize and enhance the<span color="#005ea2" style="color: #005ea2;">&nbsp;</span>registration, filing, and disclosure framework for non-variable annuities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The market for these complex products has grown significantly in recent years. Sales of RILAs reached approximately $47.4 billion in 2023 alone, more than quintupling since 2017,&rdquo; said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. &ldquo;It is important that investors receive the information they need &ndash; in plain English &ndash; to make informed investment decisions. These amendments will improve the disclosure process for these complex products to benefit investors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Non-variable annuities are annuity contracts offered by insurance companies and sold to retail investors. With RILAs, investor returns are based in part on the performance of an index or other benchmark over a set timeframe, subject to limits on potential losses and gains. Registered MVA annuity returns are based on a fixed and stated minimum rate of interest over a set timeframe. Both products typically impose certain charges and penalties for early withdrawals.</p>
<p>The final amendments build on the Commission&rsquo;s existing registration, filing, and disclosure framework for variable annuities to provide a tailored approach for non-variable annuities. These amendments are designed to provide investors with a better understanding of these products. They also will provide efficiencies for insurance company issuers that offer both variable and non-variable annuities as well as for the Commission in reviewing those filings.</p>
<p>The approach to disclosure is informed by investor testing conducted in connection with the proposal. Under the amendments, non-variable annuities will be permitted to use a summary prospectus framework that highlights key information for investors while making additional information available for investors who want it. The Commission also is extending to non-variable annuity advertisements and sales literature a current Commission rule (Rule 156) that provides guidance as to when sales literature is materially misleading under the federal securities laws.</p>
<p>In addition, the Commission is adopting amendments to Form N-4 that apply to offerings of variable annuities that are informed by the Commission staff&rsquo;s historical experience in administering these forms as well as relevant investor testing. The Commission also is adopting technical amendments to other insurance product registration forms.</p>
<p>The amendments will become effective 60 days after publication in the Federal Register. Filers will have until May 1, 2026, to comply with most of the final amendments to Form N-4 and the related rule and form amendments. For the amendments to Rule 156, insurance companies will be required to comply on the effective date.</p>

<title>Project Nexus Completes Comprehensive Blueprint For Connecting Domestic Instant Payment Systems Globally And Prepares For Work Towards Live Implementation</title>

<div> Blueprint, Phase three, Central banks, IPS operators, Cross-border payments<br />
Summary:<br />
BIS and partners complete Nexus blueprint. Phase three concluded, allowing central banks and IPS operators to work towards seamless cross-border payments. <div>
<ul>
<li>Nexus is a BIS Innovation Hub project that seeks to enhance cross-border payments by connecting multiple domestic instant payment systems (IPS) globally.</li>
<li>It is the first BIS Innovation Hub project in the payments area to move towards live implementation. BIS to play advisory role as Project Nexus sets up operational scheme and opens to potential new participants across the globe.</li>
<li>BIS will facilitate central banks and IPS operators of India, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand as they work towards live implementation in the next phase, with Bank of Indonesia as special observer.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and partners today announced that they have completed the comprehensive blueprint for phase three of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/about/bisih/topics/fmis/nexus.htm"><span class="firstword">Project</span>&nbsp;Nexus</a>, which will allow ready participants to work towards the next stage of seamlessly connecting their instant payment systems.</p>
<p>Phase four will see Bank Negara Malaysia, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Bank of Thailand and domestic IPS operators &ndash; who worked together in phase three &ndash; joined by the Reserve Bank of India, expanding the potential user base to India's Unified Payments Interface (UPI), the world's largest IPS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bank Indonesia (BI) will continue its association with the project with special observer status. BI took part in phase three and will continue in this capacity to follow the project in the next stage of its development.</p>
<p>Nexus is designed to standardise the way domestic IPS connect to one another. Rather than an IPS operator building custom connections for every new country to which it connects, the operator only needs to make one connection to Nexus. This single connection would allow the IPS to reach all other countries in the network.</p>

<div class="pbtxtcontent">I wish our partners in Nexus every success as they advance the project from concept to reality. This is the first BIS Innovation Hub project that central banks are moving towards a live phase together with instant payment providers. When implemented, it will greatly enhance cross-border payments in line with both the G20 cross-border payments programme and our mission to develop public goods in the technology space to support central banks and improve the functioning of the financial system.<br /><br />Even with just the first wave of connected countries, Nexus has the potential to connect a market of 1.7 billion people globally, allowing them to make instant payments to each other easily and cheaply.</div>

</div>
<p>The conclusions and lessons of phase three of Nexus are described in a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/othp86.htm"><span class="firstword">report</span></a>&nbsp;published today. This is complemented by a detailed scheme rulebook and technical implementation guides, as well as ISO 20022 message specifications, which are available to central banks on request.</p>
<p>To facilitate live implementation, the partner central banks and IPS operators have agreed to work towards establishing a new entity, the Nexus Scheme Organisation (NSO), which will be responsible for managing the Nexus scheme, and continuing the mission to achieve instant cross-border payments at scale.</p>
<p>The NSO will be wholly owned by the central banks and/or IPS in participating countries, depending on the specific domestic structures. In developing the blueprint in phase three of Nexus, the BIS has fulfilled its role of supporting central banks in finding innovative solutions to deliver public goods and one of its key commitments as part of the G20 Roadmap for Enhancing Cross-border Payments.</p>
<p><span>While the BIS will not own or operate the NSO, it will continue its support by playing&nbsp;</span>a technical advisory role as participating countries work towards taking Nexus live. It will also facilitate cooperation among members and the entry of new participants, helping to realise Nexus's global ambition.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>Background</em></p>
<p><em>This work follows an earlier phase of development in which a prototype of Nexus was used to successfully connect the test versions of three established IPS: the Eurosystem's TARGET Instant Payment Settlement (TIPS), Malaysia's Real-time Retail Payments Platform (RPP) and Singapore's Fast and Secure Transfers (FAST) payment system. (This work is described in Annex&nbsp;1 of the new report.)</em></p>
<p><em>In November 2022, Bank Indonesia, Bank Negara Malaysia, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, the MAS and the Bank of Thailand signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on Cooperation in Regional Payment Connectivity, which highlights the collaborative effort within the region towards establishing cross-border payment connectivity, including via fast payment linkages. Since the signing of the MoU, Brunei Darussalam Central Bank, Bank of the Lao People's Democratic Republic and the State Bank of Vietnam have joined the initiative.</em></p>
<p><em>The BIS Innovation Hub commenced the project in 2022, and its Singapore Centre has worked with the current partners over the past year to develop a comprehensive scheme and governance framework, commercial model and technology blueprint.</em></p>
<p><em>Central banks, standard-setting bodies, IPS operators and commercial entities around the world were also consulted to validate that Nexus is scalable and interoperable beyond the current participants. Nexus is one of many exploratory projects embarked upon by the BIS Innovation Hub. It is also contributing with the BIS Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures to the G20 Roadmap for Enhancing Cross-border Payments. The Roadmap highlights&nbsp;</em><em>interlinking of IPS as a key aim, and Nexus as a priority action that could have a significant impact on the speed, cost, transparency of, and access to cross-border payments.</em></p>

<p>In recognition of the 80th anniversary of the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference (the &ldquo;Bretton Woods Conference&rdquo;), the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group today announced the launch of a consultation tasked with developing a long-term view on the future of the world economy, international cooperation, and the roles of the Bank and the Fund.</p>
<p>The Bank and the Fund are pleased to announce the formation of a group of external advisors to help guide the exercise, comprising Sri Mulyani Indrawati, Minister of Finance of Indonesia; Patrick Achi, former Prime Minister of C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire; and Mark Malloch Brown, former Deputy Secretary-General of the UN. Working closely with Ajay&nbsp;Banga, President of the World&nbsp;Bank Group, and Kristalina&nbsp;Georgieva, Managing Director of the IMF, the advisors will lead a discussion with global stakeholders on the shape of the world economy 20‒30&nbsp;years from now, on how multilateralism may evolve, and, crucially, on how the Bank and the Fund can best support stability and progress on a livable planet.</p>
<p><span>IMF Managing Director Kristalina&nbsp;Georgieva</span>&nbsp;said:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;As the IMF seeks to serve the evolving needs of our global membership and to deliver, efficiently and effectively, on our three principal tasks&mdash;economic policy advice, lending, and capacity development&mdash;we recognize the importance of a longer-term perspective. This process will help us better understand possible futures and plan for them.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><span>World&nbsp;Bank Group President Ajay&nbsp;Banga</span>&nbsp;noted:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;</em><em>For 80 years, the World Bank has worked to improve lives and make the world a better place. This anniversary is an opportunity not only to reflect, but more importantly to look to the future and make ourselves ready for the challenges beyond the horizon. The world needs the Bank, and the next 50 years will demand even more from this institution than were required during the preceding 80 years to realize a world free of poverty on a livable planet.&rdquo;</em></p>

Mark Rogerson, Head of Interest Rate Products, EMEA,&nbsp;CME Group. "As our &euro;STR futures marketplace continues to build liquidity and participation, we have launched this new tool to help clients navigate this period of monetary policy change."</p>

<div> NYSE, IPO, proceeds, listing, technology<br />
<br />
Summary: NYSE reported $12 billion in IPO proceeds, led 7 of the 10 largest US transactions, welcomed international companies, and focused on thought leadership and innovation.<br /> <div>
<div class="bw-subheadline-wrapper">
<ul>
<li><i>NYSE issuers raise $12 billion as IPO activity builds momentum</i></li>
<li><i style="font-family: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">Welcomes 7 of the 10 largest U.S. transactions</i></li>
<li><i style="font-family: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">The Big Board continues to drive exchange transfers</i></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The New York Stock Exchange, part of Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE: ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today reported an industry-leading $12 billion in IPO proceeds for the first half of 2024, setting the pace globally as IPO activity regained momentum compared to the prior two years.</p>
<p>The NYSE listed 7 of the 10 largest U.S. transactions so far this year, including the two largest IPOs: Viking Holdings (NYSE: VIK) and Amer Sports (NYSE: AS). The exchange also led the re-emergence of technology IPOs in 2024, with transactions including Rubrik (NYSE: RBRK), Reddit (NYSE: RDDT) and Ibotta (NYSE: IBTA). Altogether, the NYSE&rsquo;s 2024 IPO proceeds in the first half exceeded total proceeds raised on the exchange in each of the past two years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We welcomed a reopening of the IPO window in the first six months of 2024, allowing companies from around the globe and across the economy to tap the public markets following two somewhat subdued years for new issuance,&rdquo; said Michael Harris, Global Head of Capital Markets at the New York Stock Exchange. &ldquo;In this environment, companies overwhelmingly chose the NYSE to list their shares, and the proceeds raised from their IPOs far outpaced the rest of the industry. As we move into the second half of the year, we look forward to welcoming many more leading companies to our unparalleled NYSE community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 2024, internationally headquartered companies continued to choose the NYSE as their listing home. Notably, Dublin-based Flutter Entertainment (NYSE: FLUT), the operator of FanDuel and other brands, moved its primary listing to the NYSE. In addition, five companies transferred listings to the NYSE from other exchanges, including Virtus Investment Partners (NYSE: VRTS) and Kforce (NYSE: KFRC). The NYSE has led the industry in transfers for the past two years and since the beginning of 2021, 60 operating companies have transferred to the NYSE.</p>
<p>The NYSE community also expanded through spinoffs from established listed companies, with GE (NYSE: GE) launching as GE Aerospace and spinning off its renewable energy, power and digital businesses as GE Vernova (NYSE: GEV). Additionally, 3M (NYSE: MMM) created a new entity from its healthcare business, Solventum (NYSE: SOLV). Together, these new companies represent a combined market value of $140 billion.</p>
<p>The NYSE&rsquo;s home at 11 Wall Street was once again a hub of thought-leadership activity during the year&rsquo;s first half. First Lady of the United States Dr. Jill Biden delivered a keynote address at the second annual NYSE Women&rsquo;s Health Summit, and the exchange welcomed leading officials from both parties including Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, Sen. John Thune and Gov. Brian Kemp.</p>
<p>Innovation played a central role in the exchange&rsquo;s first-half 2024 initiatives. The exchange held its first NYSE Tech Summit at its office in San Francisco, convening CIOs and CTOs from NYSE-listed companies alongside start-up leaders and prominent tech investors. It also launched the NYSE Tech Council, bringing together senior technology leaders from the NYSE community to focus on thought leadership and best practices.</p>

<div> partnership, collaboration, educational tools, ethical artificial intelligence, membership offerings
Summary:<br />Partnership between CISI and ACI FMA to deliver ethical AI education, mutual recognition of qualifications, and membership benefits. <div>
<p>The Chartered Institute for Securities &amp; Investment (CISI), with over 50,000 global members in 100 countries, is delighted to continue collaborating with the ACI Financial Markets Association (ACI FMA) &ndash; a non-profit global trade association that represents the interests of the professional financial markets community with over 7,000 members in 60 countries.</p>
<p>As of May 2024, both organisations will continue delivering educational tools to global financial markets and will now foster learning in ethical artificial intelligence through the distribution of the CISI Certificate in Ethical Artificial Intelligence (AI).</p>
<p>The partnership, initially agreed upon in 2019, means the CISI and ACI FMA will collaborate using mutual networks, particularly relating to the recognition and promotion of the respective qualifications, membership offerings, promotion of integrity and ethics, and distribution of stand-alone products to both membership bases.</p>
<p>The agreement also includes mutual recognition of some ACI FMA programmes as equivalent to one CISI examination unit in the CISI Investment Operations Certificate (IOC). This short course is important for anyone wanting to understand the fundamental ethical and management issues in the deployment of AI in financial and professional services.</p>
<p>ACI FMA Diploma holders with three years of experience can become associate members of the Institute, and ACI FMA will offer a reduced fee for CISI members who wish to apply and are successfully granted ACI FMA Individual Membership.</p>
<p>CISI CEO Tracy Vegro OBE said: &ldquo;We value our partnership with the ACI FMA and are looking forward to strengthening our relationship with our renewed agreement, particularly through sharing the CISI Certificate in Ethical Artificial Intelligence (AI) &ndash; a valuable necessity for understanding ethical guidelines and regulations and the future of financial services.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img alt="Kim Winding Larsen " src="https://mondovisione.com/_assets/images/Kim-Winding-Larsen.jpg" title="Kim Winding Larsen " /></p>
<p>ACI FMA president Kim Winding Larsen (above) said: &ldquo;ACI FMA truly appreciates this partnership. As valuable partners, the CISI and ACI FMA will continue to look for other initiatives that benefit the membership of both organisations.&rdquo;</p>

<title>PNGX Provides Guidance On Disclosure Obligations Of Listed Companies</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/pngx-provides-guidance-on-disclosure-obligations-of-listed-companies/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/pngx-provides-guidance-on-disclosure-obligations-of-listed-companies/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> issuer, continuous disclosure, material information, market integrity, timely disclosure<br />
<br />Summary:<br />PNGX Group issues guidance on continuous disclosure obligations for listed companies, emphasizing timely material information disclosure for market integrity and investor access. <div>
<p><i>PNGX Group, operator of Papua New Guinea&rsquo;s national stock exchange, has issued guidance to the market on the continuous disclosure obligations of listed companies.</i></p>
<p>Continuous disclosure is a disclosure framework which seeks to ensure the timely release of material information by issuers.</p>
<p>Timely disclosure of material information is essential to maintaining the integrity of the market and offers several key benefits including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>ensures that the market is informed of relevant information in a timely manner; </li>
<li>promotes a continuous flow of information which promotes liquidity; </li>
<li>promotes equality of access to information so that investors can make informed investment decisions; and </li>
<li>plays a critical role in promoting fair, orderly and transparent markets. </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PNGX&rsquo;s market operates within a continuous disclosure framework and the listing rules impose continuous disclosure obligations on the issuers listed on these markets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The obligation to disclose material information promptly and without delay is a fundamental obligation placed on issuers under the listing rules&rdquo; said PNGX General Manager, Ms Elizabeth Wamsa. &ldquo;The most important consideration in relation to continuous disclosure compliance is whether information could have a &ldquo;material effect on the price or value&rdquo; of a company&rsquo;s shares and is therefore required to be disclosed promptly and without delay&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>The guidance coincides with some minor amendments to the Listing Rules to clarify these obligations which will take effect from 1 August 2024.</p>
<p>PNGX may refer breaches of the continuous disclosure rules to the Securities Commission, which may impose penalties on issuers in respect of such breaches. In addition, the Securities Commission has powers under the Capital Market Act to take action against issuers that breach the continuous disclosure rules.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All listed entities must be aware of material information, especially regulatory action by an overseas regulator or stock exchange, which might have an impact on the price or value of securities in order to effect timely disclosure obligations&rdquo; said Securities Commission Acting Chairman, Mr James Joshua.&nbsp; &ldquo;Providing continuous and timely disclosure ensures the capital markets integrity, promotes equal access of information to investors, and fosters a fair and transparent market&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>A copy of the amended Listing Rules and the Guidance Note are available on the PNGX website.</p>

<title>PNGX Takes Another Step To Enhance Capital Market</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> amendments, stockbrokers, Responsible Manager, supervision, efficiency
Summary:<br />Amendments to PNGX Business Rules require stockbrokers to be supervised by Responsible Managers for efficient market management. Transition education will be provided.<br /> <div>
<p><i>PNGX Group, operator of Papua New Guinea&rsquo;s national stock exchange, has taken another step towards enhancing the PNG capital market.</i></p>
<p>PNGX has released amendments to its Business Rules to modernise the management requirements for PNG&rsquo;s stockbrokers.&nbsp; This follows the improvement to the speed of settlement of trades which took effect in July 2023,&nbsp; enhancing the overall efficiency of the market.</p>
<p>The Business Rules govern the behaviour of stockbrokers on the PNGX market.</p>
<p>The recent amendments now require each broker to be supervised by a person identified as a Responsible Manager, replacing the previous requirement of an Affiliate Director. The role of a Responsible Manager is crucial, as they must possess sufficient knowledge, seniority and authority within a broker to exert control, leadership, influence and supervision over its operations and processes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Responsible Managers must have direct responsibility for significant day-to-day decisions about the operations of the stockbroker. Additionally, Responsible Manager&rsquo;s are accountable to PNGX for ensuring the stockbrokers compliance to the business rules and all applicable regulations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These amendments are interim measures, set to remain in place until the Business Rules are completely rewritten in late 2024.To aid this transition PNGX will be providing education sessions for stockbrokers in coming months.</p>
<p>A copy of the amended Business Rules and the Guidance Note are available on the PNGX website.</p>

<title>Clearstream, DekaBank And DZ Bank Successfully Issue Tokenised Bonds On DLT At ECB Trials</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/clearstream-dekabank-and-dz-bank-successfully-issue-tokenised-bonds-on-dlt-at-e/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> DLT, Bonds, Central Bank Money, Clearstream, ECB Trials
<br />
Institutional-grade bond issuances in Germany using DLT and settling in central bank money, conducted during ECB trials.
<br /><br />Summary: The first institutional-grade bond issuances in Germany were conducted on DLT during ECB trials, settling in central bank money. <div>
<ul>
<li>First institutional-grade issuances in Germany using DLT and settling in central bank money&nbsp; </li>
<li>Bonds entirely processed on DLT&nbsp; </li>
<li>Conducted during ECB trials in productive environment&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="detailText">
<div class="paragraph">
<div>
<p>Clearstream, DekaBank and DZ Bank have jointly issued two tokenised &euro;5-million bonds using distributed-ledger technology (DLT). The issuances took place in the context of the ECB trials aimed at exploring the potential of DLT for settling wholesale transactions in central bank money.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="dombanner"></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div>
<p>The processes entirely run on Deutsche B&ouml;rse&rsquo;s D7 DLT. This includes both the transaction of the security itself and the transfer of funds using digital central bank money &ndash; from issuance via distribution and settlement to full lifecycle management. DekaBank acted as issuer, DZ Bank as investor &ndash; with swapped roles in the second case. Clearstream acted as DLT Market Operator, providing the technical infrastructure with its digital securities platform D7 developed in strategic partnership with Google Cloud. By connecting D7 with the Bundesbank Trigger Solution, the bond settlement is seamlessly reflected in the European TARGET2 payment system.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div>
<p>The transactions mark the first institutional-grade issuances in Germany on DLT using wholesale digital central bank money. Issuing securities on DLT increases transparency and automation, which reduces the need for manual intervention. Additionally, using central bank money provides enhanced safety, liquidity and monetary policy alignment for issuers and investors alike. &nbsp;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div>
<p>&ldquo;The use case impresses with the simplicity of issuing a security with DLT technology and at the same time benefiting from the advantages of the Trigger Solution. The delivery versus payment of the Trigger Solution proves how the issuing and settlement processes of private blockchains and wholesale CBDC will interact in future. As issuer, banks benefit from the speed, scalability and security of the new technology,&rdquo; said Silvio Lenk, Head of Treasury at DekaBank. &nbsp;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div>
<p>&ldquo;To explore the potential of digital assets, you have to take care of the whole lifecycle &ndash; from issuance via dvp settlement to maturity including the utilisation of central bank money. Participating in the ECB trials with strong partners like Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group and DekaBank, we are delighted to get valuable insights on our way to higher efficiency,&rdquo; Dr. Holger Meffert, Head of Securities Services &amp; Digital Custody at DZ Bank, pointed out.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div>
<p>Jens Hachmeister, Head of Issuer Services &amp; New Digital Markets at Clearstream, said: &ldquo;With the next-generation digital post-trade platform D7 Clearstream aims to digitise the entire post-trade value chain. With our new D7 DLT, launched for the ECB trials, we provide seamless processing of digital assets and high-quality cash on-chain, which is an important step in developing a digital European securities landscape. This transaction represents a significant milestone for the creation of stable digital capital markets in Germany and Europe, demonstrating the power of digital solutions in enhancing safety, liquidity and efficiency.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div>
<p>The ECB trials are conducted in a productive environment, using real central bank money. The timeframe is set for May to November 2024.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) provides an investment of US$75 million to the green and blue bonds issued by Southeast Asia Commercial Joint Stock Bank (<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="http://email.prnewswire.com/ls/click?upn=u001.v-2BJ3gj6ki5QD5j-2Fn6dQLihxWYdZ2SgywQDHxvCbe2FhqV9BSkPvyEwMxxDWxjpWoJLmf_pIbxPfpDI69aAybPrpOfg1n6CWmKMnb3conIyNKCYgr-2BTRqxLAwMRExIXLpGb5DJDKf9loFMOLHRTPn-2B-2BICcEPlZMqwvr8-2FTjHv-2F6IdIlPY-2Fzy3KMyS2xhRa1K9OvjifFal0w7uwLROMAAdDqmq4HgJ9nTL0hyqK7pg8HVC9AgfKtedAdjg-2FnUeDALfd2NSnTDbbPeAgdrSm0L5fA2sVQkRVi1F2xal3NFPdbYkvuLl2Dz0nT2mSx5a9KCta5DeL97UdQqq7Rsa-2BapijD-2Bh2jBrkUx-2BAP4QbsjeUnQ3sUtCZpc-2F2BXyOxqZ5nrxou7rQtpOG8GPv9ZqwksU78Mv9rInRo3mXkzert2Lkf5vstZ9fCOlyQUFBy1PTNNojTopy" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SeABank</a>, stock code: SSB).</p>

<p>AIIB's US$75 million investment in SeABank's green and blue bond project is expected to further strengthen the Bank's strong capital base to expand financing for sustainable economic activities linked to the sea and water, and grow green assets such as green buildings, renewable energy and energy efficiency.</p>
<p><i>"Viet Nam's Nationally Determined Contribution lays emphasis on the importance of resource mobilization from financial and international credit institutions to support climate mitigation and adaptation ambitions. AIIB is very pleased to work together with SeABank and IFC in this innovative transaction, which will supplement the on-going measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to the thematic capital market development</i>," said Gregory Liu, AIIB Director General of Financial Institutions and Funds, Global.&nbsp;<i>"We look forward to seeing more issuances from other Vietnamese financial institutions in future."</i></p>
<p><i>Following SeABank's sustainable commitment, one of our priorities in the current period is to issue the first blue bond in Vietnam and to issue the first green bond by a private commercial bank in the country. We hope the partnerships with financial institutions such as AIIB and IFC could supplement SeABank with capital sources to foster green credit and sustainable strategies associated with green and blue economy" &ndash;&nbsp;</i>said Le Thu Thuy, Vice Chairwoman of the BOD, SeABank.</p>
<p>The investment was mobilized by the co-investor introduction of IFC &ndash; SeABank's strategic partner in terms of sustainable projects, in partnership with the Australian government. Previously at the end of June, IFC provided a US$150 million financing package which includes investments in SeABank's blue and green bonds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sharing the same goal of promoting Vietnam's sustainable economy, together AIIB and IFC are investing US$150 million in SeABank's blue and green bonds. Further, IFC will advise SeABank on the bond issuance, application of related frameworks, and pipeline development.</p>
<p>With its sustainable development goal, in recent years, SeABank has continuously prioritized application of E&amp;S risk management, implementation of financial inclusion and green finance projects. As a result, the Bank has been entrusted with and has received continuous investments from various international financial institutions such as DFC, IFC and ADB with a total capital of approximately US$850 million.</p>

<div> penalty, insider trading, shares, GHL, MAS
<br />
MAS imposed a civil penalty of S$70,000 on Mr Tay Joo Heng for insider trading in GHL shares. Mr Tay admitted to contravening the insider trading provision.<br /><br />Summary: MAS imposed a civil penalty on Mr Tay for insider trading in GHL shares. Mr Tay admitted to contravening the insider trading provision and paid the civil penalty. He also gave a voluntary undertaking not to be a company director for two years. <div>
<p><span>MAS has imposed a civil penalty of S$70,000 on Mr Tay Joo Heng for insider trading in the shares of GS Holdings Limited (GHL). This follows a joint investigation by CAD and MAS into the case.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>2.&nbsp;<span> </span>On 19 November 2019, GHL announced that it had entered into a conditional sale and purchase agreement to sell its wholly owned subsidiary, GreatSolutions Pte Ltd (GreatSolutions), to GSG Capital Pte Ltd (GSG Capital) for a consideration of S$2 million. Following the announcement, trading activity in GHL shares spiked, with 915,600 GHL shares changing hands the next trading day. This was a 58% increase from the counter&rsquo;s average daily traded volume in the one month prior.</p>
<p>3.<span> </span>Mr Tay was the sole shareholder and director of GSG Capital. He was approached by GHL as a potential buyer of GreatSolutions on 2 October 2019. As GreatSolutions had been loss-making, Mr Tay held the view that the market would react positively to the news and anticipated that GHL&rsquo;s share price would rise. Over a period of 13 days between 4 October 2019 and 18 November 2019, while in possession of material non-public information relating to GHL&rsquo;s intended sale of its loss-making wholly owned subsidiary GreatSolutions, Mr Tay purchased a total of 515,000 GHL shares.</p>
<p>4.<span> </span>Mr Tay admitted to contravening the insider trading provision under section 219(2)(a) of the Securities and Futures Act (SFA) and has paid MAS the civil penalty without court action. Mr Tay has also given a voluntary undertaking not to be a company director or be involved in the management of a company for a period of two years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>***</p>
<p><span><span><span>Additional Information</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>(A) The civil penalty regime</span></p>
<p>A civil penalty action is not a criminal action and does not attract criminal sanctions. The civil penalty regime, designed to complement criminal sanctions and provide a nuanced approach to combat market misconduct, became operational at the beginning of 2004.</p>
<p>Under section 232 of the SFA, MAS may enter into an agreement with any person for that person to pay, with or without admission of liability, a civil penalty for contravening any provision of Part 12 of the SFA. The civil penalty may be up to three times the amount of the profit gained or loss avoided by that person as a result of the contravention, subject to a minimum of $50,000 (if the person is not a corporation) or $100,000 (if the person is a corporation).</p>
<p><span>(B) Section 219(2)(a) of the SFA</span></p>
<p><span></span>Section 219(2)(a) prohibits a person who is not connected to any corporation but is in possession of materially price-sensitive information, which he knows is materially price-sensitive and not generally available, and the information would have a material effect on the price or value of securities, from subscribing for, purchasing or selling, or entering into an agreement to subscribe for, purchase or sell these securities.</p>

<div> quarterly review, Amman Stock Exchange, index constituents, market capitalization, free float<br />
Summary:<br />
Amman Stock Exchange conducted a quarterly review of its indices constituents, adding and excluding companies based on market performance and trading activity.<br /> <div>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The Amman Stock Exchange (ASE)&nbsp; has conducted the periodic quarterly review of the ASE indices constituents in purpose of ensuring that these indices reflect the market performance and the trading activity of the listed companies. By this rebalancing, the activity of listed companies in regard to trading during the last quarter has been reviewed. After that, the ASE has conducted its screening process for all listed companies based on the criteria used by the ASE represented by full market capitalization of the companies and the number of trading days during last quarter.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>As&nbsp;result of this review, 3 companies have been excluded from the general index sample ASEGI and other 3 companies have been added. The companies that have been excluded from the index sample were: Arab Company for Investment Projects, Jordan Steel, and National Aluminium Industrial.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The companies that have been added to the index sample were: Al-Zarqa Educational &amp; Investment, Aldaman for Investments, and Philadelphia International Educational Investment Company.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>As part of the process, the ASE calculated the free float for all listed companies on the ASE based on the data received from the Securities Depository Center. This review also includes the reduction of the weights for some companies to maintain the 10% cap that applied to index constitutes.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Regarding the general index ASEGI,&nbsp;the full market capitalization of the index constituents represents 91.2% of the total market capitalization of the companies listed on the ASE. The free float market capitalization of the index constitutes represents 94.1% of the total free float market capitalization of the listed companies on the ASE.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>As for the</span></span></span>&nbsp;<span><span><span>ASE20 and&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>ASETR indices</span></span></span>&nbsp;<span><span><span>the full market capitalization of the index constituents represents 84.2% of the total market capitalization of the companies listed on the ASE, while the free float market capitalization of these companies represents 86.7% of the total free float market capitalization of the ASE</span></span></span>&nbsp;<span><span><span>listed companies.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>In light of the above, the index constituents will be modified on the 1<span>st</span>&nbsp;of July 2024. Interested parties can access to the constituents of the index with the new weights through the following link:</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<div> Keywords: central bank, inflation, economic growth, monetary policy, financial stability<br />
Summary: Central banks have successfully controlled inflation, but risk points remain. To ensure future stability, they must strengthen price stability, fiscal policy, and structural reforms.<br /><br /> <div>

<li>BIS analysis describes lessons learned for central banks since the turn of this century and the implications for monetary policy frameworks in the future.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>The global economy is poised for a smooth landing, but risks remain and policymakers must take a long-term view to lay the foundations for sustainable growth, the Bank for International Settlements said today in its flagship economic report.</p>
<p>Analysis in the&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/arpdf/ar2024e.htm"><span class="firstword">BIS</span>&nbsp;Annual Economic Report 2024</a></em>&nbsp;indicates that forceful central bank action has been effective in bringing inflation down substantially. Economic growth and the wider financial system have proved resilient.</p>

<p>Central banks have done their job and the global economy appears to be headed for a smooth landing, although there are some pressure points that could still throw it off course. To secure a sound future, central banks need to finish the last mile to restore price stability. At the same time, governments have to step up by consolidating public finances and prioritising long overdue structural reforms.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The report analyses various pressure points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Services prices and real wages are still lagging pre-pandemic trends and any rapid catch-up could push inflation up again.</li>
<li>Unrestrained public finances would make it harder to bring inflation down and threatenmacroeconomic and financial stability in the longer term.</li>
<li>High debt levels and servicing costs may still spark financial stress.</li>
<li>Weak productivity growth could damage both inflation and growth.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>To counter these risks, policies need to lay robust macroeconomic and financial foundations for the future, the BIS said. Monetary policy must finish restoring price stability. Fiscal policy needs to avoid adding stimulus and acting at cross purposes with monetary policy and governments must prioritise budgetary consolidation. Prudential policy must continue to strengthen the soundness of the financial system. Structural reforms that promote competition, enhance flexibility and spur innovation are the only way to boost growth on a sustainable basis and prepare the economy for the challenges ahead.</p>
<p>The report also analyses the lessons learned from the conduct of monetary policy in the 21st century, a turbulent period dominated by major financial crises, a pandemic and an unexpected surge in inflation.</p>

<p>Central banks have navigated troubled waters and delivered. The journey holds key lessons for what monetary policy can and cannot deliver and how it might be refined to face challenges ahead, focusing on being robust, nimble and realistic in ambition and operating within safety margins. Only if monetary policy is complemented by other policies can the economy and financial system follow a stable path.</p>

<div> Record day, Nasdaq Closing Cross, Russell Reconstitution, trading volumes, technology architecture
Summary:<br /><br />Nasdaq Closing Cross had a record day for the Russell Reconstitution, showcasing its role in capital markets and responding to global trading volume growth with scalable technology architecture. <div>
<ul>
<li><em>Nasdaq Closing Cross continues to play an integral and innovative role in capital markets</em> </li>
<li><em>Global growth in trading volumes demands increasingly scalable and flexible technology architecture</em> </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="xn-org">Nasdaq, Inc.</span>&nbsp;(Nasdaq: NDAQ) today announced the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=j3VhMWs3Hkng0uAGkJGwWrtEjVFY6xUAmtxY-fN_3iLiCX8PAjA3s2abFY-7OloDCmbZMC1eqdcnI-6PhzWN2liVViJ3MBVMjQoOrESuLT8dpB-epMMpzGLQ37sOv3Sy" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nasdaq Closing Cross</a>&nbsp;had a record day as it was used to rebalance Nasdaq-listed securities in the entire family of Russell US Indexes, part of global index provider FTSE Russell, during its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=_5SfcW78DJcndhCXgOWr5okqe5SVui5qQnM2Tkly1cUGC09d9grW1P2AAuPY2KI3wUrPDzlp6UrUHYbTOgBtBbW6vvD1uhRyf3WSXT5CrFMj9v3B54OvxYDaxGTCs1XyolDsJ_6c590PO8UJmzbiQQ==" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">annual reconstitution</a>. This year marks the 40th anniversary of the&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Russell</span>&nbsp;3000&reg; Index and the 21st year that the Closing Cross has been used to calculate the Russell Reconstitution.</p>
<p>2,899,191,109 shares, representing a record&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$95.257 billion</span>, were executed in the Closing Cross in 0.878 seconds across Nasdaq-listed securities, representing the largest liquidity event on the&nbsp;<span class="xn-org">Nasdaq Stock Exchange for the Russell Reconstitution</span>. The new record compares with the second-highest trading day, which represented&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$80.898 billion</span>, executed in 1.974 seconds across Nasdaq-listed securities during&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Russell's</span>&nbsp;annual reconstitution in 2021.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Nasdaq Closing Cross has played an integral and innovative role in the capital markets, enabling transparent price facilitation for over two decades,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Kevin Kennedy</span>, Executive Vice President of North American Trading Services at Nasdaq. "We are incredibly proud to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Russell</span>&nbsp;3000&reg; Index while also surpassing the record for notional value of shares traded, and we look forward to continuing to set the official closing price for all Nasdaq-listed securities for the Reconstitution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Russell indexes&ndash;now in their 40th year&ndash;continue to evolve to reflect the dynamic US economy,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Fiona Bassett</span>&nbsp;CEO of FTSE Russell. &ldquo;Annual rebalancing plays a vital role in establishing accurate benchmarks, ensuring they correctly mirror their designated market segments and remain unbiased in terms of size and style.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Closing Cross brings together buy and sell interests executing all shares for each stock at a single price, one that reflects the accurate supply and demand for these securities. The technology reflects each symbol&rsquo;s true supply and demand, providing unparalleled insight into the market close.</p>
<p>All Russell US Indexes are subsets of the&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Russell</span>&nbsp;3000E&trade; Index, which represents approximately 98% of the US equity market. Russell US Indexes allow investors to track current and historical market performance by specific market segment (large cap/small cap) or investment style (growth/value/defensive/dynamic). Today, approximately&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$10.5 trillion</span>&nbsp;in assets are benchmarked to or invested in products based on the Russell US Indexes.</p>
<p><span class="xn-location">Russell</span>&nbsp;reconstitution day is one of the year&rsquo;s most highly anticipated and heaviest trading days in the US equity market, as asset managers seek to reconfigure their portfolios to reflect the composition of&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Russell's</span>&nbsp;newly reconstituted US indexes. The index reconstitution process was completed today, and the newly reconstituted index membership will take effect when markets open on&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">Monday, July 1, 2024</span>. Please visit our website for more information on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=j3VhMWs3Hkng0uAGkJGwWrtEjVFY6xUAmtxY-fN_3iL_93OnBKB2doexaJj6HUJV5jT1Z0P19S-7bun0eSH3caGhBqcrQLUZKPx5_7g4_39IrBn30XFad2QeA_0mGBTa" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nasdaq Closing Cross</a>.</p>
<h4><span>Responding to the global growth in trading volumes</span></h4>
<p>Over the last two decades Nasdaq&rsquo;s industry-leading technology has provided the essential price discovery function that the prices of FTSE Russell Reconstitution depends on. During that time the Cross has reduced latency by over 86% while effectively keeping pace with an increasing trade volume growth of over 450% and an increasing dollar volume of over 950%.</p>
<p>This trend is representative of an extraordinary global growth in trading volumes that has necessitated the enhanced development and deployment of resilient technology in market systems. Nasdaq has long invested to ensure it has the flexible and scalable architecture necessary to manage ever greater volumes, and through our Financial Technology division continues to build on an extensive range of partnerships with infrastructure providers to support their modernization journey.</p>
<p>Modernizing global capital markets infrastructure is critical to maintaining overall system resilience and ensuring market operators can both support and grow with the economies they underpin.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Surge, Liquidations, Fees, Performance, Geopolitical risk
<br />
Summary:<br /> 
Hedge fund launches surged in 1Q24 while liquidations remained steady. Fees fell to historic lows, and performance was strong. Geopolitical risk and inflation will define 2024. <div>
<ul>
<li><b><i>Liquidations steady over prior quarter;</i></b> </li>
<li><b><i>Fees for new hedge fund launches fall</i></b> </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>New hedge fund launches surged while liquidations remained steady to begin 2024 as industry assets hit a record level of $4.3 trillion while fund managers positioned for growing geopolitical risk, representing potential for significant policy shifts, financial market volatility and destabilizing dislocations. The estimated number of new hedge fund launches in 1Q24 surged to 146, an increase of 70 percent from the prior quarter and the highest level since 1Q22, according to the latest&nbsp;<i>HFR Market Microstructure Report,</i>&nbsp;released today by HFR<sup>&reg;</sup>, the established global leader in the indexation, analysis and research of the global hedge fund industry. The strong start to 2024 follows a steady growth year in 2023 when an estimated 438 new funds launched.</p>
<p>The number of hedge fund liquidations remained steady to begin 2024, as an estimated 106 funds closed during the quarter, on par with the prior quarter estimate of 104 liquidations. For the full year 2023, an estimated 415 funds liquidated, the lowest level of liquidations since 2004. Launches were led by Equity Hedge funds in 1Q24, with an estimated 75 new funds opening its doors, representing more than half of the 1Q launches. Equity Hedge funds continue to expand with Technology-concentrated equity markets reaching record levels, though with much of the gains narrowly concentrated in large cap equities.</p>
<p>The HFRI Asset Weighted Composite Index<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;(AWC) gained +5.7 percent YTD through May, while the HFRI Fund Weighted Composite advanced +5.2 percent, as large funds outperformed small and mid-sized firms.&nbsp; Macro leads YTD strategy performance through May with additional strong contributions from Equity Hedge; the HFRI Macro (Total) Index jumped +6.9 percent over the first five months of the year, while the HFRI Macro (Asset Weighted) Index surged +7.8 percent. Macro gains were led by quantitative, trend-following CTA strategies, with the HFRI Macro: Systematic Diversified Index surging +9.5 percent YTD through May. The HFRI Equity Hedge (Total) Index advanced +6.0 percent over the first five months of the year; EH sub-strategies were led by the HFRI EH: Quantitative Directional Index, which gained +8.8 percent YTD through May, and the HFRI EH: Energy/Basic Materials Index, which advanced +7.9 percent.</p>
<p>The performance dispersion of the HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;(FWC) decreased slightly in 1Q24 from the prior quarter, as the top decile of index constituents returned an average of +19.4 percent, while the bottom decile declined by an average of -5.8 percent, representing a top/bottom decile dispersion of 25.2 percent, compared to a top/bottom dispersion of 29.5 percent in 4Q23. In the trailing 12 months ending March 2024, the top decile of FWC constituents returned an average of +43.3 percent, while the bottom decile declined by an average of -11.9 percent, representing a top/bottom decile dispersion of 55.2 percent.</p>
<p>Hedge fund fees fell to new historic lows to begin 2024, as managers continued to position for capital growth and inflows from institutional investors throughout 2024. The average industry-wide management fee was unchanged from the prior quarter at an estimated 1.35 percent, while the average incentive fee fell to at an estimated 15.96 percent. For funds that launched in 1Q24, the average management fee fell an estimated 1.17 percent, while the average incentive fee fell to an estimated 17.17 percent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Geopolitical risk and inflation are likely to define 2024, accelerating trends from 2023 with hedge fund performance and growth trends reflecting expanding interest from institutional investors looking for specialized exposure to these trends with important capital preservation,&rdquo; stated Kenneth J. Heinz, President of HFR. &ldquo;Managers continued to position for ongoing geopolitical risk driven by ongoing European elections and upcoming US elections, anticipating significant policy shifts and trade impacts, though these risks also include ongoing and potential new military conflicts, with these risks likely to increase throughout 2024. The powerful combination of strong performance, specialized exposures, and capital preservation are likely to drive industry growth throughout 2024.&rdquo;</p>

<title>SIFMA, FSI File Federal Lawsuit Against DOL Fiduciary Rule</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sifma-fsi-file-federal-lawsuit-against-dol-fiduciary-rule/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Financial Services Institute, Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, Lawsuit, Department of Labor, Fiduciary Definition<br />
Summary: FSI and SIFMA joined a lawsuit challenging DOL's new rule expanding fiduciary definition, lacking authority and rational justification. <br /> <div>
<p>The Financial Services Institute (FSI) and Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) joined a federal lawsuit today in the Northern District of Texas, seeking to strike down a recently finalized Department of Labor (DOL) rule that unlawfully expands the definition of a &ldquo;fiduciary&rdquo; and jeopardizes investors&rsquo; access to advice and education.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s legal complaint notes that the new rule is materially indistinguishable from a 2016 DOL rule that was struck down by the Fifth Circuit in 2018: &ldquo;like the 2016 Rule, the 2024 Rule is inconsistent with the common law, contravenes the statutory text, and impermissibly attempts to regulate the provision of services to accounts over which the Labor Department has no regulatory authority.&nbsp; Indeed, the illegality of the 2024 Rule is even clearer today&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 2019 the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)&mdash;the federal agency Congress actually created to regulate broker-dealers&mdash;adopted Regulation Best Interest (Reg BI), which the Department itself admits largely instituted the standards for broker-dealers that the Department&rsquo;s 2016 Rule had (illegally) sought to impose.</p>
<p>With Reg BI, the needs case for the Department&rsquo;s unlawful regulation of broker-dealers vanished.&nbsp; In Reg BI, moreover, the SEC rejected the very thing that the Department&mdash;which is an employment regulator, not a broker-dealer regulator&mdash;boasts of having imposed here:&nbsp; promulgation of &rdquo;a uniform standard of conduct [for] all financial professionals regardless of how they engage with their retail customers&rdquo; as stated in the complaint.</p>
<p>The DOL rule not only lacks statutory authority, but also violates the Administrative Procedure Act because it lacks both rational justification and adequate cost-benefit analysis.</p>
<p>Notably, the complaint does not challenge the prohibited-transaction exemption (PTE) 2020-02 (which some broker-dealers utilize in situations where they are fiduciaries under the Department&rsquo;s 1975 test) or the Department&rsquo;s recent amendments to that exemption.</p>
<p>FSI and SIFMA ask the Court to vacate and set aside the 2024 Rule and declare it to be in excess of the DOL&rsquo;s statutory authority, arbitrary and capricious, and otherwise not in accordance with law.</p>
<p>The full plaintiff-intervenors&rsquo; complaint filed in this case,&nbsp;<em>American Council of Life Insurers, et al. v. United States Department of Labor</em>, can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sifma.org/resources/submissions/complaint-filed-in-the-u-s-district-court-for-the-northern-district-of-texas-worth-division/">here</a>.</p>

<title>U.S. Department Of The Treasury, IRS Release Final Regulations Implementing Bipartisan Tax Reporting Requirements For Sales And Exchanges Of Digital Assets - Regulations Help Taxpayers File Accurate Returns And Pay Taxes Already Owed Under Current Law</title>

<div> Regulations, Digital Assets, Reporting Requirements, IRS, Tax<br />
Summary: The Treasury and IRS released final regulations for brokers of digital assets in line with reporting requirements for traditional financial services. This aims to ensure accurate tax filing and reduce tax evasion. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>As part of the Biden-Harris Administration&rsquo;s implementation of the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) today released&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/2024-14004/gross-proceeds-and-basis-reporting-by-brokers-and-determination-of-amount-realized-and-basis-for">final regulations</a>&nbsp;on the IIJA&rsquo;s reporting requirements for brokers of digital assets, which align these requirements with longstanding reporting requirements for traditional financial services. Owners of digital assets have always owed tax on the sale or exchange of digital assets, and the IIJA did not change that or impose any new taxes on digital assets. It simply created reporting requirements, similar to those that already applied to traditional financial services, to help taxpayers file accurate returns and pay taxes owed under current law.</p>
<div class="dombanner"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The final regulations announced today will require brokers to report gross proceeds on the sale of digital assets beginning in 2026 for all sales in 2025. Brokers will be required to also report information on the tax basis for certain digital assets beginning in 2027 for sales in 2026.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because of the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, investors in digital assets and the IRS will have better access to the documentation they need to easily file and review tax returns,&rdquo;&nbsp;<span>said Acting Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy Aviva Aron-Dine</span>. &ldquo;By implementing the law&rsquo;s reporting requirements, these final regulations will help taxpayers more easily pay taxes owed under current law, while reducing tax evasion by wealthy investors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While owners of digital assets have always owed tax on the sale or exchange of digital assets, compliant taxpayers have often been forced to rely on expensive third-party services to calculate their gains or losses from the sale of digital assets. These final regulations will implement Congress&rsquo;s bipartisan directive to ensure that owners of digital assets receive the information they need from brokers to file their taxes more accurately, more easily, and less expensively, and that the IRS has the information needed to address the tax evasion risks posed by digital assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These regulations were developed after Treasury and IRS held a public hearing and carefully reviewed more than 44,000 comments in response to proposed regulations. While today&rsquo;s rules primarily address reporting requirements for custodial brokers, Treasury and IRS anticipate issuing additional rules later this year establishing reporting requirements for non-custodial brokers, consistent with statutory requirements.&nbsp;</p>

<title>Financial Action Task Force Holds Plenary In Singapore, Advances Key Illicit Finance Initiatives</title>

<div> Presidency, FATF, Plenary, AML/CFT, DPRK <br />
Summary:<br /><br />The FATF concluded its Plenary, adopting Mutual Evaluation Reports for India and Kuwait, warning about DPRK's financial connectivity, and addressing terrorist financing risks. <div>
<p>Today, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the global standard-setting body for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism and proliferation (AML/CFT/CPF), concluded its sixth and final Plenary under the Singaporean Presidency. During the Plenary, the FATF took several key actions, including adopting the Mutual Evaluation Reports (MERs) for India and Kuwait, agreeing to publish a report on non-financial gatekeeper facilitation of corruption, and discussing the priorities of the incoming Mexican FATF Presidency.</p>
<p>The FATF also adopted a statement warning all countries of the Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic of Korea (DPRK)&rsquo;s increasing financial connectivity with the international financial system, and reiterating the dangers that this poses for the financing of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The FATF noted the imperative to robustly implement targeted financial sanctions against the DPRK and to terminate any correspondent relationships with DPRK banks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At a time when Russia is continuing to take destabilizing actions and seeking to increase its financial connectivity with North Korea, in violation of UN Security Council Resolutions, we welcome the FATF&rsquo;s unwavering focus on combatting illicit finance, strengthening the global financial system, and preserving the international rules-based order,&rdquo; said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. &ldquo;Treasury will continue to pursue initiatives that maintain the United States&rsquo; role as a leader in efforts to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation finance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>FATF members agreed to take on additional work related to global terrorist financing risks and proliferation financing sanctions evasion typologies. They also discussed the limited progress on global implementation of the FATF Standards on virtual assets. The FATF agreed to publish a targeted update on this topic due to continued evidence of the misuse of virtual assets by global threats, such as North Korea, ransomware criminals, scammers, terrorist groups, and others.</p>
<p>The Plenary adopted the MERs of India and Kuwait, which will be published in the near future on the FATF website. These two reports represent a culmination of peer reviews by FATF members to assess both countries&rsquo; AML/CFT/CPF legal frameworks, as well as how effectively they implement those frameworks.</p>
<p>Responding to a call by FATF ministers to enhance efforts to mitigate threats to global security, like corruption, the Plenary approved for publication a report that reviewed FATF member states&rsquo; compliance with certain FATF Recommendations. This report examined FATF members&rsquo; technical compliance with standards meant to strengthen AML/CFT/CPF obligations and supervision of designated non-financial businesses and professions (DNFBPs)&mdash;such as lawyers, real estate agents, and trust and company formation agents&mdash;that are vulnerable to abuse by corrupt actors.</p>
<p><span>The FATF adopted revisions to its methodology for assessing standards on asset recovery. These changes will help Mutual Evaluation (ME) assessors to understand and appraise the tools that countries have for their law enforcement, asset recovery agencies, and criminal justice systems to target and recover criminal proceeds and to improve mutual legal assistance.</span></p>
<p>This Plenary was the last of the Singaporean FATF Presidency and the FATF will welcome Elisa de Anda Madrazo of Mexico as the new FATF President on July 1. The United States strongly supports the Mexican Presidential priorities for the next two years, which include continuing to combat risks stemming from terrorist financing and proliferation financing, as well as promoting financial inclusion. Treasury continues to examine and mitigate reasons for financial exclusion, such as through its&nbsp;<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1438">2023 De-Risking Strategy</a>&nbsp;and the development of a&nbsp;<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2012">national strategy for financial inclusion</a>.</p>

<title>CISA Misses Mark On Proposed Cyber Incident Reporting Rule - ABA, BPI, IIB And SIFMA Comment On Shortfalls Of CIRCIA Proposal</title>

<div> Cybersecurity, incident reporting, financial institutions, CISA, data breach
Summary:
Limit reporting scope to critical incidents, focus on actionable information, clarify and reduce supplemental reporting, shorten required data retention. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The American Bankers Association, Bank Policy Institute, Institute of International Bankers and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association raised serious concerns today in a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sifma.org/resources/submissions/cyber-incident-reporting-for-critical-infrastructure-act-of-2022-reporting-requirements-joint-trades/">letter</a>&nbsp;to the Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency on its plan to implement new cyber incident reporting laws. The proposed rule would require victims of cyber incidents, like a data breach or other attack, to report to CISA within 72 hours of determining that an incident has occurred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Congress directed CISA to create a rule that gives regulators timely intelligence without diverting front-line defenders from the immediate task of stopping the attack,&rdquo; the Associations commented upon filing the letter. &ldquo;CISA has thus far failed to strike that balance, disregarded congressional intent and risks straining the U.S. financial system&rsquo;s cyber defenses. Significant changes must be made for this proposal to be useful to regulators and industry; otherwise, CISA is moving forward with another requirement that prioritizes routine government reporting over the security needs of firms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The proposal is in response to the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act, which financial institutions supported when it became law in March 2022. CISA engaged in a series of listening sessions following CIRCIA&rsquo;s passage, and the Department of Homeland Security also issued its own set of recommendations identifying 45 different reporting requirements across the federal government, each with disparate standards and thresholds, that warrant greater harmonization. However, the proposal does not adequately address these shortcomings.</p>
<p>Our recommendations:</p>
<p>CISA should address the following changes to better align with the CIRCIA statute and achieve a more coordinated and effective cyber incident response:</p>
<ul>
<li>Limit the scope of reporting to what matters most. The current scope is too broad and risks overwhelming regulators with irrelevant data. Instead, limit reporting to substantial incidents that affect critical services. Moreover, CISA should clarify that the reporting requirements only apply to the U.S. operations of financial institutions and would not apply if an incident occurs entirely outside of the United States.</li>
<li>Focus data collection on what companies &ldquo;need to know&rdquo; to prevent contagion. The information collected should be based on actionable information that could be shared with other companies to protect the economy and prevent the exploitation of similar vulnerabilities.</li>
<li>Clarify and reduce the supplemental reporting requirements applicable to covered entities. Regular status updates are important, however, requiring constant reports is not useful and ties up critical response resources.</li>
<li>Reduce the amount of time firms are required to keep forensic data. CISA should shorten the time that financial institutions are required to save data so they aren&rsquo;t forced to incur expenses for data that may no longer be necessary.</li>
</ul>

<div> charged, Consensys Software Inc, unregistered offer, securities, MetaMask Staking
<br />
Consensys Software Inc charged with unregistered offer and sale of securities, operating as unregistered broker, violating registration provisions.
<br /><br />Summary: 
Consensys Software Inc charged with unregistered offer and sale of securities, operating as unregistered broker, violating registration provisions. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Consensys Software Inc. with engaging in the unregistered offer and sale of securities through a service it calls MetaMask Staking and with operating as an unregistered broker through MetaMask Staking and another service it calls MetaMask Swaps.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, since at least January 2023, Consensys has offered and sold tens of thousands of unregistered securities on behalf of liquid staking program providers Lido and Rocket Pool, who create and issue liquid staking tokens (called stETH and rETH) in exchange for staked assets. While staked tokens are generally locked up and cannot be traded or used while they are staked, liquid staking tokens, as the name implies, can be bought and sold freely. Investors in these staking programs provided funds to Lido and Rocket Pool in exchange for the liquid tokens. The SEC&rsquo;s complaint alleges that Consensys engages in the unregistered offer and sale of securities by participating in the distribution of the staking programs and operates as an unregistered broker with respect to these transactions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By allegedly collecting hundreds of millions of dollars in fees as an unregistered broker and engaging in the unregistered offer and sale of tens of thousands of securities, Consensys inserted itself squarely into the U.S. securities markets while depriving investors of the protections afforded by the federal securities laws,&rdquo; said Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;As this enforcement action shows, we continue to hold noncompliant actors in this space accountable, as we do across the securities market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC further alleges that, since at least October 2020, Consensys has brokered transactions in crypto asset securities by, for example, soliciting investors to trade crypto asset securities, providing pricing and other investment information regarding crypto asset securities, purporting to provide investors with the &ldquo;best&rdquo; quote, accepting and routing customer orders, facilitating order execution, handling customer assets, and receiving transaction-based compensation.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in federal district court in the Eastern District of New York, charges Consensys with violating the registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and seeks injunctive relief and penalties.</p>
<p>The SEC's investigation was conducted by Daphna Waxman, Amy Mayer, and Abigail Cooper and supervised by Mark R. Sylvester, Kristin Pauley, and Jorge G. Tenreiro, all of the SEC&rsquo;s Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit. The SEC&rsquo;s litigation will be led by Samuel Wasserman under the supervision of Jack Kaufman and Mr. Tenreiro.</p>

<div> Supreme Court, SEC v. Jarkesy, CFTC, administrative proceedings, due process <br />
Summary: Commissioner Pham supports Supreme Court decision, advocates for fair hearings, due process, and scrutiny in CFTC actions.<br /> <div>
<p>Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Commissioner Caroline D. Pham released the following statement on the U.S. Supreme Court decision in&nbsp;<i>SEC v. Jarkesy</i>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement031524" target="_blank">I&rsquo;ve said before,</a>&nbsp;&lsquo;administrative proceedings, where the agency is the prosecutor, judge, and jury, lack the checks-and-balances imposed by separation of powers between the executive and judicial branches of government to ensure a fair hearing and due process.&rsquo; The Court&rsquo;s opinion explicitly recognizes this truism, and reinforces the law of the land. There&rsquo;s more work to be done at the Commission to ensure that our adjudications and settlements can withstand scrutiny, particularly when they deprive others of property without appropriate due process and in violation of the Constitution. I&rsquo;ll continue pushing to bring&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024">greater accountability and transparency</a>&nbsp;to our administrative proceedings so that our stakeholders have the utmost confidence in the CFTC&rsquo;s actions to promote safe and fair markets.&rdquo;</p>

Summary:<br /><br />ICE Benchmark Administration to continue publishing synthetic U.S. dollar LIBOR until September 30, 2024. No new settings expected after that date. Legal and regulatory advice recommended. <div>
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE:ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today announced that ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (IBA), the authorized and regulated administrator of LIBOR<sup>&reg;</sup>, has provided an update regarding the cessation of U.S. dollar LIBOR<sup>&reg;</sup>.</p>
<p>In line with previous statements, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has decided to exercise its powers under the U.K. Benchmarks Regulation (U.K. BMR)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/corporate/article-23-3-benchmarks-regulation-notice-first-decision.pdf" rel="nofollow" shape="rect"><span>to compel</span>&nbsp;</a>IBA to continue to publish the 1-, 3- and 6-Month &ldquo;synthetic&rdquo; U.S. dollar LIBOR settings using an unrepresentative&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/libor-notices/article-23d-benchmarks-regulation-usd-final-notice-requirements.pdf" rel="nofollow" shape="rect"><span>&ldquo;synthetic&rdquo; methodology</span>&nbsp;</a>until September 30, 2024.</p>
<p>The FCA has stated that it has no intention to compel publication beyond this date and has issued&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/news-stories/remaining-synthetic-us-dollar-libor-3-months-go" rel="nofollow" shape="rect"><span>a reminder</span>&nbsp;</a>of the expected cessation of these final three remaining LIBOR settings after publication on Monday, September 30, 2024.

<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) published its final draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) clarifying the extraordinary circumstances for continuing the use of internal models and disregarding certain overshootings in accordance with the Fundamental Review of the Trading book (FRTB) framework</span></p>
<p>Under the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR), competent authorities may permit institutions to derogate from certain requirements for the use of internal models in accordance with the FRTB, or apply a softer version of those requirements, under extraordinary circumstances.</p>
<p>The occurrence of extraordinary circumstances will be determined by the EBA, which must issue an opinion to that effect. The RTS published today set out the conditions and indicators that the EBA shall use to determine whether extraordinary circumstances have occurred.</p>
<h4>Legal basis</h4>
<p>The draft RTS have been developed in accordance with Article 325az(10) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, as amended by Regulation (EU) 2024/1623 (&lsquo;CRR3&rsquo;).&nbsp;</p>

<title>The EBA Amends Its Guidelines On Arrears And Foreclosure Following Changes To The Mortgage Credit Directive</title>

<div> amended, Guidelines, arrears, foreclosure, Mortgage Credit Directive
Summary:<br />European Banking Authority amended Guidelines on arrears and foreclosure to align with changes in Mortgage Credit Directive and Credit Servicers Directive. <div>
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today its amended Guidelines on arrears and foreclosure following the changes introduced in the Mortgage Credit Directive (MCD).</span></p>
<p>The EBA assessed the impact of the recent revision of Article 28(1) of the MCD and concluded that, in order to adhere to the principle that EBA Guidelines must not repeat, amend or contradict requirements set out in Level 1 legislation, the EBA Guidelines on arrears and foreclosure needed to be amended.</p>
<p>Guideline 4 on &lsquo;resolution process&rsquo; has therefore been removed from the EBA Guidelines on arrears and foreclosure, as its content is now embedded in binding Union Law. The aggregate requirements set out in the MCD and the EBA Guidelines have remained unchanged.</p>
<h4>Background and legal basis</h4>
<p>The EBA issued its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/legacy/regulation-and-policy/regulatory-activities/consumer-protection-and-financial-innovation-6">Guidelines on arrears and foreclosure (EBA/GL/2015/12</a>) in 2015 to support the transposition of the provisions of Article 28 on arrears and foreclosure of Directive 2014/17/EU on credit agreements for consumers relating to residential immovable property (MCD). The EBA Guidelines became applicable on the same day as the MCD itself on 21 March 2016.</p>
<p>In December 2021, Directive (EU) 2021/2167 on credit servicers and credit purchasers (Credit Servicers Directive &ndash; CSD),&nbsp;regulating the sale, purchase, and servicing of non-performing loans (NPLs) entered into force. The CSD introduced,&nbsp;<em>inter alia</em>, amendments to Article 28(1) MCD on arrears and foreclosure by replacing the existing wording with a nea<em>r verbatim&nbsp;</em>wording of Guideline 4 of the EBA Guidelines on arrears and foreclosure, which covers the resolution process between creditor and borrower. The amended Level 1 text became applicable at the end of December 2023.</p>
<p>The amended Guidelines will apply within two months of the publication of the translated versions.</p>

<div> Paratus Energy Services, Euronext Oslo Børs, listing, market capitalisation, international listing<br />
Summary:<br />
Paratus Energy Services, listed on Euronext Oslo Børs, has a market capitalisation of NOK 10 billion and is the eighth international listing in 2024. <div>

<p class="BodyText1">Euronext Oslo B&oslash;rs proudly congratulates Paratus Energy Services, hereafter Paratus, (ticker: PLSV) on its successful listing on Euronext Growth Oslo. This marks the sixth listing in Oslo this year and the 23rd across Euronext. Notably, it is the eighth international listing on Euronext in 2024.</p>

<p class="BodyText1">Robert Jensen, Chief Executive Officer of Paratus, said:&nbsp;<em>"Today's listing on Euronext Growth Oslo is a pivotal moment for Paratus and a testament to the hard work and dedication of our entire team. Our assets have a long-term track record of generating significant cash flows, and we expect to maintain that trajectory with our recent contract awards.

<p class="paragraph spanHeading"><span>Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) is today (Friday) pleased to publish a Consultation Paper on the proposed reduction of minimum spreads in the Hong Kong securities market. The consultation&nbsp;</span><span>period&nbsp;</span><span>will last for 12 weeks, ending on 20 September 2024.</span></p>
<p class="paragraph spanHeading">HKEX is proposing a reduction of the minimum spreads of equities, Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), and equity warrants (collectively, Applicable Securities) in Hong Kong&rsquo;s securities market, as part of ongoing efforts to enhance its market microstructure and liquidity. HKEX&rsquo;s proposal adopts a gradual, two-phase approach to reduce the minimum spreads of selected price bands, following a holistic review of the liquidity profile of the Applicable Securities.</p>
<p class="paragraph spanHeading">In Phase 1, the proposal recommends a 50 to 60 per cent reduction in the minimum spreads of price bands between $10 and $50. Subject to the implementation of the proposed changes in Phase 1 and a review of its impact, HKEX may consider proceeding with the implementation of Phase 2 to reduce the minimum spread for price band between $0.5 and $10 by 50 per cent. It is expected that around 300 and 1,300 Applicable Securities, accounting for nearly 30 per cent and 25 per cent of the average daily turnover of equities, will be included in Phase 1 and 2 respectively<span>1</span>.</p>

<div> Keywords: Euronext, Portugal, Capital Markets, Investment, Economic Growth
Summary:
Portugal Capital Markets Day highlights investment opportunities in Portugal, connects investors and corporations, promotes structural trends and fosters economic growth. <br /><br />Summary: Euronext and AEM host successful Portugal Capital Markets Day, promoting investment opportunities, showcasing economic trends, and fostering growth and collaboration. <div>
<p>Euronext, the leading pan-European market infrastructure, and AEM, the Portuguese Issuers Association, today announced the success of the first edition of the Portugal Capital Markets Day, an initiative dedicated to highlighting the wealth of opportunities available within the Portuguese economy, with a particular focus on the capital markets. This initiative, supported by AON as the main sponsor, and VdA - Vieira de Almeida and JP Morgan as sponsors, aims to connect investors, corporations and financial institutions, fostering stronger investment ties and economic growth.</p>
<p>The primary objectives of the Portugal Capital Markets Day are to promote investment opportunities in Portugal, with a focus on listed companies, by showcasing major economic structural trends, as well as relevant insights into selected sectors that are currently experiencing growth and transformation. The event seeks to enhance market visibility for Portuguese companies in the global capital markets, encouraging investment partnerships and facilitating company growth. Furthermore, it provides a platform for meaningful interactions between investors, corporates, financial experts, regulators and government officials, stimulating networking and collaboration.</p>
<p>The Portuguese Minister of State and Finance, Joaquim Miranda Sarmento, the Portuguese Minister of Economy, Pedro Reis, the Chairperson of CMVM, Lu&iacute;s Laginha de Sousa, the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext N.V., St&eacute;phane Boujnah, and the Chairman of the Portuguese Issuers Association, Miguel Athayde Marques, along with high-level representatives from Portuguese companies in the Health, Energy, Infrastructure, Real Estate, and Tourism sectors, contributed to making this event a top-tier opportunity for fostering collaboration towards a common goal: boosting growth.</p>
<p><span>One-on-one meetings: record number of meetings and investor participation</span></p>
<p>The direct personal meetings component of the Portugal Capital Markets Day has already proven to be a great success, with participation from 50 institutional investors and more than 30 investment entities. Featuring presentations from 20 top-tier Portuguese companies, the one-on-one meetings highlighted the attractiveness of these companies. Over 100 meetings and around 250 contacts and introductions between company executives and potential investors were conducted, fostering direct and impactful dialogues.</p>
<p><span>Conference: Invest in Portugal &ndash; Insights on an Economy in Transformation</span></p>
<p>The conference brings together thought leaders, policymakers, and industry experts to discuss key trends and challenges in the Portuguese industrial environment. Over 300 people are gathered today in Lisbon in person to hear discussions and insights including sustainable finance, technological innovation, and the future of investment in Portugal. Noteworthy speakers will share their insights, providing attendees with valuable knowledge and strategic perspectives.</p>
<p><span>Report: Structural Trends Shaping Portugal's Economy and Growth</span></p>
<p>The report "Structural Trends Shaping Portugal's Economy and Growth," produced by the Centre for Applied Research (CEA) of the Universidade Cat&oacute;lica Portuguesa at the request of Euronext and AEM, highlights several key developments in Portugal's economic landscape. The report identifies five key economic sectors for their significant contribution to the economy, promising growth trends and supportive regulatory environments.</p>
<p><span>Healthcare:</span>&nbsp;Portugal&rsquo;s healthcare sector accounts for 11% of GDP, higher than the OECD average, indicating strength and potential. Private providers have a relevant presence in the market, which is highly fragmented, offering numerous opportunities for consolidation and efficiency improvements. Promising areas include biotechnology start-ups, care of the elderly, medical tourism, and veterinary care.</p>
<p><span>Energy:</span>&nbsp;The energy market in Portugal is undergoing significant transformation with a pioneering stance on renewable energy investments, led by Portuguese companies with a broad international footprint. The sector is driven by its focus on renewable energy and global transformation efforts, presenting ample opportunities for sustainable development. Investments in wind and solar energy projects, green hydrogen and lithium are particularly noteworthy, supported by a stable political environment and diverse market participants.</p>
<p><span>Real Estate and Tourism:</span>&nbsp;Portugal's real estate and tourism sectors are thriving, with substantial growth in inward foreign investment. The country's strategic location, high quality of life and competitive property prices make it an attractive destination for real estate investments. The tourism industry, backed by a rich cultural heritage and innovative practice, offers opportunities in asset management, sustainable tourism, and the development of diverse entertainment experiences.</p>
<p><span>Agriculture and Forestry:</span>&nbsp;The agricultural and forestry sectors in Portugal benefit from favourable climate conditions, strategic location, and a commitment to sustainability. These sectors contribute significantly to the economy, with agricultural exports growing by 45% between 2018 and 2022. Key investment opportunities lie in advanced agricultural technologies, sustainable forestry management, and the production of higher-value products like wine, olive oil, and horticultural goods.</p>
<p><span>Infrastructure:</span>&nbsp;Portugal's strategic geographic location at the crossroads of important maritime and air routes linking Europe with other continents gives it a unique advantage, making it an attractive destination for infrastructure investments. Since joining the European Union (EU), the Portuguese government has demonstrated a proactive approach to improving infrastructure, facilitated by a combination of public funding and private investment. These efforts are geared towards modernising existing infrastructure, developing new assets to meet future demands, and ultimately driving socio-economic development. Future key investment areas will be rail transport, ports, airports, water and cultural infrastructure. Portugal is becoming a hub for technological innovation and start-ups. The public support for tech initiatives, coupled with a skilled workforce and favourable business environment, fosters a dynamic ecosystem for technology companies. Growth opportunities are abundant in areas such as digital transformation, fintech, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity.</p>
<p><span>Isabel Ucha, CEO of Euronext Lisbon and member of the Managing Board of Euronext N.V.,</span>&nbsp;said: &ldquo;<em>Organising the Portugal Capital Markets Day has been a proud achievement for us. This initiative is testament to the breadth of opportunities within the Portuguese economy and a crucial step towards highlighting our potential on the global stage. We are not only showcasing the strength of our current industries but also looking ahead to areas where Portugal can significantly enhance its competitiveness, while looking at the role that capital markets can perform in meeting financing needs.

<p><span>Miguel Athayde Marques, Chairman of the Board of Directors of AEM,</span>&nbsp;said: &ldquo;The&nbsp;<em>Portugal Capital Markets Day successfully fills a critical gap and the one-on-one meetings form a vital roadshow for Portuguese companies.

<div> progressing, delivery, CHESS replacement, phased implementation, industry consultation
Summary: ASX is progressing with the delivery of the CHESS replacement project in two phases, with strong industry support for the proposed approach.<br /><br /> <div>
<p>ASX confirms it is progressing with the targeted delivery of the first phase of the CHESS replacement project in 2026, as previously announced in November 2023. This comes as ASX today released its <a href="https://www.asx.com.au/content/dam/asx/markets/clearing-and-settlement-services/asx-response-chess-replacement-consultation-paper.pdf">response to feedback</a><a href="https://www.asx.com.au/content/dam/asx/markets/clearing-and-settlement-services/asx-response-chess-replacement-consultation-paper.pdf"> </a>received on the proposed two stage approach to implementation and the scope and design for delivery of clearing services (Release 1).&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>ASX Group Executive, Securities and Payments, Clive Triance,</b> said: &ldquo;The completion of the first of two key industry consultations on CHESS replacement is a notable milestone and the strong support we received for our initial proposals reflect the detailed engagement and consultation undertaken in the reassessment of the solution design.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The majority of respondents support a staged implementation of the CHESS replacement system and ASX intends to proceed with its overarching approach of implementing CHESS replacement across two main releases, with Release 1 delivering the clearing services and Release 2 focused on settlement and subregister functionality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This delivers a level of certainty over the first phase of the timeline of the project,&rdquo; Mr Triance said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are pleased at the engagement from the industry on this consultation and would like to thank stakeholders for providing their feedback.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Release 1 go-live date will be set with industry stakeholders as part of finalising the Release 1 Cutover and Migration Approach documentation, targeted for publication in Q2 2025.</p>
<p>ASX will release Consultation Paper 2 &ndash; which focuses on the settlement and subregister functionality &ndash; in August 2024.&nbsp;</p>

Summary: DMO and DOD issued a no-action letter for the transition of swap reporting obligations from CDOR to CORRA under ISDA LIBOR fallback provisions. <br /><br /> <div>
<p><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission&rsquo;s Division of Market Oversight (DMO) and Division of Data (DOD) today issued a staff no-action letter regarding certain Part 43 and Part 45 swap reporting obligations for swaps transitioning under the ISDA LIBOR fallback provisions from referencing the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR), to referencing the risk-free Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average (CORRA) following the cessation of CDOR after June 28, 2024.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The letter states DMO and DOD will not recommend the CFTC take enforcement action against an entity for failure to timely report under Part 45 the change in a swap&rsquo;s floating rate. This letter covers those floating rate changes that are made under the ISDA LIBOR fallback provisions from CDOR to CORRA, but only in the event the entity uses its best efforts to report the change by the applicable deadline in Part 45 and in no case reports the required information later than five business days from, but excluding, July 2, 2024.</span></span></p>

<div> survey, SIFMA, economists, rate cuts, GDP growth
<br />
Economists expect 2 rate cuts in 2024, with an expected real GDP growth of 1.6% this year. Inflation, labor market, and economic outlook also discussed.
<br /><br />Summary: 
Economists foresee 2 rate cuts in 2024, predict 1.6% GDP growth, and expect 2.8% core PCE inflation by year-end. <div>
<p>SIFMA today unveiled the results of its biannual&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sifma.org/resources/research/us-economic-survey-mid-year-2024/">US Economic Survey: Mid-Year 2024</a>.</p>
<p>This survey compiles the median economic forecast from the chief U.S. economists from over 20 global and regional financial institutions that make up the SIFMA Economist Roundtable. It includes expectations for key economic metrics and policy moves, including key findings such as the expectation of 2 rate cuts in 2024 and an expected real GDP growth of 1.6% this year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As we reach the midpoint of the year, our survey results found a generally upbeat near-term outlook for the U.S. economy,&rdquo; said Jay Bryson, Ph.D., Chair of the SIFMA Economist Roundtable. &ldquo;Despite some challenges, such as inflation and monetary policy concerns, our findings suggest a path towards sustained growth and stability, with expectations of a &lsquo;soft landing&rsquo; and gradual easing of policy in the near future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Key Takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Inflation &amp; Monetary Policy:</span>&nbsp;The majority of our economists expect 2 rate cuts in 2024 and 4 rate cuts in 2025. Over 50% of our economists expect 100-175 bps of cuts by 4Q25. Over 50% of survey respondents expect a rate cut in September, followed by around two-thirds in November and over 85% in December. However, around 14% of our economists expect no rate cut in 2024.</li>
<li><span>Economic Outlook:</span>&nbsp;Core PCE estimated to end 2024 at +2.8%; +0.4 pps from the last full survey in December 2023, +0.3 pps from the March 2024 flash poll. The top factor to core inflation estimates is wage growth. Averaging 4.2% in 2024, wage growth remains 1.2 pps above the three-year pre-COVID average.</li>
<li><span>Labor Market:</span>&nbsp;Real GDP growth estimated at +1.6% in 2024 and +2.0% in 2025; +0.9 pps from our last full survey in December 2023 but no change from our flash poll in March 2024. Over 80% of our economists put the probability of recession from 0% to 30%. As to factors impacting U.S. economic growth, monetary policy &ndash; unsurprisingly &ndash; came in on top. This factor also shows up near the top in both upside and downside risks to the economy.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div> amend, event contract rules, CFTC Regulation 40.11, public comment, proposal <br />
The CFTC extends the public comment deadline for amending event contract rules, defining "gaming," and prohibiting contracts on specific activities.<br />
Summary: The CFTC is extending the deadline for public comment on a proposal to amend its event contract rules, including defining "gaming" and prohibiting certain contracts. <div>
<p><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced it is extending the deadline for public comment on a proposal to amend its event contract rules. The extended comment period will close on August 8, 2024. The CFTC is providing an extension to allow interested persons additional time to analyze the proposal and prepare their comments.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The proposal would amend CFTC Regulation 40.11 to further specify types of event contracts that fall within the scope of Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) Section 5c(c)(5)(C) and are contrary to the public interest, such that they may not be listed for trading or accepted for clearing on or through a CFTC-registered entity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Among other things, the proposal would define the term &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; for purposes of CEA Section 5c(c)(5)(C) and CFTC Regulation 40.11, and would provide illustrative examples of &ldquo;gaming,&rdquo; such as staking or risking something of value on the outcome of a political contest, an awards contest, or a game in which one or more athletes compete, or on an occurrence or non-occurrence in connection with such a contest or game. The proposal would also include a determination that event contracts involving each of the activities enumerated in CEA Section 5c(c)(5)(C) (gaming, war, terrorism, assassination, and activity that is unlawful under any Federal or State law) are, as a category, contrary to the public interest and therefore may not be listed for trading or accepted for clearing on or through a CFTC-registered entity.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The proposal was approved by the CFTC, and published on its website, on May 10, 2024, and was made available for public comment for a period of 60 days, until July 9, 2024. [See CFTC Press Release No.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8907-24">8907-24</a>] The proposal was published in the Federal Register on June 10, 2024.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Comments may be submitted electronically through the&nbsp;<a href="https://comments.cftc.gov/PublicComments/ReleasesWithComments.aspx">CFTC Comments online process</a>. All comments received will be posted on <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/">CFTC.gov</a>.</span></span></p>

<title>Brief Remarks On The Economy, Monetary Policy, And Bank Regulation, Federal Reserve Governor Michelle W. Bowman, At The Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, And Washington Bankers Associations 2024 Annual Convention, Stevenson, Washington</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Regulatory Approvals, Bank Mergers, Monetary Policy, Economy, De Novo Bank Formation <br />
<br />Summary: Michelle Bowman discusses the economy, monetary policy, regulatory approvals, de novo bank formation, and bank mergers and acquisitions, sharing her views and concerns. <div>
<p>I would like to thank the Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington Bankers Associations for the invitation to join you this morning.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240627a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;It's a pleasure to be here in Washington State to speak with your members. Direct interactions like this, outside of Washington, D.C., enable me to develop a deeper understanding of what is happening in the banking industry and the regional economy. Before sharing some thoughts about the current trajectory of regulatory approvals and bank merger policy, I will discuss my views on the economy and monetary policy.</p>
<p><strong>Update on the Economy and Monetary Policy Outlook</strong><br />Over the past two years, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy to address high inflation. At our meeting earlier this month, the FOMC voted to continue to hold the federal funds rate target range at 5-1/4 to 5‑1/2 percent and to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve's securities holdings.</p>
<p>After seeing considerable progress on slowing inflation last year, we have seen only modest further progress this year. The 12-month measures of total and core personal consumption expenditures inflation have moved roughly sideways or slightly down since December and remained elevated at 2.7 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively, in April. The consumer price index (CPI) report for May showed 12-month core CPI inflation slowing to 3.4 percent from 3.6 percent in April. However, with average core CPI inflation this year through May running at an annualized rate of 3.8 percent, notably above average inflation in the second half of last year, I expect inflation to remain elevated for some time.</p>
<p>The recent pickup in inflation in the first several months of 2024 was evident across many goods and services categories, suggesting that inflation was temporarily lower in the latter half of last year. Prices continue to be much higher than before the pandemic, which is weighing on consumer sentiment. Inflation has hit lower-income households hardest since food, energy, and housing services price increases far outpaced overall inflation throughout this episode.</p>
<p>Economic activity increased at a strong pace last year but appears to have moderated early this year. First-quarter gross domestic product growth was slower than in the second half of last year, though private domestic final purchases continued to rise at a solid pace. Continued softness in consumer spending and weaker housing activity early in the second quarter also suggest less momentum in economic activity so far this year.</p>
<p>Payroll employment continued to rise at a solid pace in April and May, though slightly slower than in the first quarter, partly reflecting increased immigrant labor supply. Despite some further rebalancing between supply and demand, the labor market remains tight. The unemployment rate edged up to 4.0 percent in May, while the number of job openings relative to unemployed workers declined further to near its pre-pandemic level. Labor force participation dropped back to 62.5 percent in May, which suggests no further improvement in labor supply along this margin, as labor force participation among those aged 55 or older has been persistently low.</p>
<p>At its current setting, our monetary policy stance appears to be restrictive, and I will continue to monitor the incoming data to assess whether monetary policy is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to our target. As I've noted recently, my baseline outlook continues to be that inflation will decline further with the policy rate held steady. And should the incoming data indicate that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2 percent goal, it will eventually become appropriate to gradually lower the federal funds rate to prevent monetary policy from becoming overly restrictive. However, we are still not yet at the point where it is appropriate to lower the policy rate, and I continue to see a number of upside risks to inflation.</p>
<p>First, much of the progress on inflation last year was due to supply-side improvements, including easing of supply chain constraints; increases in the number of available workers, due in part to immigration; and lower energy prices. It is unlikely that further improvements along this margin will continue to lower inflation going forward, as supply chains have largely normalized, the labor force participation rate has leveled off in recent months below pre-pandemic levels, and an open U.S. immigration policy over the past few years, which added millions of new immigrants in the U.S., may become more restrictive.</p>
<p>Geopolitical developments could also pose upside risks to inflation, including the risk that spillovers from regional conflicts could disrupt global supply chains, putting additional upward pressure on food, energy, and commodity prices. There is also the risk that the loosening in financial conditions since late last year, reflecting considerable gains in equity valuations, and additional fiscal stimulus could add momentum to demand, stalling any further progress or even causing inflation to reaccelerate.</p>
<p>Finally, there is a risk that increased immigration and continued labor market tightness could lead to persistently high core services inflation. Given the current low inventory of affordable housing, the inflow of new immigrants to some geographic areas could result in upward pressure on rents, as additional housing supply may take time to materialize. With labor markets remaining tight, wage growth has been elevated at around or above 4 percent, still higher than the pace consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal given trend productivity growth.</p>
<p>In light of these risks, and the general uncertainty regarding the economic outlook, I will continue to watch the data closely as I assess the appropriate path of monetary policy. The frequency and extent of data revisions over the past few years make the task of assessing the current state of the economy and predicting how the economy will evolve even more challenging. I will remain cautious in my approach to considering future changes in the stance of policy.</p>
<p>It is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. In my view, we should consider a range of possible scenarios that could unfold when considering how the FOMC's monetary policy decisions may evolve. My colleagues and I will make our decisions at each FOMC meeting based on the incoming data and the implications for and risks to the outlook. While the current stance of monetary policy appears to be at a restrictive level, I remain willing to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at a future meeting should the incoming data indicate that progress on inflation has stalled or reversed. Restoring price stability is essential for achieving maximum employment over the longer run.</p>
<p><strong>Regulatory Approvals in the Banking System</strong><br />Before turning directly to regulatory approvals in the banking system and merger and acquisition policy, it is important to consider these issues in the broader context. Regulatory approvals and bank mergers and acquisitions do not occur in a vacuum. The choices that regulators make on regulatory and supervisory policy issues have profound implications for mergers and acquisitions and for the appetite of bank management to engage in those transactions. In recent months, the banking agencies have issued or finalized a large number of regulatory changes. These changes are shaping the future of the banking system. From bank capital requirements to liquidity reform, significant revisions to the Community Reinvestment Act, a regulatory attack on banks charging fees for services (including debit card interchange fees), the trend of dialing supervision up to "11" for banks of all sizes, and the ongoing erosion of tailoring all shape the contours of the banking system, including bank size, the activities in which they engage, and where activities occur within the broader financial system.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240627a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;These policy decisions also create incentives and impacts that we must acknowledge and understand. When policymakers flatten and standardize regulations and supervisory expectations, we create strong incentives for banks to achieve greater economies of scale through merger and make it harder for new banks to successfully compete with existing banks.</p>
<p>Actually implementing clear merger standards would reduce the number of necessary application denials and withdrawals. Where clear standards exist, those seeking regulatory approval will only file for approval of those transactions that will meet the banking agency standards. In my mind, this would be responsible and effective public policy.</p>
<p><strong>De Novo Bank Formation</strong><br />I continue to be concerned about the decline in the number of banks in the U.S. As I have noted in the past, there are several indications that there is an unmet demand for new bank creation demonstrated by the ongoing preference for "charter strip" acquisitions, the ongoing shift of activities out of the banking system, and the rising demand for banking-as-a-service partnerships.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240627a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a></p>
<p>For the past decade, de novo bank formation has been largely stagnant, even as the banking industry has rapidly evolved over the same time. Many factors influence the pursuit of de novo bank charters, including the interest rate environment, business opportunities, the intense competition for qualified bank management and staff, and potentially less onerous alternatives for financial services to be provided outside of the regulated banking system.</p>
<p>The decision to form a de novo bank is also informed by normal business considerations, including identifying investors, establishing a viable business plan, and ensuring the ability to navigate the "start-up" phase of a new bank and manage upfront operational costs, all while being subjected to intense supervisory oversight over the first several years of operation. Yet perhaps the most important factor that influences de novo bank formation is the regulatory and supervisory framework. This includes the application process and receipt of regulatory approval.</p>
<p>This application process can be a significant obstacle to de novo bank formation. Applications often experience significant delays between the initial charter application filing with the chartering authority and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation application for deposit insurance. It often takes well in excess of a year to receive all of the required regulatory approvals to open for business. Of course, this uncertainty remains after the initial capital has been raised, shareholders identified, and a management team is ready to begin work. These delays present unique challenges for de novo founders, including incurrence of more start-up expenses, difficulty recruiting and retaining qualified management to obtain approval, and challenges in raising additional start-up capital investment.</p>
<p>In my view, the absence of de novo bank formation over the long run will create a void in the banking system, a void that could contribute to a decline in the availability of reliable and fairly priced credit, the absence of financial services in underserved markets, and the continued shift of banking activities outside the banking system.</p>
<p><strong>Bank Mergers and Acquisitions</strong><br />Another pressing area of concern is the rapidly shifting approach to bank mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) by some prudential regulators.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240627a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;M&amp;A transactions allow banks to evolve and thrive in our dynamic banking system and can promote the long-term health and viability of banks. M&amp;A also ensures that banks have a meaningful path to transitioning bank ownership. The absence of a viable M&amp;A framework increases the potential for additional risks, including limited opportunities for succession planning, especially in smaller or rural communities, and zombie banks that continue to exist but have no competitive viability or exit strategy.</p>
<p>The impact of a more restrictive M&amp;A framework affects institutions of all sizes, including larger institutions that are vying to compete with the very largest global systemically important banks. They may choose to pursue M&amp;A to remain competitive with larger peers who can achieve growth organically through sheer scale.</p>
<p>M&amp;A is an important part of a healthy banking system. So when considering changes to the framework, I think we need to first identify the problem that needs to be solved and then ask whether any proposed solution is fair, transparent, and consistent with applicable statutes&mdash;and, critically, whether the proposed solution has the potential to damage the long-term viability of the banking system.</p>
<p>Are there identified shortcomings in the current process or standards, and are the proposed reforms targeted and effective to address these shortcomings? One argument I have heard about the M&amp;A regulatory approval process is that the lack of application&nbsp;<em>denials&nbsp;</em>demonstrates that regulators are failing to meaningfully review and pressure-test proposals and have effectively become a rubber stamp. I think this argument lacks a strong foundation. There is ample evidence that undermines this argument, including the resource demands on institutions pursuing M&amp;A activity and the extended time it takes to complete the regulatory review and approval process (and the not insignificant failure rate we see represented in withdrawn applications).</p>
<p>We also have to acknowledge that choosing the path of a merger or acquisition is not undertaken lightly. These transactions require significant upfront and ongoing investment and commitment of resources. At the outset, this includes finding an appropriate acquisition target, conducting due diligence, and negotiating the terms of the transaction. Once a target is identified, the banks must prepare appropriate regulatory filings, engage with regulators during the application process, and prepare for post-approval business processes, including scheduling necessary and costly systems conversions and customer transition. This is an expensive and reputationally risky process that bankers and their boards of directors take extremely seriously.</p>
<p>One would also expect to see different patterns emerging if regulators were truly acting as a rubber stamp for banking applications. We know from data published by the Federal Reserve that filing an application does not guarantee approval, even in the absence of a regulatory denial. The Federal Reserve's most recent report on banking applications activity identifies a significant portion of bank M&amp;A transactions in which applications have been withdrawn.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240627a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a></p>
<p>The processing timelines we see also seem inconsistent with a process that is operating truly as a rubber stamp. To be clear, I think we have room to do better when it comes to timely regulatory action, while maintaining a rigorous review of applications. But extended review periods are not uncommon, particularly when you include preliminary discussions and pre-filings with regulators in the published processing timelines.</p>
<p>Some contemplated regulatory reform efforts will likely make the M&amp;A application process slower and less efficient. One of the key risks to an effective process is a lack of timely regulatory action. The consequences of delays can significantly harm both the acquiring institution and the target, causing greater operational risk (including the risk of a failed merger), increased expenses, reputational risk, and staff attrition in the face of prolonged uncertainty.</p>
<p>Reducing the efficiency of bank M&amp;A can be a deterrent to healthy bank transactions. This inefficiency limits activity that ensures the value of community banks located in underserved areas, prevents institutions from pursuing prudent growth strategies, and undermines competition by preventing firms from growing to a larger scale, effectively creating a "protected class" of larger institutions.</p>
<p>At the same time some federal regulatory agencies are imposing more onerous requirements, credit unions have increased their acquisitions of banks.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240627a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;While this could solve some succession planning concerns, it is not clear how these acquisitions will ultimately impact the banking system going forward. Could these acquisitions reduce the availability of certain products and services? Will these institutions have the same incentives to serve all of the consumers in a particular community? If there are fewer banks and more credit unions, how will this data impact the competitive analysis of traditional banks merging? Historically, credit unions have had limited membership requirements and have not engaged in the same wide range of activities as banks. But in recent years, their memberships have expanded, and they are offering more of the same products and services that banks provide. Yet, unlike banks, credit unions are not required to meet the requirements of the Community Reinvestment Act or other laws that apply to banks. As some prudential regulators continue to increase the regulatory scrutiny of bank M&amp;A, it may increase the incentives for credit unions to acquire banks if there are fewer delays and more regulatory certainty related to those transactions.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the past year has shown that regulatory attention is increasingly focused on other issues, with the timeliness of processing regulatory applications by banking regulators appearing to be lower on the list of priorities.</p>
<p><strong>Closing Thoughts</strong><br />The bank regulatory reform agenda has many implications for banks of all sizes. As regulators continue to propose and make changes to the regulatory and supervisory processes, it is vital that policymakers understand the tradeoffs between the costs and benefits of what they are changing. It is equally important that policymakers also understand the unintended consequences of their decisions. While some of the proposed changes may be designed to address particular issues, they will have broader follow-on consequences. Because of these potentially broader consequences, we must address policy from a holistic perspective rather than in a piecemeal fashion. One way to better understand the outcomes of our decisions is to hear directly from you and other stakeholders about the specific impacts&mdash;intended and unintended&mdash;of changes to the bank regulatory framework. Your feedback helps us to understand the real-world impacts of regulatory and supervisory reforms.</p>
<p>Thank you, and I look forward to discussing these and other important issues with you today.</p>

<div> Opinion, Consob, Securitisation Regulation, collateral, EBA <br />
Summary: The EBA has provided an opinion to Consob regarding the permission granted for high-quality collateral in on-balance-sheet securitisations, based on evidence and legal basis. Regular reviews will be conducted by Consob. <div>
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published an Opinion addressed to Consob, the Italian Securities Commission, in response to the Competent Authority&rsquo;s notification of its decision to grant the permission referred to in Article 26e(10) of the Securitisation Regulation, which specifies the eligibility criteria for high-quality collateral for on-balance-sheet securitisations to qualify as Simple, Transparent, and Standardised (STS).</span></p>
<p>The EBA has assessed the evidence provided by the Consob, namely the current classification of Italian credit institutions and the composition of the Italian synthetic securitisation market. On the basis of the evidence provided, the EBA is of the opinion that due to the objective impediments related to the credit quality step (CQS) assigned to Italy, the use of a partial waiver to allow collateral&nbsp;in the form of cash on deposit with the originator, or one of its affiliates, qualifying for CQS 3 is justified.</p>
<h4>Legal basis, background, and next steps</h4>
<p>The EBA&rsquo;s competence to deliver this Opinion is based on Article 29(1)(a) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010. In accordance with the process set forth in Decision of the European Banking Authority EBA/DC/462 , the Opinion has been adopted.</p>
<p>Article 26e(10) of the Securitisation Regulation (EU) No 2017/2402 specifies that the credit protection provided in on-balance-sheet securitisations must meet high-quality collateral standards. By way of derogation, if certain conditions are met, the originator may use high-quality collateral in the form of cash on deposit with the originator or its affiliates, provided they qualify for at least CQS 2. Competent authorities may, under specific conditions and after consulting the EBA, permit collateral in the form of cash on deposit with the originator or its affiliates if they qualify for CQS 3.</p>
<p>Consob will regularly review the conditions of the waiver and appropriate measures will be taken if the impediments cease to exist.</p>

<div> survey, Canadian Securities Administrators, social media, investment fraud, financial advisor
Summary:
More Canadians using social media for investment. More DIY investors. Decrease in investors with financial advisors. Increased investment fraud among younger investors. Regular survey tracks investor behavior. 
Summary: <div>
<p>A national survey commissioned by the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) found that 23 per cent of Canadians report encountering possible fraudulent investments, an increase of five percentage points since 2020.&nbsp;<br /><br />&ldquo;How Canadians research and manage their investments continues to change, with more investors seeking information from social media and turning to do-it-yourself (DIY) investing,&rdquo; said Stan Magidson, CSA Chair and CEO of the Alberta Securities Commission. &ldquo;Surveying investor behaviour on a regular basis allows the CSA and its member jurisdictions to enhance existing investor education tools and develop targeted new programs to help Canadians invest wisely and avoid fraud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/investor-tools/investing-basics/research/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2024 CSA Investor Index</a>&nbsp;provides valuable insight into Canadian investing trends and fraud in an ever-evolving financial landscape. The long-running survey, first published in 2006, tracks key measurements, including investor behaviour, knowledge, confidence, attitudes towards risk, and incidences of investment fraud.&nbsp;</p>
<p>More findings include:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>More Canadians are using social media for investment information:</strong>&nbsp;Investors who use social media for investment information increased 18 per cent since 2020 to 53 per cent. Notably, 82 per cent of 18- to 24-year-old investors use social media, with YouTube, Instagram and TikTok being the most popular choices in this age group. Moreover, 46 per cent of Canadians report encountering investment opportunities on social media, which is a 17 per cent increase from 2020, and is also especially common among younger age groups.</li>
<li><strong>Nearly half of investors say they DIY invest:&nbsp;</strong>Forty-five per cent of investors say they have a self-directed account, and 30 per cent of these DIY investors first opened that account within the last two years.</li>
<li><strong>Fewer investors report having a financial advisor in 2024:&nbsp;</strong>Sixty-one per cent of investors said they currently work with a financial advisor, down eight per cent from 2020. The largest drop was for investors under the age of 45 and those with portfolios less than $100,000.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Investment fraud trends upward for younger investors:&nbsp;</strong>While investment fraud has decreased in older demographics since 2006, reported fraud doubled with almost all other age groups.&nbsp; Younger investors 18-24 years old saw the highest reported increase from 0.4% to 5%.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 2024 CSA Investor Index survey was conducted in March 2024 by Innovative Research Group. It consisted of a representative sample of 7,215 Canadian adults, weighted by age, gender, province, and education using 2021 Statistics Canada census data to reflect the actual demographic composition of the population. Additionally, weighting targets were set by investment portfolio size and type of investment accounts, using data from Statistics Canada&rsquo;s Survey of Financial Security, to accurately reflect the population of Canadian investors within the sample.</p>
<p>The 2024 CSA Investor Index is available on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/investor-tools/investing-basics/research/">CSA website</a>.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CSA website</a>&nbsp;has a variety of tools and resources to help investors avoid fraud and verify the registration of any individual, firm or platform they plan to work with. Canadian investors are encouraged to visit the site to learn more about making informed investment decisions.<br /><br />The CSA, the council of the securities regulators of Canada&rsquo;s provinces and territories, co-ordinates and harmonizes regulation for the Canadian capital markets.&nbsp;</p>

<div> Regulatory development, EMIR Refit, derivatives market, reporting standards, DTCC
Summary:
EMIR Refit implemented in the EU and UK with unique challenges and opportunities. DTCC supports seamless transition, standardized reporting formats, and improved market integrity. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>EMIR Refit took effect in the EU derivatives market on April 29th and will be implemented in the UK on September 30th, five months later.</p>
<p>Commenting on this regulatory development, Syed Ali, Managing Director of Repository &amp; Derivatives Services at DTCC, said:</p>
<p><i><span>"As the financial services industry prepares&nbsp;</span><span class="mark5cawqhw55"><span>for</span></span></i><i><span>&nbsp;the upcoming implementation of the UK EMIR Refit on 30 September 2024, DTCC remains committed to ensuring a seamless transition&nbsp;</span><span class="mark5cawqhw55"><span>for</span></span></i><i><span>&nbsp;all market participants. The UK EMIR Refit represents a divergence from the EU EMIR reporting regime, with unique challenges and opportunities&nbsp;</span><span class="mark5cawqhw55"><span>for</span></span></i><i><span>&nbsp;those reporting under both jurisdictions.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span>We recognize the complexities introduced by these new regulations, particularly the shift to standardized ISO 20022 XML reporting&nbsp;</span><span class="mark5cawqhw55"><span>for</span></span></i><i><span>mats, increased reporting fields, and the mandatory use of Unique Product Identifiers (UPIs) and Unique Trade Identifiers (UTIs). We are currently in a five-month period where entities need to navigate dual reporting requirements under both the old UK EMIR and the new EU EMIR standards. DTCC has been actively engaging with clients to provide the necessary tools and support to navigate this period. We have been conducting extensive outreach, including roundtables and testing sessions, to ensure our clients are fully prepared&nbsp;</span><span class="mark5cawqhw55"><span>for</span></span></i><i><span>&nbsp;the new regulatory requirements.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span>The UK EMIR Refit is a significant step towards a more robust and transparent derivatives market. The increased standardization of data fields and&nbsp;</span><span class="mark5cawqhw55"><span>for</span></span></i><i><span>mats will enable better data aggregation and risk analysis, ultimately improving market integrity and investor protections. At the same time, broader adoption of standard reporting&nbsp;</span><span class="mark5cawqhw55"><span>for</span></span></i><i><span>mats will increase interoperability and the efficiency of data exchange, reducing errors and speeding up processing times within the financial ecosystem. DTCC remains committed to supporting the industry through this important regulatory transition, fostering safer, more efficient, and transparent&nbsp;<span class="mark2v77xytur"><span>global</span></span>&nbsp;markets.&rdquo;</span></i></p>

<div> Blockchain, Iberclear, Eurosystem, DLT, digital tokens
Summary:<br />BME, through Iberclear, collaborates with Eurosystem for DLT experimentation with Spanish custodians and technical suppliers. Scheduled to end in November 2024. 
 <div>
<ul>
<li><span>BME, through Iberclear, has brought together part of the Spanish financial community and will contribute to the proposal its solution for the issuance and settlement of bonds with blockchain technology</span></li>
<li><span>The initiative will simulate settlement in Central Bank money issued under DLT technology</span></li>
<li><span>Iberpay and Deloitte will collaborate with BME in the program as technical suppliers</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BME, through Iberclear, has been admitted to the Eurosystem's exploratory work as a DLT market operator to conduct experiments on new technologies applicable to the settlement of wholesale operations in central bank money. After a first phase of experimentation already underway, on June 21, the ECB's Governing Council gave its approval for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/intro/news/html/ecb.mipnews240621.en.html">an additional group of participants</a>&nbsp;to test Distributed Logging Technology (DLT) for the settlement of trades in central bank money, as part of the experimentation program it is maintaining through 2024.</p>
<p>The proposal made by BME will allow to evaluate the integration of digital tokens (wholesale central bank digital currencies or wCDBC) during the different phases of the life cycle of a digital bond. This initiative has been supported by 10 large custodians, including CaixaBank, Cecabank, CACEIS Bank Spain, Kutxabank Investment Norbolsa, Banco Sabadell, Renta 4 Banco, BNP Paribas, Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale, Unicaja and Banco Cooperativo Espa&ntilde;ol. Iberpay, given its position and sectorial experience as a European payment system, and Deloitte will also collaborate in the initiative as technical suppliers. Both will contribute their experience, both in the financial sector and in DLT network projects. These two entities facilitate the activities of the custodians in the experimentation to increase the learning capacity that this initiative offers.</p>
<p>Jes&uacute;s Benito, Iberclear's CEO, explains that "participation in this experimentation program is a new demonstration of BME's innovative spirit, which is constantly seeking improvements through technologies such as blockchain, in order to continue to play a leading role in the digitization and modernization of the financial market. Additionally, it gives us the exceptional opportunity to experiment together with large Spanish custodians in the issuance and use of digital tokens in the Eurosystem. It is a unique opportunity to help our clients understand what these new technologies can bring to financial environments."</p>
<p>The Eurosystem's experimentation program is scheduled to end in November 2024, with subsequent publication of the findings.</p>

<div> framework, ISDA, derivatives, termination, collateralized <br />
Summary: <br />
ISDA has launched an interactive Close-out Framework to help firms prepare for potential termination of collateralized derivatives contracts in response to regulatory reforms and recent stress events. <div>
<p>ISDA has published a new interactive digital framework that market participants can use to help prepare for potential terminations of collateralized derivatives contracts.</p>
<p>Launch of the ISDA Close-out Framework is in response to the March 2023 failure of Signature Bank and SVB in the US, which highlighted the complexities of potentially terminating over-the-counter derivatives trading relationships following various post-crisis regulatory reforms. Specifically, in-scope entities are now required to post margin for non-cleared derivatives transactions, while various jurisdictions have introduced mandatory stays on termination rights and remedies as part of bank resolution regimes.</p>
<p>The ISDA Close-out Framework is intended to be used as a preparatory resource to help firms coordinate internal business functions and stakeholders and internal and external legal, operational, risk management, infrastructure and other relevant service providers to ensure they are adequately prepared for any potential future stress events.</p>
<p>The framework includes high-level analysis of the default mechanics and collateral enforcement provisions in ISDA documentation, along with additional commentary on bank resolution legislation in the US and Europe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Recent stress events have drummed home that terminating a portfolio of derivatives trades is now much more complex as a result of regulatory reforms. The introduction of mandatory margining and segregation requirements, alongside the implementation of bank resolution regimes, means firms need to be able to quickly respond to complex legal and operational issues that will require input from different teams across the organization. The ISDA Close-out Framework provides an essential interactive tool that firms can use to prepare ahead of any potential stress event,&rdquo; said Katherine Tew Darras, ISDA&rsquo;s General Counsel.</p>
<p>The ISDA Close-out Framework is available here:&nbsp;<a href="https://close-out.isda.org/#/">https://close-out.isda.org/#/</a>.</p>

<div> Interest rate, risk environment, financial market, global vulnerabilities, UK banking sector <br />
Summary: The Financial Policy Committee (FPC) assesses the UK financial system's resilience to various risks, including global vulnerabilities and market-based finance. It also monitors the UK banking sector's capacity to support households and businesses. The FPC maintains the UK countercyclical capital buffer rate and emphasizes the importance of improving transparency and risk management in the private equity sector. It also closes its Recommendations on LDI resilience and supports system-wide exploratory scenario exercises. The FPC encourages internationally coordinated policy reforms to address vulnerabilities in market-based finance. <div>
<h2>Financial Policy Summary, 2024 Q2</h2>
<p>The Financial Policy Committee (FPC) seeks to ensure the UK financial system is prepared for, and resilient to, the wide range of risks it could face &ndash; so that the system is able to absorb rather than amplify shocks and serve UK households and businesses.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The overall risk environment</h3>
<p><strong>The overall risk environment remains broadly unchanged from Q1. Markets continue to price mostly for a benign central case outlook, and some risk premia have tightened even further, despite the global risk environment facing several challenges. Some of these challenges have become more concerning and proximate.</strong></p>
<p>In aggregate, UK household and corporate borrowers have been resilient, although many remain under pressure. UK banks are in a strong position to support households and businesses, even if economic and financial conditions were substantially worse than expected.</p>
<p>The adjustment to the higher interest rate environment is continuing globally, including as businesses and households refinance their debt. Risks are crystalising in the US commercial real estate market and important vulnerabilities in market-based finance are yet to be addressed globally.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Developments in financial markets&nbsp;</h3>
<p><strong>The Monetary Policy Committee&rsquo;s (MPC&rsquo;s) central projection for UK GDP growth, unemployment and inflation has improved slightly further since Q1, and global growth is projected to rise in the medium term, although several risks to that outlook remain.&nbsp;</strong>Economic data news has pushed out market expectations on the timing of reductions in policy rates in the US and UK, although rate cuts have now begun in some jurisdictions. Markets responded to the announcement that French parliamentary elections would be held on 30 June and 7 July. For example, the spread between French and German 10-year government bond yields rose to its highest level since 2017.</p>
<p><strong>Risk premia on US equities have been compressed for some time but have also fallen across a range of other markets this year and are now very low by historic standards, including for more leveraged borrowers.&nbsp;</strong>While there is some evidence of investors demanding higher risk premia on small pockets of the riskiest bonds, the widespread overall compression of risk premia, in an uncertain risk environment, suggests that investors are continuing to put less weight on risks to the macroeconomic outlook. Valuations and risk premia are therefore vulnerable to a shift in risk appetite that could be triggered by factors including a weakening of growth prospects, more persistent inflation, or a further deterioration in geopolitical conditions.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Although financial market asset valuations have so far been robust to large increases in interest rates and recent geopolitical events, the adjustment to the higher interest rate environment is not yet complete and market prices remain vulnerable to a sharp correction.&nbsp;</strong>This could adversely affect the cost and availability of finance to the real economy via two main channels. First, a sharp market correction would make it more costly and difficult for corporates to refinance maturing debt, including by reducing the value of collateral. This is particularly relevant given the large proportion of leveraged lending and high-yield market-based corporate debt that is due to mature by the end of 2025. Second, it could interact with vulnerabilities in market-based finance, which may amplify the correction. For example, it may cause large losses for leveraged market participants, which could further reduce risk appetite, or it may lead to a spike in liquidity demand and a deterioration in the functioning of core markets.</p>
<h3>Global vulnerabilities</h3>
<p><strong>Global vulnerabilities remain material.</strong>&nbsp;US commercial real estate (CRE) borrowers have significant short-term refinancing needs and a number of overseas banks with large exposures to CRE, in the US and other jurisdictions, experienced significant falls in their equity prices earlier in the year. Stresses in global CRE markets could affect UK financial stability through several channels, including a reduction in overseas finance for the UK CRE sector.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Policy uncertainty associated with upcoming elections globally has increased.</strong>&nbsp;This could make the global economic outlook less certain and lead to financial market volatility. It could also increase existing sovereign debt pressures, geopolitical risks, and risks associated with global fragmentation, all of which are relevant to UK financial stability.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>UK household and corporate debt vulnerabilities</h3>
<p><strong>In the context of strong nominal household income growth and continued low unemployment, the aggregate UK household debt to income ratio has continued to fall. That said, many UK households, including renters, remain under pressure from higher living costs and higher interest rates.</strong>&nbsp;The share of households spending a high proportion of their available income servicing their mortgages is expected to increase slightly over the next two years, but it is likely to remain well below pre-global financial crisis (GFC) levels. Mortgage arrears remain low by historical standards and are expected to remain well below their previous peaks.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Aggregate measures of UK corporate debt vulnerability have fallen further and corporates are likely to remain broadly resilient to the current economic outlook, including high interest rates. But there remain pockets of vulnerability among highly leveraged corporates.</strong>&nbsp;Despite strong issuance so far in 2024, a significant portion of market-based corporate debt is due to mature in the coming years, so risks associated with the need to refinance at higher interest rates remain. The most highly leveraged and lowest rated corporates, including those backed by private equity, are likely to be more exposed to this risk.</p>
<h3>Private equity</h3>
<p><strong>The private equity (PE) sector grew rapidly during the period of low interest rates and plays a significant role in financing UK businesses.&nbsp;</strong>The long-term nature of capital investments into PE allows and incentivises fund managers to act less cyclically, which can reduce the volatility of financing flows in macroeconomic downturns.&nbsp;<strong>However, the widespread use of leverage within PE firms and their portfolio companies makes them particularly exposed to tighter financing conditions.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Although the sector has been resilient so far, it is facing challenges in the higher rate environment. These manifest in refinancing risk as debt matures, and an increased drag on performance from higher financing costs.&nbsp;</strong>Vulnerabilities from high leverage, opacity around valuations, and strong interconnections with riskier credit markets mean the sector has the potential to generate losses for banks and institutional investors, and cause market spillovers to highly correlated and interconnected markets such as leveraged loans and private credit &ndash; all of which could reduce investor confidence, further tightening financing conditions for businesses. Disruptions in international PE markets could also spill over to the UK, particularly from US markets given their size and importance, and because the majority of PE funds backing UK corporates are based in the US.</p>
<p><strong>Improved transparency over valuation practices and overall levels of leverage would help to reduce the vulnerabilities in the sector. Risk management practices in some parts of the sector also need to improve, including among lenders to the sector such as banks. The FPC will consider the outcome of regulatory work by the Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority to address some of these issues.&nbsp;</strong>Because of the interconnections between PE markets in different jurisdictions, international co-ordination will be important.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>UK banking sector resilience</h3>
<p><strong>The UK banking system has the capacity to support households and businesses, even if economic and financial conditions were to be substantially worse than expected.</strong>&nbsp;The UK banking system is well capitalised and UK banks maintain strong liquidity positions. The return on equity of major UK banks in aggregate has risen to around their cost of equity, and asset quality remains strong.</p>
<p><strong>The FPC judges that changes in credit conditions overall reflect changes to the macroeconomic outlook.</strong>&nbsp;Mortgage approvals have risen, in part in response to a fall in quoted mortgage rates since last summer. Overall credit conditions for corporates have remained broadly unchanged since the start of the year.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A number of system-wide factors are likely to affect bank funding and liquidity in the coming years, including as central banks normalise their balance sheets as the extraordinary measures put in place following the GFC and the Covid pandemic are unwound.&nbsp;</strong>The Bank of England is unwinding its holdings in its Asset Purchase Facility, as determined by the MPC, and the Term Funding Scheme with additional incentives for SMEs is coming to an end.<strong>&nbsp;It is important that banks factor these system-wide trends into their liquidity management and forward planning over the coming years.</strong>&nbsp;Banks have a number of ways in which they can manage their funding and liquidity, including use of the Bank of England&rsquo;s facilities, such as the Short-Term Repo and Indexed Long-Term Repo facilities.</p>
<h3>The UK countercyclical capital buffer rate decision</h3>
<p><strong>The FPC is maintaining the UK countercyclical capital buffer (CcyB) rate at its neutral setting of 2%.</strong>&nbsp;The FPC will continue to monitor developments closely and stands ready to vary the UK CcyB rate, in either direction, in line with the evolution of economic and financial conditions, underlying vulnerabilities, and the overall risk environment. The Bank&rsquo;s 2024 desk-based stress test will further inform the FPC&rsquo;s assessment of the resilience of the UK banking system to downside risks.</p>
<h3>The resilience of market-based finance</h3>
<p><strong>There remain important vulnerabilities in market-based finance that the FPC has previously identified. In particular, leveraged positions, which have been a driver of a number of recent stress events, appear to be increasing among hedge funds.</strong>&nbsp;The work of international and domestic regulators to develop appropriate policy responses to address the risks of excessive leverage is therefore important.&nbsp;<strong>The FPC supports the Financial Stability Board&rsquo;s international work programme on leverage in non-bank financial institutions, and encourages authorities globally to take action to reduce the vulnerabilities through internationally co-ordinated policy reforms.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Given the significant progress made on liability-driven investment (LDI) fund resilience across domestic and international authorities over the past 18 months, the FPC has closed its November 2022 and March 2023 Recommendations on LDI resilience.</strong>&nbsp;Its March 2023 Recommendation that The Pensions Regulator should have the remit to take into account financial stability considerations in its work on a continuing basis remains in place.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The FPC welcomes the launch of the second round of the Bank&rsquo;s system-wide exploratory scenario (SWES) exercise.</strong>&nbsp;In the first round, the hypothetical SWES scenario led most participating non-bank financial institutions to report significant liquidity needs from margin calls. Many participants started the scenario with greater resilience than they had at the onset of recent market shocks. For example, the current level of resilience of money market funds is well above existing minimum requirements. This is also in part the result of recent regulatory actions, such as the LDI resilience standard recommended by the FPC. Participants therefore expected those liquidity needs could be mostly met by pledging assets. However, participants&rsquo; responses also implied that terms in the sterling repo market would tighten, and that there would be selling pressure in the sterling corporate bond market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the second round, the Bank is exploring the assumptions underpinning participants&rsquo; actions and how different assumptions might alter actions taken and lead to different outcomes in markets.&nbsp;<strong>The analysis has already provided important insights which demonstrate the value of system-wide exercises. The overall results of the exercise will be published in 2024 Q4.</strong></p>

<div> DFSA, Liquidity Profile, DIFC, Thematic Review, Financial Regulation
Summary:
The DFSA published a report on liquidity management, highlighting key findings and best practices to address liquidity risk in DIFC firms. It emphasizes the importance of maintaining robust liquidity management practices. <div>
<p>The Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) today published a report on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dfsa.ae/download_file/3665/0" target="_blank">Assessment of the Implementation of the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)</a>, offering valuable insights into the liquidity profile of firms operating in or from the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC).</p>
<p>The report highlights key findings, including areas where firms need to take action to enhance their liquidity management. It also shares best practices observed during the review.</p>
<p>Liquidity risk is key for institutions engaged in financial intermediation, such as those that accept deposits. As the financial regulator of the DIFC, the DFSA is committed to ensuring that institutions maintain strong defences against these risks. To address them, it imposes specific quantitative measures on certain firms. These measures are part of a broader framework requiring firms to maintain robust internal systems, controls and governance arrangements. These efforts are supported by the DFSA&rsquo;s risk-based supervisory work, which together contribute to the overall soundness of the DIFC.</p>
<p>Over the recent months, the DFSA conducted an in-depth thematic review of the liquidity risk of firms subject to the LCR to assess the adequacy of their implementation of the requirements set out in the&nbsp;<a href="https://dfsaen.thomsonreuters.com/rulebook/pib" target="_blank">PIB Module of the DFSA Rulebook</a>. This review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of current practices and identify areas for improvement.</p>
<p><span>Justin Baldacchino, Managing Director of Supervision at the DFSA, said:</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;The DFSA puts the utmost importance to the sound management of liquidity for firms operating in the DIFC. One cannot become complacent with liquidity risk given the speed at which liquidity issues can unfold. We are committed to maintaining the highest standards of financial regulation and oversight within the DIFC, fostering a secure and resilient financial environment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DFSA firms that are subject to the LCR requirement should review the report, consider the findings, and implement the necessary actions to remedy identified deficiencies. This proactive approach is essential to ensure robust liquidity management practices are in place.</p>

<p><span>Olivier Cousin, Director FPGA Solutions of Exegy, says: &ldquo;Bringing such a significant latency reduction in tick-to-trade execution is an important boost to the industry. It underscores the success of our collaboration with AMD,&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://click.icptrack.com/icp/relay.php?r=59597334&amp;msgid=628037&amp;act=FNP7&amp;c=783105&amp;pid=4494963&amp;destination=https%3A%2F%2Fir.amd.com%2Fnews-events%2Fpress-releases%2Fdetail%2F1158%2Famd-unveils-purpose-built-fpga-based-accelerator-for&amp;cf=3638&amp;v=b7e21884a5bb6a44f3ec005ebcd5e9e63776859bdfd4a1a3634123bf0c704f30" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">which began last year</a></span><span>, and highlights the benefits of Exegy&rsquo;s ongoing dedication to reducing latency</span><span>. Even more important is that we&rsquo;ve created a blueprint for how FPGA development can and should be done &ndash; with no compromise on speed or flexibility.&rdquo; He continues: &ldquo;Our clients can now focus on their strategies with the knowledge that the rest of the AMD Alveo&trade; UL3524 accelerator card implementation is fully optimized for low-latency trading.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>The AMD and Exegy collaboration combines hardware acceleration, FPGA flexibility, and low-latency networking to ensure high performance and determinism. The testing m</span><span>easurements are precise as the Exegy team managed to reduce the jitter to 200 picoseconds or up to 10x lower than in previous benchmarks. This ensures the accuracy of the STAC-T0 results. The benchmark is designed to use industry-standard hardware and is therefore fully transparent and reproducible. As part of their subscription, existing Exegy customers received the update to the IP cores which enabled this latency record.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;In ultra-low latency trading, a nanosecond can determine the difference between a profitable or losing trade,&rdquo; said Girish Malipeddi, Director of Product Marketing - AECG-Data Center, AMD. Adding, &ldquo;This benchmark shows independently quantified, verified, real-world results showcasing how AMD and Exegy continue to push the boundaries and possibilities in high-speed trading and financial technologies as a whole.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>STAC benchmarks are the industry standard for testing solutions that enable high-speed analytics on time-series tick data. The STAC-T0 benchmark evaluates tick-to-trade network-I/O latency. The previous lowest benchmark speed of 24.2ns also came from utilizing AMD accelerators.&nbsp;</span></p>

<title>MiCA Set To Accelerate Investment In Surveillance For Crypto Trading Firms</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> MiCA, cryptocurrency trading, market surveillance, regulatory framework, compliance<br />
<br />Summary: MiCA regulation will accelerate investment in market surveillance systems for cryptocurrency trading. Firms are not fully prepared for compliance. Outsourcing to third-party vendors is expected. <div>
<p>The European Union&rsquo;s Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA) is set to accelerate ongoing investment in surveillance systems for cryptocurrency trading, a report from Acuiti has found.</p>
<p>The report, The Impact of MiCA on Crypto Market Surveillance: Insights and Challenges<i>, </i>which was commissioned by Eventus and based on a survey and series of interviews with senior executives at 68 firms engaged in crypto trade across the buy-side, sell-side and exchanges, found that a move to establish market surveillance systems is underway across the industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>MiCA represents one of the first comprehensive regulatory frameworks for crypto trading to be developed in a major financial jurisdiction, and its adoption will increase requirements for market participants in a range of areas.</p>
<p>The study found that, of the firms that were in scope for MiCA, just 9% were fully prepared, and a quarter of firms had not begun preparations. With MiCA coming into effect at the end of the year, it is important that firms identify whether they are in scope now and begin preparations to comply.<span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>In terms of market surveillance, the MiCA regulation is based upon requirements set out in the EU&rsquo;s Market Abuse Regulation (MAR). For many firms, particularly crypto native firms coming into scope for the first time, there will be a significant operational lift to put in place the systems required to be compliant. This study found that there were still high levels of firms that were not sure if they were in scope.</p>
<p>The crypto market is already becoming more sophisticated when it comes to market surveillance, the report found with firms across the market, including 57% of those that consider themselves not in scope for MiCA, already having market surveillance systems in place.</p>
<p>With consultations still ongoing on the final technical standards, one quarter of those in scope had not yet started preparation. Just under a third were at an early stage of preparation, while just over a third were at an advanced stage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Firms investing in new systems were typically looking at outsourcing to a third-party software vendor with 64% planning to do so, although many firms anticipated challenges in finding the right vendor for their needs.</p>
<p>Of all the challenges that MiCA posed to firms coming into scope, the costs of compliance and finding skilled staff were the key factors that firms anticipated would cause them issues.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For firms that are not already operating under MIFID II, MiCA will present a significant operational lift to become compliant, and it is no surprise that we found that firms were looking to third-party vendors to assist them in their preparations,&rdquo; says Ross Lancaster Head of Research at Acuiti.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a relative lack of awareness among some areas in the market as to who is in scope, which will need to be addressed if firms are going to have time to get ready for compliance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eventus CEO Travis Schwab said: &ldquo;While there are commonalities in trade surveillance across asset classes, digital assets can present some unique challenges. We invested significantly beginning several years ago in ensuring we could meet the needs of this sector, including the ability to handle real-time alert generation covering billions of messages per day, 24x7. Regulation in the EU is only the beginning of new regulatory guidelines we expect to see in jurisdictions across the globe in the coming years.&rdquo;</p>

<title>More Transparent And Efficient: First KfW Benchmark Bond Via Deutsche Börse’s Digital D7 Platform</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> KfW, digital bond issuances, D7, Deutsche Börse, Clearstream <br />
Summary: KfW issues €4 billion benchmark bond on D7 platform with 2.75% coupon, partnering with Deutsche Börse and Google Cloud for efficiency and speed. <div>
<div class="text-highlight">
<div>
<ul>
<li>Optimised platform technology results in even more efficient and faster processes</li>
<li>KfW plans further digital bond issuances on D7 in the future</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="detailText">
<div class="paragraph">
<div><br />
<p>KfW issues its first high-volume benchmark bond as a central register security according to the German electronic securities act (eWpG) with a value date of 2 July 2024. The issuance was facilitated by Clearstream via Deutsche B&ouml;rse&rsquo;s digital securities platform D7. Clearstream is the post-trade business of Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group. The KfW bond has a volume of &euro;4 billion with a maturity of 3 years and a coupon of 2.75%.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div>
<p>Tim Armbruster, Treasurer at KfW, commented: &ldquo;We are delighted to have successfully completed a second digital transaction, with a focus on further automating data generation and speeding up the issuance process, thus improving scalability. We thank Deutsche B&ouml;rse for the constructive cooperation over the past months. It is important to us to provide key insights from the issuer&rsquo;s perspective to contribute to the further digitisation of capital markets.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div>
<p>Jens Hachmeister, Head of Issuer Services &amp; New Digital Markets at Deutsche B&ouml;rse, said: &ldquo;We are thrilled to welcome KfW&rsquo;s benchmark bond on our digital D7 platform. This is a striking milestone for the digitisation of German capital markets overall, and we are proud be pioneers in this field. To date, D7 has processed more than 35,000 digital issuances across all financial instruments, totalling around &euro;3.5bn, more than any other platform worldwide. With successful benchmark issuances like this one, D7 proves that it is the platform of choice for high-volume and high-scale digital issuances.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div>
<p>Thanks to its partnership with Google Cloud, Deutsche B&ouml;rse further significantly optimised D7&rsquo;s technology stack as part of the latest system upgrade. This enabled, for instance, a further decrease in time-to-market for digital securities from minutes to seconds. Traditionally, issuances can take several days due to cumbersome reconciliation processes and lack of system interoperability. Digital issuances increase speed, transparency, thus efficiency, while decreasing error-proneness and costs throughout the entire securities lifecycle.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div>
<p>This benchmark bond marks the second time KfW issues a central register security on D7 under the German electronic securities act (eWpG). KfW already completed a first pilot transaction (&euro;20 million, maturity: 2 years) in December 2022. Going forward, KfW plans to use D7 for further euro transactions.&nbsp;</p>

<title>ESMA Approved Taiwan Futures Exchange’s New Clearing Service In TWD NDF</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> TAIFEX, TWD NDF, ESMA, clearing services, regulatory compliance
Summary:
TAIFEX receives ESMA approval for TWD NDF clearing service, adheres to international standards, gains recognition from multiple international financial regulatory authorities.<br /><br /> <div>
<p>On June 12, 2024, the Taiwan Futures Exchange (TAIFEX) was notified by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) that the application submitted on June 28, 2023, for the addition of New Taiwan Dollar Non-Deliverable Forward (TWD NDF) clearing service has been officially approved and is effective on the date of notification.</p>
<p>In compliance with Article 25 of the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR), Third-Country Central Counterparties (TC-CCPs) must notify ESMA of any service extensions or reductions. This allows ESMA to review compliance and assess the impact on the EU market. Accordingly, TAIFEX notified ESMA of its plan to extend clearing services on June 28, 2023, and began offering client clearing and TWD NDF clearing services on July 31, 2023. After confirming TAIFEX's full regulatory compliance, ESMA approved the application on June 12, 2024.</p>
<p>TAIFEX is committed to researching the frameworks of international organizations and analyzing the systems of major foreign clearinghouses to develop a clearing mechanism that aligns with international standards. By adhering to the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI), disclosing quantitative information, and optimizing risk management, TAIFEX fosters an environment conducive to participation by both domestic and international institutions. TAIFEX's ongoing efforts have been continuously recognized by foreign financial regulatory authorities. Since the commencement of OTC central clearing services on July 25, 2022, TAIFEX has received recognition from various international financial regulatory bodies. On December 31, 2022, TAIFEX was recognized by ESMA as a TC-CCP. Furthermore, on October 13, 2023, TAIFEX was approved by the Japan Financial Services Agency (JFSA) to be exempted from licensing for TWD IRS clearing, and on February 14, 2024, it was granted the Exemption from Derivatives Clearing Organization registration by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), significantly enhancing the competitiveness and international visibility of Taiwan's OTC central clearing services.</p>
<p>TAIFEX will continue to actively seek qualifying central counterparty (QCCP) recognition from other countries, aligning with international standards, and diligently adhering to regulatory requirements. This effort will enhance foreign financial institutions' confidence in Taiwan&rsquo;s market, promote the internationalization of Taiwan's financial market, and expand its global influence.</p>

<title>BNP Paribas Asset Management Closes The Voting Season With 36% Opposition</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> voting policy, executive compensation, climate transition, director appointment, ESG

Summary:<br /><br />BNP Paribas Asset Management maintained a high rate of opposition on environmental and social issues during the 2024 AGM season. They require integration of a climate component in executive compensation and increased diversity in director appointments. They also prioritize ESG standards in their voting strategy and remain committed to collaborative engagement. <div>
<p><span>BNP Paribas Asset Management (BNPP AM) has continued to implement its strict voting policy during the 2024 Annual General Meeting (AGM) season. With an opposition rate across all resolutions of 36% (same as in 2023), this season illustrates BNPP AM&rsquo;s consistent and ambitious approach, based on ongoing constructive dialogue with companies.&nbsp;Among the major topics of the 2024 season were: executive compensation, corporate governance and climate transition.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>In 2024, BNPP AM opposed 2,163 management proposals across 332 companies for environmental and social reasons, 79% of which were related to climate or biodiversity-related expectations.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Michael Herskovich, Head of Voting and Corporate Governance at BNP Paribas Asset Management</span>, comments:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"During this season, we have maintained a high rate of opposition on environmental and social issues and have seen improvements through engagement with investee companies. As a result of this process, we have been able to strengthen our expectations of the companies in which we are invested every year. We remain convinced that shareholder democracy is essential to encourage companies to improve their performance and transparency on topics related to sustainability."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>BNPP AM now requires the integration of a climate component in executive compensation&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Executive compensation remained the key subject of opposition this season, despite a significant improvement in transparency and practices. In 2024, BNPP AM opposed more than one in two resolutions related to executive compensation, mostly due to lack of transparency or unjustified exceptional compensation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This year, BNPP AM specified its requirements related to the integration of environmental and social issues into executive remuneration. It expects companies to include a climate component in executives&rsquo; remuneration policies in some sectors (such as energy, utilities, industry and materials) and in companies identified in its investment portfolios as being among the higher greenhouse gas emitters. This requirement will be extended to all companies by 2026.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Integrating a climate component in compensation is an increasingly developed practice. However, to be efficient, these criteria must be measurable, quantifiable, and relevant to the company's sustainable development strategy.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Rachel Crossley, Head of Stewardship,&nbsp;Europe&nbsp;at BNP Paribas Asset Management</span>, explains:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Voting is a central fiduciary duty and core to BNPP AM's sustainability strategy. During the 2024 season we have reinforced our stance on combatting climate change, protecting nature, and promoting equality and inclusive growth. While climate criteria are increasingly being introduced to executive compensation plans in Europe, this is not the case in North America. Even in Europe, however, the criteria are often opaque and are not sufficiently quantified. We will continue to press for greater transparency and specificity on these and other sustainability metrics, that are science-based and tied to corporate strategy.</em>"&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>BNPP AM rejected 40% of director appointment resolutions, mainly due to diversity&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Opposition to directors is often linked to weak corporate governance, a lack of effective checks and balances, or a failure to meet diversity expectations. From 2025, BNPP AM will increase the minimum threshold required for female board membership to 40% in Europe, North America, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>ESG remains a priority for BNPP AM's voting strategy&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>BNPP AM uses voting to promote good environmental, social and governance standards, which are an essential part of its corporate responsibility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In line with its&nbsp;<a href="https://mediaroom-fr.bnpparibas-am.com/actualites/bnp-paribas-asset-management-presente-sa-feuille-de-route-pour-atteindre-la-neutralite-carbone-dici-2050-0d93-35b20.html" target="_blank">Net Zero</a>&nbsp;roadmap, BNPP AM expects companies to set the ambition to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 at the latest. In addition, the integration of biodiversity into voting activity requires companies to assess the impact of their activities and their dependence on nature. BNPP AM opposed more than 2,100 management proposals (in 3/4 of cases for reasons related to climate and biodiversity) compared to 1,521 resolutions in 2023.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>BNPP AM remains committed to collaborative engagement&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>BNPP AM is part of more than 40 collective initiatives around the world. BNPP AM's participation in Climate Action 100+ and Nature Action 100 has been strengthened by it taking on formal roles in the steering committee of each of these organisations. These appointments reflect BNPP AM&rsquo;s commitment towards participating in collaborative engagement to manage systemic risks.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Key figures for 2024:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Of the 1,645 general meetings:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li> At 1,492 general meetings (90%), BNPP AM voted against or abstained on at least one resolution (compared to 86% in 2023)&nbsp; </li>
<li> Of the 23,653 resolutions voted, 22,735 resolutions were proposed by the companies and 918 were shareholders resolutions.&nbsp; </li>
<li> 12 shareholder resolutions were filed by BNPP AM in 2024: 7 on governance in Italy and 5 environmental resolutions<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;in the United States.&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
<li> Within the scope of the most emitting companies subject BNPP AM&rsquo;s requirement of including a climate criterion in executive compensation, BNPP AM opposed 127 compensation-related resolutions due to the lack of criteria - 74% of these resolutions relate to companies listed in North America.&nbsp; </li>

<div> Collaboration, Art Multilateral Trading Facility, Exactpro, AI Testing, Regulation <br />
ARTEX Global Markets collaborated with Exactpro to ensure quality and operational resilience of its art trading platform using AI testing.<br /><br />Summary: ARTEX Global Markets partnered with Exactpro for AI testing, ensuring robustness and compliance. It increased delivery speed, resolved defects, and established a solid test library. <div>
<p dir="ltr"><span>ARTEX Global Markets, providers of the first regulated Art Multilateral Trading Facility (MTF), has collaborated with Exactpro to streamline its platform delivery and software testing practice. Having successfully listed its first artwork &ndash; Francis Bacon, &ldquo;Three Studies for Portrait of George Dyer&rdquo;, 1963, LU2583605592 &ndash; on 8 March 2024, ARTEX Global Markets has been running incident-free since then. The collaboration results are now available in the form of a case study.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Co-founded in 2020 by art enthusiasts and financial market experts H.S.H. Prince Wenceslas of Liechtenstein and Yassir Benjelloun-Touimi, ARTEX Global Markets is enabling the trading of a new regulated asset class &ndash; art shares. ARTEX Global Markets is a multilateral trading facility (MTF) supervised by the Financial Markets Authority of Liechtenstein and operating within the European MiFID II legislative framework.</span><span><br /></span><span><br /></span><span>The&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://exactpro.com/case-study/ai-enabled-software-testing-artex-mtf?utm_source=PR&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=Artex-Exactpro-case-study-release-27June+2024" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>joint case study</span></a><span>&nbsp;focuses on the collaborative work conducted by the ARTEX and Exactpro teams ahead of, during and post-launch, to ensure the required level of quality and operational resilience of the new trading venue. It highlights the use of Exactpro's AI Testing approach that was tailored to the ARTEX Global Markets needs and encompassed end-to-end functional and non-functional testing of the MTF's protocol and matching engine software.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Alexandre Reynaert, Chief Technology Officer, ARTEX Global Markets, comments on the ARTEX&ndash;Exactpro collaboration:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;Building a new trading venue is a rigorous exercise and guaranteeing a flawless experience for our members and participants is paramount. We needed to ensure that our trading venue is robust, consistent and compliant with industry standards, and Exactpro&rsquo;s insights &amp; experience were invaluable in achieving this goal.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;We wanted a partner that was agile, and able to adapt to our specific needs as we changed. Exactpro&rsquo;s ability to adapt and update their test libraries &amp; models was outstanding. Through the use of AI, the size and execution time of the testing process has been reduced without compromising the quality of the testing. There was also great value in the End-to-End testing aspect to ensure consistency and detect regressions.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Iosif Itkin, co-CEO and co-founder, Exactpro, adds:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Having invested in independent software testing at this early stage, ARTEX was able to avoid a lot of the common pitfalls, resolve defects early and at a lower cost, as well as significantly increase their overall delivery speed. The trading venue is now supported by an extensive test library that can be used regularly for regression testing and serve as a foundation for future growth.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;We very much appreciate the trust put in Exactpro in this collaboration and have enjoyed the opportunity to share our industry expertise and showcase our AI-enabled software testing approach</span><span>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>

<div> Partnership, Sustainability, Carbon Offset Solution, Global Trade, Distichain <br />
<br />
ZERO13 and Distichain partner to integrate carbon offset solution into B2B trade platform, reducing environmental impact, promoting CSR, and enabling regulatory compliance.<br />
Promote sustainability in global trade, mitigate environmental impact, showcase commitment to CSR, facilitate regulatory compliance, and enable new market access.<br />
Summary:<br />
ZERO13 and Distichain partnership integrates carbon offset solution into B2B trade platform, reducing environmental impact, showcasing commitment to CSR, and facilitating regulatory compliance for global trade. <div>
<p><span>ZERO13, the COP28 award-winning international carbon exchange, registry and hub aggregation ecosystem, part of GMEX Group (&lsquo;GMEX&rsquo;), has announced a strategic partnership with Distichain, an innovative TradeTech platform delivering international trade-as-a-service for B2B marketplaces and recognised in the PWC NetZero Future50 report.</span></p>
<p><span>The partnership will see the existing GMEX-enabled Distichain digital custody and payments rails solution extended through the integration of ZERO13&rsquo;s carbon offset solution and Distichain&rsquo;s SaaS B2B trade platform. This latest collaboration provides businesses engaging in sustainable global trade with a range of benefits, including:</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Reduction of Environmental Impact</strong>: Traders can effectively mitigate the environmental impact of their business operations; particularly as global trade relies heavily on cross-border transportation and logistics.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Participation in Corporate Social Responsibility</strong>: Companies and governments can showcase their commitment to environmental sustainability and corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives, as well as contribute to the drive to combat climate change.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Sustainability inclusivity</strong>: This collaboration helps governments and enterprises to prioritise sustainability issues. Combining the two services creates a pragmatic solution accessible to all companies using the Distichain-powered marketplaces.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Regulatory Compliance and New Market Access</strong>: In regions such as Europe and the USA, where carbon emissions regulations and offset incentives exist, ZERO13 and Distichain can facilitate cross-border trade and enable businesses to demonstrate carbon neutrality or offset their emissions to access specific opportunities or contracts.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Haisam Jamal, CEO of Distichain</strong>, discussed the partnership, stating, &ldquo;Our collaboration with ZERO13 marks a significant step in driving sustainability within global digital trade for a NetZero Future.&nbsp;As the first to integrate a carbon offsetting solution directly into B2B platforms, we are empowering traders to actively mitigate their environmental footprint and pave the way for a greener future in cross-border trade."</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Hirander Misra, Chairman of GMEX Group and ZERO13</strong>, commented on the partnership, saying, "The integration of ZERO13's carbon offset solution with Distichain's trade platform represents a major step towards achieving sustainability goals in the global trade ecosystem. With London Climate Action Week and as part of that, the Climate Innovation Forum taking place this week, this collaboration showcases our commitment to providing innovative solutions that mitigate environmental impact and unlock new opportunities for businesses in the evolving landscape of trade finance."</span></p>
<p><span>ZERO13, provides a digital Platform-as-Service (PaaS) Carbon Trading, Exchange and Carbon Registry Aggregation Hub to support sustainability by enabling distributed interconnectivity across multiple blockchains and APIs. Functioning as a decentralised hub, the 60+ strong and rapidly growing participant ecosystem orchestrates workflows across multiple trade participants to ensure successful trading and settlement, interconnecting silos and addressing the inadequacies of the stand-alone voluntary carbon market (VCM) model.</span></p>
<p><span>Distichain, a leading provider of International Trade-as-a-Service, offers secure, end-to-end transaction capabilities, enabling businesses to digitally engage in export and import activities. The platform transforms traditional trading processes by digitalising every step via a multi-firm ecosystem, from supply-chain management and verification to secure innovative trade finance solutions.</span></p>

<title>ASIC Approves Enhanced Banking Code Of Practice</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-approves-enhanced-banking-code-of-practice/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-approves-enhanced-banking-code-of-practice/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: ASIC, Australian Banking Association, Banking Code of Practice, consumer protections, enhancements<br />
Summary: ASIC approved the new Banking Code of Practice with enhanced consumer protections, including better small business coverage and improved accessibility. The code will commence on 28 February 2025.<br /><br /> <div>
<p>ASIC has approved a new version of the Australian Banking Association&rsquo;s (ABA) Banking Code of Practice, which includes enhancements to key protections. The new Code will commence on 28 February 2025.</p>
<p>Following a period of extensive ASIC-led consultation, the ABA agreed to address critical gaps flagged by stakeholders, resulting in a strengthening of standards and a retention of key protections for consumers and small businesses.</p>
<p>The enhancements in the February 2025 Code include:</p>
<ul>
<li>expanding the definition of a small business from $3 million in aggregate borrowings to $5 million meaning another 10,000 businesses will be eligible,</li>
<li>improved inclusivity and accessibility for customers, including via interpreter services,</li>
<li>new provisions for deceased estates,</li>
<li>broadening the definition of financial difficulty, and</li>
<li>enhanced protections for loan guarantors.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ASIC sought to ensure there was no diminishment of key Code protections, including the requirement to act with the care and skill of a diligent and prudent banker for consumer borrowers and their guarantors.</p>
<p>Important provisions regarding the handling of consumer complaints and ensuring the robust oversight of the Code by the Banking Code Compliance Committee have also been retained, including by a new provision that commits subscribing banks to be bound by their obligations under the Banking Code Compliance Committee Charter.</p>
<p>ASIC Chair Joe Longo said while there are several key improvements in the new Code, it was not the final word in customer-focussed banking.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Banks have a significant impact on our lives and Australians and ASIC rightly have high expectations of them,&rsquo; Mr Longo said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;ASIC&rsquo;s review has been focused on ensuring this Code can make a difference in the day-to- day practice of the banking sector and through that, good customer outcomes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In coming weeks, ASIC will also release reports on Better Banking for Indigenous Australians, credit card offerings, and scam detection, prevention and response.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Code and reports like these are a call for banks to continuously look at how they should be putting the customer front and centre. ASIC expects the ABA to continue working with its members to consider opportunities to improve consumer outcomes through data insights, including the identification of consumers experiencing vulnerability and customers identifying as First Nations consumers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We look forward to following the implementation of the Code and seeing its subscribers hold themselves to high standards of implementation and compliance,&rsquo; Chair Longo said.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s decision to approve the new Banking Code of Practice follows an independent review of the code in 2021,&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/consultations/cp-373-proposed-changes-to-the-banking-code-of-practice/" title="CP 373 Proposed changes to the Banking Code of Practice">public consultation</a>&nbsp;by ASIC on a revised code from November 2023 to January 2024 and engagement with the ABA, consumer groups and other interested stakeholders.</p>
<p>The February 2025 Banking Code of Practice will shortly be made available on the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ausbanking.org.au/">ABA&rsquo;s website</a>.</p>
<p><span>The new Code will commence from 28 February 2025</span>.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>ASIC previously&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2019-releases/19-358mr-asic-approves-an-updated-banking-code-of-practice/" title="19-358MR ASIC approves an updated Banking Code of Practice">approved</a>&nbsp;the Code, as a whole, in December 2019 and most recently&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2021-releases/21-003mr-asic-approves-variations-to-the-banking-code/" title="21-003MR ASIC approves variations to the Banking Code">approved</a>&nbsp;updates in January 2021.</p>
<p>The Code is owned and developed by the ABA. ASIC does not have a role in enforcing or monitoring Code compliance. In approving the Code, ASIC considered that:</p>
<ul>
<li>the rules in the Code are binding on the ABA's members and form part of the contracts between banks and their customers for relevant banking services and guarantees,</li>
<li>the Code was developed and reviewed in a transparent way, which involved consultation with relevant stakeholders, including consumer and small business groups, and</li>
<li>the Code is supported by effective administration and compliance mechanisms. The Banking Code Compliance Committee will continue to have oversight of banks' Code compliance. They can also require banks' cooperation with their monitoring and investigations, and apply a range of sanctions for non-compliance with Code provisions.</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today, the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) released its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ciro.ca/news-room/publications/ciro-annual-priorities-fiscal-2025" target="_self" title="CIRO Annual Priorities for fiscal 2025">Fiscal 2025 Annual Public Priorities</a>.</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s Annual Priorities build on last year&rsquo;s priorities and begin the work of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ciro.ca/media/7981/download?inline" target="_self" title="CIRO Strategic Plan FY 2025-2027">CIRO&rsquo;s three-year Strategic Plan</a>&nbsp;released in April of this year. For the FY25 CIRO is focused on the following three key areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integration</li>
<li>Regulatory Delivery and Operations</li>
<li>Strategic Objectives</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These priorities build on last year&rsquo;s priorities and from CIRO&rsquo;s three-year Strategic Plan released earlier of this year, while advancing the organization in ways that we know are important to our members, investors and other stakeholders,&rdquo; said Alexandra William, Senior Vice-President, Member Regulation and Corporate Strategy. &ldquo;Our Annual Priorities provide members and stakeholders with transparency about CIRO&rsquo;s focus for the next year and how we plan to respond to transformation in the industry and changes in how investors and members engage with capital markets and market participants. A critical component of our strategic planning process was the consultation conducted with our various stakeholders. CIRO did extensive work to obtain feedback from members and other stakeholders on CIRO&rsquo;s current role as a regulator, what can be done better, and what can be done better meet the needs of the investor and the industry for the future. All this work formed the basis of the strategic planning process and helped us determine this year&rsquo;s priorities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were several factors considered when deciding this year&rsquo;s Annual Priorities, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Impact to Members, investors and stakeholders</li>
<li>Size of the impact measured by size of rule changes, new information or request for comments asked by us</li>
<li>How the priorities match to the Year 1 integration priorities</li>
<li>Balance between regulation delivery and operations, integration and Strategic Priorities</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;CIRO, like all regulators, has a primary responsibility of delivering regulation efficiently and effectively. The successful integration over the next couple of years will support the delivery of our commitments to our members, investors and stakeholders,&rdquo; said Williams.</p>
<p>The Annual Public Priorities are in addition to the ongoing delivery of CIRO&rsquo;s mission to promote healthy capital markets by regulating fairly and effectively so that our investors feel protected and confident investing for their futures.</p>

<title>Federal Reserve Board Annual Bank Stress Test Showed That While Large Banks Would Endure Greater Losses Than Last Year's Test, They Are Well Positioned To Weather A Severe Recession And Stay Above Minimum Capital Requirements</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> capital requirements, stress test, recession, losses, banks
<br />
The Federal Reserve's stress test on large banks showed they can endure a severe recession, with higher losses but still meeting capital requirements.
<br />
Summary: <div>
<p>The results of the Federal Reserve Board's annual bank stress test showed that while large banks would endure greater losses than last year's test, they are well positioned to weather a severe recession and stay above minimum capital requirements. Additionally, the Board published aggregate results from its first exploratory analysis, which will not affect bank capital requirements.</p>
<p>"This year's stress test shows that large banks have sufficient capital to withstand a highly stressful scenario and meet their minimum capital ratios," Vice Chair for Supervision Michael S. Barr said. "While the severity of this year's stress test is similar to last year's, the test resulted in higher losses because bank balance sheets are somewhat riskier and expenses are higher. The goal of our test is to help to ensure that banks have enough capital to absorb losses in a highly stressful scenario. This test shows that they do."</p>
<p>The Board's stress test is one tool to help ensure that large banks can support the economy during downturns. The test evaluates the resilience of large banks by estimating their capital levels, losses, revenue and expenses under a single hypothetical recession and financial market shock, using banks' data as of the end of last year. The individual results from the stress test inform a bank's capital requirements to help ensure a bank could survive a severe recession and financial market shock.</p>
<p>All 31 banks tested remained above their minimum common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital requirements during the hypothetical recession, after absorbing total projected hypothetical losses of nearly $685 billion. Under stress, the aggregate CET1 capital ratio&mdash;which provides a cushion against losses&mdash;is projected to decline by 2.8 percentage points, from 12.7 percent to 9.9 percent. While this is a greater decline than last year's, it is within the range of recent stress tests.</p>
<p>This year's hypothetical scenario is broadly comparable to last year's scenario. It includes a severe global recession with a 40 percent decline in commercial real estate prices, a substantial increase in office vacancies, and a 36 percent decline in house prices. The unemployment rate rises nearly 6-1/2 percentage points to a peak of 10 percent, and economic output declines commensurately.</p>
<p>With the scenario relatively unchanged from last year, there are three main factors that explain the larger capital decline in this year's test:</p>
<ul>
<li>Substantial increases in banks' credit card balances combined with higher delinquency rates have resulted in greater projected credit card losses;</li>
<li>Banks' corporate credit portfolios have become riskier, partly reflected in banks' downgrading of their own loans, resulting in higher projected corporate losses; and</li>
<li>Higher expenses and lower fee income in recent years, resulting in less projected income to offset losses.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The nearly $685 billion in total projected losses includes $175 billion in credit card losses, $142 billion in losses from commercial and industrial loans, and nearly $80 billion in losses from commercial real estate. The disclosure document includes additional information about losses, including firm-specific results and figures.</p>
<p>The Board also conducted an exploratory analysis, including two funding stresses to all banks tested and two trading book stresses to only the largest and most complex banks. The exploratory analysis is distinct from the stress test, exploring additional hypothetical risks to the broader banking system.</p>
<p>The two funding stresses include a rapid repricing of deposits, combined with a more severe and less severe recession. Under each element, large banks would remain above minimum capital requirements in aggregate, with capital ratio declines of 2.7 percentage points and 1.1 percentage points, respectively.</p>
<p>Under the two trading book stresses, which included the failure of five large hedge funds under different market conditions, the largest and most complex banks are projected to lose between $70 billion and $85 billion. The results demonstrated that these banks have material exposure to hedge funds but that they can withstand different types of trading book shocks.</p>

<div> Malaysia, Jho Low, civil forfeiture, 1MDB, international money laundering
Summary:
The Justice Department reached an agreement with Jho Low and his family to return assets acquired through alleged embezzlement from Malaysia's 1MDB fund. Collaboration with foreign partners in asset transfer. Charges against Jho Low in New York and Washington, D.C. remain. FBI and IRS Criminal Investigation are involved. Appreciation extended to international authorities for their assistance. Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative led by MLARS. Individuals with information about foreign corruption proceeds in the US should contact law enforcement or the provided email addresses. <div>
<p>The Justice Department announced today that it has reached an agreement with Low Taek Jho, also known as Jho Low, members of his family, and trust entities Low established (collectively, the &ldquo;Low Parties&rdquo;) that resolves two civil forfeiture cases.</p>
<p>The department previously brought the cases against assets that it alleges were acquired by Low and his family using funds allegedly embezzled from 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), Malaysia&rsquo;s sovereign investment development fund. The Low Parties have also agreed to cooperate in the transfer to Malaysia of certain other assets located in Hong Kong, Switzerland, and Singapore that are linked to 1MDB funds. Under the agreement, the department will coordinate with foreign partners to facilitate the liquidation and return of these assets to Malaysia.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the civil forfeiture complaints, from 2009 through 2015, more than $4.5 billion in funds belonging to 1MDB were allegedly misappropriated by high-level officials of 1MDB and their associates, including Low, through a criminal conspiracy involving international money laundering and bribery. 1MDB was created by the government of Malaysia to promote economic development in Malaysia through global partnerships and foreign direct investment. Its funds were intended to be used to improve the well-being of the Malaysian people.</p>
<p>The agreement resolves the civil forfeiture action against a luxury apartment in Paris and artwork located in Switzerland by artists Andy Warhol and Claude Monet, which Low purchased for approximately $35 million in total. In addition, parties agreed to return to Malaysia real property and cash in bank accounts valued at approximately $67 million located in Hong Kong, Switzerland, and Singapore. The United States will release a total of $3.5 million to the trust entities to pay for legal fees and costs associated with the properties. Under the agreement, none of these fees may be returned to Low or his family members.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prior to this settlement, in total, the United States has returned or assisted in the return to Malaysia of over $1.4 billion in assets associated with the international money laundering, embezzlement, and bribery scheme.</p>
<p>Low separately faces charges in the Eastern District of New York for allegedly conspiring to launder billions of dollars embezzled from 1MDB and for conspiring to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by allegedly paying bribes to various Malaysian and Emirati officials, and in the District of Columbia for allegedly conspiring to make and conceal foreign and conduit campaign contributions during the United States presidential election in 2012. This agreement does not release any entity or individual from filed or potential criminal charges.</p>
<p>The FBI&rsquo;s International Corruption Squads in New York City and Los Angeles and IRS Criminal Investigation are investigating the case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trial Attorneys Barbara Levy, Sean Fern, Jonathan Baum, and Joshua Sohn of the Criminal Division&rsquo;s Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section (MLARS) and Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan Galatzan for the Central District of California are prosecuting the case, with significant assistance from the Justice Department&rsquo;s Office of International Affairs and MLARS&rsquo; Program Management Staff.</p>
<p>The Justice Department also appreciates the significant assistance provided over the course of this investigation by the Attorney General&rsquo;s Chambers of Malaysia, the Royal Malaysia Police, the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission, the Attorney-General&rsquo;s Chambers of Singapore, the Singapore Police Force-Commercial Affairs Department, the Office of the Attorney General and the Federal Office of Justice of Switzerland, and French authorities.</p>
<p>The Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative is led by a team of dedicated prosecutors in MLARS, in partnership with federal law enforcement agencies, and often with U.S. Attorneys&rsquo; Offices, to forfeit the proceeds of foreign official corruption. Individuals with information about possible proceeds of foreign corruption located in or laundered through the United States should contact federal law enforcement or send an email to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:kleptocracy@usdoj.gov">kleptocracy@usdoj.gov</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://tips.fbi.gov/">https://tips.fbi.gov/</a>.</p>

<div> framework, money laundering, terrorist financing, AMLA, EU

Summary:
The EBA welcomes new EU framework to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, retains AML/CFT powers, and supports national authorities in transition to AMLA. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) welcomes the entry into force of the new EU framework that will transform how Europe tackles money laundering and terrorist financing. The EBA is proud to be paving the way for the establishment of the new anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism authority (AMLA) and is committed to facilitating a smooth transition, and making the EU a hostile place for financial crime.</span></p>
<p>Since 2020, the EBA has been leading, coordinating and monitoring the EU financial sector&rsquo;s fight against money laundering (ML) and terrorist financing (TF). The new legislative framework marks a significant step forward in the EU&rsquo;s fight against financial crime, with a harmonised and single AML/CFT rulebook, and the establishment of AMLA, a dedicated EU anti-money laundering authority.</p>
<p>The EBA will retain its AML/CFT powers and mandates until December 2025 to minimise disruption and provide continuity, and it will also continue working closely with AMLA going forward. In particular, after transferring the powers that are specific to AML/CFT to AMLA, the EBA will remain responsible for addressing ML/TF risk across its prudential remit.</p>
<p>Since its inception, the EBA has been working to ensure that financial institutions and their supervisors apply effective AML/CFT controls wherever they operate in the EU, providing a solid foundation for the new regime. The European Commission has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-03/2d15a537-adaa-49ce-8b2a-54467772dfb6/CfA%20RTSs_GL%20EBA_fin_rev.pdf">asked&nbsp;</a>the EBA to provide its technical advice on important aspects of the future EU AML/CFT framework to ensure that AMLA can begin to operate efficiently and effectively as of its establishment.</p>
<p>Over the course of 2024 and in 2025, the EBA&rsquo;s priorities in the area of AML/CFT will focus on the following aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>a methodology for selecting financial institutions for direct EU-level AML/CFT supervision;</li>
<li>a common risk assessment methodology;</li>
<li>information necessary to carry out customer due diligence;</li>
<li>criteria to determine the seriousness of a breach of AML/CFT provisions.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The EBA will be providing its advice to the Commission in October 2025.</p>
<p>Throughout the transition phase, the EBA will also support national competent authorities getting ready for AMLA and will coordinate with the European Commission&rsquo;s AMLA taskforce, which will be responsible for the establishment and initial operations of AMLA.</p>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>In 2024, the co-legislators agreed on a new AML/CFT package to strengthen the EU&rsquo;s fight against financial crime.</p>
<p>The Regulation establishing AMLA (2024/1620), the Regulation establishing a single AML/CFT Rulebook (2024/1624) and the revision of the AML/CFT Directive (AMLD6 - 2024/1640) were published in the Official Journal of the European Union on the 19 of June.</p>
<p>Once established, AMLA will directly supervise the cross-border credit and financial institutions exposed to highest money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF) risk. It will also draft AML/CFT standards and guidelines, oversee AML/CFT supervisors, and coordinate Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs). In accordance with Article 103 and 108 of Regulation 2024/1620, the EBA will transfer its AML/CFT mandates, powers and resources to AMLA by the end of 2025.</p>

<title>ACER Assesses The Gas Transmission Tariff Methodology Proposed For Austria</title>

<div> ACER, report, Austrian gas transmission tariffs, E-Control, methodology
<br />
Summary: ACER recommends evaluating network patterns, exploring suitable methodologies, and comparing capacity cost allocation outcomes. E-Control will consider ACER's recommendations in its next tariff consultation. <div>
<p>Today, ACER releases its report on the Austrian gas transmission tariffs proposed for 2025 by E-Control, the National Regulatory Authority (NRA) of Austria.</p>
<p>The proposed methodology takes into account the changes in network patterns resulting from the 2022 energy crisis.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What does ACER recommend?</span></p>
<p>ACER analysed the information provided by E-Control and assessed the compliance of the proposed methodology against the requirements of the Network Code on Harmonised Transmission Tariff Structures (<a href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsPBlIJUVgFAUwMAQMGHVZYBQYdUAwAAhoCV1YHAQsFUw5QAAAdB1FUBFxUAwUdAQwGAx0GCQdfGlRcCg4ZUQdSDgAEAFUEBQFVRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" target="_blank">NC TAR</a>). Based on this analysis, ACER provides the following recommendations to the NRA:</p>
<ul>
<li>Evaluate the network topology and use patterns. For instance, the NRA should take into account the distance gas flows need to cover to supply different network points into the methodology.</li>
<li>Explore the methodologies that best align with the network&rsquo;s characteristics and usage, including selecting appropriate cost drivers and other instruments such as flow scenarios.</li>
<li>Compare the results of the Capacity Cost Allocation (CAA) assessment to identify the most suitable methodologies for the Austrian transmission network. The NRA should investigate whether high CAA outcomes indicate potential cross-subsidisation between intra-system and cross-system network usage.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the next steps?</span></p>
<p>E-Control adopted the&nbsp;<a href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsCBQBXAAUFVEwNAQVXHVZYUwIdUF8CUxoBU1dSDFFQAQIEDwMdB1FUBFxUAwUdAQwGAx0GCQdfGlRcCg4ZUQdSDgAEAFUEBQFVRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" target="_blank">motivated decision</a>&nbsp;on the reference price methodology on 31 May 2024, after receiving preliminary input from ACER.</p>
<p>Following the publication of this report, E-Control shall consider ACER&rsquo;s recommendations in its next tariff consultation, scheduled for completion by the end of 2024.&nbsp;</p>

<li><span><i>Key milestone paves the way for&nbsp;CME Group to migrate to Google Cloud's industry-first specialized platform for capital markets</i></span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reaching a significant milestone in the companies' transformational partnership,&nbsp;CME Group&nbsp;and Google Cloud today announced plans to build a new private Google Cloud region, and a co-location facility, in&nbsp;Aurora, Illinois.</p>
<p>The private Google Cloud region will host Google Cloud's new, industry-first specialized platform designed to support global trading of&nbsp;CME Group's&nbsp;futures and options markets, and offer derivatives traders cloud-based, ultra-low-latency networking, and high-performance computing.</p>
<p>Locating the platform in the new private Google Cloud region in the&nbsp;Chicago&nbsp;area will allow&nbsp;CME Group's&nbsp;clients to utilize existing connectivity options and access points to other global markets. Additionally,&nbsp;CME Group's&nbsp;clients can choose between self-managed infrastructure in the co-location facility or Google Cloud's specialized infrastructure-as-a-service offering, both with equal network latency to the exchange.</p>
<p>The new specialized platform will enable a number of benefits for&nbsp;CME Group's&nbsp;clients, including expanded flexibility, strengthened operational efficiencies, and increased access to cloud services, and artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, all of which will deepen the value proposition for market users around the globe. For example,&nbsp;CME Group&nbsp;clients will be enabled to rapidly experiment, test, and deploy new strategies without impacting their production trading environments.</p>
<p>"This is a significant step forward in our partnership with Google Cloud that is revolutionizing our industry," said&nbsp;CME Group&nbsp;Chairman and Chief Executive Officer&nbsp;
Terry Duffy. "Located within close proximity to our current data center campus, and with disaster recovery facilities in&nbsp;Dallas, Texas, Google Cloud's new specialized platform will extend the benefits we can provide to our clients through next-generation cloud technology, expanded access and efficiencies, a broader range of customized connectivity options, and faster product development, with minimal disruption to their current operations."&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the capabilities offered through the new platform, market participants that migrate to the cloud can benefit from Google Cloud's global network and innovative AI and data capabilities. With Google Cloud's data cloud products like BigQuery and AlloyDB, and its AI and machine learning platform, Vertex AI, financial institutions will be able to experiment with new modeling techniques such as time-series forecasting and simplify access to insights with generative AI. All of this is backed by Google Cloud's expanding number of regions, planet-scale network, and AI-powered security.</p>
<p>"Our latest milestone with CME Group builds on our shared goal to accelerate CME's move to the cloud and innovate capital markets infrastructure worldwide," said&nbsp;
Thomas Kurian, CEO, Google Cloud. "Through our collaboration, we're harnessing the best of cloud computing, data analytics, and AI, while respecting the existing custom hardware requirements of market participants to bring low latency, deterministic, and scalable trading environments to&nbsp;CME Group&nbsp;customers and the broader financial markets."</p>
<p>Development of the specialized platform is underway, starting with key capabilities available for customer testing in the Dallas Google Cloud region, which will eventually become the disaster recovery facility. Construction of the private Google Cloud region in&nbsp;Aurora&nbsp;is scheduled to begin this year.&nbsp;CME Group&nbsp;expects to provide clients with at least 18 months advance notice before&nbsp;CME Group&nbsp;markets move to the new platform.&nbsp;CME Group&nbsp;cash markets will continue to operate in their current facilities as they do today.</p>
<p>Since announcing their partnership in 2021,&nbsp;CME Group&nbsp;and Google Cloud continue to execute on key initiatives, including recent enhancements to&nbsp;CME Group's&nbsp;cloud-based data platform and migration of critical clearing applications to the cloud. Both firms are focused on delivering significant benefits to all market participants by expanding access, creating real-time, customer-centric data and analytics capabilities, bringing new products and services to market, and increasing efficiencies.</p>

<div> Basel III, capital reform, monetary policy, regulatory framework, economic outlook
Summary:
The article discusses the current economic and monetary policy outlook in the US and its implications for bank capital reform, emphasizing the need for data-driven analysis and considering both direct and indirect consequences of regulatory reforms. <div>
<p>I would like to thank the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) for the invitation to speak to you today.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240626a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1">1</a>&nbsp;I appreciate the opportunity to engage with you on matters that affect the swaps and derivatives industry, specifically how we can best consider and address the potential consequences of bank capital reform measures, both in the United States and around the world. Before doing so, I will share my views on the economy and monetary policy in the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Update on the Economy and Monetary Policy Outlook</strong><br />Over the past two years, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy to address high inflation. At our meeting earlier this month, the FOMC voted to continue to hold the federal funds rate target range at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent and to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve's securities holdings.</p>
<p>After seeing considerable progress on slowing inflation last year, we have seen only modest further progress this year. The 12-month measures of total and core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation have moved roughly sideways or slightly down since December and remained elevated at 2.7 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively, in April. The consumer price index (CPI) report for May showed 12-month core CPI inflation slowing to 3.4 percent from 3.6 percent in April. However, with average core CPI inflation this year through May running at an annualized rate of 3.8 percent, notably above average inflation in the second half of last year, I expect inflation to remain elevated for some time.</p>
<p>The recent pickup in inflation in the first several months of 2024 was evident across many goods and services categories, suggesting that inflation was temporarily lower in the latter half of last year. Prices continue to be much higher than before the pandemic, which is weighing on consumer sentiment. Inflation has hit lower-income households hardest since food, energy, and housing services price increases far outpaced overall inflation throughout this episode.</p>
<p>Economic activity increased at a strong pace last year but appears to have moderated early this year. First-quarter gross domestic product growth was slower than in the second half of last year, though private domestic final purchases continued to rise at a solid pace. Continued softness in consumer spending and weaker housing activity early in the second quarter also suggest less momentum in economic activity so far this year.</p>
<p>Payroll employment continued to rise at a solid pace in April and May, though slightly slower than in the first quarter, partly reflecting increased immigrant labor supply. Despite some further rebalancing between supply and demand, the labor market remains tight. The unemployment rate edged up to 4.0 percent in May, while the number of job openings relative to unemployed workers declined further to near its pre-pandemic level. Labor force participation dropped back to 62.5 percent in May, which suggests no further improvement in labor supply along this margin, as labor force participation among those aged 55 and older has been persistently low.</p>
<p>At its current setting, our monetary policy stance appears to be restrictive, and I will continue to monitor the incoming data to assess whether monetary policy is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to our target. As I've noted recently, my baseline outlook continues to be that inflation will decline further with the policy rate held steady. And should the incoming data indicate that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2 percent goal, it will eventually become appropriate to gradually lower the target range for the federal funds rate to prevent monetary policy from becoming overly restrictive. However, we are still not yet at the point where it is appropriate to lower the policy rate, and I continue to see a number of upside risks to inflation.</p>
<p>First, much of the progress on inflation last year was due to supply-side improvements, including easing of supply chain constraints; increases in the number of available workers, due in part to immigration; and lower energy prices. It is unlikely that further improvements along this margin will continue to lower inflation going forward as supply chains have largely normalized; the labor force participation rate has leveled off in recent months below pre-pandemic levels; and an open U.S. immigration policy over the past few years, which added millions of new immigrants in the U.S., may become more restrictive.</p>
<p>Geopolitical developments could also pose upside risks to inflation, including the risk that spillovers from regional conflicts could disrupt global supply chains, putting additional upward pressure on food, energy, and commodity prices. There is also the risk that the loosening in financial conditions since late last year, reflecting considerable gains in equity valuations, and additional fiscal stimulus could add momentum to demand, stalling any further progress or even causing inflation to reaccelerate.</p>
<p>Finally, there is a risk that increased immigration and continued labor market tightness could lead to persistently high core services inflation. Given the current low inventory of affordable housing, the inflow of new immigrants to some geographic areas could result in upward pressure on rents, as additional housing supply may take time to materialize. With labor markets remaining tight, wage growth has been elevated at around or above 4 percent, still higher than the pace consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal, given trend productivity growth.</p>
<p>In light of these risks, and the general uncertainty regarding the economic outlook, I will continue to watch the data closely as I assess the appropriate path of monetary policy. The frequency and extent of data revisions over the past few years make the task of assessing the current state of the economy and predicting how the economy will evolve even more challenging. I will remain cautious in my approach to considering future changes in the stance of policy.</p>
<p>It is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. In my view, we should consider a range of possible scenarios that could unfold when considering how the FOMC's monetary policy decisions may evolve. My colleagues and I will make our decisions at each FOMC meeting based on the incoming data and the implications for and risks to the outlook. While the current stance of monetary policy appears to be at a restrictive level, I remain willing to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at a future meeting should the incoming data indicate that progress on inflation has stalled or reversed. Restoring price stability is essential for achieving maximum employment over the longer run.</p>
<p><strong>Grappling with the Unintended Consequences of Bank Capital Reform</strong><br />I will turn now to the issue of bank capital reform, and the implications of adopting and implementing the Basel III "endgame" standards both in the United States and around the world.</p>
<p><em>Considering capital and debt requirements in the aggregate</em><br />Capital requirements are an important component of the prudential regulatory frameworks and interconnected banking and financial systems around the world. As you know, the U.S. has lagged our E.U. and U.K. counterparts in fully implementing the Basel III capital standards. In July 2023, the U.S. federal banking agencies issued a public consultation on implementing what the U.S. calls the Basel III "endgame" capital reforms.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240626a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2">2</a>&nbsp;The response to the U.S. capital proposal has been overwhelmingly negative, including from a broad range of stakeholders. I have previously spoken at length about my concerns with the proposal, and as public commenters have reviewed it, they have identified additional areas of concern.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240626a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3">3</a></p>
<p>In my view, the concerns are well-founded. The proposal acknowledged that the revisions, if implemented, would result in an estimated 20 percent aggregate increase in total risk-weighted assets across bank holding companies subject to the rule. Individual impacts would vary not only by firm, but also by business line. For any particular business line or product, the aggregate impact of the proposed capital changes could result in a more significant increase, depending upon the firm's characteristics. Consider the impact on business lines subject to the market risk capital rule. As noted in the proposal, the revisions to the market risk rule alone would increase risk-weighted assets from $430 billion to $760 billion for Category I and II firms, and from $130 billion to $220 billion for Category III and IV firms.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240626a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4">4</a></p>
<p>Even this example ignores the additive capital increases from other aspects of the rule, such as the operational risk charge "overlay" that may separately result in a higher capital charge for the same business line, if that line is also generating fee income. The changes that may affect any particular financial product or service vary but could include impacts across all aspects of the proposal. For many of the derivatives and swaps activities in which banking entities engage, the aggregate impacts on different business lines could result from changes to the market risk rule, the calculation of credit valuation adjustments, and the treatment of securities financing transactions, among others.</p>
<p>So far, what I have described are just the aggregate effects of capital increases that would appear within the four corners of the U.S. Basel III endgame proposal. We know that these changes do not exist in a vacuum. A particular firm can also be impacted by changes to the global systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge and long-term debt requirements. The firm's business planning would also need to consider existing requirements, such as leverage and "total loss-absorbing capacity" requirements. By design, these elements are intended to be complementary, often seeking to capture different risks, operate as "backstop" capital standards, promote resiliency, and be available for recapitalization in resolution.</p>
<p>Despite the goal that the capital framework operates in a holistic fashion, the rulemaking process in the United States has taken a fragmented approach. This process has seemed to ignore the interrelationships of the requirements. We cannot fully understand the intended and unintended consequences of any regulatory reform, including capital reform, without using a broader lens to consider the interconnections and interrelationships among different capital and debt requirements that apply in the banking system.</p>
<p>This narrow approach to rulemaking&mdash;focusing on a specific reform, without considering the broader framework&mdash;has created a corresponding narrowness when we think about the consequences of regulatory reform. This challenge has been particularly acute in the capital and debt space simply because there are so many requirements that are intended to operate in a complementary way, and that in the aggregate may overlap or conflict, generating unintended consequences. The Federal Reserve has expressly acknowledged the complementary nature of these requirements, for example in noting that some leverage ratio requirements operate as a backstop to risk-based capital requirements.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240626a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5">5</a>&nbsp;And yet, the discussions of costs and benefits of reform tend to disregard the aggregate impact across rules, even when related reforms are proposed at the same time and the aggregate impacts can be identified and assessed.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240626a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6">6</a></p>
<p><em>Considering direct and indirect consequences</em><br />With respect to the Basel III "endgame" reforms, much of the discussion of consequences has focused on the direct consequences to the availability and price of credit, resulting from the proposed changes to risk-weighted assets. These issues resonate with households and businesses. Everyone understands the direct impact on their own household finances or their business's bottom line from higher costs of lending. Often overlooked are the direct and indirect consequences of capital reforms on financial products such as derivatives and swaps. These products can seem exotic to the public, but we know they play a significant role in the financial system and the broader economy, including commodities price hedging by end-users, such as agricultural producers. And it is certainly foreseeable that proposed capital reforms could impair market liquidity.</p>
<p>We also know that regulatory reforms&mdash;especially capital reforms with a direct link to particular products, services, and markets&mdash;can cause broader changes in firm behavior. Some banks may raise prices on particular products based on their internal allocation of increased capital charges. And some banks may discontinue certain products or services that cannot be offered in a cost-effective way. These choices will impact the competitive landscape into the future, and in some cases&mdash;such as where significant economies of scale are required to offer a product or service&mdash;the end result may be that some banks exit certain product markets, resulting in increased concentration and higher prices for households and businesses.</p>
<p>While I am acutely aware of our need to consider these costs and price effects, I am also aware that regulators sitting in Washington, D.C. are not well-equipped to query and understand these real-world consequences of reform. In my view, the commenter feedback we have received on these issues has helped to illuminate these consequences. My hope is that we take them into account when moving forward to implement the Basel III endgame standards.</p>
<p><em>The path forward</em><br />I do see a path forward to implement Basel III, one that not only addresses the overall calibration and international consistency and comparability, but also makes more granular changes that will improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the rule. In terms of this path, I will briefly outline what I see as necessary procedural steps, while also providing a non-exclusive list of substantive changes that I believe are necessary to improve the proposal.</p>
<p>In October 2023, the Federal Reserve initiated a data collection to gather information from the banks affected by the U.S. proposal. I am hopeful that these data will allow regulators to better understand the proposal's impact and identify areas for revision. Any next step in this rulemaking process will require broad and material changes. It should also be accompanied by a data-driven analysis of the proposal and be informed by the significant public input received during the rulemaking process. This should assist policymakers in creating a path to improve the rulemaking. My hope is that policymakers pay closer attention to the balance of costs and benefits while considering the direct and indirect consequences of the capital reform.</p>
<p>I have previously identified a number of specific areas and procedural steps that would be necessary to address in any future efforts to revise this proposal. Some of these issues include</p>
<ul>
<li>addressing redundancy in the capital framework (for example, between the new market risk and operational risk requirements, and the stress capital buffer);</li>
<li>recalibrating the market risk rule specifically, where some of the biggest outlier increases in risk-weighted assets would appear;</li>
<li>adopting a more reasonable treatment for non-interest and fee-based income through the operational risk requirements, which could deter banks from diversifying revenue streams, even though such diversification can enhance an institution's stability and resilience;</li>
<li>reviewing the impact of capital requirements, including leverage ratio requirements, on U.S. Treasury market intermediation and liquidity;</li>
<li>incorporating tailoring in the applicability of Basel III capital reforms, specifically looking at whether each element of the Basel III capital proposal is appropriate for non-G-SIB firms that are not internationally active; and</li>
<li>re-proposing the Basel III standards to address the broad and material reforms that I believe should be included in any final rule, including granular changes to address the specific issues raised by commenters, as appropriate.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240626a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7">7</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While these steps would be a reasonable starting place, they are not a replacement for a data-driven analysis and a careful review of the comments submitted. This would result in a better proposal that includes not only changes to address these concerns, but also the many other concerns raised by the public.</p>
<p><strong>Closing Thoughts</strong><br />It has been a pleasure speaking with you today. Your industry plays an important role not only in the U.S. economy, but also in the broader world economy. It is imperative that regulators not lose sight of the practical implications of regulatory reform, even as the U.S. considers the next steps in moving forward to adopt the final Basel III capital reforms.</p>

<p>The Fintech Open Source Foundation (<a href="https://pr.report/do6">FINOS</a>), the financial services umbrella of the Linux Foundation, is proud to announce the addition of new members <a href="https://pr.report/do7">to its ecosystem</a>: <a href="https://pr.report/do8">DTCC</a>, <a href="https://pr.report/do9">FactSet</a>, <a href="https://pr.report/doa">Intel</a>, <a href="https://pr.report/dob">Japan Securities Clearing Corporation (JSCC) </a>have joined as Gold members, and <a href="https://pr.report/doc">Amazon Web Services (AWS)</a>, <a href="https://pr.report/dod">Provectus</a>, and <a href="https://pr.report/doe">Testify Sec</a> have joined as Silver members. Additionally, <a href="https://pr.report/dof">interop.io</a> has elevated its commitment from Silver to Gold Membership. These companies join FINOS to contribute to open collaborations that benefit the entire financial services industry's value chain, like the recently announced <a href="https://pr.report/dog">AI Strategic Initiative</a>.</p>
<p>"I couldn't be more thrilled to welcome so many globally recognized organizations to the FINOS community," said Gabriele Columbro, Executive Director of FINOS and GM of Linux Foundation Europe. "Not only does the increased commitment of existing contributors like FactSet and interop.io demonstrate once more the value our most established projects like FDC3 are delivering across the industry, but the additions of JSCC, AWS, Provectus and Testify Sec strengthen our position as "the commons" for financial services and will undoubtedly fuel our <a href="https://pr.report/doh">strategic initiatives</a> in 2024 and beyond "</p>
<h4><b>New Members React</b></h4>
<p>DTCC, the premier post-trade market infrastructure for the global financial services industry, has joined the FINOS community as a Gold member.</p>
<p>"DTCC is excited to join the FINOS community and collaborate with other industry leaders to help advance innovation across the financial technology landscape. Given our position as a highly regulated entity in the global financial markets, we look forward to sharing our knowledge and experience, as well as participating in FINOS' strategic initiatives that align with DTCC's focus areas including the responsible governance and use of Artificial Intelligence and Common Cloud Controls and the Common Domain Model (CDM)," stated Johnna Powell, Managing Director, Global Head of Technology, Research and Innovation, at DTCC.</p>
<p>FactSet, a global financial digital platform and enterprise solutions provider, joins FINOS to leverage OSFF and the member only <a href="https://pr.report/doi">AI Readiness SIG</a>.</p>
<p>"A key pillar of FactSet's strategy is to create a flexible ecosystem for customers by facilitating the integration of datasets and interoperability of applications and systems. We see this as a way to unlock true efficiency for our customers and the financial industry. For several years, FactSet has been involved with FINOS through contributions to FDC3 (Financial Desktop Connectivity and Collaboration Consortium), and we are excited to officially join FINOS as members and expand our contribution to even more critical workstreams they support. AI Readiness is a topic of great importance to us, our clients, and the financial industry, and we look forward to sharing our expertise and collaborating with clients and peers to solve our biggest challenges collectively," said Kate Stepp, Chief Technology Officer at FactSet.</p>

<p>interop.io, a long standing FINOS member and lead maintainer of the FDC3 project, has upgraded to Gold Membership to leverage the extensive training, certification and software conformance benefits offered by FINOS.</p>
<p>​​"We've been an active participant and member of FINOS since 2017 and are proud to be upgrading to a Gold membership. As a firm, we continue to invest heavily in open standards and lead the FDC3 working groups. FINOS is the key that unlocks collaboration across open source and open standards inside the financial services industry," said Dan Schleifer, President and Co-Founder at interop.io.</p>
<p>AWS, a leading cloud service provider (CSP), joins FINOS to contribute its High Throughput Computing-Grid (HTC-grid) project to the open source community. The <a href="https://pr.report/doj">AWS HTC-Grid-project</a> aims to provide scalable, secure, and efficient computing solutions for the financial services industry.</p>
<p>"Financial services institutions are facing immense computational demands and the pressing need for modernization," said Adam Honor&eacute;, Head of Financial Services Service Development, at AWS. "That's why we open sourced the HTC-Grid project in 2022 to help any customer handle massive volumes of short and long-running tasks with unparalleled throughput, low latency, and seamless infrastructure orchestration.

<title>ECB Makes Boerse Stuttgart Group The Only European Exchange Operator To Participate In EU-Wide Blockchain Tests - Testing Of Market Infrastructure For Tokenized Securities  - Direct Settlement On The Blockchain With Six Partner Banks And Bundesbank</title>

<div> Blockchain, securities, settlement, ECB tests, Boerse Stuttgart Group
Summary:<br />Boerse Stuttgart Group participates in ECB tests for blockchain-based settlement of tokenized securities with major banks, aiming to shape future digital European market infrastructure.<br />Summary: <div>
<p>Boerse Stuttgart Group is the only exchange operator in Europe to have successfully applied for the second wave of the European Central Bank's (ECB) EU-wide tests, in which the settlement of blockchain-based financial transactions against central bank money is being explored.</p>
<p>With its partners Commerzbank, Deutsche Bank, DZ Bank, LBBW, Bankhaus Metzler and V-Bank, Boerse Stuttgart Group tests the settlement of exchange transactions with tokenized securities against euros for the first time. The banks act as trading and settlement participants and are directly connected to the new blockchain-based settlement solution of Boerse Stuttgart Group. The Deutsche Bundesbank is providing its trigger solution for the test, which connects blockchain transactions with the traditional euro payment system.</p>
<p>Boerse Stuttgart Group settles secondary market transactions of tokenized securities directly between trading participants on the blockchain &ndash; within minutes, without a central securities depository and against payments in central bank money. This innovative, end-to-end delivery-versus-payment process is particularly efficient, enables peer-to-peer settlement and reduces the number of intermediaries and counterparty risks.</p>
<p>"We are a pioneer in digital assets, and we are convinced of the benefits of blockchain and tokenization for the European securities markets. That's why we want to shape the future digital European market infrastructure for tokenized securities. In the EU, we are taking the first important step with the ECB tests. In Switzerland, we are even further ahead: BX Digital, our exchange for the trading and settlement of tokenized securities, is set to launch in the second half of 2024. It is fully regulated and will use our self-developed, blockchain-based settlement solution," says Dr Matthias Voelkel, CEO of Boerse Stuttgart Group.</p>
<p>Until November, Boerse Stuttgart Group will implement its use case in a test environment with the participating banks. The aim is to gain practical insights into the scalability, efficiency and speed of the settlement process involving central bank money. On behalf of Boerse Stuttgart Group, its broker EUWAX AG and its crypto custodian Boerse Stuttgart Digital Custody are also involved in the ECB tests.</p>

Summary:
Synechron acquires Chamonix IT and Exposé, doubling its presence in Australia and enhancing its digital transformation capabilities in key industries.<br /><br /> <div>
<p>Synechron, a global leader in digital transformation consulting for the financial and technology sectors, is proud to announce that it has executed a definitive agreement for the acquisition of&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://chamonix.com.au/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Chamonix IT Management Consulting Pty Ltd</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://exposedata.com.au/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Expos&eacute; Data Pty Ltd</a>. Both companies are headquartered in Adelaide, Australia, with additional operations in Melbourne and Brisbane and share a common goal of delivering digital transformation, artificial intelligence, and analytics expertise to clients across several key industries including government, healthcare, utilities, energy, and education. The definitive agreement with respect to the acquisition was signed on Tuesday, 25 June, 2024, and is subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by the Australian Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB).</p>
<p>Chamonix IT, established in 2010, is the leading provider of digital transformation services to organizations in South Australia. With a skilled team of approximately 150 professionals, Chamonix IT has been pivotal in delivering cutting-edge solutions that address complex challenges and drive significant outcomes for enterprise-level and public sector clients. Chamonix IT&rsquo;s founders established Expos&eacute; as a new company in 2016 to bring the same level of expertise, this time focused specifically on data science and engineering, data modelling and visualization, and artificial intelligence.

With these additions, Synechron has effectively doubled its presence in the country, achieving coverage across major sectors.

Summary:<br />Singapore launches National Asset Recovery Strategy to combat sophisticated money laundering, focusing on detection, prevention, and international cooperation.<br /> <div>

<div class="wrap:l m-x:a mas-section__banner-item">
<div class="_mas-typeset contain m-t:l m-b:3xl mas-rte-content">
<p><span>Singapore today published our National Asset Recovery Strategy, setting out our comprehensive approach towards the recovery of illicit funds and assets from criminals, and the forfeiture of these assets or their return to victims. Announced by Prime Minister and Minister for Finance Lawrence Wong at the opening of the Financial Action Task Force Plenary Meeting this morning, the National Asset Recovery Strategy is part of Singapore&rsquo;s continued efforts to enhance its Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) regime.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>2.<span> </span>Globally, money laundering activities are increasingly sophisticated, involving swift movements of large sums of illicit funds across jurisdictions, and affecting a significant number of victims. Specific to Singapore, a sizeable proportion of the money laundering cases here are transnational in nature, involving foreign predicate offences and foreign crime syndicates which employ sophisticated and complex methods, including layering tactics and digital technologies, to conceal the cross-border movement of their illicit funds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.<span> </span>Asset recovery is one of the key pillars of Singapore&rsquo;s AML regime.&nbsp; It seeks to deter the flow of illicit assets through Singapore&rsquo;s financial ecosystem, while remaining welcoming to legitimate businesses. Between January 2019 and June 2024, Singapore seized S$6 billion linked to criminal and money laundering activities &ndash; of which S$416 million have been returned to victims, and S$1 billion have been forfeited to the State. The large bulk of the remainder is linked to still ongoing investigations or court proceedings.</p>
<p>4.<span> </span>Successful asset recovery requires a multi-faceted approach. To this end, Singapore&rsquo;s National Asset Recovery Strategy focuses on four pillars, namely to:</p>
<p>a.<span>&nbsp;</span><span>Detect</span>&nbsp;suspicious and criminal activities by tracing the illicit funds;&nbsp;</p>
<p>b.<span>&nbsp;</span><span>Deprive&nbsp;</span>criminals of their ill-gotten proceeds through prompt seizure and confiscation;&nbsp;</p>
<p>c.<span>&nbsp;</span><span>Deliver&nbsp;</span>maximum recovery of assets for forfeiture and restitution to victims; and</p>
<p>d.<span>&nbsp;</span><span>Deter&nbsp;</span>criminals from using Singapore to hide, move, or enjoy their illicit assets.</p>
<p>5.<span> </span>Singapore implements these four pillars through upstream loss prevention efforts, and a whole-of-society approach. We have strengthened partnerships with our international counterparts, and community and private sector stakeholders, in asset recovery and loss prevention efforts. For instance, the Singapore Police Force&rsquo;s Anti-Scam Command and the local banks sent more than 16,700 SMS alerts from March to April 2024 to warn more than 12,500 bank customers, whom the authorities had detected were in the process of being scammed. This resulted in the disruption of more than 3,000 scams and averted losses of over S$100 million.&nbsp;</p>
<p>6.<span> </span>Singapore recognises that criminal activities and methods are constantly evolving. We are committed to continually enhancing our AML/CFT regime to prevent criminals from exploiting Singapore&rsquo;s ecosystem. Where we detect any abuse by criminals, we will track them down, and take them to task, including depriving them of their ill-gotten assets.

<title>ASIC Calls On Market Intermediaries To Strengthen Supervision Of Business Communications</title>

<div> ASIC, market intermediaries, business communications, supervision, financial services laws
Summary:<br />ASIC urges market intermediaries to strengthen supervision of business communications to prevent misconduct and comply with financial services laws. <div>
<p>ASIC is calling on market intermediaries to strengthen their supervisory arrangements for recording and monitoring representatives&rsquo; business communications to prevent, detect and promptly address misconduct and contraventions of financial services laws.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/markets/market-supervision/supervising-your-representatives-business-communications/" title="Supervising your representatives&rsquo; business communications">Information Sheet 283</a>&nbsp;<em>Supervising your representatives&rsquo; business communications&nbsp;</em>(INFO 283) responds to concerns that the use of unmonitored communication channels and encrypted communication applications in business communications can significantly increase the risk of misconduct going undetected.</p>
<p>The Information Sheet gives practical guidance to market intermediaries (investment banks, participants of exchange and over-the-counter markets, securities dealers and corporate advisers) about managing these risks, embedding supervisory arrangements for business communications and reviewing their effectiveness in compliance with their obligations under the&nbsp;<em>Corporations Act 2001</em>&nbsp;and ASIC market integrity rules.</p>
<p>ASIC Commissioner Simone Constant said, &lsquo;Bankers, dealers and market participants have important roles as gatekeepers to Australia&rsquo;s financial markets and stewards of market integrity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We expect them to maintain strong and effective supervisory arrangements to manage the risk of harm to clients and to market integrity. Misconduct, such as the misuse of confidential or inside information, market abuse, insider trading, market manipulation, bribery and fraud, hurt Australian investors by damaging their confidence and wiping value from their investments.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rapidly evolving technologies, use of personal devices and wider adoption of remote or hybrid working arrangements present challenges for monitoring and recordkeeping for licensees. We expect market intermediaries to periodically review their arrangements for supervision of business communications so they are working effectively, and are appropriate for the nature, scale, and complexity of their business. With almost every working or retired Australian having a share in Australian markets, market integrity is a duty owed to every Australian,&rsquo; Ms Constant said.</p>
<p>The Information Sheet deals with common challenges and pitfalls for market intermediaries in effectively supervising their representatives&rsquo; business communications, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>the emergence of new and popular communication channels that are outside the scope of their surveillance systems;</li>
<li>weak or no controls to identify where data used in surveillance systems is incomplete or erroneous; and</li>
<li>reliance on &rsquo;out of the box&rsquo; settings of vendor-provided communication surveillance systems and a failure to routinely calibrate alert parameters.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The risks arising from the widespread use of personal devices and unapproved communication channels were also highlighted by the recent actions taken by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission. These regulators reached record-breaking settlements with dozens of financial institutions for failures to maintain and preserve electronic communications.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Market intermediaries that are Australian financial services licensees are required to take reasonable steps to ensure their representatives comply with the financial services laws. This includes having adequate arrangements to monitor and supervise representatives&rsquo; communications as they relate to the business of the licensee.</p>
<p>Since 2016, ASIC continues to monitor the performance of substantial remediation programs required under court enforceable undertakings (CEUs) with several market intermediaries to (among other changes) strengthen systems, controls, training, guidance and frameworks for the monitoring and supervision of representatives in relation to spot foreign exchange contracts and BBSW-referenced products. Insights from this work are incorporated in INFO 283.</p>

<title>SEC Charges Meta Materials And Former CEOs With Market Manipulation, Fraud And Other Violations</title>

<div> Charges, Meta Materials Inc., market manipulation, SEC complaint, CEO<br />
Summary:<br />
SEC charges Meta Materials Inc. and former CEOs with market manipulation scheme, misleading investors, and violating securities laws. <div>
<div class="article-body">
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed charges against Meta Materials Inc. and its former CEOs, John Brda and George Palikaras. The company has agreed to settle the SEC&rsquo;s charges in an administrative proceeding, while the SEC&rsquo;s litigation against Brda and Palikaras will proceed in federal district court.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint against Brda and Palikaras alleges that, as a result of a concerted market manipulation scheme, Meta Materials, a Nevada corporation headquartered in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada, raised $137.5 million from investors in an at-the-market (ATM) offering in June 2021 immediately prior to the merger of Brda&rsquo;s Torchlight Energy Resources Inc. and Palikaras&rsquo; Metamaterial Inc. that formed Meta Materials.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that Brda and Palikaras planned and conducted the manipulative scheme that included, among other things, issuing a preferred stock dividend immediately before the merger. The complaint alleges that Brda and Palikaras told certain investors and consultants&mdash;and hinted via social media&mdash;that the dividend would force short sellers to exit their positions and trigger a &ldquo;short squeeze&rdquo; that would artificially raise the price of the company&rsquo;s common stock. The SEC further alleges that Brda and Palikaras also misrepresented the company&rsquo;s efforts to sell its oil and gas assets and distribute proceeds to preferred stockholders, giving investors a false impression of the value of the dividend. While investors held or bought the company&rsquo;s common stock to receive the dividend, the complaint alleges, the company was cashing in by selling $137.5 million in an ATM offering at prices that the company, Brda, and Palikaras knew were temporarily inflated by their manipulative scheme. &ldquo;We have two days,&rdquo; the complaint alleges Brda told Palikaras after the first day of the ATM offering, &ldquo;to take advantage of the squeeze...&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The conduct we allege was a sophisticated, yet brazen plan by a public company and its former CEOs to purposely mislead investors in the company&rsquo;s stock,&rdquo; said Eric Werner, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Fort Worth Regional Office. &ldquo;This conduct is particularly alarming because it involves public company CEOs who were more concerned with &lsquo;burning the shorts&rsquo; than creating long-term value for shareholders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint charges Brda and Palikaras with violating the antifraud and proxy disclosure provisions of the federal securities laws, and charges Brda with aiding and abetting Meta Materials&rsquo;s violations of the reporting, internal accounting controls, and books and records provisions. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, officer-and-director bars, and civil penalties from both defendants. The complaint also seeks disgorgement with pre-judgment interest from Brda.</p>
<p>The SEC also instituted a separate administrative proceeding against Meta Materials, entering a settled order finding that Meta Materials violated the antifraud, reporting, internal accounting controls, and books and records provisions of the federal securities laws. Without admitting or denying the findings, Meta Materials was ordered to cease and desist from violations of the relevant provisions of the federal securities laws and to pay a $1,000,000 penalty.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Christopher Rogers and Ty Martinez of the SEC&rsquo;s Fort Worth Regional Office under the supervision of Samantha Martin, B. David Fraser, and Mr. Werner. The SEC&rsquo;s litigation against Brda and Palikaras will be conducted by Patrick Disbennett and supervised by Keefe Bernstein.</p>
<p>A separate Commission investigation regarding subsequent events related to Meta Materials (MMTLP) remains ongoing. If you are an individual with information related to this investigation or any other related suspected fraud and you wish to contact the SEC staff, please submit a tip at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/tcr">SEC.gov</a>.</p>

<div> Inflation, Labor Market, Economic Activity, Monetary Policy, Financial Stability
Summary:<br /><br />The speaker discusses the progress of disinflation, the state of the labor market, economic activity, monetary policy, and financial stability. <div>
<p>Thank you, Barbara. It is a fitting time to be speaking again to the Economic Club of New York, because this month marks two years since my first Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20240625a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;At that meeting, we kicked off a series of large interest-rate increases, all of which I supported, because I am fully committed to bringing inflation sustainably back to our 2 percent target. As I said when I joined the Board, I care about both sides of the dual mandate Congress gives us, maximum employment and price stability. When inflation was well above target and the unemployment rate was historically low, we prioritized restoring price stability. Over the past year, inflation has slowed, and labor market tightness has eased, such that the risks to achieving our inflation and employment goals have moved toward better balance.</p>
<p>I think now is a good time to assess how the economy has evolved after rates have held steady at a restrictive level for nearly a year. Today, I will provide a progress report on disinflation, give you my outlook on the economy, and share my views on how to ensure that monetary policy brings inflation fully back to 2 percent over time while being attentive to the risk of a slowing labor market. I will conclude my remarks with a few words about my role as chair of the Board's Financial Stability Committee.</p>
<p><strong>Inflation</strong><br />As the U.S. and global economy recovered from the pandemic, rebounding demand came up against still-constrained supply, and inflation rose to the highest level in many years. In the past two years, 12-month inflation in the PCE price index has fallen from a peak above 7 percent to 2.7 percent in April, and it likely moved a bit lower in May based on consumer and producer price data. However, after rapid disinflation in the second half of last year, progress has slowed this year. My focus remains on making sure inflation is on a path to return sustainably to 2 percent. How do I think about making that determination? To respond, I think it is helpful to look at the underlying data.</p>
<p>Some price components have clearly improved. Food and energy price increases moderated significantly over the past two years as global commodity supplies recovered from the shock of Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. When excluding often-volatile food and energy costs, 12-month inflation in core goods prices is down from 7.6 percent in early 2022, returning to the trend of slightly negative inflation observed before the pandemic. The increased availability of computer chips and other material inputs led to a recovery in motor vehicle production and, along with restraint in aggregate demand, likely reduced supply&ndash;demand imbalances for durable goods, more generally.</p>
<p>Inflation in services, a spending category that accounts for about two-thirds of household budgets, has slowed significantly, though it remains noticeably above pre-pandemic rates. Specifically, housing services inflation has eased quite gradually, as it takes time for the moderation of increases in market rent&mdash;what a landlord charges a new tenant&mdash;to show through to broader measures of shelter costs. One possible explanation is that landlords raise rents for existing tenants only gradually over several years and are still moving those rents closer to the market rate.</p>
<p>Outside of housing, 12-month services inflation slowed over the course of last year from above 5 percent to below 3.5 percent but has stalled near that rate this year. That is still about 1 percentage point above the average pace during the two years before the pandemic. Some of the largest contributors to recent services inflation are imputed prices, including portfolio management fees that are affected by equity price increases. Other components of services inflation that are more reflective of supply and demand conditions in the economy have continued to ease. Prices of hotel stays, airline tickets, and restaurant meals are illustrative.</p>
<p>I expect that the longer-run disinflation trend will continue as interest rates weigh on demand. Anecdotal reports, including from the Fed's Beige Book, suggest consumers are pushing back on price increases. Several national retailers have announced plans to lower prices on certain items, and there is increasing evidence that higher-income shoppers are trading down to discount stores. Two other important factors supporting this trend are well-anchored long-term inflation expectations and short-term inflation expectations falling back to near pre-pandemic levels.</p>
<p>My forecast is that three- and six-month inflation rates will continue to move lower on a bumpy path, as consumers' resistance to price increases is reflected in the inflation data. I expect 12-month inflation will roughly move sideways for the rest of this year, with monthly data likely similar to the favorable readings during the second half of last year. Beyond that, I see inflation slowing more sharply next year, with housing-services inflation declining to reflect the past slowing in rents on new leases, core goods inflation remaining slightly negative, and inflation in core services excluding housing easing over time.</p>
<p><strong>Labor Market</strong><br />Turning to the other side of our dual mandate, the labor market has largely returned to a better alignment between supply and demand. Many indicators suggest the job market is roughly where it was before the pandemic&mdash;tight but not overheated. The unemployment rate was a still-low 4 percent in May, but it has gradually risen over the past year since touching a more than half-century low of 3.4 percent in April 2023. Last month's rate was also modestly above readings just before the pandemic took hold.</p>
<p>Layoffs remain low, and payroll growth has been solid so far this year, adding an average of 248,000 jobs a month, essentially matching last year's pace. Labor supply has expanded, partly reflecting a rise in immigration. Labor force participation has broadly rebounded from pandemic lows, except for those aged 65 or older. Women between the ages of 25 and 54 led the rebound, with their participation reaching 78.1 percent in May, the highest ever recorded. With more workers entering the economy, the monthly job gains needed to keep the unemployment rate steady likely has risen from just under 100,000 to nearly 200,000. Although these estimates are uncertain, such a breakeven pace may be a bit higher than the true pace of recent job gains, when taking into account data from the Quarterly Census for Employment and Wages. These data suggest that payroll job gains were overstated last year and may continue to be so this year. Thus, even the robust payroll numbers are consistent with a tight, but not overheating, labor market.</p>
<p>Signs of better balance in the labor market have come into focus. For example, the ratio of job vacancies to unemployment has fallen from a high of 2.0 in mid-2022 to 1.2 in April, in line with its pre-pandemic level. Workers are also less likely to leave their current jobs in search of new ones. The quits rate has fallen from 3.0 percent in April 2022 to 2.2 percent this April and is now below its 2019 average. This decline suggests a normalization following a period of high churn. Wage growth is outpacing inflation but is also moderating. Data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta show that the wage-growth differential between job changers and stayers has narrowed. Wage growth reflected in postings from online job boards, such as Indeed, has returned to pre-pandemic levels. These measures tend to adjust quickly to changes in labor market conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Activity</strong><br />Turning to the broader picture, the U.S. economy has rebounded robustly since the short but deep pandemic recession. Overall, gross domestic product (GDP) growth eased in the first quarter from the rate at the end of last year. However, much of the first-quarter weakness was in net exports and inventories, noisy components from which I do not take much signal, while growth in private domestic final purchases remained solid. Going forward, I expect economic growth to remain near the rate of potential growth, somewhat above 2 percent, which is boosted by the increase in the size of the labor force.</p>
<p>American consumers have driven the current expansion, bolstered by strong income growth. But recent data, including first-quarter household spending and retail sales for April and May, suggest that growth is slowing. And, in April, the total amount of credit-card balances and other types of revolving consumer debt declined for the first time since 2021. Signs of strain continue to emerge among consumers with low-to-moderate incomes, as their liquid savings and access to credit have increasingly become exhausted. Credit-card delinquency is<strong>&nbsp;</strong>on an upward trend, and the<strong>&nbsp;</strong>rate at which auto loans are transitioning into delinquency is at a 13-year high. These rates are not yet concerning for the overall economy but bear watching.</p>
<p>Offsetting some of the slowing in consumer spending, investment spending for equipment and intangibles, such as intellectual property and software, has been strong this year. After growing at about only a 1 percent pace last year, equipment and intangibles spending grew at a more than 4 percent annual rate in the first quarter. If that strength continues, it has the potential to increase productivity over time.</p>
<p>Productivity growth is one factor that could change the path of both the expansion and inflation. Last year's GDP growth of 3.1 percent came alongside more moderate employment gains, implying strong growth in productivity. The economy may have benefited from investment undertaken in response to strong demand when the labor market was tight. Productivity growth is volatile and difficult to measure, but if it remains strong, then a faster pace of economic growth might not be inflationary. While the pace of gains may have cooled from last year, I still lean toward optimism on innovation and productivity. Looking ahead, I see adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) technology as a potentially significant source of productivity growth, keeping in mind that breakthroughs, such as effective generative AI, will take time to fully reach their potential and disseminate throughout the economy and for complementary investment to bear fruit.</p>
<p><strong>Monetary Policy</strong><br />Considering the full view of economic data available at the time, my colleagues on the FOMC and I decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent when we met earlier this month. I believe our current monetary policy stance is restrictive, putting downward pressure on aggregate demand in the economy. With disinflation continuing, albeit at a slower pace this year, and the labor market having largely normalized, I see the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals as having moved toward better balance. Given our data dependence, we will closely monitor incoming information to determine the future path of policy.</p>
<p>Returning inflation sustainably to our 2 percent target is an ongoing process and not a fait accompli. In considering how restrictive policy is, I look at a broad range of indicators from financial and credit markets. For instance, the two-year real rate, derived from Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS, remains around 2.7 percent, up from an average of about 1/2 percent in the couple of years before the pandemic, while the 30-year mortgage rate is around 7 percent. Meanwhile, banks have significantly tightened credit standards over the past two years. In particular, small businesses and some small banks and community development financial institutions are experiencing diminished access to credit. Many of these businesses also face short-duration loans that need to be refinanced at higher interest rates. With rising delinquencies, a number of low-to-moderate-income households are also likely experiencing diminished access to credit. On the other hand, the largest firms and the largest banks do not report a lack of access to funding. Larger firms, like many homeowners, were able to lock in low interest rates for longer terms a few years ago, before rates rose.</p>
<p>Of course, the economic outlook is always uncertain. One way to address such uncertainty is to consider a range of scenarios and not just the baseline forecast. One scenario is the possibility that persistently high inflation durably increases inflation expectations. While this appears less likely than a year or two ago, I am very attentive to the evolution of inflation expectations. Such a risk would imply keeping monetary policy restrictive for longer. Another scenario would be that the economy and labor market weaken more sharply than expected in my baseline forecast. In that case, monetary policy would need to respond to such a threat to the employment side of the dual mandate.</p>
<p>Considering the balance of risks related to these scenarios, I believe that our current policy is well positioned to respond as needed to any changes in the economic outlook. With significant progress on inflation and the labor market cooling gradually, at some point it will be appropriate to reduce the level of policy restriction to maintain a healthy balance in the economy. The timing of any such adjustment will depend on how economic data evolve and what they imply for the economic outlook and balance of risks.</p>
<p><strong>Financial Stability</strong><br />Before I conclude, I would like to say a few words about the financial system's resilience. Following the 2007&ndash;09 financial crisis, a broad set of reforms was put in place to bolster financial stability. To ensure an ongoing focus on that area, the Board established its Committee on Financial Stability as a venue to discuss related developments and policy issues. Earlier this year, I became the chair of this committee.</p>
<p>Consistent with some easing of financial conditions since late last year, valuations for some asset categories have risen. Home prices, for example, have outstripped rent gains for several years. That leaves measures such as the price-to-rent ratio high relative to historical averages. Yet, these valuations have not led to an appreciable increase in risk-taking. While house prices have been growing rapidly, mortgage debt has not, and most households have ample equity cushions. As I said earlier, some households are experiencing financial strain, and rising delinquency rates suggest some caution. Borrowing by businesses and households has been expanding at rates below GDP growth for several years. I use the ratios of their debt levels to GDP as a rough proxy of whether the sectors are overleveraged, and those stand well below pre-pandemic levels.</p>
<p>Financial institutions and markets also appear broadly robust, with high capital and liquidity levels at the largest and most interconnected banks. While there is less visibility into nonbank financial institutions, this tightening cycle has seen markets absorb a number of risk events, suggesting that leverage does not appear too great. A subset of banks has a high concentration of commercial real estate (CRE) loans, and supervisors are working closely with those banks. As the CRE market adapts to the shifting preference for downtown office space, prices for some buildings will likely continue to fall, and more loans will need to be worked out as they come due. However, markets have broadly taken the bumps in stride so far, without notable spillovers.</p>
<p>In sum, I see a system that has some vulnerabilities but also important sources of resilience and, on balance, is not currently positioned to unusually amplify any future shock. A stable and resilient financial system is critical to the well-being of households and firms, allowing them to access credit, and it is essential for the Federal Reserve to achieve its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability.</p>
<p>Thank you. It is a pleasure to be back at the Economic Club of New York. I look forward to continuing our conversation.</p>

<div> Commission, comparability determinations, capital, financial reporting, nonbank SDs
Summary:<br /><br />The Commission approved four comparability determinations for capital and financial reporting requirements applicable to nonbank SDs in four foreign jurisdictions. This ensures global oversight while avoiding duplicative requirements. <div>
<p>I support the Commission&rsquo;s approval of four comparability determinations and related orders finding that the capital and financial reporting requirements in Japan, Mexico, the European Union (France and Germany), and the United Kingdom (for swap dealers (SDs) designated for prudential supervision by the UK Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA)) are comparable to the Commission&rsquo;s capital and financial reporting requirements applicable to nonbank SDs. These are the first comparability determinations that the Commission has finalized for applications filed following the July 2020 adoption of its regulatory framework for substituted compliance for non-U.S. domiciled nonbank SDs.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/behnamstatement062524?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt1" id="fntref1" name="fntref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;There are currently 15 non-U.S. nonbank SDs that are eligible to comply with these conditional orders: three in Japan; three in Mexico; two in Germany and one in France for the EU; and six in the UK that are PRA-designated.</p>
<p>As part of the process leading to the Commission&rsquo;s final comparability determinations and orders, Commission staff engaged in a thorough analysis of each foreign jurisdictions&rsquo; capital and financial reporting frameworks and considered the public comments received on the proposed determinations and orders. Based on those reviews, the Commission has determined that the respective foreign jurisdictions&rsquo; rules are comparable in purpose and effect, and achieve comparable outcomes, to the CFTC&rsquo;s capital and financial reporting rules. Specifically, the Commission considered the scope and objectives of the foreign regulators&rsquo; capital adequacy and financial reporting requirements; the ability of those regulators to supervise and enforce compliance with their respective capital and financial reporting requirements; and other facts or circumstances the Commission deemed relevant for each of the applications.</p>
<p>In certain instances, the Commission found that a foreign jurisdiction&rsquo;s rules impose stricter standards. In limited circumstances, where the Commission concluded that a foreign jurisdiction lacks comparable and comprehensive requirements on a specific issue, the Commission included a targeted condition designed to impose an equally stringent standard. The Commission has issued the final orders consistent with its authority to issue a comparability determination with the conditions it deems appropriate. These conditions aim to ensure that the orders only apply to nonbank SDs that are eligible for substituted compliance in these respective jurisdictions and that those non-U.S. nonbank SDs comply with the foreign country&rsquo;s capital and financial reporting requirements as well as certain additional capital, financial reporting, recordkeeping, and regulatory notice requirements. This approach acknowledges that jurisdictions may adopt unique approaches to achieving comparable outcomes. As a result, the Commission has focused on whether the applicable foreign jurisdiction&rsquo;s capital and financial reporting requirements achieve comparable outcomes to the corresponding Commission requirements for nonbank SDs, not whether they are comparable in every aspect or contain identical elements.</p>
<p>With these comparability determinations, the Commission fully retains its enforcement and examination authority as well as its ability to obtain financial and event specific reporting to maintain direct oversight of nonbank SDs located in these four jurisdictions. The avoidance of duplicative requirements without a commensurate benefit to the Commission&rsquo;s oversight function reflects the Commission&rsquo;s approach to recognizing the global nature of the swap markets with dually-registered SDs that operate in multiple jurisdictions, which mandate prudent capital and financial reporting requirements. This is, however, an added benefit and not the Commission&rsquo;s sole justification for issuing these comparability determinations.</p>
<p>The comparability orders will become effective upon their publication in the Federal Register. For several order conditions, the Commission is granting an additional compliance period of 180 calendar days. To rely on a comparability order, an eligible non-U.S. nonbank SD must notify the Commission of its intention to satisfy the Commission&rsquo;s capital and financial requirements by substituted compliance and receive a Commission confirmation before relying on a determination.</p>
<p>I appreciate the hard work and dedication of the staff in the Market Participants Division over the past several years to propose and finalize these four determinations. I also thank the staff in the Office of the General Counsel and the Office of International Affairs for their support on these matters.</p>

<p><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission announced today it has approved four comparability determinations and related comparability orders granting conditional substituted compliance in connection with the CFTC&rsquo;s capital and financial reporting requirements to certain CFTC-registered nonbank swap dealers organized and domiciled in Japan, Mexico, the European Union (France and Germany), or the United Kingdom.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Pursuant to the orders, non-U.S. nonbank swap dealers subject to prudential regulation by the Financial Services Agency of Japan, the National Banking and Securities Commission of Mexico and the Mexican Central Bank, the European Central Bank, or the United Kingdom Prudential Regulation Authority may satisfy certain Commodity Exchange Act capital and financial reporting requirements by being subject to, and complying with, comparable capital and financial reporting requirements under the respective foreign jurisdiction&rsquo;s laws and regulations, subject to specified conditions.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The comparability orders will become effective upon their publication in the Federal Register. For several order conditions imposing new obligations on non-U.S. nonbank swap dealers, the CFTC is granting an additional compliance period of 180 calendar days.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To rely on a comparability order, an eligible non-U.S. nonbank swap dealer must notify the CFTC of its intention to satisfy the CFTC&rsquo;s capital and financial requirements by substituted compliance. The non-U.S. nonbank swap dealer may not apply substituted compliance until it receives confirmation from CFTC staff that the swap dealer may do so. The notice of intent must include certain representations enumerated in the respective order&rsquo;s conditions and must be submitted to the following address:&nbsp;<a href="mailto:MPDFinancialRequirements@cftc.gov">MPDFinancialRequirements@cftc.gov</a><span>.</span></span></span></p>

<p>The composition of the European parliament may be different following recent elections, but the list of challenges facing EU policymakers &ndash; European competitiveness, economic resilience, energy security and sustainability &ndash; remains the same. Tackling those challenges can&rsquo;t be achieved without having strong, liquid capital markets that support financing, investment and risk management &ndash; which means a well-functioning derivatives market is an important part of the puzzle.</p>
<p>Derivatives play a critical role in the efficient performance of markets and mobilization of capital by enabling corporates, pension funds, insurance companies, asset managers, banks, government agencies and others to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2021/01/28/video-who-uses-derivatives-and-why/">manage risk</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/04/17/isda-animation-video-the-value-of-derivatives/">reduce funding costs</a>, enhance investment returns and achieve price discovery. This encourages liquidity and competition and helps to alleviate uncertainty, giving firms the confidence to lend, borrow and invest &ndash; which, in turn, contributes to economic growth. As such, we recently&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/05/28/isda-submits-policy-paper-on-derivatives-and-eu-agenda-to-european-commission/">published a paper</a>&nbsp;that sets out a series of policy measures the European Commission (EC) could take to further strengthen the EU derivatives market and support the bloc&rsquo;s strategic priorities.</p>
<p>For example, there are several derivatives-related initiatives the EC could adopt to improve the vibrancy of EU financial markets, which would help support the competitiveness of the economy. These include encouraging innovations in risk management by ensuring the treatment of financial markets and derivatives activity is proportionate to the underlying risks, improving the attractiveness of EU derivatives market infrastructure and removing barriers to entry, calibrating transparency and reporting rules to establish the EU as a global trading hub, and aligning regulatory requirements to ensure the EU is competitive on an international basis.</p>
<p>Specifically, the EC should allow EU entities to access global liquidity pools without barriers that could hamper effective risk management. That could be achieved by granting non-time-limited equivalence for UK central counterparties (CCPs) well in advance of the June 30, 2025 expiry of the current equivalence decision, and by allowing subsidiaries of EU firms to access non-EU CCPs that have not obtained recognition under the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) without being subject to punitive capital requirements.</p>
<p>Regulators should also review the EU&rsquo;s transparency framework to ensure useful information is published and to reduce barriers to entry for global market participants &ndash; for instance, by adopting international standards like unique product identifiers and by facilitating machine-readable and executable reporting. In the latter case, ISDA has adopted its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2023/04/04/drr-infohub/">Digital Regulatory Reporting initiative</a>&nbsp;for the revised reporting rules under EMIR, enabling firms to digitally report data accurately, cost-effectively and efficiently.</p>
<p>When it comes to reinforcing the resilience of the EU, ISDA recommends several key policy measures to strengthen European financial markets to ensure they continue to serve the real economy, even during stressed conditions. This includes automating collateral management processes to improve efficiency and cut operational and liquidity risks. To help enable this, ISDA has developed several&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2023/02/16/isda-collateral-initiatives/">use cases for standardizing and automating collateral processes</a>&nbsp;using the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/cdm/">Common Domain Model</a>, a free-to-use data standard for financial products, trades and lifecycle events. ISDA also recommends reducing barriers to accepting money market funds as eligible collateral for cleared and non-cleared derivatives &ndash; something that would provide investors with more options when faced with elevated margin calls during periods of volatility.</p>
<p>The transition to a climate-neutral and sustainable economy remains a matter of urgency in the EU and elsewhere. This shift is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.i4ce.org/en/publication/european-climate-investment-deficit-report-investment-pathway-europe-future/#:%7E:text=As%20real%2Deconomy%20investments%20reached,2022%20(IMF%2C%202023).">estimated to require approximately &euro;400 billion per year in additional green investment</a>&nbsp;in the EU alone. Deep, liquid financial markets will be critical to channel the necessary capital to green technologies and infrastructure, and derivatives will play an important role in enabling firms to optimize funding costs and manage risks. In the paper, ISDA sets out several recommendations aimed at improving transparency and disclosure requirements and developing a robust, credible system for carbon credits that is as internationally connected as possible &ndash; for example, by linking the EU and UK emissions trading systems.</p>
<p>Ultimately, derivatives help drive vibrant, competitive markets and enable firms to manage risk and invest. We think our recommendations will create a safer, more efficient EU derivatives market, which will help support the key EU objectives of boosting competitiveness and economic security, while helping to achieve a successful green transition.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li><span>The index will consist of 110 stocks, following the additions of Ezentis, MFE-Media and Puig and the delistings of Applus, Inmobiliaria del Sur, Lingotes Especiales and Opdenergy</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Management Committee of the Madrid Stock Exchange General Index (IGBM) has decided, at the ordinary review meeting of the Index, that both the IGBM and the Total Index will consist of 110 listed companies in the second half of 2024, following the additions of&nbsp;<span>Ezentis, MFE-Media&nbsp;</span>and<span>&nbsp;Puig</span>&nbsp;and the delistings of&nbsp;<span>Applus, Inmobiliaria del Sur, Lingotes Especiales&nbsp;</span>and<span>&nbsp;Opdenergy</span>.</p>
<p>The three new companies entering the indices meet the necessary requirements to do so, while the exclusions of Applus and Opdenergy are due to their respective takeover bids and those of Inmobiliaria del Sur and Lingotes Especiales are due to their failure to meet these requirements.</p>
<p>The final weightings of sectors, sub-sectors and securities will be published in the Madrid Stock Exchange&rsquo;s Official Daily Bulletin on June 28th &nbsp;2024, which can be accessed via&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bolsasymercados.es/bme-exchange/en/Prices-and-Markets/Statistics/Trading-Bulletin-Madrid">this link</a>.</p>

<title>Central Banks Must Prepare For AI's Profound Impact On Economy And Financial System: BIS</title>

<div> Keywords: Central banks, artificial intelligence, economic impact, financial system, data

Summary:
Central banks need to embrace AI for better economic and price stability. AI can enhance nowcasting, but also introduce risks like cyber attacks. The BIS Innovation Hub is testing AI capabilities with central bank partners.
<br /><br />Summary: Central banks must use AI for economic stability, enhance nowcasting, and manage risks. The BIS Innovation Hub is testing AI capabilities for various financial applications. <div>
<div id="cmsContent">
<ul>
<li>Central banks should embrace artificial intelligence (AI), anticipating its impact on the economy and financial system and harnessing it in their own operations. Widespread adoption could have repercussions for inflation dynamics.</li>
<li>The financial sector is among the most exposed to the benefits and risks of AI. Benefits include improvements for lending and payments; risks include more sophisticated cyber attacks.</li>
<li>The increased importance of data as a cornerstone of the AI revolution hastens the need for central bank cooperation.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>The rapid adoption of AI requires central banks to embrace the new technology, the Bank for International Settlements said today, urging policymakers to anticipate the transformative effects of AI on the economy and to use it to sharpen their own analytical tools in pursuit of financial and price stability.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/arpdf/ar2024e3.htm"><span class="firstword">special</span>&nbsp;chapter</a>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;<em>BIS Annual Economic Report 2024</em>&nbsp;lays out the implications of new AI applications for central banks. AI is poised to impact the financial system, labour markets, productivity and economic growth. With widespread adoption, it could enhance firms' ability to adjust prices faster in response to macro-economic changes with repercussions for inflation dynamics. The job of central banks as stewards of the economy will also be directly affected as frontline users of AI tools.</p>
<p>Central bank use cases for AI include enhancing nowcasting by using real-time data to better predict inflation and other economic variables and to sift through data for financial system vulnerabilities, allowing authorities to better manage risks. Data have become an even more valuable resource with the advent of AI and will be the cornerstone of central banks' use of the technology.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="pbtxt">
<div class="pbtxtcontent">
<p>New generation AI models have captured our collective imagination through their uncanny abilities, but they also have a direct bearing on how central banks do their jobs. Vast amounts of data could provide us with faster and richer information to detect patterns and latent risks in the economy and financial system. All this could help central banks predict and steer the economy better.</p>
</div>

<div class="pbquoteauthor">Hyun Song Shin, Head of Research and Economic Adviser at the BIS</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The effects on demand and therefore on inflationary pressures will depend on how quickly displaced workers can find new jobs, and whether households and firms correctly anticipate future gains from AI. In the short-run, supply could outstrip demand, which could lower pressures but those effects could reverse over time as demand also catches up through higher incomes. Central banks will need to stay attuned to these dynamics in their monetary policy.</p>
<p>In the financial sector, AI can improve efficiencies and lower costs for payments, lending, insurance and asset management, the report said. The BIS cautioned that AI also introduces risks, such as new types of cyber attacks, and may amplify existing ones, such as herding, runs and fire sales.</p>
<p>The BIS Innovation Hub is testing AI's capabilities in several areas together with central bank partners.</p>

<p>Central banks were early adopters of machine learning and are therefore well positioned to make the most of AI's ability to impose structure on vast troves of unstructured data.<br /><br />For example, Project Aurora explores how to detect money laundering activities from payments data and Project Raven uses AI to enhance cyber resilience, to mention just two from our portfolio.</p>

<div> trading activity, credit futures, duration risk, margin offsets, centralized marketplace
Summary:<br /> CME Group's new U.S. Credit futures have seen strong trading activity, offering capital efficient ways to manage duration risk and credit exposure with margin offsets. They provide bid-offer spreads lower than 0.1% of index points and access to an anonymous, centralized marketplace. Portfolio managers at PGIM Fixed Income are welcoming the new credit index futures at CME Group, as it enables them to hedge their portfolios and provide greater liquidity to clients. The credit futures are the first to help market participants manage duration risk through an intercommodity spread with U.S. Treasury futures and gain exposure to and manage credit component risk through futures on Bloomberg's duration-hedged index. Clients can benefit from automatic margin offsets against CME Group's Interest Rate and Equity Index futures. <div>
<p><a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4198928-1&amp;h=2883294352&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cmegroup.com%2F&amp;a=CME+Group" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">CME Group</a>, the world's leading derivatives marketplace, today announced that its new&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;Credit futures have traded 415 contracts since their launch on&nbsp;June 17.</p>
<p>"In just one week since launch, our credit futures are generating strong trading activity as clients turn to more capital efficient ways to manage their duration risk and&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;credit exposure," said&nbsp;
Agha Mirza, CME Group Global Head of Rates and OTC Products. "These products have already provided bid-offer spreads lower than 0.1% of index points, as well as offered access to an anonymous, centralized marketplace with significant potential margin offsets."</p>
<p>"We welcome the new credit index futures at CME Group," said&nbsp;
Matthew Angelucci, Portfolio Manager at&nbsp;PGIM Fixed Income. "The opportunity to isolate credit or duration risk while benefiting from margin offsets with&nbsp;CME Group's&nbsp;deeply liquid futures markets enables us to hedge our portfolios and provide greater liquidity to a greater number of clients."</p>
<p>CME Group&nbsp;credit futures are the first futures contracts to help market participants manage duration risk through an intercommodity spread with&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;Treasury&nbsp;futures.

<div> Monetary Policy, Bank Capital Reform, Inflation, Federal Reserve, Basel III<br />
Summary: Michelle W. Bowman discusses recent developments in US monetary policy, including high inflation, policy tightening, and the impact of bank capital reforms. <div>
<p>I would like to thank Policy Exchange for the invitation to speak with you today.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240625a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1">1</a>&nbsp;Engagement abroad is essential for gaining a better understanding of the common forces shaping the global economy and financial system. It also promotes a better understanding of the drivers of differences between the economic and financial environments across countries and jurisdictions. My remarks will offer some perspectives on recent developments in monetary policy and bank regulatory policy&mdash;specifically, bank capital reform&mdash;in the U.S. These are two areas in which I am actively engaged as a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.</p>
<p><strong>Monetary Policy</strong><br />I'll begin with monetary policy. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)&mdash;the monetary policymaking body of the Federal Reserve System&mdash;has been keenly focused on restoring price stability following the surge in inflation during 2021 and in 2022 in the aftermath of the global COVID-19 pandemic. During this time, inflation reached levels not seen in the U.S. since the 1970s and 1980s. The high inflation experienced in the U.S. in the wake of the pandemic was also experienced in many economies around the world, reflecting, in part, the common global nature of the shocks that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>In many economies during the pandemic, supply constraints related to social-distancing measures, reduced labor supply, and supply chain disruptions, coupled with strong demand for goods as economies emerged from pandemic restrictions, acted as catalysts, pushing inflation up to very high levels. Aggregate demand was also supported by accommodative monetary and fiscal policies, which served to bolster the balance sheets of households, businesses, and local governments, and contributed to very tight labor markets.</p>
<p>The global inflation experience since the pandemic was highly synchronized across the major world economies, reflecting similar shocks that acted to reduce supply, while fiscal and monetary policy interventions stimulated demand. Early in the pandemic, many economic sectors, especially in services, were affected by lockdowns and both mandatory and voluntary social distancing. Many workers also transitioned to working remotely. Aggressive fiscal policies helped support personal and business income, and monetary policy became highly accommodative. The large shift in the composition of demand toward goods resulted in rising supply bottlenecks and higher goods prices.</p>
<p>Reduced immigration and lower labor force participation led to very tight labor markets as the economy reopened and demand recovered. Consumer spending was supported by excess savings accumulated from extraordinary fiscal support and reduced spending during lockdowns. Wage growth and services price inflation also picked up and have remained persistently elevated, reflecting a tight labor market and the protracted adjustment of prices and wages to the shocks during the pandemic.</p>
<p>A sharp rise in food and energy price inflation, and their pass-through to core inflation, also contributed to a more synchronous inflation dynamic across major advanced foreign economies in recent years. Food and energy prices are mostly set in global markets, and their sharp increases also reflected the effects of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, especially for major European economies including the U.K.</p>
<p>Many central banks facing these dynamics tightened monetary policy in an effort to better balance demand and supply and to bring inflation back down to target. In the U.S., by late 2021, it became clear that the FOMC's monetary policy stance was too accommodative in the presence of growing inflationary pressures, due to broader and more persistent supply constraints, and that the Committee needed to move toward a tighter policy. It seems likely to me that the U.S. experience during the years leading up to the pandemic, when inflation was persistently low, made it hard for many to foresee how quickly that situation could change. Additionally, the domestic inflation and labor data did not accurately reflect the economic conditions prevailing at the time and were subsequently substantially revised.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240625a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2">2</a></p>
<p>In my view, these factors, combined with new forward guidance introduced in the September and December 2020 FOMC statements following the revisions to the Committee's monetary policy strategy consensus statement in August 2020, contributed to a delay in the removal of monetary policy accommodation in 2021.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240625a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3">3</a>,<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240625a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4">4</a>&nbsp;In late 2021, the FOMC did begin to move toward tightening the stance of monetary policy and, beginning in 2022, increased the policy rate rapidly to bring monetary policy into restrictive territory. Since March 2022, the FOMC has raised the target range of the federal funds rate by 5‑1/4 percentage points. The target range has remained at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent since July 2023. Since June 2022, the Federal Reserve has also been reducing its securities holdings, which had increased substantially during the pandemic period.</p>
<p>The tightening in monetary policy has had an effect. Over 2023, we saw significant progress on lowering inflation in the U.S. while the economy and labor market have remained strong. The 12-month change in core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices slowed to 2.9 percent in December 2023, nearly 2 percentage points less than one year earlier. The restrictive stance of monetary policy reduced demand-side inflation pressures. Rising interest rates continued to act as a drag on growth of residential and business investment, outside of an increase in construction of new electric vehicle battery and microprocessor factories. Labor demand also moderated, contributing to some loosening of labor market tightness. The job openings and quits rates fell and payroll employment gains slowed significantly throughout last year.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240625a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5">5</a></p>
<p>Some of the progress on inflation last year also reflected favorable supply-side developments, including the resolution of supply chain disruptions and increased labor supply&mdash;both from higher immigration and higher labor force participation of prime-age workers&mdash;as well as lower energy prices.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of 2024, however, we have seen only modest further progress on inflation. The 12-month measures of total and core PCE inflation have moved roughly sideways or slightly down since December and remained elevated at 2.7 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively, in April. The consumer price index (CPI) report for May showed 12-month core CPI inflation slowing to 3.4 percent from 3.6 percent in April. However, with average core CPI inflation this year through May running at an annualized rate of 3.8 percent, notably above average inflation in the second half of last year, I expect inflation to remain elevated for some time.</p>
<p>Recent data suggest some moderation in economic activity early this year. First-quarter gross domestic product growth was slower than in the second half of last year, though private domestic final purchases continued to rise at a solid pace. Continued softness in consumer spending and weaker housing activity early in the second quarter also suggest less momentum in economic activity so far this year.</p>
<p>Payroll employment continued to rise at a solid pace in April and May, though slightly slower than in the first quarter, partly reflecting increased immigrant labor supply. Despite some further rebalancing between supply and demand, the labor market remains tight. The unemployment rate edged up to 4.0 percent in May, while the number of job openings relative to unemployed workers declined further to near its pre-pandemic level. Labor force participation dropped back to 62.5 percent in May, which suggests no further improvement in labor supply along this margin, as labor force participation among those aged 55 or older has been persistently low.</p>
<p>In contrast to the past two years, it is possible over the coming months that the path of monetary policy in the U.S. will diverge from that of other advanced economies, including the U.K., as the underlying economic developments and outlooks across jurisdictions exhibit greater heterogeneity. Inflation and labor market developments in the U.S. have unfolded differently in recent quarters compared to many other advanced economies, likely reflecting a more open immigration policy and significantly larger discretionary fiscal stimulus since the pandemic.</p>
<p>Economic activity in the U.S. has recovered considerably more than in other advanced foreign economies, including in the U.K. This likely reflects higher levels of fiscal support and productivity growth in the U.S. compared to other major economies.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240625a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6">6</a>&nbsp;A more flexible labor market in the U.S. likely allowed for greater movement of workers across sectors following the COVID-19 shock, with higher unemployment in the early stages of the pandemic followed by stronger job creation during the recovery.</p>
<p>A rebound in new business formation in the U.S. also likely enhanced productivity growth in recent years. With economic activity remaining weaker in other advanced foreign economies than in the U.S. and given differing economic and inflation outlooks in their own jurisdictions, central banks in these economies may ease monetary policy sooner or more quickly than in the U.S.</p>
<p>Inflation in the U.S. remains elevated, and I still see a number of upside inflation risks that affect my outlook. First, it is unlikely that further supply-side improvements will continue to lower inflation going forward, as supply chains have largely normalized, the labor force participation rate has leveled off in recent months below pre-pandemic levels, and an open U.S. immigration policy that added millions of new immigrants in the U.S. over the past few years may become more restrictive.</p>
<p>Geopolitical developments could also pose upside risks to inflation, including the risk that spillovers from regional conflicts could disrupt global supply chains, putting additional upward pressure on food, energy, and commodity prices. There is also the risk that the loosening in financial conditions since last year, reflecting considerable gains in equity valuations, and additional fiscal stimulus could add momentum to demand, stalling any further progress or even causing inflation to reaccelerate.</p>
<p>Finally, there is a risk that increased immigration and continued labor market tightness could lead to persistently high core services inflation. Given the current low inventory of affordable housing, the inflow of new immigrants to some geographic areas could result in upward pressure on rents, as additional housing supply may take time to materialize. With labor markets remaining tight, wage growth has been elevated at around or above 4 percent, still higher than the pace consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal given trend productivity growth.</p>
<p>In the U.S., the FOMC pursues monetary policy in support of price stability and maximum employment. These goals mandated to the Federal Reserve by the U.S. Congress are focused on domestic economic conditions. However, international economic and financial developments can influence U.S. monetary policy to the extent that these developments affect the economic outlook for the U.S. For example, weaker foreign activity and an appreciation of the dollar driven by easier monetary policy abroad would both reduce foreign demand for U.S. exports and lower the outlook for economic growth in the U.S. Likewise, geopolitical developments or trade restrictions could affect the outlook for the prices of energy, food, and goods.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, I will be closely watching the incoming data as I assess whether monetary policy in the U.S. is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to our 2 percent goal over time. The extent and frequency of revisions to U.S. economic data since the pandemic have made the task of assessing the current state of the economy and the outlook even more challenging. My baseline outlook continues to be that U.S. inflation will return to the FOMC's 2 percent goal, with the target range of the federal funds rate held at its current level of 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent for some time. Should the incoming data indicate that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2 percent goal, it will eventually become appropriate to gradually lower the federal funds rate to prevent monetary policy from becoming overly restrictive.</p>
<p>However, we are still not yet at the point where it is appropriate to lower the policy rate. In my view, we should consider a range of possible scenarios that could unfold when considering how the FOMC's monetary policy decisions may evolve. I remain willing to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at a future meeting should progress on inflation stall or even reverse. Given the risks and uncertainties regarding my economic outlook, I will remain cautious in my approach to considering future changes in the stance of policy. Reducing our policy rate too soon or too quickly could result in a rebound in inflation, requiring further future policy rate increases to return inflation to 2 percent over the longer run.</p>
<p><strong>Bank Capital Reform</strong><br />I will now briefly touch on bank capital reforms, which are particularly important when it comes to our global and interconnected banking and financial systems. The U.S. has lagged its EU and U.K. counterparts in fully implementing the Basel III capital standards. In July 2023, the U.S. federal banking agencies issued a public consultation on implementing what we call the Basel III "endgame" capital reforms.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240625a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7">7</a></p>
<p>The U.S. proposal was notable for a number of reasons, but I would highlight two in particular. First, the U.S. proposal would significantly expand the scope of application and calibration of these capital requirements. And, second, this proposal went beyond the Basel framework in several areas, undermining the goal of increasing consistency in capital standards across jurisdictions and potentially creating competitive concerns. The response to the U.S. capital proposal was overwhelmingly negative from a broad range of commenters.</p>
<p><em>Calibration and scope</em><br />A key consideration in evaluating reform efforts is whether the benefits of a change outweigh the costs, both for the financial institutions subject to these reforms and for the broader economy. The benefits of reform, like Basel III, are clear&mdash;on a basic level, higher capital can make the banking system safer. At a minimum, this increased safety comes at a cost; in its more extreme forms, it can actually increase financial stability risks.</p>
<p>The Basel III proposal in the U.S. is complex and, if it were to apply today as proposed, could have very significant, detrimental impacts. Federal Reserve staff estimated that the proposed changes would result in an aggregate 20 percent increase in total risk-weighted assets across bank holding companies subject to the rule, with some commenters projecting much greater effects.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240625a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8">8</a>&nbsp;And, instead of these standards applying only to large, internationally active banks, the U.S. proposal would "push down" these standards to a much broader range of domestic institutions.</p>
<p>A change of this significance could impact U.S. market liquidity and lending as well as force firms that lack sufficient economies of scale to stop providing certain products and services. Capital increases of this scale could reduce the cost and availability of credit, particularly for certain types of loans, and could disproportionately harm underserved markets, businesses, and communities. In my view, the proposal insufficiently considered these direct costs. These are costs that would ultimately be imposed on bank customers.</p>
<p>Of course, the evaluation of reforms should not end at their direct costs. Many of the costs are indirect or unintended and may be substantial, creating further concerns, including risks to financial stability. These reforms could create an exodus of activities and products from the banking system due to the indirect costs and unintended consequences.</p>
<p>Over time, activity tends to migrate to where it can be conducted efficiently and at the least cost. Capital requirements can play a significant role in determining where and by whom an activity is conducted. Banks are often best positioned to provide financial products and services due to their expertise and experience as well as their requirement to operate safely and soundly. When the over-calibration of regulatory costs becomes too significant, activities often migrate out of banks and into the nonbank financial system, potentially leading to greater systemic risks.</p>
<p>Up until this point, I have focused primarily on the "cost" side of the analysis, and I think it is fair to characterize the direct and indirect costs of the proposed Basel III rule as substantial. But we must also measure these costs against the benefits such capital increases could provide.</p>
<p>As a starting point for this analysis, we must evaluate the current state of the banking system. In the U.S., given the increase in capital following the 2008 financial crisis, I do not see undercapitalization of large banks as a current vulnerability. While some have argued that large capital increases should be part of the regulatory response following the 2023 U.S. banking stress, I think this argument lacks a solid foundation.</p>
<p>First, as we know, the Basel reforms were being developed long before last year's banking stress. The U.S. proposal included regulatory changes that had previously been considered and rejected as part of the Basel III implementation&mdash;specifically, a significant accounting change regarding the treatment of unrealized losses on securities portfolios.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240625a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9">9</a>&nbsp;While revisiting this one element of Basel III has been used to try tying the rulemaking initiative to the regulatory response to the bank failures last spring, the majority of the proposed changes are unrelated to last spring's banking stress.</p>
<p>Second, linking this rulemaking to the banking stress implies that the&nbsp;<em>causes</em>&nbsp;of individual bank failures in the spring of 2023 were in some way a signal of broader banking system weakness, which could best be addressed by significant capital increases.</p>
<p>This argument seems to rely on the philosophy that more capital makes stronger banks, regardless of costs and tradeoffs, or possible more efficient approaches. Linking the proposed capital increases to the bank failures in the spring of 2023 should not be used as a pretext to avoid the challenges of identifying and evaluating the tradeoffs involved with setting capital requirements, nor should it excuse regulators from taking a hard look at the root causes of the bank failures with the goal of identifying more targeted solutions than across-the-board capital increases.</p>
<p>In the case of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), both bank management and supervisors failed to appreciate, appropriately identify, and mitigate the known, significant, and idiosyncratic risks of a business model that relied on a highly concentrated, uninsured base of depositors. They also overlooked the buildup of interest rate risk without appropriate risk management. These management failures arguably support an honest and critical look at how supervision was conducted in the lead-up to the firm's failure. And it would then be appropriate to propose changes to remediate those deficiencies. But the failures did not suggest either that "capital" was the major problem contributing to SVB's failure or that undercapitalization was a broader problem in the banking system.</p>
<p><em>Basel III capital reforms and&nbsp;</em><em>international consistency</em><br />Before discussing the path ahead, I will also address one of the factors that should be a focus for regulatory reforms that may resonate in this forum: the issue of international comparability and competitive disadvantages. One of the primary purposes of the Basel capital standards is to promote minimum standards across jurisdictions that not only improve competitive equity in banking markets, but also result in making the financial system safer.</p>
<p>While I have expressed some skepticism of the U.S. Basel III proposal, I see value in engaging in ongoing discussions about international coordination through multilateral organizations like the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. Some degree of consistency in international banking and financial markets can be helpful in fostering a cross-border level playing field for internationally active banking organizations while establishing minimum standards that can help mitigate global financial stability risks.</p>
<p>In internationally active banking and financial markets, there are often "choices" about where activity can be conducted. Financial products and services are offered around the world in different markets, and there is often some degree of flexibility as to how a customer can access a product or service. This competitive "choice" aspect of international banking and financial markets can itself create downward pressure on regulatory standards and create opportunities for forum shopping.</p>
<p>In the absence of some degree of international coordination, there is a risk of creating a regulatory "race to the bottom," as regulators compete to grow their banking and financial systems by lowering regulatory and supervisory standards below levels that are appropriate based on risk. But this desire for greater international consistency can be equally frustrated when U.S. regulators excessively calibrate requirements. As I previously noted, the U.S. proposal was calibrated at a level well in excess of other international jurisdictions as well as without sufficient analytical support and evidence that the proposed increases were proportionate to risk.</p>
<p>This is not only a problem for international competitive equity, but also a concern for global financial stability. Significant banking activities occur in the international and cross-border context, and we know that financial stability risks can spread throughout global financial markets. The U.S. Basel proposal reflects elements of the agreed-upon standards, but it far exceeds them. Adjusting the calibration could have the important secondary benefit of enhancing this international consistency.</p>
<p><em>The path forward</em><br />Notwithstanding what has brought us to this point, I do see a path forward to implement Basel III, one that addresses not only the overall calibration as well as international consistency and comparability, but also makes more granular changes that will improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the rule.</p>
<p>In October 2023, the Federal Reserve launched a data collection to gather information from the banks affected by the U.S. proposal. I am hopeful that this data will allow regulators to better understand the impact of the proposal and to identify areas for revision. Any next step in this rulemaking process will require broad and material changes. It should also be accompanied by a data-driven analysis of the proposal and informed by the significant public input received during the rulemaking process. This should assist policymakers in creating a path to improve the rulemaking. My hope is that policymakers pay closer attention to the balance of costs and benefits and consider the direct and indirect consequences of the capital reform.</p>
<p>I have previously identified a number of specific areas and procedural steps that would be necessary to address in any future efforts to revise this proposal. Some of these issues include</p>
<ul>
<li>addressing redundancy in the capital framework (for example, between the new market risk and operational risk requirements, and the stress capital buffer)</li>
<li>recalibrating the market risk rule specifically, where some of the biggest outlier increases in risk-weighted assets would appear (for example, these revisions alone will increase risk-weighted assets from $430 billion to $760 billion for Category I and II firms, and from $130 billion to $220 billion for Category III and IV firms)</li>
<li>adopting a more reasonable treatment for non-interest and fee-based income through the operational risk requirements, which could deter banks from diversifying revenue streams, even though such diversification can enhance an institution's stability and resilience</li>
<li>reviewing the impact of capital requirements, including leverage ratio requirements, on U.S. Treasury market intermediation and liquidity</li>
<li>incorporating tailoring in the applicability of Basel III capital reforms, specifically looking at whether each element of the Basel III capital proposal is appropriate for non-G-SIB firms that are not internationally active</li>
<li>re-proposing the Basel III standards to address the broad and material reforms that I believe should be included in any final rule, including granular changes to address the specific issues raised by commenters, as appropriate.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240625a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10">10</a></li>
</ul>
<p>While these steps would be a reasonable starting place, they are not a replacement for a data-driven analysis and a careful review of the comments submitted. This would result in a better proposal that includes changes to address not only these concerns, but also many other concerns raised by the public.</p>
<p><strong>Closing Thoughts</strong><br />I would like to thank you again for the opportunity to speak with you today. My experience over the past five and a half years at the Federal Reserve highlights the enduring challenge of setting monetary policy amid a wide and evolving range of risks and uncertainties in the global economy. An important question I will be considering is how to make monetary policy durable to a wide range of possible shocks and changes in the macroeconomy, such as those experienced globally during the pandemic.</p>
<p>We will continue to learn about the post-pandemic global economy, and, if history is any guide, new shocks to and changes in the economy will eventually and inevitably occur. While the economic outlook is uncertain, the FOMC's mandate of fostering price stability and maximum employment in the U.S. remains very clear. Restoring price stability is essential for achieving maximum employment over the longer run.</p>
<p>I also look forward to ongoing international discussions about bank capital and regulatory frameworks, and I hope that my brief remarks today relay both my support for ongoing international discussions on these matters and my firm belief that we must engage in regulatory reform efforts with our eyes wide open, acknowledging the benefits, costs, and tradeoffs.</p>
<p>While our interconnected banking and financial system provides many benefits, we must also continue to focus on the opportunities it creates for financial stability risks to shift from domestic concerns to global vulnerabilities. Bank capital policy is an important measure to control these risks, but we know that capital is only one of many tools in our supervisory arsenal. And it is insufficient without the complement of other regulatory tools.</p>
<p>So, as we continue the process of considering regulatory reform, I hope that we approach every issue with a broader lens, focusing on data-driven identification of the problems we are trying to solve, and with an openness to solving these problems in a more targeted and efficient way.</p>

<p>2. For example, both the August and September 2021 employment reports suggested much lower job growth than did consensus forecasts, and these initial estimates were subsequently sizably increased. Similarly, total personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation for nearly all quarters in 2021 has been revised higher than initially reported. See the real-time data on the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis's ALFRED website at&nbsp;<a href="https://alfred.stlouisfed.org/series/downloaddata?seid=PAYEMS">https://alfred.stlouisfed.org/series/downloaddata?seid=PAYEMS</a>&nbsp;(job growth) and&nbsp;<a href="https://alfred.stlouisfed.org/series/downloaddata?seid=PCECTPI">https://alfred.stlouisfed.org/series/downloaddata?seid=PCECTPI</a>&nbsp;(PCE inflation).&nbsp;</p>

Bowman (2024), "<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240405a.htm">Risks and Uncertainty in Monetary Policy: Current and Past Considerations</a>," speech delivered at "Frameworks for Monetary Policy, Regulation, and Bank Capital" Spring 2024 Meeting of the Shadow Open Market Committee, hosted by the Manhattan Institute, New York, New York, April 5.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. The new forward guidance in the September 2020 FOMC statement emphasized that the federal funds rate would remain near zero until "inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time" (paragraph 4) and "labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment" (paragraph 4). In the December 2020 FOMC statement, the FOMC added forward guidance regarding asset purchases that stated that the Federal Reserve would continue to purchase Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities at the then current pace of $80 billion and $40 billion per month, respectively, "until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee's maximum employment and price stability goals" (paragraph 4). (The September and December 2020 FOMC statements are available on the Board's website at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm">https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm</a>.) The September and December 2020 forward guidance followed the August 2020 revisions to the FOMC's Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which are described on the Board's website at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/guide-to-changes-in-statement-on-longer-run-goals-monetary-policy-strategy.htm">https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/guide-to-changes-in-statement-on-longer-run-goals-monetary-policy-strategy.htm</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. The Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) report for the fourth quarter of 2023 suggests that the slowdown in payroll employment gains was likely more pronounced than currently reported by the Current Employment Statistics (CES) establishment survey. The Q4 QCEW administrative data show employment gains that are about 110,000 per month lower than what the CES survey reported from March 2023 to December 2023. Although the BLS benchmarks CES payroll employment based on the Q1 QCEW, to be released on August 21, the Q4 QCEW data point to a substantial downward revision to CES employment gains last year.&nbsp;</p>

<div> Blue finance, green bonds, Vietnam, SeABank, IFC <br />
Summary: IFC provides $150 million financing package to SeABank for blue and green bonds, SME funding, and financial inclusion in Vietnam. <br /> <div>
<p>To catalyze a viable blue finance market, foster green bonds and support smaller businesses in Vietnam, IFC is providing a financing package of $150 million to Southeast Asia Commercial Joint Stock Bank (<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="http://email.prnewswire.com/ls/click?upn=u001.v-2BJ3gj6ki5QD5j-2Fn6dQLihxWYdZ2SgywQDHxvCbe2FhqV9BSkPvyEwMxxDWxjpWoUzai_pIbxPfpDI69aAybPrpOfg1n6CWmKMnb3conIyNKCYgr-2BTRqxLAwMRExIXLpGb5DJbZnmWjDWD02IrKbxkSrsT2xn46jg64RMmHIYE5m8bw75670ZVHshNTWxhO8MAlynXSyMaGEUpiDiUBR21hwK-2FCCbBJLYU-2FDacmF3f-2Bd3NamP5Cor-2B0foQV19xnQVurE6IhwAhR-2F1KdHp7jKD034d-2FeA7jTbQU2uS2BjVUL2yQON0z-2B6fMR7dcNfCLcz7cVoK1FzBdjXml9DLN3YR9TLTyO2mDbPle-2BIT1JUYPifHZJRLu95MA-2BsLsidjY2eGnUe8XnrzXu3q6FNDKtB-2FxXUtXX70KrQYlehW-2BTcrMSoVmtY-3D" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SeABank</a>, stock code: SSB). The investment entails Vietnam's first blue bond and the first green bond by a private commercial bank in the country.</p>
<div dir="ltr" id="dvprnejpge8b0left"><img align="middle" alt="IFC Supports SeABank to Issue Vietnam&rsquo;s First Blue Bond, Boost Climate Finance" id="prnejpge8b0left" src="https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2446268/SeABank_1__3.jpg" title="IFC Supports SeABank to Issue Vietnam&rsquo;s First Blue Bond, Boost Climate Finance" /></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of that, IFC's $25 million subscription in blue bonds will allow SeABank to expand its funding for sustainable economic activities associated with ocean and water (aquaculture and fisheries, water supply, etc.). IFC's $50 million subscription in green bonds will help the bank increase financing for green assets (green buildings, renewable energy, and energy efficiency). As the implementing entity of the UK's Market Accelerator for Green Construction (MAGC) Program, IFC will provide a performance-based incentive of up to $0.48 million targeting retail borrowers to help offset the incremental greening costs associated with green housing units purchase.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, IFC's $75 million loan to SeABank is aimed at promoting financial inclusion through boosting financing for SMEs, including women-owned businesses.</p>
<p>"<i>IFC's investment will help SeABank increase funding for initiatives that support the country's climate and financial inclusion agenda. We are proud to be issuing Vietnam's first blue bond and the first green bond by a private commercial bank. We look forward to working with IFC to further bolster our green and blue portfolio strategy</i>," said Le Thu Thuy, Vice Chairwoman of SeABank BOD.</p>
<p>Alongside the investment, IFC will advise SeABank on adopting green and blue bond frameworks, while helping SeABank identify eligible green and blue assets and develop a pipeline.</p>
<p>"<i>Vietnam's green transition relies heavily on private capital, and the launch of innovative financing instruments such as blue and green bonds offers a new source of funding for climate-related projects</i>," said Thomas Jacobs, IFC Country Manager for Vietnam, Cambodia, and Lao PDR. "<i>With investment in a leading player, IFC is establishing new asset classes while mobilizing capital and strengthening the capacity of local financial institutions to drive increased climate finance in Vietnam</i>."</p>
<p>Two parties have partnered since 2021 to expand SMEs lending via tailored products, increase climate finance access and international trade. With IFC's support, SeABank could develop an integrated ESG framework and prioritize funding for green projects, thereby promoting climate change mitigation and resource efficiency.</p>

<div> Keywords: technology, product innovation, Singapore investors, SGX, partnership

Summary: SGX and SIAS mark the securities market open, highlighting technology and product innovation, commitment to empowering investors, and a $10 million investment for market vibrancy. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<div class="row"><section class="template-article-section col-12"><ol>
<li>
<p>Mr David Gerald, Founder, President &amp; CEO, Securities Investors Association (Singapore); Friends from SIAS, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is my pleasure to welcome everyone to today&rsquo;s Securities Market Open, which we mark together with our valued partner, SIAS.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Technology and product innovation have revolutionised the landscape and complexion for securities investors internationally. So Singapore investors today enjoy these innovations, with a wide range of channels for trading and investment in securities. As product choices and information channels grow in sophistication and novelty, so has the Singapore investor.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SGX has moved quickly to meet these constantly evolving demands from investors and issuers. We have broadened our product shelves: listing the first active ETF, introducing structured certificates and offering depository receipts on blue-chip Thai companies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Product development on the Exchange is one factor in the equation. Another important factor is that our brokers and industry partners continue to develop and sustain a healthy Singapore securities market.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is why having SIAS join us today is so special. SIAS will be marking its 25th anniversary this year. We look forward to many more years together, of empowering and encouraging retail investors in their wealth provisioning and investing journey.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp; We share SIAS&rsquo; commitment to building a vibrant Singapore capital market. The range of commitment spans sponsorships and research/policy collaborations, investor education, listed company outreach and corporate governance matters.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a mark of our continued and purposeful dedication to grow market participation, I am delighted to announce that SGX is committing to a one-time $10 million investment, over and above our ongoing investments in the Securities Market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The monies will be channeled to industry partners for initiatives that can significantly improve market vibrancy. Such catalysts will grow momentum in our investor ecosystem, so as to enhance the liquidity flywheel of Singapore&rsquo;s capital market.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 11px; background-color: initial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The intention is for industry partners to address three broad areas with their initiatives:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, grow distribution channels to reach out to more investors;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Second, develop new services to engage investors and facilitate investments; and</li>
<li>Finally, support the expansion of the SGX product shelf and development of regional connectivity with ASEAN markets and exchanges.&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
</ol> </li>
<li>
<p>We wake up every day to a 24-hour global market news cycle of product innovations and investment opportunities. Our investors deserve to benefit from these innovations and opportunities. With our partners, with SIAS, the Exchange will work hard to continuously grow the relevance of Singapore&rsquo;s securities market. &nbsp;I look forward to our partnership and continued journey together.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 11px; background-color: initial;">&nbsp;</span></p>
</li>
<li>Thank you.&nbsp;</li>

<title>NZX Meets Its Market Operator Licence Requirements – New Zealand Financial Markets Authority Report</title>

<div> compliance, governance, technology, risk management, FMA<br />
Summary:<br />
NZX complies with its market operator obligations, meeting governance arrangements, improving frameworks and processes, investing in technology, and risk management. FMA recommends participant resilience and crisis management improvements. <div>
<p>NZX has complied with its licensed market operator obligations, a review by the Financial Markets Authority (FMA) &ndash; Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko &ndash; has found. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The annual NZX Market Operator Obligations Review, released today, assesses how well the NZX is meeting the requirements for its market operator licence. The report found NZX met all its obligations during the review period from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In particular, the review found: &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>NZX&rsquo;s governance arrangements continue to be appropriate and support its ability to comply with its licensee obligations</li>
<li>NZX and NZ RegCo &ndash; NZX&rsquo;s regulatory function &ndash; continue to improve its frameworks, processes, and operational effectiveness across the areas assessed</li>
<li>Continued demonstration of NZ RegCo&rsquo;s operational independence, while maintaining an appropriate and effective working relationship with NZX</li>
<li>Significant work and investment in technology resources over the last three years has resulted in the business being much better positioned with respect to capability, resilience and security</li>
<li>Further enhancements in the risk management frameworks, ownership, identification, management and mitigation of risk, and delivery of assurance activity.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The report has made two recommendations. The first recommendation is to consider how NZX can further address its dependency on the resilience of participants and providers regarding the overall stability of the ecosystem. The second recommendation is for NZX to continue to improve crisis management scenario testing by considering testing a system being unrecoverable. &nbsp;</p>
<p>FMA Director of Markets, Investors, and Reporting, John Horner, said: &ldquo;This year&rsquo;s report shows NZX continues to improve its systems and processes, particularly in key risk areas such as technology and security. NZ RegCo operates in a structured and considered way, with a clear strategy to achieve its outcomes. The FMA encourages NZX to build on the improvements with a focus on the two FMA recommendations on participant resilience and crisis management.&rdquo;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<title>SEC Updates List Of Firms Using Inaccurate Information To Solicit Investors</title>

<div> Securities and Exchange Commission, unregistered entities, soliciting, investors, fraud<br />
Summary:<br />
SEC updated list of unregistered entities soliciting non-U.S. investors. Investors warned of fraudsters impersonating official agencies to lure victims. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it updated its list of unregistered entities that use misleading information to solicit primarily non-U.S. investors, adding 24 soliciting entities, six impersonators of genuine firms, and four bogus regulators.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s list of soliciting entities that have been the subject of investor complaints, known as the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/investor/oiepauselist.htm">Public Alert: Unregistered Soliciting Entities (PAUSE) list</a>, enables investors to better inform themselves and avoid being victims of fraud. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/pause-list-2024-76.pdf">latest additions</a>&nbsp;are firms that SEC staff found were providing inaccurate information about their affiliation, location, or registration. Under U.S. securities laws, firms that solicit investors generally are required to register with the SEC and meet minimum financial standards and disclosure, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements.</p>
<p>In addition to alerting investors to firms falsely claiming to be registered, the PAUSE list flags those impersonating registered securities firms and bogus regulators who falsely claim to be government agencies or affiliates. Inclusion on the PAUSE list does not mean the SEC has found violations of U.S. federal securities laws or made a judgment about the merits of any securities being offered.</p>
<p>The PAUSE list is periodically updated by the SEC&rsquo;s Office of Market Intelligence, in coordination with the Office of Investor Education and Advocacy and the Office of International Affairs.</p>
<p><span>How to protect yourself:</span></p>
<p>Be aware that communications &mdash; including phone calls, voicemails, text messages, messages via social media, emails, letters, and certificates &mdash; may falsely appear to be from official U.S. government sources, including the SEC. If you receive a communication that appears to be from the SEC, do not provide any personal information until you have verified that you are dealing with someone from the SEC and not an impersonator.</p>
<p>AI technology has made it even easier for fraudsters to impersonate government agencies, organizations, and individuals in luring investors into scams.</p>

<title>The EBA Publishes Amendments To Counterparty Credit Risk Standards As Part Of Its New Roadmap For The Implementation Of The Banking Package In The EU</title>

<div> European Banking Authority, final draft, Regulatory Technical Standards, counterparty credit risk, SA-CCR<br />
Summary:<br />
EBA published final draft amending RTS on SA-CCR, specifying formulas for supervisory delta of options and commodity options compatible with negative rates and prices. <div>
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published its final draft amending Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) on the standardised approach for counterparty credit risk (SA-CCR). This regulatory product is part of the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-12/9dc534e8-8a3d-438f-88e3-bc86e623d99e/EBA%20Roadmap%20on%20strengthening%20the%20prudential%20framework_1.pdf"><span>new roadmap on the Banking Package</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p>The amendments to the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR3) have expanded the EBA mandate to specify the formula to calculate the supervisory delta of options under the SA-CCR framework. Alongside the supervisory delta formula for interest rate options compatible with negative interest rates, the mandate now also requires the specification of the supervisory delta formula for commodity options compatible with negative commodity prices. Therefore, the existing RTS on SA-CCR have been amended to include the formula for commodity options.</p>
<h4>Legal basis and background</h4>
<p>The draft RTS on SA-CCR have been developed according to Article 277(5) and 279a(3) of the CRR, as amended by Regulation (EU) 2024/1623 (CRR3), which mandates the EBA to specify:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>the method for identifying transactions with only one material risk driver or with more than one material risk driver and for identifying the most material of those risk drivers;</li>
<li>the formulas to calculate the supervisory delta of call and put options mapped to the interest rate or commodity risk categories compatible with negative interest rates or commodity prices, and the supervisory volatility suitable for those formulas;</li>
<li>the method for determining whether a transaction is a long or short position in the primary risk driver or in the most material risk driver in the given risk category.</li>

<div> China-Based Companies, Disclosure Priorities, Commercial Real Estate, Cybersecurity, Clawbacks<br />
Summary:<br />Division of Corporation Finance discusses disclosure program, review priorities, focusing on China-based companies, AI, commercial real estate, and new rules like cybersecurity and clawbacks. <div>
<p><i>This statement is provided in the author&rsquo;s official capacity as the Commission&rsquo;s Director of the Division of Corporation Finance but does not necessarily reflect the views of the Commission, Commissioners, or other members of the staff. This statement is not a rule, regulation, or statement of the Commission. The Commission has neither approved nor disapproved its content. This statement, like all staff statements, has no legal force or effect: it does not alter or amend applicable law, and it creates no new or additional obligations for any person.</i></p>
<p>This Statement describes, among other things, my opening remarks and other matters discussed among Jessica Barberich, Johnny Gharib, Bobby Klein, Jim Lopez, Lilyanna Peyser, Tiffany Posil, and Amanda Ravitz during a Division of Corporation Finance panel discussion at the 2024 SEC Speaks Conference held on April 2, 2024, in Washington, D.C.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gerding-statement-state-disclosure-review-062424?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Director&rsquo;s Remarks</span></p>
<p>Good afternoon. I appreciate the opportunity to speak with you again today as part of the Corp Fin Workshop. I wanted to make a few remarks about the important work being done in the Division&rsquo;s Disclosure Review Program and highlight some of our areas of focus going forward. This is part of an initiative to be more transparent and communicate with the marketplace about what is going on in the Disclosure Review Program.</p>
<p>Before I begin, I do need to provide our standard disclaimer: The views we express today are provided in our official capacities in the Commission&rsquo;s Division of Corporation Finance but do not necessarily reflect the views of the Commission, the Commissioners, or any other members of the staff. This disclaimer also extends to my colleagues on the panel today, who are also speaking in their official capacities.</p>
<p>The Division of Corporation Finance has over 400 professionals, primarily comprised of accountants and attorneys, who carry out the Commission&rsquo;s important three-part mission of protecting investors, facilitating capital formation, and maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets. Of those Division individuals, over 70% are focused on disclosure review.</p>
<p>It is that work I would like to highlight for you this afternoon because of the key role that it plays furthering the SEC&rsquo;s mission.</p>
<p>I am happy to share the stage with our panelists this afternoon and spend some time looking back at the state of disclosure for fiscal year 2023 and then lay out some of our disclosure priorities for fiscal year 2024.</p>
<p>It is through disclosure that investors are provided with the information they need to make informed investment and voting decisions. And, while high-profile IPOs and de-SPACs receive a lot of attention, it is important to remember that investment and voting decisions are not only made when a company initially offers its securities to the market. Those decisions happen daily in secondary markets, which is why public companies are charged with the responsibility to provide updated information to investors through their periodic reporting.</p>
<p>Corp Fin&rsquo;s annual report review program is the primary mechanism that we use to monitor and enhance compliance with disclosure rules and accounting requirements in these periodic reports filed by public companies. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act mandates that we review each reporting company at least once every three years; however, we review a significant number of companies more frequently. In fiscal year 2023, we reviewed approximately 3,300 companies as part of our annual review program.</p>
<p>While the nature of comments varies significantly depending on the specific facts for each company, the top areas of comment in fiscal year 2023 probably come as no surprise to this audience and include, among others, China-related matters, non-GAAP disclosures, management&rsquo;s discussion and analysis (MD&amp;A), revenue recognition, and financial statement presentation.</p>
<p>In addition to annual report reviews, Division staff considers trends and emerging risks in the market where our additional focus could significantly improve disclosures. In some instances, we address these topics as part of the review of annual reports, while in others, we may target a particular issue in other periodic filings such as a quarterly report. This flexibility in our approach allows for more timely engagement as issues arise.</p>
<p>Emerging areas of focus in 2023 included market disruptions in the banking industry, cybersecurity risks, the impact of inflation, and disclosure related to newly adopted rules, such as pay versus performance. We also continued to monitor disclosures by companies based or with a majority of their operations in the People&rsquo;s Republic of China, what we call &ldquo;China-Based Companies.&rdquo; Many of these topics are going to be covered in more detail by my colleagues as part of this Workshop, but I did want to spend just a few minutes going over two initiatives where 2023 marked the first year of disclosures and share how we approached the new requirements in SEC filings.</p>
<p>I will start with Commission Identified Issuers or &ldquo;CIIs.&rdquo;<i>&nbsp;</i>Public companies identified as CIIs under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act of 2020,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gerding-statement-state-disclosure-review-062424?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;or HFCAA, were required to comply with submission and disclosure requirements under the HFCAA and Commission rules.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gerding-statement-state-disclosure-review-062424?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;These disclosures required, among other things, at both the issuer and consolidated foreign operating entity level the following: information on ownership and controlling financial interests by foreign government entities; identification of Chinese Communist Party, or CCP, officials who are on the issuer&rsquo;s board; and whether the issuer&rsquo;s articles of incorporation (or any equivalent organizing document) contain any &ldquo;charter&rdquo; of the CCP.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gerding-statement-state-disclosure-review-062424?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p>There were 174 companies identified as CIIs, and Division staff reviewed the disclosures for all CIIs that filed annual reports to assess their compliance with these submission and disclosure requirements. Comments in this area sought additional transparency in instances where the disclosure was missing or deficient or where the scope of representations by the company were vague or unclear.</p>
<p>I also want to touch briefly on the pay versus performance, or PVP, disclosure requirements that went into effect in late 2022<i>.&nbsp;</i>We try to approach the first-year implementation of new rules pragmatically, and pay versus performance is a great example of that. In August 2022, the Commission adopted the final PVP rule, which requires disclosure of information reflecting the relationship between executive compensation actually paid by a company and the company&rsquo;s financial performance.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gerding-statement-state-disclosure-review-062424?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p>In 2023, Division staff assessed the first year of PVP disclosures through several lenses, including using XBRL tagging to analyze disclosures in a large number of filings. As part of that work, we looked at over 2,400 inline XBRL disclosures. We also conducted a more detailed review of PVP disclosure in a random sample of proxy statements across industries, and in some instances issued future (i.e., forward-looking) comments.</p>
<p>As with any new rule, we were not looking to play &ldquo;gotcha.&rdquo; At the same time, given the forward-looking orientation of our comments in the first year, we also don&rsquo;t see the first season as establishing a settled market practice. Based on our review of PVP disclosures, we were able to observe some of the more obvious disclosure issues in complying with the new rule and identify areas where staff observations, through comments and compliance and disclosure interpretation (C&amp;DIs), could be helpful to the registrant community and ultimately to investors. In response to questions and comments after the PVP rule adoption, and in response to issues we saw in our review, we ended up publishing a number of C&amp;DIs on the PVP rules.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gerding-statement-state-disclosure-review-062424?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;We hope registrants and their advisors find these useful as they prepare or adjust their disclosure for this current year.</p>
<p>The staff in the Disclosure Review Program also plays an integral role in facilitating capital formation through their reviews of registration statements. The Division staff selectively reviews filings made under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or pursuant to Regulation A to monitor and enhance compliance with the applicable disclosure and accounting requirements. In fiscal year 2023, the SEC received over 2,200 registration statements, including initial public offerings and follow-on offerings, which collectively sought to register the offer and sale of approximately $1 trillion of securities.</p>
<p>To close out the discussion of 2023, I want to talk about transparency, and our engagement with companies as we sought to drive better disclosure last year. While we do not publicly disclose the criteria we use to select a company or filing for review, we do understand the importance of transparency in our comment process. Once our review is complete, we publicly disseminate, via the Commission&rsquo;s Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system (EDGAR), both our comment letters and the company&rsquo;s response to those letters. However, it is important to keep in mind those comments are tailored to a company&rsquo;s specific facts and circumstances and do not necessarily apply to other filings. As a result, we have put an emphasis on using a multi-pronged approach to communicating, especially as it relates to emerging disclosure issues that may be relevant to a critical mass of issuers or investors.</p>
<p>Recently, we have issued Sample or Dear Issuer letters and other &ldquo;one-to-many communications&rdquo; on topics such as China-related matters (which builds on a previous Dear Issuer Letter and other staff statements we have issued over the past several years), as well as on disruptions in crypto markets and data-tagging. These letters often focus on emerging issues and are designed to better help companies understand what disclosures might be required under existing disclosure rules in order to help ensure that investors are receiving information they need to make informed investment and voting decisions.</p>
<p>We will keep doing this sort of work &ndash; analyzing emerging issues, thinking about what disclosures might be required under our existing rules, and communicating with the public.</p>
<p>Finally, I&rsquo;d like to briefly touch on our disclosure priorities for 2024, which we will discuss more during this Workshop.</p>
<p>Certain financial reporting topics, especially areas that involve judgment or where the Financial Accounting Standards Board or the International Accounting Standards Board have recently issued accounting standards, are generally areas of particular focus. Examples of these areas include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Segment reporting, including compliance with new U.S. GAAP disclosures effective in annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023;</li>
<li>Compliance with non-GAAP regulations and rules;</li>
<li>Critical accounting estimates disclosure in MD&amp;A; and</li>
<li>Disclosures related to supplier finance programs in the notes to the financial statements and any related information in MD&amp;A.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to those financial reporting topics, I anticipate that many of the disclosure priorities from 2023 will continue through the upcoming year.</p>
<ul>
<li>We will continue our focus on China-Based Companies and eliciting disclosure from companies on material risks they face from the PRC government intervening in, or exercising control over, their operations in the PRC.</li>
<li>While it appears that inflation is beginning to come down, this is not the time for issuers to revert to boilerplate disclosures. Any material ongoing impacts should be disclosed and we ask companies to not just note high level trends, but discuss the more particularized risks and impacts on their specific company.</li>
<li>Given the market disruptions in the banking industry that began about a year ago, we will be continuing to take a close look at updated disclosures related to interest rate risk and liquidity risk.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There will be some new additions to our priorities as well, many of which you may have already heard us mention in recent conferences or seen through the comment letter process, such as artificial intelligence and potential exposure due to changes in the commercial real estate market.</p>
<p>We are also tracking how companies are navigating the disclosure requirements resulting from newly adopted rules including, clawbacks,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gerding-statement-state-disclosure-review-062424?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;SPACs,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gerding-statement-state-disclosure-review-062424?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;and cybersecurity.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gerding-statement-state-disclosure-review-062424?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;Thank you for allowing me to speak with you this afternoon about the hard work that our disclosure operations staff continue to do.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Disclosure Priorities</span></p>
<p><i>Artificial Intelligence</i></p>
<p>Over the last year, we have observed a significant increase in the number of companies that mention artificial intelligence in their annual reports. These companies often discussed the topic in the risk factors or description of business sections, or both. There are also a number of companies that discuss the topic in their management&rsquo;s discussion and analysis (MD&amp;A).</p>
<p>As companies incorporate the use of artificial intelligence into their business operations, they are exposed to additional operational and regulatory risks. A number of existing rules or regulations may require disclosure about how a company uses artificial intelligence and the risks related to its use, including disclosure in the description of business section, risk factors, MD&amp;A, the financial statements, and the board&rsquo;s role in risk oversight. In 2024, the Division staff will consider how companies are describing these opportunities and risks, including, to the extent material, whether or not the company:</p>
<ul>
<li>clearly defines what it means by artificial intelligence and how the technology could improve the company&rsquo;s results of operations, financial condition, and future prospects;</li>
<li>provides tailored, rather than boilerplate, disclosures, commensurate with its materiality to the company, about material risks and the impact the technology is reasonably likely to have on its business and financial results;</li>
<li>focuses on the company&rsquo;s current or proposed use of artificial intelligence technology rather than generic buzz not relating to its business; and</li>
<li>has a reasonable basis for its claims when discussing artificial intelligence prospects.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gerding-statement-state-disclosure-review-062424?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Disclosures by China-Based Companies</i></p>
<p>In the last several years, the Division staff has published Dear Issuer Letters regarding the disclosure obligations of China-Based Companies.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gerding-statement-state-disclosure-review-062424?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;The letters address an array of disclosure issues, including those related to the variable interest entity (VIE) structure, the reliability of financial reporting, the regulatory environment in China, and corporate governance matters. The Division staff will continue to focus on these and other emerging risks these companies face in 2024.</p>
<p>The Division staff noted, in the context of the Commission&rsquo;s rules under the HFCAA, that it monitored disclosures by certain China-Based Companies and provided additional guidance where appropriate. As part of its filing review process, the Division staff also issued comments to China-Based Companies to enhance their compliance with disclosure obligations under the federal securities laws. The Division continues to believe that companies should provide more prominent, specific, and tailored disclosures about China-specific matters so that investors have the information they need to make informed investment and voting decisions.</p>
<p><i>Commercial Real Estate</i></p>
<p>Banks with significant commercial real estate (CRE) exposure and real estate investment trusts (REITs), including office and retail REIT sub-sectors, are subject to several CRE risks, including heightened vacancy rates, elevated interest rates, extended loan maturities, and increased loan delinquencies. While these risks are not new,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gerding-statement-state-disclosure-review-062424?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;in light of increased attention on these risks, the Division staff has been considering, and will continue to consider how, among other matters:</p>
<ul>
<li>banks are disclosing disaggregation of loan portfolio characteristics, geographic and other concentrations, loan-to-value ratios, loan modifications, nonaccrual loan policies, policies around timing, frequency and sources of appraisals, and risk management; and</li>
<li>office and retail REITs are describing default risks or liquidity issues and any mitigating efforts, debt maturity and lease term schedules, trends in lease renewals, major tenant rollovers, financial viability of tenants, property dispositions, asset impairments, and tenant receivables.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We would encourage companies to consider other areas of their disclosures where more granular information could be provided to improve investors&rsquo; understanding of the material risks inherent in the company&rsquo;s CRE or other loan portfolios and any mitigating steps they are taking to address those risks.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gerding-statement-state-disclosure-review-062424?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>&nbsp;Companies should also keep in mind that other types of industries outside of banks and REITs could be impacted by the current CRE environment, and they should continue to re-evaluate these disclosures as the interest rate environment changes.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Recently Adopted Rules</span></p>
<p>The Division staff will review disclosures made pursuant to certain recently adopted rules to assess compliance, provide guidance to companies, and improve disclosures for investors.</p>
<p><i>Cybersecurity</i></p>
<p>On July 26, 2023, the Commission adopted new rules to enhance and standardize disclosures regarding cybersecurity risks and incidents by public companies that are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gerding-statement-state-disclosure-review-062424?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>&nbsp;The new rules have two main components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disclosure of material cybersecurity incidents in Item 1.05 of Form 8-K.</li>
<li>Annual disclosure of cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance matters.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, in December, the Division issued a C&amp;DI which clarified that consultation with the Department of Justice regarding a cybersecurity incident does not necessarily result in the determination that the incident is material, and noted that the requirements of Item 1.05 do not preclude a registrant from consulting with the Department of Justice, including the FBI, the Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency, or any other law enforcement or national security agency at any point regarding the incident, including before a materiality assessment is completed.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gerding-statement-state-disclosure-review-062424?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></p>
<p>Further, I issued a statement in December that, among other things, &ldquo;encourag[ed] public companies to work with the FBI, CISA, and other law enforcement and national security agencies at the earliest possible moment after cybersecurity incidents occur&rdquo; and stated &ldquo;I believe this timely engagement is in the interest of investors and the public.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gerding-statement-state-disclosure-review-062424?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a></p>
<p>The Division staff will review both current reports about material cybersecurity incidents and selected annual disclosures to assess compliance with the rules, provide guidance, and improve disclosures.</p>
<p><i>Clawbacks</i></p>
<p>On October 26, 2022, the Commission adopted new rules mandated by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, which direct national securities exchanges to adopt listing standards that require listed companies to develop and implement a policy providing for the recovery of erroneously awarded incentive-based compensation received by current or former executive officers (a Clawback Policy) and to disclose such policy.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gerding-statement-state-disclosure-review-062424?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a></p>
<p>The Division staff will review disclosures to confirm the filing of the Clawback Policy and to assess disclosures when a recovery analysis is triggered.</p>
<p><i>Pay Versus Performance</i><a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gerding-statement-state-disclosure-review-062424?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>Consistent with the remarks above concerning pay versus performance disclosures, in 2024, the Division staff will continue its efforts to monitor disclosures made in response to this rule requirement and issue comments as necessary to improve disclosures. As it did in 2023, the Division staff will continue to leverage machine-readable data to make preliminary assessments of compliance with the rules.</p>
<p><i>Universal Proxy</i></p>
<p>On November 17, 2021, the Commission adopted rules requiring parties in a contested election to use universal proxy cards that include all director nominees presented for election at a shareholder meeting.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gerding-statement-state-disclosure-review-062424?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a></p>
<p>The Division staff is committed to helping ensure the smooth implementation of these important new rules and answering interpretive questions ahead of the proxy season. Since the universal proxy rules were adopted, the Division has published several C&amp;DIs addressing questions soliciting parties had about the new universal proxy rules and related disclosures.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gerding-statement-state-disclosure-review-062424?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a>&nbsp;In 2023, the first proxy season with universal proxy cards, the rules generally worked well, and there was no significant change in the number of proxy contests. In 2024, the Division staff will continue to review proxy contest filings to assess compliance with the universal proxy rules and improve disclosures regarding shareholders&rsquo; voting options.</p>
<p><i>Beneficial Ownership Reporting</i></p>
<p>On October 10, 2023, the Commission adopted amendments to modernize the rules governing beneficial ownership reporting.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gerding-statement-state-disclosure-review-062424?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a>&nbsp;The Division staff is closely monitoring the implementation of these new rules.</p>
<p>The Division staff will review selected beneficial ownership reports to assess compliance with the new, shortened filing deadlines and issue comments as necessary to improve required disclosures.</p>

Summary:
OCC requests comments on revising recovery planning guidelines for large banks, including testing standards and considering non-financial risks. <div>

<ul>
<li>Expand recovery planning guidelines to apply to banks with at least $100 billion in assets;</li>
<li>Incorporate a testing standard for recovery plans; and</li>
<li>Clarify the role of non-financial risk (including operational and strategic risk) in recovery planning.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div> Keywords: BIS, OTC derivatives, market value, credit exposure, clearing rates<br />
Summary: The latest BIS data shows OTC derivatives notional outstanding rose, but gross market value and credit exposure fell. Clearing rates remained high.<br /> <div>
<p>The latest data from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives statistics shows a rise in the notional outstanding of OTC derivatives during the second half of 2023 versus the second half of 2022, driven by growth in interest rate and foreign exchange (FX) derivatives. The gross market value of outstanding OTC derivatives fell during the period, attributed to a slower pace of US dollar rate tightening. Gross credit exposure also declined.</p>
<p>Global OTC derivatives notional outstanding grew by 7.9% at the end of 2023 compared to the previous year. The gross market value of OTC derivatives contracts dropped by 12.7% and gross credit exposure &ndash; gross market value after netting &ndash; fell by 12.3% over the same period.</p>
<p>Total mark-to-market exposure was reduced by 82.8% as a result of close-out netting. Credit exposure was further lowered by the collateral that market participants posted for cleared and noncleared transactions.</p>
<p>Clearing rates for both interest rate derivatives (IRD) and credit default swaps (CDS) remained high over the period. Firms posted $392.2 billion of initial margin (IM) for cleared IRD and CDS transactions at all major central counterparties (CCPs) at year-end 2023 compared to $384.4 billion at year-end 2022. The leading derivatives market participants also collected $1.4 trillion of IM and variation margin (VM) for non-cleared derivatives exposures at the end of 2023, flat compared to the year before.</p>

<div>
<p>Eurex Clearing is actively participating in the second wave of the Eurosystem&rsquo;s exploratory work on new technologies for wholesale central bank digital money settlement. These trials aim to explore the potential of distributed ledger technology (DLT).</p>
<p>The ECB has now officially confirmed the Wave 2 stakeholders which include Eurex Clearing and other market participants along with DLT operators like Clearstream.</p>
<p>As part of Wave 1 of the exploratory work, Eurex Clearing has been also engaged in testing the Trigger Solution developed by Deutsche Bundesbank. The use case focuses on a centrally cleared repo transaction. The repo instrument is a native digital commercial paper traded on Eurex Repo&rsquo;s F7 platform; issued and settled on Clearstream&rsquo;s D7 DLT-capable digital securities platform.</p>
<p>In Wave 2, Eurex Clearing is involved in trials that settle cash amounts via the ledger of the Banque de France&rsquo;s Full DLT Interoperability Solution. The Wave 2 trials encompass two use cases: cleared repo transactions, similar as in Wave 1, and intraday margin calls.</p>
<p>Matthias Graulich, Member of the Executive Board, Eurex Clearing AG: &ldquo;We are proud to be part of the second wave of ECB trials as well. As one of the world's leading central counterparties, we recognize the great potential of new technologies such as DLT. They can undoubtedly contribute to greater cost efficiency and process optimization in clearing and settlement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a trusted financial market infrastructure, Eurex Clearing is actively preparing for the digital transformation of the financial industry, ensuring that its risk models and methodologies uphold market integrity and safety. The exploratory work will lay the basis for future industry standards, particularly for interoperability between DLT platforms and traditional finance, in which financial market infrastructures like CCPs will play a crucial role.</p>

<div> open source, regulatory reporting, collaboration, financial institutions, industry-wide collaboration
Summary:
REGnosys contributes language for regulatory reporting to FINOS, enabling industry-wide collaboration. Rune supports ISDA's DRR and CDM, with support from financial institutions and DTCC. <div>
<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://regnosys.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">REGnosys</a>, the collaboration platform for regulatory reporting, has successfully contributed the language underpinning its digital regulatory reporting solution to the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.finos.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Fintech Open Source Foundation (FINOS)</a>, the financial services umbrella of the Linux Foundation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The language &ndash; formerly known as the Rosetta DSL (Domain-Specific Language) and renamed the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://github.com/finos/rune-dsl" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Rune DSL</a>&nbsp;&ndash; is now available under the FINOS open source governance, enabling members to contribute, test and share regulatory logic in a system- and technology-agnostic way. The language integrates seamlessly with REGnosys&rsquo;s award-winning data-modelling platform, Rosetta, which is also made available under a&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://ui.rosetta-technology.io/login" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">free version</a>&nbsp;to the community. This contribution further advances REGnosys&rsquo;s mission to build the future of data and reporting for financial markets through industry-wide collaboration &ndash; a goal that aligns with FINOS&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.finos.org/open-regtech" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Open RegTech</a>&nbsp;initiative.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rune&nbsp;has been deployed for production implementations of regulatory reporting under ISDA&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.isda.org/2023/04/04/drr-infohub" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Digital Regulatory Reporting</a>&nbsp;(DRR) programme. The ISDA DRR leverages another FINOS project, the​​​<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.finos.org/common-domain-model" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Common Domain Model (CDM)</a>​, to express global trade reporting rules as open-access, unambiguous, machine-executable code using the Rune language.&nbsp;The CDM &ndash; an open-source data standard for financial products, trades and lifecycle events developed by the FINOS community &ndash; is also supported in Rune.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Several financial institutions and market infrastructure firms have championed these Rune-powered collaboration projects as critical for operational efficiency and resilience. In November 2022, BNP Paribas&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.isda.org/2022/11/02/isda-and-bnp-paribas-successfully-test-digital-regulatory-reporting-for-cftc-rules" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a>&nbsp;that it had successfully implemented ISDA&rsquo;s DRR for trade reporting under the US CFTC Rewrite. Global financial institutions including J.P. Morgan Chase and Standard Chartered are also​<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.isda.org/2023/04/04/drr-infohub/#implement" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">supporting</a>​its ongoing development. In April this year, DTCC and REGnosys&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.dtcc.com/news/2024/april/10/dtcc-collaborates-with-regnosys-to-support-isda-digital-regulatory-reporting" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a>&nbsp;their collaboration to support ISDA&rsquo;s DRR. REGnosys connected its Rosetta platform to DTCC&rsquo;s Global Trade Repository, the industry leader in trade reporting, to enable the reliable testing of trade reporting submissions generated using the ISDA DRR in support of evolving trade reporting requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Leo Labeis, Founder and CEO at REGnosys, said:&nbsp;</b>&ldquo;From the outset, our vision has been to create a regulatory reporting solution that is built for the industry and by the industry. In a year of sea change within global regulatory reporting, with six major&nbsp;jurisdictions&nbsp;updating their trade reporting rules, the contribution of Rune to FINOS reinforces our&nbsp;commitment to community-driven compliance through modern, open-source initiatives.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Thomas Louis, GM CDO and Head of Regulatory &amp; Surveillance technology platform at BNP Paribas said:</b>&nbsp;&ldquo;BNP Paribas has been at the forefront of the development of CDM and its application to ISDA&rsquo;s DRR for several years, and welcomes the step taken by REGnosys to open source a critical supporting component of these projects. Having a language to co-develop regulatory code between market participants allows us to build compliance assurance at industry level.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Eleanor Kelly, Global Head of Markets Regulatory Change and Control at J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co, stated</b>: &ldquo;Ensuring we adhere to the highest standard of data quality and control in our regulatory reporting is of critical importance for J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. Being able to express all of our data requirements&rsquo; best practice into code and through industry consensus is a very effective way to achieve operational excellence and we recognise the benefits that open-source technology such as that contributed by REGnosys and FINOS offers to facilitate this.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Syed Ali,&nbsp;Managing Director of Repository &amp; Derivatives Services (RDS)</b><b>&nbsp;</b><b>at DTCC, stated</b>: &ldquo;DTCC remains committed to helping the industry achieve complete, accurate and timely derivatives trade regulatory reporting. By leveraging open-source, standardised and machine-readable logic, with capabilities that evolve as regulatory requirements evolve, firms are better placed to achieve compliance. We are pleased to be working with REGnosys and FINOS as we collectively champion operational efficiency and data accuracy in the derivatives trade reporting space.&rdquo;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Scott O&rsquo;Malia, Chief Executive of ISDA, said:</b>&nbsp;&ldquo;The ISDA DRR allows firms to implement new reporting requirements cost-effectively and accurately, reducing the risk of regulatory penalties for misreported data. We support all efforts to facilitate adoption of the ISDA DRR and CDM, so welcome the contribution of Rune as open source on FINOS.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Jane Gavronsky, Chief Operating Officer</b>&nbsp;<b>at FINOS, said:&nbsp;</b>&ldquo;We are excited to welcome Rune to the FINOS portfolio of open source and open standards projects. Regulatory reporting is one of the biggest challenges facing financial institutions today and FINOS's Open RegTech initiative brings the industry together to mutualize the creation of innovative solutions in an area ripe for open source disruption. Based on Rune's success, we look forward to its continued potential to enable the industry goal of more efficient compliance.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<div> clearing, ICE, U.S. Treasury securities, SEC, market

ICE to launch clearing service for U.S. Treasury securities and repurchasing agreements. Leveraging expertise, separate from CDS clearing.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE: ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today announced it will leverage its proven track record and expertise in central clearing and the fixed income market to launch a clearing service for all U.S. Treasury securities and repurchasing agreements. This follows the recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-247" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">announcement</a>&nbsp;by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) mandating for the expansion of U.S. Treasury securities clearing to enhance resilience in the market.</p>
<p>ICE operates many of the largest clearing houses globally and brings decades of experience in clearing products ranging from interest rates, energy, agricultural and equity derivative futures and options, as well as credit derivatives.</p>
<p>The new Treasury clearing service will leverage ICE&rsquo;s existing clearing house, ICE Clear Credit, which is the leading global clearing house for credit default swaps (CDS). The Treasury clearing service will be established as a distinct offering from the current CDS clearing service, and will have a separate rulebook, membership, risk management framework, financial and liquidity resources, and risk committee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over the last fifteen years, ICE Clear Credit has become the leading global clearing house for credit derivatives, and we believe it is strategically positioned to offer Treasury clearing services that will promote competition and help facilitate the SEC&rsquo;s policy objective of bringing increased transparency and standardized risk management to the Treasury securities market,&rdquo; said Stan Ivanov, President of ICE Clear Credit. &ldquo;The rich experience we&rsquo;ve developed creating and operating ICE Clear Credit and the work we&rsquo;ve done to ensure its compliance with all U.S. and foreign regulatory regimes has created a fertile environment for adding Treasury clearing to our suite of credit clearing services.&rdquo;</p>
<p>ICE Clear Credit was founded during the financial crisis in 2009 to bring confidence and stability to the CDS market. Since then, it has become the leading global clearing house for credit derivatives, including Single Name and Index CDS instruments, and options on index CDS. ICE Clear Credit offers clearing for more than 650 Single Name and Index CDS instruments referencing corporate and sovereign debt, and has reduced counterparty risk exposure by clearing approximately $200 trillion in two-sided notional amount, with open interest of over $1.75 trillion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The history of ICE Clear Credit and the way the team at ICE identified a market need that could benefit from modernization is the core of who we are as a company,&rdquo; said Chris Edmonds, President of ICE&rsquo;s Fixed Income and Data Services. &ldquo;As we look to add Treasury clearing to the breadth of services we offer for fixed income markets, we will leverage the successful playbook we developed in the past to offer an industry-trusted clearing solution along with the front-, middle- and back-office workflows our customers rely on to manage their daily business operations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As an SEC-registered Securities Clearing Agency, ICE Clear Credit has years of experience navigating and complying with complex regulatory requirements. Additionally, ICE Clear Credit is designated as a systemically important financial market utility (SIFMU) by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, and deemed a qualified central counterparty (QCCP) under U.S. bank capital rules.</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Takes Action Against Three Individuals From SVS Securities For Mistreatment Of Pension Funds</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: FCA, SVS Securities Plc, ban, fine, reckless behavior<br />
<br />
Summary: The FCA banned and fined three individuals for reckless behavior in managing SVS Securities Plc, resulting in customer losses and breach of rules.<br /> <div>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffcc99;">Demetrios Hadjigeorgiou and David Stephen have referred their Decision Notices to the Upper Tribunal where they will each present their respective cases. Any findings in these individuals&rsquo; Decision Notices and the descriptions of those findings in this press release are therefore provisional and reflect the FCA&rsquo;s belief as to what occurred and how it considers their behaviour is to be characterised.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffcc99;">Kulvir Virk has not referred the FCA&rsquo;s decision to the Upper Tribunal and his Final Notice has not been the subject of any judicial finding. To the extent that Kulvir Virk&rsquo;s Final Notice contains criticisms of Demetrios Hadjigeorgiou and David Stephen, they have received Decision Notices which set these out. They dispute many of the facts and any characterisation of their actions in Kulvir Virk&rsquo;s Final Notice and have referred their Decision Notices to the Upper Tribunal for determination. The Tribunal's decision in respect of the individuals' references will be made public on its website.</span></p>
<p>The FCA has decided to ban and fine 3 individuals who were involved in running SVS Securities Plc (SVS), a discretionary fund manager.</p>
<p>SVS managed investments held on behalf of its customers. Under FCA rules, the firm was required to act in the best interests of its customers and not let conflicts of interests interfere with its obligations to them.</p>
<p>Kulvir Virk, the former CEO and majority shareholder, recklessly caused SVS to use a complex business model intended to maximise the flow of customer funds into high-risk illiquid bonds. These bonds were operated by directors of SVS and a close business associate of Mr Virk. The model involved inducements to SVS and unauthorised introducers with undisclosed commissions of up to 12% of the customers&rsquo; investments. The model created systematic conflicts of interests and inappropriately prioritised income to SVS over the best interests of customers.</p>
<p>879 customers paid in a total of &pound;69.1m. Bonds into which they were invested by SVS have since defaulted, with customers unlikely to receive more than a fraction of their investment back.</p>
<p>In the FCA&rsquo;s view, as Head of Compliance, David Stephen failed to fulfil his responsibilities to ensure SVS was following the rules. Demetrios Hadjigeorgiou, SVS&rsquo;s former finance director then CEO, also failed to fulfil his responsibilities to manage conflicts of interest and ensure proper due diligence was carried out.</p>
<p>The FCA has found that the 3 individuals acted recklessly in deciding to mark-down customers&rsquo; valuations when they disinvested from fixed income assets, with the result that SVS kept 10% of customer funds. This allowed them to generate &pound;359,800 in income for SVS at the expense of its customers.</p>
<p>The FCA has decided to fine Mr Virk, &pound;215,500; Mr Hadjigeorgiou, &pound;84,600; and Mr Stephen, &pound;52,100. The FCA has banned Mr Virk from working in financial services, and decided to ban Mr Hadjigeorgiou and Mr Stephen from holding senior management roles.</p>
<p><span>Therese Chambers, Joint Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight, said</span>:</p>
<p>'These three individuals and SVS were a central part of a tangled web which concealed the fact that customers&rsquo; pension money was being invested into high-risk bonds. Customers were entitled to trust that SVS would act in their best interests, but it repeatedly prioritised income for itself and its associates.</p>
<p>'The actions of those in charge threatened the ability of their customers to enjoy a secure and comfortable retirement. This kind of behaviour has life-changing consequences for consumers.'</p>

<div> Central Bank of Italy, International Journal of Central Banking, conference, monetary policy, academic research
Summary: Central Bank of Italy hosts International Journal of Central Banking conference on post-pandemic monetary policy with academic research and distinguished scholars. <div>
<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-md-8">
<p>Thank you, Stefano, and thank you to the Central Bank of Italy (CBI) for hosting this year's conference.</p>
<p>When it is in the news, central banking often looks like the work of individual policymakers handing down their decisions. In fact, it is a team effort of many people working together, and that is also the case for editing the&nbsp;<em>International Journal of Central Banking</em>&nbsp;(IJCB) and planning this conference. I have a long list of people to thank who did the lion's share of that work during the year that I have served as managing editor. But for those who may not know it, let me first review the history of the journal and then discuss what this conference will address.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2004, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the European Central Bank, and the Group of Ten central banks agreed to support the development of a new publication focused on the theory and practice of central banking. We didn't launch this journal because there was a shortage of research on central banking or of journals eager to publish it. Far from it. Central bankers themselves continue to publish peer-reviewed research in leading journals, not to mention many working papers published by central banks and other outlets. This work was prevalent, but there was a sense that there lacked a place for scholarly research that focused exclusively on central banking and could serve as a forum for the community of central bankers around the world. The creation of the International Journal of Central Banking filled this deficit.</p>
<p>The primary objectives of the IJCB are to widely disseminate the best policy-relevant and applied research on central banking and to promote communication among researchers inside and outside central banks. We do this with publication of the journal, which will now be coming out six times a year, and with the added attention of this conference, which presents research on timely policy topics. The journal has attracted distinguished managing editors, including my colleagues from the Federal Reserve and my immediate predecessor, Luc Laeven from the European Central Bank. We have the strong support now of nearly 55 sponsoring institutions, including the Central Bank of Italy and also the host of last year's conference, the Central Bank of Ireland.</p>
<p>In 2023, we chose the theme for this year's conference based on events very much on the minds of central bankers: "The Transmission of Monetary Policy in the Post-Pandemic World." Many things changed both during COVID and after. First, there was an unprecedented fiscal and monetary policy response to the pandemic. Second, structural changes have occurred, including supply chain issues and shifts in the organization of work. Finally, economies have been grappling with elevated inflation. This economic environment has raised several policy questions that the papers presented here attempt to answer. These are questions that policymakers, including those here today, must grapple with, even when the answers are far from apparent. Academic research provides insights into these questions and possible answers, ways to analyze the data, and the foundations for testing theories with economic models.</p>
<p>The papers presented here today and tomorrow are ideal examples of the kind of work that can help policymakers do their jobs better, and can facilitate the sharing of knowledge around the world. We have sessions on how firms' balance sheets, households' savings and borrowing decisions, as well as supply chains, influence monetary policy transmission. We also will look into financial market impacts and labor market considerations of the current policy environment.</p>
<p>Before we get to those presentations, and what I hope will be vigorous discussions, let me recognize several people who made this event possible. Here at the CBI, Stefano and Enrico Sette helped organize this conference. Enrico is a co-editor of the IJCB. Let me mention the other co-editors: Ana Babus, Diana Bonfim, Huberto Ennis, Carlos Garriga, Refet G&uuml;rkaynak, &Ograve;scar Jord&agrave;, Robin Lumsdaine, Fernanda Nechio, and Steven Ongena. This conference and the day-to-day smooth running of the journal couldn't be accomplished without the editorial team at the BIS and the Board of Governors. A special thank you goes to Kommaly Dias and Jessica Flagg from my staff. And, finally, a big thank you to my adviser Jane Ihrig, who does so much for me and who worked to oversee the process at the IJCB this past year.</p>
<p>And with that, I will step away from the microphone and put the spotlight where it should be, on the scholars presenting their work today. Thank you, and I believe [Enrico] has a few words to get us started.</p>

<div> Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities, MSMS, MUBK, FSA, administrative action <br />
Summary:<br /> 
FSA took administrative actions against MUMSS, MSMS, and MUBK for violations, including sharing non-public client information and unfair trading. Requests for improvement and reports were also made. <div>
<p class="indent">Today, the Financial Services Agency (hereinafter "FSA") took administrative actions against Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co., Ltd. (Chiyoda City, Tokyo; corporate number: 4010001129098; hereinafter &ldquo;MUMSS&rdquo;), Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities Co., Ltd. (Chiyoda City, Tokyo; corporate number: 2011001046046; hereinafter &ldquo;MSMS&rdquo;), and MUFG Bank, Ltd. (Chiyoda City, Tokyo; corporate number: 5010001008846; hereinafter &ldquo;MUBK&rdquo;), as described in I. below. In addition, the FSA asked to submit reports as described in II. below to MUBK and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. (Chiyoda City, Tokyo; corporate number: 4010001073486; hereinafter &ldquo;MUFG&rdquo;).</p>
<h2>I. Administrative action against MUMSS, MSMS and MUBK</h2>
<h3><strong><span>1. Reasons for the administrative action</span></strong></h3>
<div>
<p class="indent">As a result of conducting an on-site inspection of MUMSS, MSMS and MUBK, the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission (hereinafter "SESC") made a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsa.go.jp/sesc/english/news/reco/20240614-2.html" target="_blank">recommendation<span class="icon-blank"><img alt="open new window" src="https://www.fsa.go.jp/images/common/icon_newwin.gif" /></span></a>&nbsp;for taking an administrative action on June 14, 2024, based on the findings of the following violations of laws and regulations, etc.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="indent">The Financial Instruments and Exchange Act (hereinafter &ldquo;FIEA&rdquo;) prohibits a Financial Instruments Business Operator from providing and/or receiving non-public client information among financial firms within the group, without the consent of clients. Nevertheless, the above three firms repeatedly shared non-public client information, knowing that their clients asked not to share their information with other firms within the group, and some of the information contained material information that would impact investment decisions. These findings led to the conclusion that the three firms had deficiencies in internal control environment for the management of information. (The SESC also found that one employee of MUBK had engaged in unfair trading in violation of the FIEA due to these deficiencies.)</p>
<p class="indent">Furthermore, the FIEA prohibits a Financial Instruments Business Operator from soliciting the financial instruments transaction contract by using non-public information without the consent of their clients. The SESC found, however, that a board member of MUMSS had received confidential information of their clients from an executive officer of MUBK, and MUMSS, together with MSMS, used the information for solicitation of offer to sell financial instruments to their clients.</p>
<p class="indent">Lastly, the FIEA prohibits a bank from conducting Securities-Related Business (underwriting business). Nevertheless, MUBK repeatedly negotiated for the underwriting shares on behalf of MUMSS. Among such cases, it was found that MUBK had engaged in a tie-in negotiation, asking for more underwriting shares of MUMSS as a condition of MUBK&rsquo;s loan agreement.</p>

<div> extend, comment period, proposal, Fedwire Funds Service, National Settlement Service
Summary:
The Federal Reserve Board extends the comment period for its proposal to expand the operating days of Fedwire Funds Service and NSS. The proposal aims to operate these services every day of the year, with the same operating hours. The proposal does not include changes to the Fedwire Securities Service or the FedNow Service. <div>
<p>The Federal Reserve Board on Friday announced that it will extend until September 6, 2024, the comment period on its proposal to expand the operating days of the Federal Reserve Banks' two large-value payments services, Fedwire<span>&reg;</span>&nbsp;Funds Service and the National Settlement Service (NSS), to include weekends and holidays. The Board extended the comment period to allow the public more time to analyze the proposal and prepare their comments. Comments on the proposal were originally due by July 8, 2024.</p>
<p>Currently, both the Fedwire Funds Service and the NSS operate Monday through Friday, excluding holidays. Under the proposal, both services would operate every day of the year. The operating hours each day would remain the same, with the Fedwire Funds Service open 22 hours per day, and NSS open 21.5 hours per day.</p>
<p>The Fedwire Funds Service is a wholesale payment service that allows service participants to send and receive individual electronic funds transfers up to $10 billion. The NSS is a settlement service for participants in private-sector clearing arrangements, such as check clearinghouses, a private-sector automated clearinghouse network, and securities settlement systems. The proposal does not include changes to the Fedwire Securities Service or the Federal Reserve's new retail service for instant payments, the FedNow<span>&reg;</span>&nbsp;Service.</p>

<p>Established to honour the most outstanding B2C and B2B brands in the online trading and fintech domain and provide traders and businesses with an industry benchmark, the UF Awards are widely considered as one of the sector's most sought-after prizes.

<p>Invited on stage to receive the award, FP Markets CEO Craig Allison expressed his gratitude and commented: 'The two UF Awards we've won tonight are the embodiment of what we strive to achieve as a company on a daily basis: deliver a superior trading destination for traders while at the same time uphold our core values of integrity, transparency and innovation and we continue to find ways to provide the best possible trading conditions'.</p>

<title>Acting US Comptroller Of The Currency Issues Statement On FDIC Industrial Loan Company Application</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael J. Hsu issued the following statement at yesterday&rsquo;s Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) board meeting regarding the application from Thrivent Financial for federal deposit insurance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I support the deposit insurance application for a proposed industrial bank to be owned by Thrivent Financial for Lutherans (Thrivent Financial). Thrivent Financial, a $113 billion company, and its subsidiaries offer nationwide financial and investment advice, trust services, and investment and insurance products. In addition, Thrivent Financial proposes to merge Thrivent Financial Credit Union, a $832 million federally chartered credit union, into the proposed industrial bank.</em></p>
<p><em>The proposed industrial bank and combined entity would broaden Thrivent Financial&rsquo;s reach within the general population and attract new clients beyond the credit union&rsquo;s restricted field of membership and capital growth limitations. Merging the credit union into the industrial bank would establish the bank&rsquo;s foundation, providing infrastructure, comprehensive product and service offerings, established risk and compliance practices, and experienced personnel. Pursuant to a master servicing agreement, the bank would leverage certain resources available through its affiliates&rsquo; existing infrastructure.</em></p>
<p><em>The proposed bank would look a lot like a community bank. The organizers have developed a comprehensive and diverse business plan outlining an operating strategy that is supported by reasonable financial projections. The bank would be sufficiently capitalized, and Thrivent Financial would execute a capital and liquidity management agreement to serve as a source of financial strength to the Bank. In the event of financial stress or failure at its parent, the bank would retain franchise value mitigating risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund. For these reasons and considering the statutory factors, I support the deposit insurance application submitted by Thrivent Financial. I also support the merger application filed to merge Thrivent Financial Credit Union into the industrial bank.</em></p>

<title>Acting US Comptroller Of The Currency Issues Statement On New Reporting Channels for FDIC Complaints</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael J. Hsu issued the following statement at yesterday's Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) board meeting regarding the creation of the Office of Professional Conduct and the Office of Equal Employment Opportunity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I strongly support the creation of the Office of Professional Conduct (OPC) and the Office of Equal Employment Opportunity (OEEO).</em></p>
<p><em>The employees of the FDIC need and deserve a safe and inclusive workplace. For far too long, however, the fear of retaliation and a confusing, ineffective complaints process have prevented that. Such fear and confusion led to underreporting, a lack of accountability, and space for wrongdoers to perpetuate the old boys&rsquo; club.</em></p>
<p><em>As the Cleary Report notes, fixing this requires cultural and structural transformation. Replacing the agency&rsquo;s broken internal processes with the OPC and OEEO is a critical step in that transformation.</em></p>
<p><em>The OPC would serve as a single point of entry to intake, investigate with the support from third parties, report, determine discipline, and represent the FDIC in any challenges to that discipline regarding complaints of harassment and other interpersonal misconduct or complaints of retaliation for reporting such harassment or misconduct. The OEEO would manage the agency&rsquo;s Equal Employment Opportunity Program and serve as a single point of entry to intake, investigate with the support from third parties, process, and report about complaints of discrimination. Each office would be led by a Director, who would be a new Officer of the FDIC. The offices and their Directors would report directly to the Board of Directors to ensure accountability and mitigate the risk of retaliation by supervisors. The investigations conducted by the OPC and OEEO would be supported by third-party investigators to ensure independence and expertise.</em></p>
<p><em>The creation of these offices is an important step in protecting the employees of the FDIC and earning back their trust. I strongly support this action.</em></p>

<title>US Federal Agencies Announce Results Of Resolution Plan Review For Largest And Most Complex Banks</title>

<div> submissions, weakness, resolution, deficiency, feedback
Summary:<br />FDIC and Federal Reserve identified weaknesses in resolution plans from four major banks, outlining required remedial actions and areas for development. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Federal Reserve Board today announced that, following their joint review of the July 2023 resolution plan submissions of the eight largest and most complex banks, they identified a weakness in the plans from Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan Chase. The agencies did not identify any weaknesses in the plans from the other banks.</p>
<p>Resolution plans, also known as living wills, must describe a bank's strategy for orderly resolution in bankruptcy in the event of its material financial distress or failure. The agencies have jointly determined that each weakness identified in the 2023 plans from Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan Chase is a "shortcoming." A shortcoming is a weakness that raises questions about the feasibility of the plan.</p>
<p>The agencies jointly identified a weakness in the 2023 plan submitted by Citigroup, but reached different conclusions on its severity. The FDIC determined that the Citigroup plan is not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and considers the weakness to be a "deficiency." A deficiency is a weakness that could undermine the feasibility of the plan. The Board concluded that the weakness is only a shortcoming. Under the resolution planning rule of the agencies, when one agency finds a shortcoming in a resolution plan and the other agency finds a deficiency, the plan is deemed to have a shortcoming. As a result, Citigroup's 2023 plan is considered to have a shortcoming. The agencies also previously identified a shortcoming in Citigroup's 2021 plan related to data quality and data management, and that shortcoming remains outstanding.</p>
<p>The agencies provided feedback letters to each of the eight banks that identify areas for continued development of banks' resolution strategies and capabilities. For the four banks with an identified shortcoming, the letters describe the specific weaknesses resulting in the shortcoming and the remedial actions required by the agencies. The shortcomings are to be addressed in the next resolution plans due by July 1, 2025. The feedback letters also specify that each bank, in its 2025 resolution plan submission, should address the topics of contingency planning and obtaining foreign government actions necessary to execute the resolution strategy.</p>

<title>The EBA Updates The Pillar 3 Disclosure Framework Finalising The Implementation Of The Basel III Pillar 3 Framework</title>

<div> Implementing Technical Standards, Basel III, Pillar 3, Disclosure, CRR 3<br />
<br />Summary: The EBA published draft ITS on public disclosures by institutions to implement changes in the Pillar 3 disclosure framework. Requirements align with Basel III. <div>
<ul>
<li><em>Today&rsquo;s publication of draft implementing technical standards is a key milestone in the implementation of the latest Basel III disclosure reforms laid down in the new Banking Package.</em></li>
<li><em>The new ITS implement the CRR 3 disclosure requirements on output floor, credit risk, market risk, CVA risk, operational risk and a transitional disclosure on exposures to crypto-assets.</em></li>
<li><em>The alignment of the disclosure requirements with the Basel III framework and its integration with supervisory reporting will promote comparability and consistency of the information.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today a final draft implementing technical standards (ITS) on public disclosures by institutions that implement the changes in the Pillar 3 disclosure framework introduced by the amending Regulation (EU) 2024/1623 (CRR 3). These ITS will ensure that market participants have sufficient comparable information to assess the risk profiles of institutions and understand compliance with CRR 3 requirements, further promoting market discipline.</span></p>
<p>The amending Regulation (EU) 2024/1623 (&lsquo;CRR 3&rsquo;) introduced new and amended disclosure requirements stemming from the latest Basel III Pillar 3 reforms, and a mandate for the EBA to develop IT solutions, including templates and instructions, for the disclosure requirements laid down in the banking regulation. The new ITS implement the CRR 3 prudential disclosures by including new requirements on output floor, credit risk, market risk, CVA risk, operational risk and a transitional disclosure on exposures to crypto-assets. In addition, they aim to provide institutions with a comprehensive integrated set of uniform disclosure formats while promoting market discipline.</p>
<p>These ITS constitute the first Pillar 3 deliverable included in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-12/9dc534e8-8a3d-438f-88e3-bc86e623d99e/EBA%20Roadmap%20on%20strengthening%20the%20prudential%20framework_1.pdf">EBA Roadmap on strengthening the prudential framework</a>&nbsp;published in December 2023. Later in 2024, the EBA will complement these ITS with the CRR 3 disclosure requirements that are not directly linked to Basel III implementation, in particular&nbsp; &nbsp;the extension of the disclosure requirements on ESG risks to all institutions in accordance with the proportionality principle, and new disclosure requirements on shadow banking.</p>
<p>Following the mandate for the EBA to develop IT solutions, these ITS are designed to repeal the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/637, with a view to make the technical standards more user-friendly for institutions. The IT solutions according to which disclosures have to be provided, including templates and instructions, can be found on the EBA website.</p>
<p>When developing these ITS, the EBA has sought alignment and integration between the disclosure and reporting frameworks, to facilitate institutions' compliance with both requirements, and an updated mapping tool between the revised disclosure templates and the reporting templates is expected to be published at the beginning of July, together with the new ITS on supervisory reporting for the CRR 3 implementation&nbsp; published for consultation, together with these ITS, in December 2024. The EBA will later publish a technical package, including DPM, validation rules and taxonomy, that shall be used by large and other institutions to submit this information to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/risk-and-data-analysis/reporting-frameworks/reporting-framework-41">EBA Pillar 3 data hub</a>.</p>
<h4>Legal basis and background</h4>
<p>Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (&lsquo;the CRR&rsquo;) as amended by Regulation (EU) 2024/1623 (&lsquo;CRR 3&rsquo;) mandates the EBA, in articles 434a, to develop draft implementing technical standards to specify uniform disclosure formats, and IT solutions, including instructions, for disclosure requirements under Titles II and III of the CRR.</p>
<p>The CRR 3 implements the latest Basel 3 reforms, which strengthen the EU institutions&rsquo; prudential framework, including also the related new and amended disclosure requirements for institutions.</p>
<p>Following article 434a(1), new draft implementing technical standards have been developed that implement the CRR 3 changes to the Pillar 3 disclosure framework and replace the Commission Implementing Regulations (EU) 2021/637. The new ITS caters for possible developments related to the FRTB capital framework.&nbsp;</p>

<title>Bank Of England - Asset Purchase Facility: Gilt Sales – Market Notice 21 June 2024</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/bank-of-england-asset-purchase-facility-gilt-sales-market-notice-21-june-20/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/bank-of-england-asset-purchase-facility-gilt-sales-market-notice-21-june-20/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Schedule, gilts, Asset Purchase Facility, sales, monetary policy<br />
Summary: The Bank of England will reduce the stock of gilts by £100 billion from October 2023 to September 2024 through quarterly auctions.<br /> <div>
<p><span>This Market Notice sets out the schedule for sales in Q3 2024 of gilts held in the Asset Purchase Facility (APF) for monetary policy purposes.</span></p>
<p>At its September 2023 meeting, the MPC voted to reduce the stock of gilts held in the APF for monetary policy purposes by &pound;100 billion over the period from October 2023 to September 2024, to a total of &pound;658 billion.</p>
<p>The Bank set out in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/market-notices/2022/september/apf-gilt-sales-market-notice-1-september-2022">consolidated APF gilt sales Market Notice</a>&nbsp;published on 1 September 2022 that it would publish a quarterly schedule for the sales of gilts held in the APF for monetary policy purposes. The details and schedule for the Q3 2024 sales of such gilts are set out in this Market Notice, which covers the period from 1 July 2024 to the week commencing 30 September 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As set out in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/market-notices/2023/december/apf-gilt-sales-market-notice-15-december-2023">15 December 2023 Market Notice</a>, the Bank will set a schedule of auctions in order to continue to reduce the APF as evenly as possible across maturity sectors, measured in initial proceeds terms. These sectors are defined as gilts with a residual maturity of between: 3-7 years (short), 7-20 years (medium) and over 20 years (long).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Accordingly, in Q3 2024, the Bank will sell short maturity sector bonds across four auctions of &pound;800 million, medium maturity sector bonds across four auctions of &pound;725 million, and long maturity sector bonds across two auctions of &pound;650 million. Further details are outlined in the table below.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As this is the final quarter of the period over which the MPC&rsquo;s &pound;100 billion target set in September 2023 applies, it may be necessary for the Bank to make some adjustment to the sizes of the final three auctions. If any adjustment is required, the Bank will provide the market with advance notice in a similar way to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/market-notices/2023/september/apf-gilt-sales-market-notice-1-sept-2023">Market Notice of 1 September 2023</a>.</p>
<p>Other than as amended in this Market Notice, the detailed operational parameters and participation requirements set out previously will apply to these gilt sales.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Bank will continue to monitor the impact of its gilt sales programme on market conditions, and reserves the right to amend its schedule, including the gilts to be sold and the size of its auctions, or any other aspect of its approach at its sole discretion.</p>
<p>The Bank intends to communicate any future sales schedules for 2024 Q4 or beyond following the MPC&rsquo;s annual review of the reduction in the stock of purchased gilts over the next twelve-month period, which is expected to be announced alongside the MPC meeting on 19 September 2024.&nbsp;</p>

<title>ICE First Look: Mortgage Performance Remains Strong As Delinquencies, Foreclosures Continue To Improve In May</title>

<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li>The national delinquency rate fell 6 basis points (bps) year over year to 3.04% in May; still the second lowest point on record, behind 2.92% in March 2023</li>
<li>A fifth consecutive monthly improvement in serious delinquencies (those loans 90+ days past due, but not yet in active foreclosure) reset what had already been a more than 18-year low</li>
<li>The number of mortgage-holders who&rsquo;ve missed a single payment dropped by -19K, while 60-day delinquencies edged up slightly (+4K) from April</li>
<li>While inflow of borrowers newly 30 days late dropped to a one-year low, those rolling to later stages of delinquency edged higher from April and fewer delinquent loans cured to current status</li>
<li>Foreclosure starts were down -6.5% from April, keeping active foreclosure inventory at the lowest level since pandemic-era moratoria were lifted in January 2022</li>
<li>The total number of mortgage-holders currently in active foreclosure remains 32% below (-92K) pre-pandemic levels</li>
<li>Though up slightly for the month, foreclosure sales (completions) in May were down -7.2% year over year and remain well below pre-pandemic norms</li>
<li>A seasonal rise in home sales and slightly improved refi volumes pushed prepayments to their highest level since September 2022, even as rate-related headwinds persist</li>

<div> Henan Province, LuxSE, HNCA, green bond, sustainable aviation industry
Summary:<br /><br />Henan Province's HNCA listed its first international green bond at LuxSE, marking a milestone in sustainable aviation finance and Luxembourg-China cooperation. <div>
<p><b>During a special Ring the Bell ceremony held at the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (LuxSE) today, in the presence of the Governor of the Henan Province, LuxSE and Henan Civil Aviation Development &amp; Investment Co. Ltd (HNCA), celebrated the listing of the Chinese aviation group&rsquo;s first international green bond.</b></p>
<p>As part of an official visit by a high-level delegation from the Chinese province of Henan and its aviation industry to Luxembourg this week, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (LuxSE) and Henan Civil Aviation Development &amp; Investment Co. Ltd (HNCA) took part in a special Ring the Bell ceremony to mark HNCA&rsquo;s debut in international capital markets with a RMB 200 million green bond aimed at transitioning towards a more sustainable aviation industry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The aviation industry can and must play an important role in creating a more low-carbon future. As a leader in the field of sustainable finance, we are delighted to welcome HNCA to the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and Luxembourg Green Exchange with this important green bond. This issuance underpins HNCA&rsquo;s commitment to creating a more sustainable aviation industry, and we look forward to supporting its efforts in the future as we continue to help finance the decarbonisation of the transportation industry,&rdquo; said Julie Becker, CEO of LuxSE.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>Leading the way in sustainable aviation</b></h4>
<p>HNCA&rsquo;s inaugural green bond also marks its debut in international capital markets, making it the first Chinese entity to issue a green bond focusing on sustainable aviation fuel among other key sustainable projects.</p>
<p>Projects to be financing through this RMB 200 million bond include the research, production and manufacturing of sustainable aviation fuel, Cargolux&rsquo;s Sustainable&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 11px;">Aviation Fuel Programme, and the construction of a green building project that will become the Group&rsquo;s Aviation Training Centre.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;This bond issuance marks an important moment in HNCA&rsquo;s continuous efforts to strengthen its cooperation with the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the Grand-Duchy as a whole. We look forward to further collaborating to mobilise international capital to support the development of a more sustainable aviation industry and the development of the Henan Province,&rdquo; said Zhang Mingchao, Party Secretary and Chairman of HNCA.</p>
<h4><b>Building on Luxembourg-China cooperation</b></h4>
<p>In 2014, HNCA completed the purchase of a 35% stake in Luxembourg&rsquo;s flag carrier cargo airline, Cargolux. Since then, HNCA has continued to work closely with key actors in Luxembourg to further connect the Grand-Duchy with mainland China - a move that today has expanded into sustainable finance for the aviation sector through the listing of its inaugural green bond at LuxSE.</p>
<p>The Ring the Bell ceremony was organised in the context of an official visit by a high-level delegation from the Henan Province to Luxembourg, which included the Second Zhengzhou-Luxembourg Air Silk Road International Cooperation Forum at LuxExpo on 20 June, in which Vice Premier of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China Ding Xuexiang, Deputy Prime Minister of Luxembourg Xavier Bettel and LuxSE&rsquo;s CEO Julie Becker were in attendance.</p>

<p><span><span>Some of the notable VC funding deals announced in the UK during January-May 2024 included around $1 billion worth of funding secured by Wayve, $1 billion capital raising by Abound, $431 million worth of funding raised by Monzo, $112 million capital raising by Exohood Labs, $110 million funding secured by Skyports, and $110 million capital raising by Build A Rocket Boy, among others.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Bose adds:&nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;The UK stands as the top European market for VC funding activity and was also among the top five markets globally both in terms of VC deals volume and value during January-May 2024.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The UK accounted for a 7.2% share of the total number of VC deals announced globally during the first five months of 2024, while its share of the corresponding disclosed funding value stood at 6.5%.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note: Historic data may change in case some deals get added to previous months because of a delay in disclosure of information in the public domain</span></span></p>

<title>US Acting Comptroller Of The Currency Issues Statement On FDIC Resolution Plan Rule</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> regulator, resolution planning, FDIC, final rule, insured depository institution <br />
Summary: Acting Comptroller of the Currency supports the final rule to modify the IDI resolution plan rule, requiring detailed plans for resolution submissions. <div>
<p>Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael J. Hsu issued the following statement at today&rsquo;s Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) board meeting regarding the final rule on insured depository institution (IDI) resolution planning.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>As a long-time regulator of large financial institutions, I know first-hand the consequences of complacency when it comes to resolvability. Those consequences can include not just disorderly failure and the need for extraordinary government action, but also a broader loss of trust in banks and their regulators. It is on us to remain vigilant to safeguard that trust.</em></p>
<p><em>I support the final rule to modify the current insured depository institution (IDI) resolution plan rule, codified at 12 CFR 360.10, including requirements for the content, timing, and evaluation of resolution submissions, to support the FDIC&rsquo;s readiness in the event of material distress and failure of a covered IDI (CIDI).</em></p>
<p><em>The FDIC published a notice of proposed rulemaking in September 2023 to modify the current IDI resolution plan rule. I appreciate the thoughtful comments, all of which were carefully analyzed and considered. While this final rule retains key elements from the proposal, it is improved by several modifications taken from commenters. The final rule requires CIDIs with at least $100 billion in total assets, or Group A CIDIs, to develop and submit detailed plans demonstrating how they could be resolved in an orderly and timely manner in the event of receivership. These plans must include an identified strategy that would provide timely access to insured deposits, maximize value from the sale or disposition of assets, minimize any losses realized by creditors in resolution, and address potential risk of adverse effects on US economic conditions or financial stability.</em></p>
<p><em>CIDIs with at least $50 billion but less than $100 billion in total assets, or Group B CIDIs, are required to submit more limited informational filings that will support the development of strategic options for resolution of the CIDI by the FDIC. To implement these requirements, I support termination of the existing moratorium on submission of resolution filings by Group B CIDIs.</em></p>
<p><em>Importantly, the final rule requires that CIDIs be able to demonstrate the capabilities necessary to ensure that franchise components, such as asset portfolios or lines of business, are marketable in resolution. Submissions must describe capabilities to establish a virtual data room in a timely manner to market such franchise components. Such capabilities would improve not only the likelihood of orderly resolution, but also the chances of recovery when banks are in stress.</em></p>
<p><em>For these reasons, I support the final rulemaking to revise the IDI resolution plan rule. I especially want to thank the staff for their dedication and hard work on this matter.</em></p>
</blockquote>

The Division of Corporation Finance clarifies that the rules on cybersecurity incident disclosure do not restrict private sharing of information. Regulation FD still applies, but there are exceptions. The selective disclosure rules are not a significant obstacle to sharing information about material cybersecurity incidents. Despite some companies' hesitance, sharing information about a material cybersecurity incident is generally not prohibited by the Commission's rules.<br /> <div>
<p><a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gerding-cybersecurity-incidents-06202024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn*" name="_ftnref*">[*]</a>Last year, the Commission adopted rules requiring public companies to disclose material cybersecurity incidents under Item 1.05 of Form 8-K.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gerding-cybersecurity-incidents-06202024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp; Since then, staff in the Division of Corporation Finance have heard assertions that those rules may preclude a company from sharing additional information about a material cybersecurity incident with others, including their commercial counterparties.&nbsp; Apparently, some companies are under the impression that if they experience a material cybersecurity incident, the Commission&rsquo;s new rules prohibit them from discussing that incident beyond what was included in the Item 1.05 Form 8-K disclosing the incident.&nbsp; That is not the case.</p>
<p>Item 1.05 of Form 8-K requires a company that experiences a cybersecurity incident that it determines to be material to describe the material aspects of the nature, scope, and timing of the incident, as well as the incident&rsquo;s material impact or reasonably likely material impact on the company, including its financial condition and results of operations.&nbsp; Nothing in Item 1.05 prohibits a company from privately discussing a material cybersecurity incident with other parties or from providing information about the incident to such parties beyond what was included in an Item 1.05 Form 8-K.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gerding-cybersecurity-incidents-06202024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp; Those parties may include commercial counterparties, such as vendors and customers, as well as other companies that may be impacted by, or at risk from, the same incident or threat actor.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gerding-cybersecurity-incidents-06202024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp; I recognize that sharing information about a material cybersecurity incident with those parties may assist with remediation, mitigation, or risk avoidance efforts and may facilitate those parties&rsquo; compliance with their own incident disclosure and reporting obligations, if required under the Commission&rsquo;s rules or other regulatory regimes.</p>
<p>I also recognize that companies could conceivably have concerns that privately disclosing additional information regarding a material cybersecurity incident beyond what was included in an Item 1.05 Form 8-K could implicate the Commission&rsquo;s rules regarding selective disclosures that are set forth in Regulation FD. &nbsp;It is important to reiterate the scope of Regulation FD.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gerding-cybersecurity-incidents-06202024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp; As is well-known, Regulation FD requires public disclosure of any material nonpublic information that has been selectively disclosed to securities market professionals or shareholders, as specified in the regulation.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gerding-cybersecurity-incidents-06202024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp; Depending on the information disclosed, and the persons to whom that information is disclosed, discussions regarding a cybersecurity incident may implicate Regulation FD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That said, nothing in Item 1.05 alters Regulation FD or makes it apply any differently to communications regarding cybersecurity incidents. &nbsp;There are several ways that a public company can privately share information regarding a material cybersecurity incident beyond what was disclosed in its Item 1.05 Form 8-K without implicating Regulation FD.&nbsp; For example, the information that is being privately shared about the incident may be immaterial, or the parties with whom the information is being shared may not be one of the types of persons covered by Regulation FD.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gerding-cybersecurity-incidents-06202024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp; Further, even if the information being shared is material nonpublic information and the parties with whom the information is being shared are the types of persons covered by Regulation FD, an exclusion from the application of Regulation FD may apply.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gerding-cybersecurity-incidents-06202024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp; For example, if the information is being shared with a person who owes a duty of trust or confidence to the issuer (such as an attorney, investment banker, or accountant)<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gerding-cybersecurity-incidents-06202024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;or if the person with whom the information being shared expressly agrees to maintain the disclosed information in confidence (<i>e.g.</i>, if they enter into a confidentiality agreement with the issuer),<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gerding-cybersecurity-incidents-06202024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;then public disclosure of that privately-shared information will not be required under Regulation FD.</p>
<p>While some companies may have a general reticence to privately share information regarding a material cybersecurity incident, as discussed earlier, the Commission&rsquo;s rules generally do not prohibit the sharing of such information.&nbsp; The selective disclosure rules in Regulation FD were adopted over 20 years ago.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gerding-cybersecurity-incidents-06202024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, public companies and their attorneys should be well-versed in navigating those rules, and, if the scope and requirements of those rules are heeded, they should not pose an undue impediment to the mutually beneficial sharing of information regarding material cybersecurity incidents.</p>

<title>US Treasury Releases Report On Macroeconomic And Foreign Exchange Policies Of Major Trading Partners Of The United States</title>

<div> Treasury Report, Major Trading Partners, Currency Manipulation, Biden Administration, Monitoring List <br />
Summary: The U.S. Treasury's report found no currency manipulation but identified seven economies for close monitoring, including China for lack of transparency. <br /> <div>
<p>The U.S. Department of the Treasury delivered its semiannual Report to Congress on Macroeconomic and Foreign Exchange Policies of Major Trading Partners of the United States.&nbsp; In this Report, Treasury reviewed and assessed the policies of major U.S. trading partners, comprising about 78 percent of U.S. foreign trade in goods and services, during the four quarters through December 2023.</p>
<p>In accordance with the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, the Report analyzed the practices of the United States&rsquo; major trading partners and concludes that no major U.S. trading partner manipulated the rate of exchange between its currency and the U.S. dollar for purposes of preventing effective balance of payments adjustments or gaining unfair competitive advantage in international trade during the four quarters through December 2023.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this Report, Treasury found that no major trading partner met all three criteria for enhanced analysis under the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 during the four quarters ending December 2023.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Biden Administration strongly opposes attempts by the United States&rsquo; trading partners to artificially manipulate currency values to gain unfair advantage over American workers.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Treasury continues to promote policies that support stronger and more balanced global growth that benefits American workers, including through close engagement with major trading partners on currency-related issues,&rdquo; Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen said today.</p>
<p>Seven economies are on Treasury&rsquo;s &ldquo;Monitoring List&rdquo; of major trading partners that merit close attention to their currency practices and macroeconomic policies:&nbsp;China, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, Vietnam, and Germany.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Report also reiterated Treasury&rsquo;s call for increased transparency from China.&nbsp; China&rsquo;s failure to publish foreign exchange intervention and broader lack of transparency around key features of its exchange rate policy make China an outlier among major economies and warrant Treasury&rsquo;s close monitoring.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s Report is submitted to Congress pursuant to Section 3005 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, 22 U.S.C. &sect; 5305, and Section 701 of the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015, 19 U.S.C. &sect; 4421.&nbsp;</p>

<div> survey, credit, financing, derivatives, dealers
Summary: The SCOOS is a quarterly survey on credit availability and terms in securities financing and OTC derivatives markets, generally completed by dealer firms. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>The Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms (SCOOS) is a quarterly survey providing information about the availability and terms of credit in securities financing and over-the counter (OTC) derivatives markets. The SCOOS is modeled after the long-established Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices, which provides qualitative information about changes in supply and demand for loans to households and businesses at commercial banks. The SCOOS collects qualitative information on credit terms and conditions in securities financing and OTC derivatives markets, which are important conduits for leverage in the financial system. The survey panel for the SCOOS began by including 20 dealers and over time has been expanded. These firms account for almost all of the dealer activity in dollar-denominated securities financing and OTC derivatives markets. The survey is directed to senior credit officers responsible for maintaining a consolidated perspective on the management of credit risks. The HTML links below include the full report; the PDF links include the summary only.</p>

<title>Canadian Securities Regulators Announce Multilateral Initiative To Support Capital-Raising By Extending The Role Of Exempt Market Dealers</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Securities regulators, Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Alberta<br />
Exempt market dealers, prospectus offerings, capital-raising, Canadian small businesses, securities regulations<br /><br />Summary:<br />The Ontario Securities Commission and other regulators are allowing exempt market dealers to participate in prospectus offerings to support capital-raising for small businesses. <div>
<p>The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC), the Autorit&eacute; des march&eacute;s financiers (AMF), the B.C. Securities Commission (BCSC), Financial and Consumer Affairs Authority of Saskatchewan (FCAA), the Alberta Securities Commission (ASC) and the Nova Scotia Securities Commission (NSSC) today announced an initiative intended to support capital-raising by early-stage businesses by allowing exempt market dealers (EMDs) to participate as selling group members in prospectus offerings.</p>
<p>EMDs play an important role in assisting start-ups and small- to medium-sized businesses raise capital by distributing those businesses&rsquo; securities under prospectus requirement exemptions. However, as the businesses grow and seek financing through prospectus offerings, EMDs are unable to participate in those prospectus offerings due to restrictions on their permitted activities.</p>
<p>The time-limited exemption announced today enables EMDs to maintain their relationships with those issuers and opens more capital-raising opportunities for Canadian small businesses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fostering the right conditions to enable businesses to thrive is crucial to our collective economic success. The measures announced today show how securities regulators are supporting the growth and prosperity of our capital markets,&rdquo; said Grant Vingoe, CEO of the OSC.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are pleased that Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Alberta and Nova Scotia are working together to put these measures in place and are finding ways to harmonize regulation in support of Canadian businesses,&rdquo; said Stan Magidson, CSA Chair and Chair and CEO of the ASC.</p>
<p>Enabling EMDs to participate as selling group members provides another route for raising capital for growing businesses within these provinces. Investment dealers will remain involved in these offerings, including by acting as underwriter and signing the underwriter certificate to the prospectus.</p>
<p>The measures announced today follow work carried out by the OSC in response to the Ontario Capital Markets Modernization Taskforce 2021 report, as well as work undertaken by the other jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The securities regulatory authority in New Brunswick anticipates publishing a similar local blanket order in the upcoming weeks.</p>
<p>The CSA, the council of securities regulators of Canada&rsquo;s provinces and territories, coordinates and harmonizes regulation for the Canadian capital markets.</p>

<title>The EBA Publishes Final Standards For Assessing The Materiality Of Extensions And Changes To New Market Risk Internal Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published its final draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) on the conditions for assessing the materiality of model extensions and changes, as well as changes to the subset of modellable risk factors, applicable under the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB) rules. With the submission of these final draft RTS to the European Commission, the EBA completes its</span>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/10180/2844544/ab272ad0-f256-4d70-9563-376e1d772feb/EBA%20roadmap%20for%20the%20new%20market%20and%20counterparty%20credit%20risk%20approaches.pdf" title="EBA roadmap for the new market and counterparty credit risk approaches.pdf"><span>roadmap on market and counterparty credit risk approaches</span></a><span>&nbsp;published on 27 June 2019.</span></p>
<p>In line with the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR), the final draft RTS differentiate between material extensions and changes under the internal models approach (IMA), to be approved by competent authorities (CA), and non-material extensions and changes, to be notified to CAs four weeks in advance. This last category is further divided into two sub-categories: extensions and changes notified with additional information, and extensions and changes with basic information.</p>
<p>For the categorisation of extensions and changes to the relevant categories and sub-categories, the final draft RTS set out a combination of qualitative and quantitative conditions. In particular, the quantitative conditions aim at assessing the effect of the extension or change on the IMA own funds requirements and on the relevant components of the FRTB IMA (Expected Shortfall, Stress Scenario Risk Measure and Default Risk Charge), before and after the planned extension or change. The final draft RTS also include guiding principles that institutions should follow in the categorisation process, provisions on the implementation of extensions and changes and documentation requirements.</p>
<h4>Legal basis and background</h4>
<p>These draft RTS have been developed according to Article 325az(8)(a) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (Capital Requirements Regulation - CRR), which mandates the EBA to specify the conditions for assessing the materiality of extensions and changes to the use of alternative internal models and changes to the subset of the modellable risk factors.</p>
<p>The CRR allows institutions to calculate their own funds requirements for market risk using the alternative IMA, provided that permission from CAs is granted. According to the CRR, material changes to the use of the IMA, the extension of the use of the IMA and material changes to the institution's choice of the subset of the modellable risk factors require separate permission from competent authorities. All other extensions and changes to the use of the IMA require notification to the competent authorities.</p>

<br />
FI orders Swedish banks to rectify deficiencies in payments infrastructure by December 2026, contacting authorities in Denmark and Finland. Limitations in Bank Girot system need to be resolved.
<br /><br />Summary: FI is ordering Swedish banks to rectify payment infrastructure deficiencies and has informed authorities in Denmark and Finland about the limitations in the Bank Girot system. <div>
<p><span>FI is ordering Handelsbanken, SEB and Swedbank to rectify deficiencies in the payments infrastructure no later than December 2026. FI has also contacted the supervisory authorities in Denmark and Finland and informed them of the need to take corresponding measures for Danske Bank and Nordea.</span></p>
<div class="editor-content">
<p>All banks and payment services providers that perform electronic transfers within the EU must ensure that certain information about the payer and the payee is included with the transfers. Bank Girot is not specifically included in these requirements but plays a central role in the Swedish payment chain and is the only operations that has authorisation to conduct clearing of payments. This means that a large portion of the payments made within the country, for example invoices, salary deposits, and transfers between bank accounts, are compiled and controlled within the Bank Girot system.</p>
<p>However, the Bank Girot system has some limitations that entail that participating banks cannot meet the requirements in the anti-money laundering regulations on the transfer of information. Participants in the Bank Girot system are thus lacking the conditions to fully comply with the anti-money laundering regulations. Therefore, Bank Girot's Swedish owner banks, Handelsbanken, SEB and Swedbank, are ordered to take the measures necessary to ensure that the statutory information is included with transfers in Sweden.</p>
<p>"We have been monitoring for a long time how the owner banks are working on this matter and how they are planning to rectify the problem. We are now choosing to proceed with a strict time frame. We expect these deficiencies to be resolved," says FI Executive Director Malin Alpen.</p>
<p>FI would like to emphasise that the limitations in the Bank Girot system affect all Bank Girot and Data Clearing participants. However, FI is targeting the Bank Girot owners since they have the opportunity in practice to ensure that the deficiencies are rectified.</p>
<p>In terms of the foreign owner banks Danske Bank and Nordea, FI does not have the same legal basis for intervention. However, FI has contacted the relevant supervisory authorities in Denmark and Finland and informed them about the deficiencies in Bank Girot, and FI will follow up on this matter in the future.</p>

<title>“Shortening The Settlement Cycle: Benefitting Everyday Investors” Prepared Remarks Before The Accelerated Settlement In The U.K. Conference, SEC Chair Gary Gensler, Washington D.C., June 20, 2024</title>

<div> Securities and Exchange Commission, T+1, settlement cycle, market structure, clearinghouse
<br />
Summary: Shortening the settlement cycle to T+1 benefits investors, reduces risk, requires global coordination, may necessitate business model shifts, and could prompt further discussions in other markets. <div>
<p>Good afternoon. Thank you, Charlie, for the kind introduction. As is customary, I&rsquo;d like to note that my views are my own as Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and I am not speaking on behalf of my fellow Commissioners or the staff.</p>
<p>Last month, the U.S. smoothly shortened the settlement cycle for equities, corporate bonds, and municipal securities to one day after the transaction date (T+1). This step better unifies the U.S. market structure, where Treasuries, options, and mutual funds already largely settle in one day.</p>
<p>For everyday investors, this means you now can sell your stock on a Monday and get your cash on a Tuesday. This makes a real difference&mdash;you don&rsquo;t have to wait until Wednesday. With 58 percent of American households holding stocks,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-accelerated-settlement-uk-conference-062024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;this is significant. This step also helped better unify the U.S. market structure, where Treasuries, options, and mutual funds already largely settle in one day.</p>
<p>Canada, Mexico, Argentina, and Jamaica successfully joined us in the move.</p>
<h3>Importance of Shortening the Cycle</h3>
<p>Time is money. Time is risk.</p>
<p>Thus, shortening the market plumbing of clearance and settlement saves money. It lowers risk. It increases efficiency, boosts liquidity, and promotes resiliency of the markets.</p>
<p>As I said, for everyday investors who sell their stock on a Monday, they will get their money on Tuesday.</p>
<p>For institutional investors, it will free up liquidity that might otherwise be trapped for two days.</p>
<p>Cutting the clearance and settlement cycle in half also reduces the amount of margin, or collateral, that must be placed with the clearinghouse. The way the math works it&rsquo;s likely to average 29 percent savings over time. First indications reported by the clearinghouse show a savings of 25 percent, or more than $3 billion, resulting from the move to T+1.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-accelerated-settlement-uk-conference-062024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Shortening the matching parts of clearing (the time to ensure that all parties agree to the trade details) also lowers operational as well as counterparty risk. The sooner the parties have allocated, confirmed, and affirmed the trade information for their transaction, the lower the likelihood of a settlement failing since the parties have more time to identify and resolve any potential errors. The Bank of International Settlements (BIS) first recommended T+0 affirmations 22 years ago.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-accelerated-settlement-uk-conference-062024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;A decade later, CPMI-IOSCO reaffirmed this in their&nbsp;<em>Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures</em>.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-accelerated-settlement-uk-conference-062024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p>Shortening the cycle also means reducing the credit, market, and liquidity risks of the clearinghouse.</p>
<p>Lowering risks for market participants and clearinghouses, alike, reduces the likelihood that any one entity&rsquo;s failure spreads risk to the financial system, making the system safer for everyone.</p>
<h3>U.S. Memorial Day Transition</h3>
<p>Many Americans were celebrating the unofficial start of summer over Memorial Day weekend as the U.K. was enjoying a spring bank holiday. Another important thing was happening. We were transitioning to T+1. Further, trades relating to initial public offerings were shortened from T+4 to T+2.</p>
<p>Following that weekend, brokers also were required to have policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure completion of allocations, confirmations, and affirmations as soon as technologically practical. This is based on the new SEC rule<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-accelerated-settlement-uk-conference-062024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;and in line with what BIS first recommended 22 years ago.</p>
<p>In addition, registered advisers are required to keep certain time-stamped records of allocations sent or received, confirmations received, and affirmations sent or received.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clearing agencies also are required to have policies and procedures to facilitate the straight-through processing of securities transactions, automating the entire trade process from execution to clearing and settling.</p>
<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
<p>As you consider your own transition to T+1 in the U.K., I want to share some key takeaways from our experience.</p>
<p><em>It&rsquo;s a Team Sport</em></p>
<p>First, transitioning to T+1 is a team sport. Thousands of market participants&mdash;from the clearinghouse, depositories, custodian banks, broker dealers, investment advisers, self-regulatory organizations, stock exchanges, service providers, and industry groups&mdash;worked, along with SEC staff, to make the transition happen smoothly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not only a team sport, it&rsquo;s a global sport. By the way, speaking of global sports, good luck to England today in the Eurocup match.</p>
<p>The SEC staff engaged with market participants and regulatory counterparts around the world.</p>
<p>I want to thank everyone who had a role in making this smooth transition possible. Given the experience of moving from T+3 to T+2, we anticipated fail rates might go up following the transition to T+1. The data shows, though, that fail rates stayed relatively flat. For instance, the first day of T+1 settlement the fail rates went down modestly from May&rsquo;s average.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-accelerated-settlement-uk-conference-062024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p><em>Importance of T+0 Allocations, Confirmations, and Affirmations</em></p>
<p>Second, I&rsquo;d note how important it was that we included that allocations, confirmations, and affirmations must be completed as soon as technologically practicable, but at least on T+0. When we proposed the rule in February 2022, only 68 percent of transactions were being affirmed &nbsp;on trade date.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-accelerated-settlement-uk-conference-062024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;By January 2024, this had increased slightly to 73 percent.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-accelerated-settlement-uk-conference-062024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;The clearinghouse publicly set a goal as part of the transition to move that up to at least 90 percent.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-accelerated-settlement-uk-conference-062024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;Given our rule as well as market participants&rsquo; efforts, by May 29, the day after the transition, the T+0 affirmation rate was up to approximately 95 percent at 9 p.m. ET, which is Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation&rsquo;s (DTCC&rsquo;s) new deadline.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-accelerated-settlement-uk-conference-062024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p><em>Importance of Setting a Firm Implementation Date</em></p>
<p>Third, I&rsquo;d note how important it is just to set a date and, if possible, stick to it. It helps to organize everybody&rsquo;s planning and implementation. No doubt, there will be some market participants who raise concerns with meeting whatever date you select. We benefited, though, from having an announced implementation date as well as a well-thought-out timeline and schedule.</p>
<p>The process from final rule adoption<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-accelerated-settlement-uk-conference-062024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;to smooth implementation of T+1 in the U.S. was 15 months. The process from proposing the rule in February 2022 to implementation was 27 months. The transition happened smoothly within this time based upon all the efforts of market participants, the clearinghouse, and fellow regulators. In Canada it was 17 months from proposal to implementation.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-accelerated-settlement-uk-conference-062024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;In Mexico, it was just 10 months from when it was proposed in July 2023.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-accelerated-settlement-uk-conference-062024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>&nbsp;Argentina and Jamaica adopted their plans to transition but two weeks and one week respectively before implementation.</p>
<p>In the U.K., you will have to decide what policy and timing is right for you. I don&rsquo;t suspect you will follow the timing of Argentina or Jamaica. I&rsquo;d note, though, that if one looks at the 27 months it took the U.S. from proposal to implementation, your implementation might be June 2026. That&rsquo;s 27 months from when you finalized your March 2024 &ldquo;Accelerated Settlement Taskforce Report.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-accelerated-settlement-uk-conference-062024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></p>
<p><em>Some Business Models May Need to Shift</em></p>
<p>Fourth, though the transition to T+1 overall brings benefits to investors and the markets, it does come with transition costs as well as the need for various market participants to change business models.</p>
<p>For instance, international investors may need to shift their operations to cover their foreign currency risks on T+0 rather than possibly waiting for T+1. We saw a number of international investors actually moving some of their staff to the U.S. to accommodate the shift. We also found that time zones do matter, though you have the advantage that the U.S. already has gone to T+1.</p>
<p>Further, as it relates to mutual funds, including exchange-traded funds (ETFs), some market participants raised concerns about the potential mismatch between the timing of the redemption of such funds versus the settlement cycle of the underlying portfolio.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d note it&rsquo;s not the first time we&rsquo;ve had mismatches between the settlement cycle for funds and their underlying portfolios. In the United States, we&rsquo;ve long had transactions in mutual funds generally settle in one day. In the U.K., you&rsquo;ve also lived with such mismatches as the U.K. Gilt markets settle in one day.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-accelerated-settlement-uk-conference-062024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>&nbsp;Mutual funds and ETFs have used a variety of tools to address settlement time mismatches between fund shares and portfolio investments, including cash reserves, lines of credit, and interfund lending facilities.</p>
<p>A nice benefit of going to T+1 is in the area of corporate actions, in that ex-dividend dates and record dates now are aligned on the same day.</p>
<p><em>We Already Live in a World Where Settlement Cycles Are Not Aligned</em></p>
<p>Lastly, you undoubtedly will hear from market participants about settlement cycles not being aligned with other jurisdictions. The history of settlement cycles shows, however, that we have long experience with differences in settlement cycles both within jurisdictions as well as across jurisdictions. This history shows that market participants have found ways to handle this. For any market that shortens the settlement cycle, though, the benefits are real. Time is money, time is risk.</p>
<p>A bit of history might surprise some in the audience, but the U.S. stock market settled at T+1 well into the 1920s. It was only with increasing volumes that the market plumbing was lengthened to a business week after a transaction (T+5). We first shortened the cycle to T+3 in 1995,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-accelerated-settlement-uk-conference-062024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>&nbsp;followed by shortening it to T+2 in 2017.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-accelerated-settlement-uk-conference-062024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a></p>
<p>Ten years ago, you shortened to T+2 three years prior to us. In 2014, the European Commission required equity markets in 29 member countries (including the U.K. pre-Brexit) to move to T+2 settlement, joining Germany, Bulgaria, and Slovenia, which were already settling T+2.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-accelerated-settlement-uk-conference-062024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a></p>
<p>Israel moved to T+1 in 2012 for Tel Aviv Exchange&rsquo;s clearinghouse member brokers&rsquo; equity trades. Broker-to-broker trades in corporate and government bonds also settle T+1.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-accelerated-settlement-uk-conference-062024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a>&nbsp;India completed moving its equity markets to T+1 in January 2023.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-accelerated-settlement-uk-conference-062024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a>&nbsp;Its sovereign debt has been T+1 since 2017.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-accelerated-settlement-uk-conference-062024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a>&nbsp;In Japan, equities settle at T+2,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-accelerated-settlement-uk-conference-062024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a>&nbsp;while government bonds settle at T+1.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-accelerated-settlement-uk-conference-062024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a>&nbsp;China actually has moved to same-day securities delivery (within four hours after market close) for its A-shares securities,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-accelerated-settlement-uk-conference-062024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a>&nbsp;though their related payments move in the banking system the next morning. In Hong Kong, settlement is T+2.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-accelerated-settlement-uk-conference-062024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a></p>
<h3>Looking Forward</h3>
<p>Looking forward, I want to raise three areas for further policy discussions.</p>
<p>First, as I look forward, I want to mention the Commission&rsquo;s rules to facilitate additional central clearing for the U.S. Treasury market, which will be phased in over two years.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-accelerated-settlement-uk-conference-062024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a>&nbsp;The final rules make changes to enhance customer clearing and broaden the scope of which transactions clearinghouse members must clear. These rules will help to make the Treasury market more efficient, competitive, and resilient.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In just nine months, in March 2025, the separation of house and customer margin must be completed, ensuring that clearinghouses facilitate indirect participants as well. Starting at the end of 2025, certain cash transactions will have to be cleared. Starting in June 2026, certain repurchase agreement (repo) and reverse repo transactions must be cleared.</p>
<p>Second, looking forward, I think it&rsquo;s appropriate for regulators and market participants around the globe to start to consider the possibility of shortening the settlement cycle for currency trading. Currency markets worldwide currently settle T+2. Particularly if Europe and the U.K. were to join the major markets of North America and Asia in moving to T+1, we should start to engage now in conversations, along with central banks, about the possibility of shortening the currency trading settlement cycle.</p>
<p>Third, some markets already have moved to settlement cycles on the day of the transaction. This includes parts of U.S. money markets, parts of the Chinese equity markets, and most recently India has proposed doing so in some equity markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-accelerated-settlement-uk-conference-062024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a>&nbsp;Thus, looking forward, it raises the question as to whether further shortening beyond T+1 may be appropriate.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Let me conclude by once again saying why I think shortening the settlement cycle is so important. It helps everyday investors get their money sooner when they sell a security. It helps clearinghouse members lower their margin and free up liquidity. It helps the clearinghouse lower risk. Though it might just seem like the plumbing, it really does help the financial system and everyone who participates in it.</p>
<p>It took a team effort for a smooth transition in the U.S. as well as for our neighbors in the Americas. We look forward to continuing to work with you as you move toward giving everyday investors in the U.K. similar benefits.</p>

<title>Spectrum Markets Comment: ASX Launches First Spot Bitcoin ETF</title>

<div> ETFs, Bitcoin, Ethereum, SEC, ASX
Summary:
SEC is close to approving spot ether ETFs, ASX approved first Bitcoin spot ETF, Europe unlikely to follow due to diversification rules. Regulators must consider potential risks. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>Dr. Alpay Soyt&uuml;rk, Chief Regulatory Officer of Spectrum Markets, the pan-European trading venue, issued the following comment in response to the news that the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) has approved the listing of its first spot Bitcoin ETF.</p>
<p><i>&lsquo;&rsquo;Following the authorisation of ETFs on bitcoin, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has also given the green light for ETFs on ethereum. Actually, the SEC approved 19b-4 filings for eight spot ether ETFs, but the agency has not yet greenlighted the S-1 (registration statement) filings, which must be completed and declared effective before the spot ether ETFs can launch.</i></p>
<p><i>More clarity on the latest developments in the approval procedure has been provided by Gary Gensler, SEC chairman, during his testimony before the U.S. Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services. Pressed by questions raised by senators, Gensler stated that the final greenlight to spot ether ETFs could come as soon as this summer. However, the proceedings needed for the greenlight are duties to be managed by the issuers, not by SEC&rsquo; staff.&nbsp;</i></p>
<p><i>In the meantime, ASX (Australian Securities Exchange), which accounts for around 80% of the country&rsquo;s equities trading, has approved its first bitcoin spot ETF. This represents the third in Australia, following the two already available on rival exchange Cboe, and such a decision could influence other regulators to make similar decisions, contributing to the growth and maturation of the global cryptocurrency market.</i></p>
<p><i>Although these news testify the evolution and wider acceptance of crypto assets, it is unlikely we are going to see something similar in Europe soon. The reason lies behind the UCITS Directive, which contains diversification rules for the inclusion of indices as ETF underlyings, and virtually none of them allow for a disproportionate concentration risk on individual securities.&nbsp;</i></p>
<p><i>This also calls for a reconsideration of how the protection provided by authorization from a securities regulator should be evaluated. We do not intend to criticize the whole Bitcoin or Ethereum projects, but rather to question whether authorizing investment funds in individual securities is a sensible measure.</i></p>
<p><i>Of course, the ETFs now authorized offer the opportunity to gain exposure to bitcoin or ethereum without having to hold the crypto assets directly. But firstly, there have been alternatives in this country before, such as securitised derivatives on BTC or ETH. Secondly, the ETF authorisation paves the way for large institutional institutions to become heavily involved in distribution, as the fierce fee competition among large US asset managers has already shown in the recent past. If this results in private investors with a rather conservative risk profile and investment objectives that do not correspond to this type of security becoming more involved and being unable to adequately compensate for strong downturns, securities regulators will be caught in the crossfire.&nbsp;&lsquo;&rsquo;</i></p>

<div> Nasdaq, Cinclus Pharma, IPO, eGERD, pharmaceutical<br />
Summary:<br />
Nasdaq announces trading of Cinclus Pharma on Stockholm market. Cinclus develops drug for eGERD, optimistic about future as listed company. <div>
<p>Nasda<span><span>q (Nasdaq: NDAQ) announces that trading in the shares of Cinclus Pharma Holding AB (ticker name: CINPHA) will commence today on the Nasdaq Stockholm Main Market. Cinclus Pharma is a Mid Cap company within the Health Care sector. Cinclus Pharma is the 15<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;</span></span>company to be admitted to trading on Nasdaq&rsquo;s Nordic and Baltic markets* in 2024.</p>
<p>Cinclus Pharma is a clinical stage pharmaceutical company focused on the development of the drug candidate linaprazan glurate, a proprietary &ldquo;prodrug&rdquo; of the molecule linaprazan, originally developed by AstraZeneca. Linaprazan glurate represents a new and innovative mode of action for the treatment of erosive gastroesophageal reflux disease (eGERD) where there is currently a lack of sufficiently effective treatment options.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are very excited about this important step in Cinclus Pharma&rsquo;s development. By becoming the product that can offer 24-hour acid control and healing for the most severely ill patients with eGERD, we have the potential to drive a paradigm shift in the treatment of gastric acid-related diseases. The listing on Nasdaq Stockholm is a logical and important step that enables continued development of linaprazan glurate. We have received very positive feedback from investors, making us feel incredibly excited about our future as a listed company,&rdquo; said Christer Ahlberg, CEO of Cinclus Pharma.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adam Kosty&aacute;l, President of Nasdaq Stockholm, said &ldquo;We warmly congratulate Cinclus Pharma on their successfully completed IPO. It is truly an honor to welcome them as they embody the pioneering spirit and innovation that define the Health Care sector companies that choose to partner with Nasdaq. We look forward to supporting them in their journey as a publicly traded company.&rdquo;</p>

<div> consultation, Power Purchase Agreement, renewable energy, ACER, stakeholders
Summary:<br />ACER seeks input on PPA templates in the EU energy market. PPAs are contracts between energy producers and buyers supporting renewable energy adoption. If needed, ACER will develop PPA templates. <div>
<p>Today, ACER opens a public consultation (running from 20 June until 18 July 2024, 17:00 CET) to gather stakeholders&rsquo; views on the benefits and drawbacks of introducing voluntary templates for Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) contracts in the EU energy market.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are Power Purchase Agreements?</span></p>
<p>Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) are contractual arrangements between electricity producers (frequently renewable energy generators) and buyers. By providing renewable electricity at mutually agreed rates, these contracts foster stability for both parties and promote the adoption of renewable energy sources (RES).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why the need for a consultation?</span></p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtVU1QIA1VSW0wIAAZSHVZdAAAdU1tUBRoBVQUEBFJWUwEFV1QdVlFaUQkHV1EdBgsMVB0GAFJUGldRAAIZUAIEDgAGVQRVBVsDRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" target="_blank">EU Electricity Market Design Reform</a>&nbsp;mandates ACER to assess the need for PPAs templates by taking into account the requirements of the different counterparties. For this reason, ACER is running a public consultation to gather inputs from stakeholders and ensure an informed and inclusive decision-making process.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the next steps?</span></p>
<p>ACER will consider the feedback received in the consultation and the conclusions reached by the&nbsp;<a href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsBAlJQWQJXW0wLBwFSHVYODA4dUwkHVBpQAAMAUAIEVFMFUggdVlFaUQkHV1EdBgsMVB0GAFJUGldRAAIZUAIEDgAGVQRVBVsDRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" target="_blank">consultative expert group</a>&nbsp;established in May 2024.</p>
<p>If the assessment (expected in Autumn 2024) highlights the need to develop templates for PPA contracts, ACER, together with all Nominated Electricity Market Operators (NEMOs), will start the process in Winter 2024.</p>

Summary:<br />
Two suspects arrested for running illegal cryptoasset exchange, FCA and police involved, over £1 billion in unregistered cryptoassets, suspects interviewed and released on bail, ongoing investigation.<br /> <div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA, working with the Metropolitan Police Service, has conducted an operation to arrest 2 individuals, aged 38 and 44, suspected of running an illegal cryptoasset exchange.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p><span>More than &pound;1 billion of unregistered cryptoassets are believed to have been bought and sold through this business.</span></p>
<p><span>The FCA inspected the offices associated with the suspects and the police seized several digital devices during searches of 2 residential London properties.</span></p>
<p><span>Both suspects were interviewed under caution by the FCA and released on bail. The FCA&rsquo;s investigation into the case is ongoing.</span></p>
<p><span>Cryptoasset exchange providers must be registered with the FCA and comply with the UK money laundering regulations in order to operate legally in the UK.</span></p>
<p><span>Therese Chambers, Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight at the FCA, said:</span></p>
<p><span>'The FCA has an important role to play in keeping dirty money out of the UK financial system. These arrests show we will do everything in our power to stop crypto firms from operating illegally in the UK.'</span></p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<ol>
<li>Since 10 January 2021, cryptoasset businesses providing certain cryptoasset services in the UK must be registered with the FCA under the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017 (MLRs).</li>
<li>Cryptoasset businesses need to be registered with the FCA under the MLRs, and comply with the requirements of the regulations, if they intend to provide certain cryptoasset services by way of business, and in the UK.</li>
<li>Under the MLRs the FCA can impose directions on cryptoasset businesses which can prohibit them from operating. It is a criminal offence to breach a direction imposed under the MLRs.</li>
<li>The FCA regularly warns consumers that cryptoassets are unregulated and high-risk, which means people are very unlikely to have any protection if things go wrong.</li>
<li>The FCA publishes a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/consumers/warning-list-unauthorised-firms" title="FCA Warning List of unauthorised firms">list of businesses</a>&nbsp;that it suspects are operating without our registration.</li>
<li>The FCA cannot comment further at this time but will make further announcements when appropriate.</li>

<div> Experiment, FCA, trading apps, digital engagement practices, push notifications<br />
<br />Summary: FCA's experiment found that digital engagement practices in trading apps increase trading frequency and risk-taking. Push notifications and prize draws had the largest impact. It also found that the impact is larger on some subgroups, including those with low financial literacy, women, and younger participants. The FCA continues to educate consumers and has warned trading apps to review game-like design features. <div>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>In an online experiment with over 9,000 consumers, the FCA found that digital engagement practices (DEPs) used by trading apps, such as push notifications and prize draws, can increase trading frequency and risk taking.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>In an FCA first, the regulator built an experimental trading app platform to test the effect of different DEPs on trading behaviour. It also found evidence that DEPs can have a larger impact on some subgroups, including those with low financial literacy, women and younger participants (18-34).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under the FCA&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/consumer-duty" title="Consumer Duty">Consumer Duty</a>, trading apps must ensure services are designed and tested so they meet consumers' needs and enable them to make effective, timely and properly informed investment decisions, including for those with characteristics of vulnerability.</p>
<p>The FCA warned stock trading apps to review game-like design features in 2022 ahead of the Consumer Duty&rsquo;s implementation. &nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Sheldon Mills, Executive Director of Consumers and Competition at the FCA, said</span>:</p>
<p>'Trading apps have the potential to transform retail investments, but some in-app features might be pushing consumers towards more frequent or riskier trading, which isn&rsquo;t right for everyone.</p>
<p>'With usage and popularity of trading apps growing, we&rsquo;ll be keeping them under review to make sure customers can make investment decisions that suit their needs.'</p>
<p>The FCA continues to educate consumers about making better investment decisions and understanding the opportunities and risks, through its InvestSmart campaign. It has also brought charges against &lsquo;finfluencers&rsquo; promoting financial products on social media.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/research-notes/research-note-digital-engagement-practices-trading-apps-experiment" title="Research Note: Digital engagement practices: a trading apps experiment ">FCA&rsquo;s research on digital engagement practices</a>.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Key findings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Push notifications and points &amp; prize draw increased the number of trades made, by 11% and 12% respectively.</li>
<li>Push notifications and points &amp; prize draw increased the proportion of trades that were in risky investments by 8% and 6% respectively.</li>
<li>Those with low financial literacy increased their trading by more than those with high financial literacy in the presence of flashing prices and trader leaderboards.</li>
<li>Women increased their trading frequency by more than men when push notifications and points &amp; prize draw were introduced.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Younger participants (18-34) increased their end-of-trading portfolio riskiness by more than older participants (35+) across all DEPs (except flashing prices). &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the research, low financial literacy was defined as giving 1 or fewer correct answers in response to the '<a class="ext" href="https://gflec.org/education/questions-that-indicate-financial-literacy/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Big Three' financial literacy<span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>, which ask about the effect of compound interest and inflation as well as the importance of investment diversification. &nbsp;</li>

We reported at that time that in the first four months of 2021, 1.15 million accounts were opened across four trading app firms.</li>
<li>In the last three years, at just four trading app firms, more than 2.47 million accounts have been created across the UK. This is based on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/markets/regulation-markets-financial-instruments" title="Regulation of markets in financial instruments ">MiFID</a>&nbsp;reporting data.

<title>GDF, ANNA, And DTI Foundation Announce Partnership To Support The Development Of Standards And Best Practices In The Digital Asset Industry</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> partnership, global members association, digital assets, standardization, transparency
Summary:<br />Global Digital Finance (GDF) partners with ANNA and DTI Foundation to promote standardization and transparency in the digital asset sector. This partnership supports the adoption of market standards and identification data, integrating digital assets into traditional finance systems. <div>
<p><span>Global Digital Finance (GDF), the global members association and platform for open innovation in digital assets in financial services, announces a partnership with&nbsp;the Association of National Numbering Agencies (ANNA), a global member association seeking to foster standardization within the financial industry, and the Digital Token Identifier (DTI) Foundation whose combined mandate is to increase transparency in the digital asset space by creating a core reference data set based on open data principles and made available as a public good.&nbsp;</span></p>
<div class="dombanner"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>As the digital asset sector grows, it is crucial that standardized identification data is&nbsp;available that seamlessly blends digital asset standards with conventional financial&nbsp;systems.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Partnering with ANNA and DTIF is true to GDF&rsquo;s mission of promoting and underpinning the greater adoption of market standards for the use of crypto and digital assets, and GDF looks forward to continued engagement with both organizations to better advocate and accelerate the adoption of best practices for digital assets.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Background</strong>:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In 2021, a joint ANNA-DTIF Task Force was established to ensure a complementary relationship between the International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) and Digital Token Identifier (DTI) ISO standards. This alliance supports a growing digital asset sector with complementary identifiers that foster market transparency and interoperability. In 2023, the Task Force has progressed to introduce new innovative ISINs assigned by ANNA which are recognized by a new XT ISIN prefix. These are based on DTIs for digital assets that are not themselves financial instruments.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The ISO DTI standard for digital token identification continues to be adopted by crypto&nbsp;and digital asset market infrastructure and service providers and regulators. The&nbsp;European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) is anticipated to embed DTIs as the&nbsp;crypto-asset identifier under MiCA transparency reporting, order book, offering and&nbsp;record-keeping requirements. The ISO ISIN standard is already required by ESMA for&nbsp;reporting for MiFID II regulated financial instruments which would include tokenized&nbsp;securities.</span></p>
<p><span>As the world&rsquo;s largest open innovation platform supporting the development of best practices for the digital asset industry, GDF is delighted to strategically partner with ANNA and DTI Foundation to help drive awareness and adoption of market standards that help build stronger,&nbsp;</span><span>transparent, and more efficient bridges between traditional finance and the digital asset ecosystem.</span></p>
<p><span>Madeleine Boys, GDF Head of Programmes and Innovation says, &ldquo;Standards are key to unlocking efficiencies and driving transparency in financial markets.&nbsp;For regulators, global identification standards help bring consistency and transparency into new DLT markets. For market participants, this standard supports better effective risk management and has been commended by industry as a strong foundation for better interlinking digital finance and traditional finance.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>Commenting on the partnership, Stephan Dreyer, Managing Director at ANNA says, &ldquo;Since launch last year, the ANNA/DTI Foundation partnership has significantly progressed the introduction of new International Identification Securities Numbers (ISIN) to identify crypto assets to support industry transparency and interoperability. We are now delighted to be working with Global Digital Finance (GDF) to facilitate greater integration within wider industry communities."</span></p>
<p><span>Denis Dounaev, DTIF Product Owner adds, &ldquo;This partnership marks a significant milestone in our mission to increase transparency and standardization within the digital asset space. By aligning our efforts with ANNA and GDF, we are ensuring that digital assets are seamlessly integrated into the traditional financial system while also fostering greater trust and adoption of digital assets globally.&rdquo;</span></p>

<div> Gender Equality, Worldline, UK, Workplace, Business Strategy
<br />
Worldline IT Services UK listed in The Times Top 50 Employers for Gender Equality 2024, commitment to addressing gender inequalities, inclusive workplace culture.
<br /><br />Summary:
Worldline IT Services UK listed in The Times Top 50 Employers for Gender Equality 2024. Commitment to inclusive workplace culture, addressing gender inequalities. <div>
<p><span>Worldline [Euronext: WLN], a global leader in payment services, announces that its UK entity, Worldline IT Services UK Limited has been listed as one of The Times Top 50 Employers for Gender Equality 2024, for its commitment to addressing gender inequalities in the workplace.</span></p>
<p>The Times Top 50 Employers for Gender Equality is the UK&rsquo;s most highly profiled and well-established list of employers taking action and making gender equality part of their business strategy at all levels. While progress has been made to reduce inequalities in the workplace, gender inequalities are still prevalent in UK workplaces today, especially in times of economic disruption.</p>
<p>Business in the Community (BITC) has been running The Times Top 50 for 14 years, as part of its Gender Equality work, which focuses on equality for all genders and those who do not identify as a gender. The organisations featured in the list have taken a proactive approach to stamp out inequalities in their workplaces by creating action plans to address disparities ranging from pay to progression.</p>
<p>Applicants were assessed on the work they do to remove gender inequalities in the workplace, from flexible working to family friendly policies to pay, reward, and progression at work.</p>
<p>This is the third year in a row that Worldline UK has achieved this prestigious accolade.</p>
<p>Worldline is committed to making sure every colleague feels included and accepted. In 2020, Worldline IT Services UK Limited established its thriving Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Networks, each with Executive Sponsors. At Group level, Worldline UNITE, run by volunteers, is also open to all. UNITE aims to contribute to creating an inclusive culture, raising issues and sharing ideas. It &nbsp;provides information about Worldline&rsquo;s strategy, policy and developments. Employees across the UK have embraced these networks, with numerous events and webinars organised over the last four years to give people opportunities to learn more, engage and connect.</p>
<p>Worldline&rsquo;s priority is to ensure that employees feel empowered and are encouraged to perform at their best in a diverse, inclusive and inspiring workplace. Worldline has developed a comprehensive action plan to anchor fairness and transparency in its employees&rsquo; journey to better attract, retain, empower and develop women in the company, supported by its Trust 2025 CSR program.</p>
<blockquote><span>Johnny Astbury, CEO of Worldline IT Services UK Limited</span>&nbsp;said: &ldquo;<i>We&rsquo;re really humbled to receive a place on The Times Top 50 Employers for Gender Equality for the third year running. At the heart of our strategy we focus on our people and our planet. Embracing uniqueness and valuing all genders is a way of being, woven into everything we do. This public recognition highlights our pursuit of creating an environment in the workplace that truly is one of inclusion and diversity</i>.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;</blockquote>
<blockquote><span>Charlotte Woodworth, Gender Equality Director at Business in the Community,&nbsp;</span>said: &ldquo;<i>Being named as a Times Top 50 employer for gender equality demonstrates Worldline&rsquo;s commitment to driving a more equitable, inclusive world. But while the employers who made the list are doing great work prioritising gender equality, there is still more work to do. From addressing pay disparities to better supporting those with caring responsibilities, many employees, women among them, still face barriers to finding employment and progressing in their careers. It is every employer&rsquo;s responsibility to play their part in reducing and removing gender inequalities from the workplace, and research shows this isn&rsquo;t just the right thing to do, it also makes business sense.</i>&rdquo;</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The continuation of the Helvetia Pilot marks a significant milestone, paving the way for wider adoption of the tokenized ecosystem. It allows financial market participants to continue settling tokenized securities transaction on SDX in central bank money and to explore the added value of tokenization and integrated settlement.</p>
<p>"This represents a major step forward in the financial industry's digital transformation,&rdquo; said Jos Dijsselhof, CEO, SIX. &ldquo;Pioneering the use of wholesale central bank digital currency goes beyond enhancing the efficiency and security of financial transactions, it is the groundwork for the future of finance. This project underscores our commitment to innovation and cements Switzerland&rsquo;s position at the forefront of digital asset adoption in capital markets."</p>
<p>David Newns, Head of SIX Digital Exchange, added: "Robust and scalable financial market infrastructure requires that wholesale transactions be settled in central bank money, the safest form of money. To fully utilize blockchain's potential, both the tokenized investment and the settlement asset must be on the same chain. Project Helvetia III demonstrated that SDX can meet these requirements. The participation of leading financial institutions and the issuance of seven digital bonds to date, totalling more than CHF 750 million, settled in wCBDC, highlights market confidence in our digital asset infrastructure. SDX continues to advance digital financial markets, with the continued Helvetia Pilot allowing more participants to adopt digital assets with on-chain wCBDC settlement.&rdquo;</p>

<div> ETF, ASX, Bitcoin, Australia, cryptocurrency <br />
Summary:<br />ASX admits its first spot Bitcoin ETF, responding to increased demand, backed by US master fund, providing regulated access for Australian investors. <div>
<p>ASX today announces the admission of its first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), marking a significant milestone in the Australian financial market and cryptocurrency industry.</p>
<div class="dombanner"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The admission of the VanEck Bitcoin ETF (ASX:VBTC) comes as crypto assets, such as Bitcoin and Ether, increasingly move into the investment mainstream, supported by increased regulatory guidance around the product category and growing consumer demand.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Andrew Campion, GM of Investment Products &amp; Strategy</b> said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re really pleased to admit the ASX&rsquo;s first Bitcoin ETF, responding to increased customer demand for access to cryptocurrency assets, and providing access to more investment options for Australians.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At ASX, a key part of our role is to ensure that investors can have confidence in trading securities and have certainty in the structure of their holdings. To achieve this, we&rsquo;ve been working on bringing a crypto asset ETF to market for a number of years, including establishing a new category of permissible underlying assets for ETFs in August 2022 which includes Bitcoin and Ether.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;While it has been possible to trade Bitcoin via crypto exchanges, trading units with exposure to Bitcoin via an ETF on an exchange like ASX means you&rsquo;re able to buy and sell those units through a traditional brokerage account, simplifying the process and opening the opportunity to more Australians.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>VBTC will be backed by a Bitcoin holding via a US domiciled master fund, ensuring that each unit of the ETF corresponds to a specific amount of Bitcoin. This structure aims to give investors exposure to the price of Bitcoin, providing investors with a robust and transparent reflection of the crypto asset's value.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the demand for digital assets continues to grow, we are proud to offer a regulated avenue for Australian investors to access the crypto asset market,&rdquo; Mr Campion said.</p>

<title>ISDA Responds To FSB Consultation On Liquidity Preparedness For Margin And Collateral Calls</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-responds-to-fsb-consultation-on-liquidity-preparedness-for-margin-and-colla/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-responds-to-fsb-consultation-on-liquidity-preparedness-for-margin-and-colla/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>On June 18, ISDA submitted a response to the Financial Stability Board&rsquo;s (FSB)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P170424.pdf">consultation on liquidity preparedness for margin and collateral calls</a>.</p>
<p>The response notes that the recommendations are generally sensible and seek to incorporate a proportionate and risk-based approach. It also highlights a number of considerations relevant to the non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI) sector&rsquo;s liquidity preparedness for margin and collateral calls.</p>
<p>First, due to the diverse nature of the NBFI sector, and the fact that many NBFIs and other non-bank market participants are already subject to financial and/or market regulation within their home jurisdictions, excessively prescriptive regulatory recommendations could, for a number of reasons, be inappropriate for all such firms across all geographies and market sectors.</p>
<p>Second, increased transparency in central counterparty margining practices, which has been addressed as part of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d568.pdf">consultation on transparency and responsiveness of initial margin in centrally cleared markets</a>&nbsp;from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures and the International Organization of Securities Commissions, is a critically important aspect of liquidity preparedness and will help NBFIs and other market participants to better prepare for potential margin calls in centrally cleared markets.</p>
<p>Third, liquidity preparedness by NBFIs is dependent in part on banks&rsquo; balance-sheet capacity and the ability of banks to perform their intermediation function in core funding and lending markets. With that in mind, regulators should weigh how any restrictions on that capacity will affect the liquidity preparedness of NBFIs and other market participants.</p>
<p>Fourth, to further help with liquidity preparedness, ISDA encourages the FSB, standard-setting bodies and authorities to consider ways to support extending the range of collateral that can be used to meet margin requirements. Building flexibility into collateral arrangements through wider collateral eligibility would also reduce the reliance on other sources of liquidity.</p>
<p>Fifth, ISDA agrees that financial institutions such as clearing members and intermediaries in bilateral transactions should perform robust due diligence on all their counterparties. However, intermediaries should not be the conduit for oversight of their counterparties.</p>
<p>Sixth, ISDA draws attention to ongoing industry efforts to further automate and standardize collateral management, where appropriate, through various mechanisms including but not limited to ISDA&rsquo;s collateral management suggested operational practices and the Common Domain Model.</p>
<p>Seventh, a number of key terms used in the consultation report may be interpreted ambiguously as they will likely mean different things to different types of NBFIs, standard-setting bodies and regulators. Inappropriate and ambiguous application of such terms could lead to an inconsistent regulatory framework, which could create competitive imbalances, regulatory arbitrage and inappropriately over-insure against liquidity risk, trapping too much cash or other highly liquid collateral, thus rendering it unavailable for investment in the real economy.</p>
<p>Finally, key data about derivatives activity and exposures is currently available to regulators in all major jurisdictions, due to mandated derivatives reporting requirements, via derivatives trade repositories that have been established over the past decade. ISDA support the FSB&rsquo;s recommendation in its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P060923-2.pdf">report on the financial stability implications of leverage</a>&nbsp;to make &ldquo;more intensive use of existing data, such as those available in trade repositories&rdquo; and urges regulators to optimize their use of the data they currently receive before they consider imposing additional requirements.</p>

<div> Innovate Finance, CISI, Certificate in Ethical AI, partnership, fintech
Summary:<br /><br />Innovate Finance partners with CISI to offer members Certificate in Ethical AI, supporting ethical and responsible AI use in financial services. <div>
<p>The UK&rsquo;s industry body for the fintech community, Innovate Finance, has confirmed it will be distributing the<b><i> </i></b><a href="https://www.cisi.org/cisiweb2/cisi-website/study-with-us/professional-assessments/Certificate-in-Ethical-Artificial-Intelligence"><b>CISI&rsquo;s Certificate in Ethical Artificial Intelligence (AI)</b></a><b><i> </i></b>to its membership.</p>
<p>This new partnership means that the CISI&rsquo;s Certificate in Ethical AI will be added to the Innovate Finance elearning programme and made available to all Innovate Finance members.</p>
<p>Educational charity and professional body the CISI has a global membership of over 53,000 based in over 100 countries. The Institute offers qualifications and lifelong elearning opportunities for those working or aspiring to work in the capital markets, financial planning and wealth management professions.</p>
<p>The CISI launched its Certificate in Ethical Artificial Intelligence (AI) in November 2023 as part of its campaign to champion ethics and transparency in the use of AI. The certificate was introduced as part of an ethical AI initiative by the City of London Lord Mayor Michael Mainelli, Chartered FCSI(Hon), with key input from the Lord Mayor&rsquo;s steering group for this project.</p>
<p>Since its launch, 3,000 professionals, 7 financial services regulators and 4 central banks in 50 countries have registered for the CISI Certificate in Ethical Artificial Intelligence (AI).</p>
<p>Machine Learning/AI is listed as a priority future skill for the UK financial services sector by the Financial Services Skills Commission (FSSC) in&nbsp;<a href="https://financialservicesskills.org/news/demand-for-data-ai-and-tech-skills-increases-across-financial-services-future-skills-report-2024/#:~:text=24%20April%202024-,Demand%20for%20data%2C%20AI%20and%20tech%20skills%20increases%20across,services%20%2D%20Future%20Skills%20Report%202024.&amp;text=Demand%20for%20technology%20and%20data,Services%20Skills%20Commission%20(FSSC).">its recent report</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Janine Hirt" src="https://mondovisione.com/_assets/images/Janine-Hirt.jpg" title="Janine Hirt" /></p>
<p>Janine Hirt, above, CEO of Innovate Finance said: &ldquo;We are delighted to be partnering with CISI to&nbsp; offer our members the CISI Certificate in Ethical Artificial Intelligence. Our world-leading UK fintech sector has always led the way in harnessing new technology to improve the financial services industry for consumers across the country. This course will provide our members with an in-depth understanding of the fundamental ethical and management issues in the deployment of artificial intelligence, helping to ensure we utilise this technology in a safe and responsible way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tanveer Bhatti, group head of Model Risk Management at Revolut said: &ldquo;At Revolut, understanding AI ethics is vital for ensuring the safety and trust of our customers who use our banking app. We've subscribed our senior leaders to the CISI and Innovate Finance AI certificate, allowing them to upskill and reinforcing our commitment to responsible AI use and customer protection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tracy Vegro OBE, CISI CEO said<b>: </b>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great privilege to be working alongside our partners Innovate Finance and to support them with their vision to boost the understanding of ethics in AI for their members. This is the first of many future digital skills and financial literacy projects we will be collaborating on with Innovate Finance. Innovation and integrity need to go hand in hand and AI systems rely on large amounts of data, which raises privacy concerns. Without ethical guidelines and regulations in place, the misuse or mishandling of data can result in harm to individuals or groups.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want to support the fintech and professional services practitioner community to understand that AI systems need to be transparent, accountable and inclusive. As AI becomes more advanced and widespread, there are growing concerns about issues such as bias, transparency, accountability, safety, and employment trends. If people do not believe that AI is being developed and used in a responsible and ethical manner, they hesitate to use or interact with beneficial technologies. This course will help Innovate Finance members understand the issues and opportunities posed by AI in financial services."</p>
<p>The certificate will become available to Innovate Finance members on 1 July 2024.</p>

<div> ICE, Midland WTI, open interest, futures contract, Houston<br />
Summary:<br />
ICE's HOU crude futures contract hit record open interest. Customers benefit from margin offsets and flexibility in delivery locations and dates. <div>
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE: ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today announced that its ICE Midland WTI (ICE:HOU) crude futures contract hit record open interest of 158,208 contracts on June 13, 2024, after market participants last week added over 100,000 lots of HOU to their books.</p>
<p>ICE HOU has grown from average daily volume (ADV) of 1,794 in 2022, to ADV of 6,695 contracts in 2023, to record ADV of 27,560 during the month of May 2024.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Customers are moving positions to ICE HOU as the contract offers them greater optionality,&rdquo; said Jeff Barbuto, Global Head of Oil Markets at ICE. &ldquo;The Houston market has changed fundamentally since price reporting agencies started assessing Midland WTI in Houston roughly 15 years ago. Since then, production shipped to Houston has surged, infrastructure has expanded to multiple times its previous capacity, the U.S. export ban was lifted, all contributing to the U.S. exporting on average 4.2 million barrels per day, with the majority of that being Midland WTI.&rdquo;</p>
<p>ICE HOU pricing reflects current fundamentals in Houston, delivering physical crude into two of the biggest crude oil systems on the U.S. Gulf Coast, the ONEOK Magellan East Houston (MEH) and Enterprise Crude Houston (ECHO) terminals. Both are connected to Platts-approved water terminals to deliver Midland WTI into Brent. HOU is the only exchange-guaranteed source of ratably deliverable Midland WTI, with the quality spec of HOU matching the Platts spec for Midland WTI.</p>
<p>Over 12 million barrels of crude are being delivered against HOU futures each month. This includes EFPs (Exchange for Physicals), which allows customers the flexibility to deliver barrels to other locations, as well as flexible delivery dates. Meanwhile, ICE HOU time spreads, as well as spreads with Brent and WTI Cushing (Domestic Sweet), help customers mitigate price risk between locations and grades.</p>
<p>Customers can benefit from margin offsets as high as 98% when clearing HOU alongside other oil positions cleared at ICE. Offsets are available across a range of over 800 oil contracts, including ICE Brent, ICE Gasoil, ICE WTI (Cushing), ICE Dubai (Platts), and ICE Murban, as well as NY Harbor RBOB Gasoline and Heating Oil.</p>
<p>Across ICE&rsquo;s global oil complex, open interest stands at 14.4 million contracts, up 24% y/y. Alongside record highs in Midland WTI, ICE&rsquo;s WTI (Cushing) futures contract hit record open interest of 793,288 contracts on June 10, 2024. Oil is one part of ICE&rsquo;s extensive global commodity markets where OI stands at 62 million contracts, up 26% y/y. Meanwhile, ICE&rsquo;s total futures and options hit record open interest of 98.4 million contracts on June 13, 2024.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><ol>
<li>
<p><span>Final draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) on the use of asset-referenced tokens (ARTs) and electronic money tokens (EMTs) denominated in a non-EU currency as a means of exchange.</span>&nbsp;The draft RTS specify the methodology to be applied by issuers of ARTs and of EMTs denominated in a non-EU currency for estimating the number and value of transactions associated to uses of these tokens &ldquo;as a means of exchange&rdquo;, for the purpose of the reporting under MiCAR. The drat RTS aim at contributing to the objective of MiCAR of monitoring and preventing risks that the wide use of ARTs and of EMTs denominated in a non-EU currency as a means of exchange may have on monetary policy transmission and monetary sovereignty within the EU.</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<div><ol start="2">
<li>
<p><span>Final draft Implementing Technical Standards (ITS) on the reporting obligations of issuers of ARTs and EMTs denominated in a non-EU currency, and of crypto-asset service providers (CASPs).</span>&nbsp;The final draft ITS provide specific templates and related instructions for the issuers of ARTs and of EMTs denominated in a non-EU currency to comply with their reporting obligations.

<li>
<p><span>Guidelines (GL) on liquidity stress testing</span>. The Guidelines lay out the risks to be covered in the liquidity stress testing and identify the common reference parameters of the stress test scenarios to be included in the liquidity stress testing to be applied.

</li>
</ol></div>
<div><ol start="4">
<li>
<p><span>Final draft RTS on supervisory colleges.</span>&nbsp;The draft RTS specify the conditions under which certain entities, such as custodians of the reserve of assets, trading platforms and crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) providing custody and administration of crypto-assets on behalf of clients, are to be deemed &ldquo;the most relevant&rdquo; in their category, and the conditions under which a significant ART or EMT is to be deemed to be &ldquo;used at large scale&rdquo;, for the purpose of determining the composition of a supervisory college under MiCAR. The EBA is required to establish such a college in accordance with MiCAR for each significant ART and significant EMT. In addition, the RTS specify the general conditions for the functioning of supervisory colleges, including aspects related to participation in college meetings, voting procedures, exchange of information and the entrustment of tasks among college members.</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<div>

In accordance with Article 58(3) of MiCAR, these RTS shall also apply mutatis mutandis to EMTs denominated in a non-EU currency.</p>
</div>

</div>
<div>

<title>Finansinpektionen: Nasdaq Stockholm Receives A Remark And An Administrative Fine</title>

<div> Nasdaq Stockholm, Finansinspektionen, remark, administrative fine, violations
Summary:<br />Finansinspektionen issued a SEK 100 million fine to Nasdaq Stockholm for deficiencies in trade monitoring and initiating unauthorized trading. <div>
<p><span>Finansinspektionen has decided to issue Nasdaq Stockholm Aktiebolag a remark and an administrative fine of SEK 100 million.</span></p>
<div class="editor-content">
<p>Nasdaq Stockholm Aktiebolag (Nasdaq Stockholm or the stock exchange) is a stock exchange, i.e., a firm that holds authorisation to operate a regulated market in accordance with the Securities Market Act (2007:528).</p>
<p>Finansinspektionen has investigated whether Nasdaq Stockholm, in conjunction with four major company events in 2021 and 2022, met its obligations to maintain effective arrangements, systems and procedures in its trade monitoring and to report suspected insider dealing to the authority pursuant to Article 16(1) of the EU Market Abuse Regulation (MAR) and Chapter 13, section 7 of the Securities Market Act.</p>
<p>Finansinspektionen also investigated whether Nasdaq Stockholm, on two occasions in 2022 and 2023, initiated trading in financial instruments on Nasdaq Stockholm's regulated market in violation of Chapter 13, section 3 of the Securities Market Act since Finansinspektionen had not approved and registered prospectuses for the instruments.</p>
<p>The investigations show that, in conjunction with the four company events, there have been deficiencies in how Nasdaq Stockholm has conducted its trading monitoring, which should prevent, identify and report insider dealing. The investigations also show that Nasdaq Stockholm on two occasions initiated trading in financial instruments in violation of the regulatory framework. Nasdaq Stockholm has hereby disregarded its obligations pursuant to Article 16(1) of MAR and Chapter 13, section 3 of the Securities Market Act.</p>
<p>Finansinspektionen makes the assessment that the violations have been of such a nature that there are grounds on which to intervene against Nasdaq Stockholm. However, the violations are not so serious that there are grounds on which to withdraw the stock exchange's authorisation or issue the stock exchange a warning. Finansinspektionen is therefore issuing Nasdaq Stockholm a remark and an administrative fine of SEK 100 million.</p>

Summary:<br />FI is keeping the countercyclical buffer rate at 2%, with a Credit-to-GDP gap of -15 ppts and a buffer guide of 0%. <div>
<p><span>In accordance with its assessment in the most recent stability report, FI is leaving the countercyclical buffer rate unchanged in the second quarter. The buffer rate of 2 per cent, which was applied starting on 22 June 2023, shall thus continue to apply. The countercyclical buffer guide is calculated at 0 per cent.</span></p>

<p><em>Note: Due to revisions in SCB's national accounts, the Credit-to-GDP gap and the Buffer guide are only estimated up to the fourth quarter of 2023. At the next quarterly review of the countercyclical buffer rate, we will once again publish the Credit-to-GDP gap and the Buffer guide for the latest quarter available.</em></p>
<p>According to the Capital Buffers Act (2014:966), FI must change or determine the countercyclical buffer rate when necessary. According to the same Act, FI must calculate a countercyclical buffer guide for each quarter.</p>

<title>Hong Kong Securities And Futures Commission’s 35th Year And Beyond: Guiding Hong Kong’s Capital Markets With Mission And Vision</title>

<div> Initiatives, Resilience, Growth, Market Integrity, Global Collaboration
<br />
The SFC's Annual Report showcases initiatives to promote market growth, uphold integrity, and enhance global collaboration for Hong Kong's capital markets.
<br /><br />Summary:
The Annual Report highlights initiatives, market resilience, global collaboration, and market integrity. It also emphasizes advancing Hong Kong's super-connector role. <div>
<p>The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) marks its 35-year history as the guardian of Hong Kong&rsquo;s capital markets with today&rsquo;s publication of its&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.sfc.hk/-/media/EN/files/COM/Annual-Report/2023-24/SFC-Annual-Report-2023-24_EN.pdf?rev=36fededb4a204061b4a6b3a836c6c80e" target="_blank">Annual Report 2023-24</a></em>.</p>
<p>The Annual Report highlights various initiatives to promote the resilience and sustainable growth of Hong Kong&rsquo;s capital markets to cement its position as an international financial centre. It also lays out the SFC&rsquo;s roadmap to prepare the capital markets for future opportunities as well as challenges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SFC&rsquo;s Chairman Mr Tim Lui said: &ldquo;The achievements we made and valuable experience gained over the years will stand us in good stead to steer Hong Kong&rsquo;s capital markets. To this end, we remain steadfast in our commitment to ensuring market integrity and resilience in the face of emerging trends and new challenges at the local, regional and global levels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SFC&rsquo;s Chief Executive Officer Ms Julia Leung said: &ldquo;To remain a world-class regulator and lead Hong Kong&rsquo;s capital markets to new heights in decades to come, the SFC must strengthen its dual role as protector and enabler, by staying agile and vigilant as well as harnessing new opportunities from sustainability and new technologies, without compromising investor protection.&rdquo;<span></span></p>
<p>Advancing Hong Kong&rsquo;s super-connector role has remained one of the SFC&rsquo;s top initiatives. With the recent measures announced by the China Securities Regulatory Commission to support the city&rsquo;s market developments, the SFC is making efforts with all parties to launch these measures, in order to deepen Mainland-Hong Kong mutual market access. It is also striving to connect with new markets to diversify the sources of the city&rsquo;s capital and listings. Senior management&rsquo;s first official visit to the Middle East earlier in June has paved the way for further regional market collaboration.</p>
<p>The flagship Stock Connect scheme, which celebrates its 10th anniversary, has recorded a 20-fold advance in average daily trading since 2014. ETF Connect has also spurred overall ETF market turnover since its mid-2022 launch, boosting ETFs&rsquo; share to 14% of Main Board turnover in the first quarter of 2024 from 5% in 2021. Through its debut year, Swap Connect, which strengthens the city&rsquo;s role as an offshore risk management hub, has seen its overseas participants more than double and average daily turnover quadruple.</p>
<p>To lead financial market transformation via technology and scale up the Web3 ecosystem in Hong Kong, the SFC has authorised the city&rsquo;s first tokenised retail gold product, as well as Asia&rsquo;s first batch of virtual asset (VA) spot ETFs for retail access. These ETFs have a total market capitalisation of more than US$300 million with orderly trading and decent daily turnover since their launch. The SFC has made sure investors are protected through wide-ranging safeguards to foster a resilient VA ecosystem.</p>
<p>Tremendous enforcement efforts have also been made to uphold market integrity. Following the SFC&rsquo;s investigation, individuals involved in a highly sophisticated market manipulation case were convicted in a landmark High Court jury trial in May. The criminal prosecution marks the first time that an offence under the Securities and Futures Ordinance has been tried at the Court of First Instance. Separately, a case against two suspected core members of a large-scale ramp and dump syndicate was transferred to the District Court following the SFC&rsquo;s investigation. This marks the first ramp and dump criminal prosecution at the District Court.<span></span></p>
<p>Internationally, the SFC actively participates in global standard-setting work through the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO). In May, Ms Leung began her two-year tenure as Chair of the IOSCO Asia-Pacific Regional Committee to help ensure the Asian voice is heard globally. As a champion of sustainable finance, the SFC is working closely with the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong on taking a proportionate local approach to implement the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards, to help the city become an early adopter of global standards and ride on transition finance opportunities. To lead by example and encourage transparent disclosure of carbon footprint by Hong Kong&rsquo;s corporates, the SFC also discloses its Scope 1-3 emissions for the first time in this annual report.</p>
<p>For the SFC&rsquo;s key operational data for the financial year of 2023-24, please refer to the Appendix of this press release.</p>
<p>The Annual Report, together with&nbsp;<a href="https://d3nv6maja2jqhl.cloudfront.net/SFC_ENG_V4_140624.mp4" target="_blank">a video message</a>, is now available on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sfc.hk/en/Published-resources/Corporate-publications/Annual-reports" target="_blank">SFC website</a>, as well as its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/sfchkofficial/" target="_blank">Facebook</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/2495159/admin/feed/posts/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sfc.hk/en/WeChat" target="_blank">WeChat</a>&nbsp;pages.</p>

<div> Court, Securities and Futures Commission, Ramp-and-dump, Defendants, Trial<br />
Summary:<br />
Three ramp-and-dump cases transferred to District Court for trial involving 18 defendants manipulating trading and inducing investors. Bail conditions set. <div>
<p>The Eastern Magistrates&rsquo; Court today granted the applications made on behalf of the Secretary for Justice to transfer three large scale and sophisticated ramp-and-dump cases to the District Court for trial following joint investigations by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Police.</p>
<p>The first hearing in the District Court will be held on 9 July 2024.</p>
<p>A total of 18 defendants were charged in the three cases with offences under the Securities and Futures Ordinance and the offences of conspiracy to defraud and money laundering involving the shares of Eggriculture Foods Limited, Fullwealth Construction Holdings Company Limited, and KNT Holdings Limited (Note 1).</p>
<p>The defendants had allegedly organised and executed ramp-and-dump schemes in the shares of the three Hong Kong-listed companies by manipulating the trading of a large volume of those shares through numerous nominee accounts and inducing investors to buy the shares via different social media platforms.</p>
<p>The Court granted bail to each defendant on the following conditions: (i) cash and sureties ranging from $50,000 to $1 million; (ii) not to leave Hong Kong; (iii) surrender all travel documents; (iv) report to police station on a regular basis; and (v) reside at the reported residential address and inform the Police in advance of any change of residential address.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Private economy is the driving force behind the Chinese path to modernization, and listed private-owned enterprises (POEs) are an important foundation for the high-quality development of the capital market. The report to the 20th CPC National Congress emphasized the need to optimize the development environment for private enterprises and promote the growth of the private economy. During this year's Two Sessions, General Secretary Xi Jinping once again stressed the importance of the policy of "two unswervinglys", namely unswervingly consolidating and developing the public sector and unswervingly encouraging, supporting and guiding the development of the non-public sector. This aims to stimulate the intrinsic motivation and innovative vitality of various types of market entities.<span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE) earnestly implements the decisions and arrangements of the&nbsp;CPC&nbsp;Central Committee and the State Council to promote the development and growth of the private economy. We continue to implement the requirements of the CSRC's "Three-Year Action Plan to Promote the Improvement of the Quality of Listed Companies (2022-2025)". To support the high-quality development of SZSE-listed POEs, we have formulated a "Work Plan to Support POEs in Focusing on Core Businesses and Ensuring Stable Development".&nbsp;It&nbsp;actively guides private enterprises to focus on their core businesses and develop steadily, thereby fully boosting confidence in the development of the private economy, and laying a solid foundation for capital market reform and development.</p>
<p>Currently, SZSE has gathered over 2,100 listed POEs, accounting for over 70% of SZSE-listed companies. Their total market value is approximately 20 trillion yuan, accounting for 68% of the total market value of SZSE-listed companies. Moreover, on the ChiNext board, POEs account for over 80% of the total, and under the registration-based IPO system, more than 90% of the newly listed companies are POEs. High-quality listed POEs have become a distinctive feature and important pillar of the SZSE market. Empowered by the capital market, SZSE-listed POEs have shown strong resilience and vitality, with stable and improving performance trends. In 2023,&nbsp;the&nbsp;SZSE-listed POEs achieved a total operating revenue of 9.56 trillion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 6.63%. 1,485 POEs achieved profitability, with a net profit of 449.8 billion yuan. Furthermore, a number of innovative "leaders" and industrial "pioneers" emerged&nbsp;and&nbsp;more than 10 POEs&nbsp;achieved&nbsp;a market value of over 100 billion yuan.</p>
<p>On May 16, SZSE will host a collective&nbsp;briefing on performance themed&nbsp;"Private Economy: Advancing to&nbsp;a&nbsp;New Stage" in the listing hall. We will invite companies including Tri_Ring Group, Lingyi iTech, Delton Technology, Newland,&nbsp;and&nbsp;CNGR to participate, and communicate with investors through a combination of online and offline channels. SZSE will provide online interactive Q&amp;A services, online text and image communication, and synchronous video broadcasting through the Easy IR platform.</p>
<p>During the theme week, a number of listed POEs such as TGOOD, Tengyuan Cobalt, Kehua Data, Mingyang Electric will also hold online&nbsp;briefings&nbsp;(the specific information is subject to company notices). At the&nbsp;briefing, each company's core members including the Chairman, General Manager, Finance Director, Board Secretary, and Independent Directors will analyze the company's performance, answer investors' questions, listen to investors' suggestions, and help investors gain a deeper understanding of the company's situation. We look forward to all investors' continued attention and active participation.&nbsp;</p>

<title>DEAC &amp; DLC Data Centers Strengthen Position In Northern Europe With New Brand Delska</title>

<div> merger, Delska, data center, network expertise, infrastructure expansion
<br />
DEAC and DLC merge to form Delska, offering IT solutions, green energy, new data center construction, and comprehensive services.
<br /><br />Summary: Delska formed from DEAC and DLC merger, offering IT solutions, green energy, new data center construction, and comprehensive services. <div>
<p><b>DEAC</b><b>&nbsp;and Data Logistics Center (DLC) celebrate 25 years of data center and network expertise by merging into a joint brand, Delska. This strategic merger will benefit businesses, offering sophisticated solutions for reliable operations of IT infrastructure and networks across multiple locations.</b></p>
<div dir="ltr" id="dvprnejpgf62aleft"><img align="middle" alt="DEAC and DLC merged into a new brand Delska." id="prnejpgf62aleft" src="https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2441990/DEAC_and_DLC.jpg" title="DEAC and DLC merged into a new brand Delska." /></div>
<p>Both companies have been part of the Baltic Rezo group, owned by Swiss Quaero European Infrastructure Fund II and managed by Quaero Capital since 2020, accelerating development and infrastructure expansion. The legal entities will stay the same.</p>
<p>Andris Gailitis, DEAC and DLC CEO, comments: "We are embarking on an exciting rebranding journey, which involves closer cooperation between companies and an expanded services portfolio to meet IT challenges of our customers from over 40 countries. The heart of the new brand is customers and personal approach to their business. Our strength lies in custom solutions for specific business and industry needs."</p>
<p>Delska's values are openness, flexibility, and reliability. Both companies still emphasize security, quality, and sustainability by using green energy and Neste MY diesel from HVO for backup power generators.</p>
<p>AI boom, increased demand for large-scale data processing, edge and high-power computing have accelerated the construction of data centers. To keep up with the lack of power capacities in major European hubs, a new 10 MW data center in Latvia is under construction. It will be one of the region's most sustainable, with LEED and Tier III certifications, scheduled for launch in 2025. Flexible options of up to 100kW per rack and 1000 racks are available for pre-booking, and the construction project can be adapted by expanding up to 50 MW.</p>
<p>Delska's growth plans include building a new data center in Lithuania, and additional players joining the group soon to build a strong regional data center and network ecosystem. Several owned data centers in Riga and Vilnius and points of presence in Frankfurt, Amsterdam, and Stockholm ensure customers' business continuity with disaster recovery solutions.</p>
<p>Delska offers a comprehensive range of IT services &ndash; cloud, dedicated servers, security, network solutions, and managed services. "In addition to currently available virtual machine deployment on our self-service platform, built for SMBs, developers, and startups, this year we will implement instant bare metal service to simplify IT people's lives even further," emphasis A. Gailitis.</p>

<div> FCA, review, treatment, PEPs, financial services<br />
Summary:<br />
FCA launched a review of PEP treatment, delayed publication due to election, compliance with anti-money laundering legislation, separate from bank account closure data request. <div>
<p>Last year, the FCA launched a review of the treatment of domestic Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) by financial services firms.</p>
<p>We had been on track to publish the findings from this review in line with the end of June deadline set in the Financial Services and Markets Act 2023.</p>
<p>However, we do not think it is appropriate to publish the review during the pre-election period. We will now publish it in July once Parliament has returned.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ol>
<li>Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-launches-review-treatment-politically-exposed-persons" title="FCA launches review of treatment of Politically Exposed Persons">statement announcing the review</a>.&nbsp;</li>

<li>This review was being conducted in compliance with Section 78 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2023.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The review assessed how firms are adhering to the anti-money laundering legislation and FCA guidance to conduct proportionate and risk based due diligence on their clients.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The definition of a PEP derives from the international standards issued by the&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Financial Action Taskforce<span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>.&nbsp;</li>
<li>This work is separate to our data request on bank account closures.</li>

<title>Financial Advice In A Changing World - Opening Remarks By ASIC Commissioner Alan Kirkland At The Professional Planner Licensee Summit, 18 June 2024</title>

<div> Enforcement, Retirement outcomes, Reportable situations, IDR framework, Experienced provider pathway
<br />
ASIC's priorities include enforcement, regulation and support for good retirement outcomes. They focus on reportable situations, IDR, and experienced provider pathway.
<br /><br />Summary: 
ASIC's priorities include enforcement to address misconduct, regulation for retirement outcomes, and support for reforms such as the experienced provider pathway. <div>
<h2>KEY POINTS</h2>
<ul>
<li>ASIC Commissioner Alan Kirkland addressed financial advice licensees at the Professional Planner Licensee Summit about ASIC&rsquo;s priorities and current work in the area of financial advice.</li>
<li>As millions of Australians head towards retirement age, the number of people who need trusted financial advice is growing. ASIC will continue to have strong focus on supporting good retirement incomes for these Australians.</li>
<li>ASIC supports the Government&rsquo;s objective of improving access to high quality and affordable advice to Australians through the Delivering Better Financial Outcomes, and will consider providing regulatory guidance once the reforms are passed by Parliament.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd like to begin by acknowledging the Traditional Owners of the land on which we meet today, the Dharug and Gundungurra people, and paying my respects to Elders past and present.</p>
<p>I am really pleased to be here in this exciting post-lunch slot to discuss ASIC&rsquo;s priorities and current work in relation to financial advice.</p>
<p>I thought I&rsquo;d cover three key areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our focus and our priorities in enforcement.</li>
<li>Our progress in bedding down some new reforms, including in relation to reportable situations and internal dispute resolution.</li>
<li>Our broader work in supporting good retirement outcomes for Australians.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before I joined CHOICE as CEO around 12 years ago in my last role, I had little to do with debates about financial advice regulation.</p>
<p>As I was going for the role, the FoFA [Future of Financial Advice] reforms had recently been settled, after many months &ndash; if not years &ndash; of debate and inquiries through Parliament. But I remember saying in one of my job interviews that, I suspect that the debate about advice regulation isn't over.</p>
<p>That was a bit of a throwaway line at the time &ndash; but I didn&rsquo;t realise at the time how prescient that observation might be.</p>
<p>In the 12 years since then, we&rsquo;ve seen:</p>
<ul>
<li>the debate about repealing the FoFA reforms</li>
<li>the Life Insurance Framework reforms of 2018</li>
<li>the establishment of FASEA and implementation of the Professional Standards Reforms</li>
<li>the Financial Services Royal Commission and the wave of reform, both broadly across financial services and specific financial advice that came out of it</li>
<li>the disbanding of FASEA</li>
<li>the Quality of Advice Review</li>
<li>and now, the Delivering Better Financial Outcomes [DBFO] process that is underway now in response to the Quality of Advice recommendations.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of change in 12 years, almost all of it subject to heavily contested debate.</p>
<p>And maybe we shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised about that.</p>
<p>Access to good advice &ndash; safe advice &ndash; is important to people who need it. While not every Australian will want or need financial advice, when they do, they need to be able to receive advice that they can trust.</p>
<p>Also the number of people who need advice is growing. Three million Australians will become eligible to start drawing upon their superannuation in the next decade &ndash; on top of the six million who are already at or above superannuation preservation age<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/financial-advice-in-a-changing-world/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span>[1]</span></a>. And as the superannuation system continues to mature, more of those people will be retiring with larger balances.</p>
<p>That reinforces the importance of ensuring that protection for consumers of financial advice is appropriate &ndash; because in the worst cases, when financial advice goes wrong, people can lose their entire retirement savings, and that can be devastating for the individuals involved.</p>
<p>And from my work on these issues over time, nothing brings that point home more clearly than having talked to people in that situation &ndash; people at or around retirement, who suddenly found themselves with no retirement savings, having thought that they had set themselves up for maybe not a super comfortable retirement, but one that would be adequate, and then instead discovering that they're probably going to be dependent on the age pension, with poor advice having played a significant role in that. That&rsquo;s the risk we&rsquo;re always trying to protect against.</p>
<h2>The industry today</h2>
<p>I reflected on the last decade or so of reform &ndash; where does that leave the industry today?</p>
<p>I think there are some signs of stabilisation.</p>
<p>As discussed this morning, while there has been a significant contraction in the number of advisers since the introduction of the professional standards reforms in particular, there are some signs that this trend may be easing.</p>
<p>There were exactly 15,663 advisers registered with ASIC as at 1 March 2024, and while this is around 9,000 less than the long-term average prior to 2019, it represents a decline of only 36 since 30 June 2023 &ndash; so there's some signs that trend may be stabilising.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also got the experienced provider pathway coming online and new financial advisers undertaking their professional year, so I think these numbers will be interesting to watch over the next few years.</p>
<p>But at the same time, it seems like there might be more structural reform on the way.</p>
<p>While the detail of the Delivering Better Financial Outcomes proposal to introduce a new class of adviser is still being worked through, it is likely to lead to a significant expansion in the number of firms that offer some kind of advice and the number of people involved in providing it.</p>
<p>Super funds will play an even bigger role in the provision of advice &ndash; and as is the case currently, this will likely involve a range of insourced and outsourced models. And of course, there is growing speculation that some of the major banks may make some kind of return to wealth management.</p>
<p>In the context of all that, ASIC is taking a close interest in the DBFO reforms, as is the case with any reform to laws that we administer. We support the Government&rsquo;s objective of improving access to high quality and affordable advice to Australians.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t make government policy decisions or design regulatory reform, despite what you might sometimes read in Professional Planner. That is a job for the Government, guided by Treasury advice. But we do work with Treasury of course through the process, as do a range of industry bodies, bringing to the task our many years of insight and experience in overseeing and regulating the financial advice industry.</p>
<p>And once these reforms have passed through the Parliament, we&rsquo;ll be considering where there&rsquo;s a case for regulatory guidance to provide greater certainty around the way in which we interpret and apply the law.</p>
<h2>ASIC&rsquo;s focus</h2>
<p>With that context of further reform on the way, I thought it might be useful to talk about ASIC&rsquo;s priorities, in terms of enforcement and regulation.</p>
<p>While you know us as the financial services regulator, and you see the detailed work we do in relation to financial advice, we are also Australia&rsquo;s corporate, markets, and consumer credit regulator.</p>
<p>We've got one of the broadest remits of financial services or corporate regulators in the world. We have got finite resources, and that means that we need to prioritise what we focus on and how we use those resources.</p>
<p>In doing so, we aim to focus on the most serious threats and harms we see in the system as a whole &ndash; to ensure we are directing our resources to where they are needed most.</p>
<p>Setting priorities and understanding those threats and harms is quite a detailed process. It involves analysing the multiple sources of data available to us, talking to our peer regulators internationally, talking to industry bodies, looking at the reports of misconduct that come to us and also talking to our advisory panels, which include a number of industry representatives.</p>
<p>Retirement outcomes is one of our strategic priorities for the current financial year and while priorities for 2024&ndash;25 will be announced early in the new financial year, I can confidently say there will continue to be a strong focus on supporting good retirement incomes for Australians.</p>
<h3>Enforcement</h3>
<p>Alongside these strategic priorities, we also set annual enforcement priorities. These typically cover the calendar year, with the 2024 priorities having been announced at the ASIC Forum in November last year.</p>
<p>Of interest to this audience, the current enforcement priorities include:</p>
<ul>
<li>misconduct resulting in the systemic erosion of superannuation balances</li>
<li>compliance with the reportable situations regime, and</li>
<li>our enduring priority of systemic compliance failures by large financial institutions resulting in widespread consumer harm.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In pursuing these priorities, we are incredibly active. As our Chair [Joe Longo] frequently says, we are in court rooms around the country almost every day of the legal year, often in many court rooms on the same day, pursuing cases against individuals and firms, small and large.</p>
<p>The laws we administer carry a broad range of potential criminal, civil and administrative consequences &ndash; from issuing public warnings through to terms of imprisonment. We use this broad toolkit in a calibrated and proportionate manner to address misconduct.</p>
<p>So far this financial year, we have removed, restricted, or banned 49 people or companies from providing financial services across a range of sectors (figures to May 29, 2024) &ndash; the equivalent of almost one every week.</p>
<p>The circumstances in each case vary &ndash; including insolvency, dishonest conduct, providing advice that&rsquo;s not in the best interests of clients, or providing inappropriate advice &ndash; but each case fundamentally represents a threat to trust in our financial services system.</p>
<p>We take a risk-based approach to our enforcement activities. We&rsquo;re always looking to target our legal efforts to the matters that can have the broadest reach or send the most powerful deterrence message.</p>
<p>That obviously sometimes involves action against larger firms, where misconduct may often lead to larger scale harm to consumers. You&rsquo;ll see that demonstrated in several recent actions against:</p>
<ul>
<li>'licensee for hire' firm Lanterne Fund Services<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/financial-advice-in-a-changing-world/#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><span>[2]</span></a>&nbsp;for breaching its AFS licence obligations (although I would say Lanterne was large in the number of authorised reps operating under its banner but ultimately only had one full-time employee, so not sure if we should classify as small or large &ndash; large certainly in terms of its impact on consumers)</li>
<li>RM Capital<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/financial-advice-in-a-changing-world/#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><span>[3]</span></a>&nbsp;for failing to ensure its authorised representative, SMSF Club, did not accept conflicted remuneration, and</li>
<li>Mercer Financial Advice<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/financial-advice-in-a-changing-world/#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><span>[4]</span></a>, for failing in its fee disclosure obligations and charging fees to customers it was not entitled to charge.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes, this involves actions against smaller firms or individual advisers &ndash; for instance, our actions against David Valvo,<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/financial-advice-in-a-changing-world/#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"><span>[5]</span></a>&nbsp;Brett Gordon<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/financial-advice-in-a-changing-world/#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"><span>[6]</span></a>&nbsp;or Mark Cooper.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/financial-advice-in-a-changing-world/#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"><span>[7]</span></a>&nbsp;In fact, half of the companies and individuals we have removed, restricted, or banned this financial year had an estimated business revenue of less than $1 million.</p>
<p>I make this point because there&rsquo;s often a suggestion which I think was reflected in some of the discussion this morning that we don&rsquo;t take action to address this conduct by individuals or smaller firms. This data demonstrates that we can and do take action against a broad range of firms and, where appropriate, against individuals involved in the management or governance of firms involved in misconduct.</p>
<h3>Reform</h3>
<h4>Reportable situations regime</h4>
<p>One of the enforcement priorities that I mentioned a moment ago was compliance with the reportable situations regime.</p>
<p>This regime was a key recommendation of the Financial Services Royal Commission. It was intended to be a key source of regulatory intelligence for ASIC to feed into the decision making around where we apply our resources, so it is really important to us that it operates effectively.</p>
<p>The regime has now been in effect for almost three years &ndash; but the proportion of licensees that have submitted a report is very low,<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/financial-advice-in-a-changing-world/#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"><span>[8]</span></a>&nbsp;which suggests some still may not be complying with their obligations.</p>
<p>There has been little improvement on this since our first report on this in 2022,<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/financial-advice-in-a-changing-world/#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9"><span>[9]</span></a>&nbsp;which is one of the reasons we have made it an enforcement priority for 2024.</p>
<p>Our surveillance on this remains active and ongoing but we have spent the past two years warning licensees to lift their game &ndash; and my message today is that we&rsquo;re not going to spend the next two years doing the same.</p>
<p>Where we find evidence of non-compliance, we will take the appropriate action &ndash; including enforcement action, where necessary.</p>
<h4>IDR framework</h4>
<p>Another key new source of data to inform our work is in relation to internal dispute resolution [IDR] data &ndash; although I would acknowledge that the IDR reporting regime is much newer.</p>
<p>Smaller financial firms were required to submit their IDR reports to ASIC for the first time this year.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/financial-advice-in-a-changing-world/#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"><span>[10]</span></a></p>
<p>This means on 1 January, all in-scope financial firms &ndash; around 8,700 in total &ndash; were due to report Internal Dispute Resolution data to ASIC.</p>
<p>This provides us &ndash; for the first time &ndash; with a picture of how the full spectrum of Australian financial firms are dealing with consumer and small business complaints under their internal dispute resolution procedures &ndash; the good, the bad, and everything in between.</p>
<p>We intend to use it to inform our work &ndash; but consistent with the recommendations of the Ramsay Review, which proposed these reforms, we also intend to publish some of that data.</p>
<p>Now that all financial firms have commenced reporting, we expect to publish some observations from the initial data collections later this year, as well as providing feedback to industry, to improve the quality and consistency of reporting.</p>
<p>Over time, you should expect the breadth and depth of data that we publish to increase, so we encourage you to be doing what you can now to make sure that your data is accurate and comprehensive.</p>
<h4>Experienced provider pathway</h4>
<p>The other key reform that I want to briefly touch on is the experienced provider pathway.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s important in the context of some of the big structural reforms I noted earlier, because it is obviously a mechanism to retain experienced advisers in the industry.</p>
<p>We have recently issued new guidance to support advisers and licensees to access the pathway.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/financial-advice-in-a-changing-world/#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11"><span>[11]</span></a></p>
<p>We have also updated our IT systems, so from 1 July, licensees can begin lodging notifications where they have received a written declaration from an adviser who is relying on the pathway. I hope that that is a relatively simple process but as always, our team is happy to answer any questions you may have as you engage this process.</p>
<h3>Regulation</h3>
<p>Before pausing, I thought it might be helpful to touch on a few aspects of our recent regulatory work that have attracted a lot of attention and interest.</p>
<h4>Choice super report</h4>
<p>The first is our work on choice super products &ndash; articulated in&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-779-superannuation-and-choice-products-what-focus-is-there-on-performance/" title="REP 779 Superannuation and choice products: What focus is there on performance?">Report 779</a>&nbsp;<em>Superannuation choice products: What focus is there on performance?</em>&nbsp;released in February.</p>
<p>As I noted earlier, ensuring good retirement outcomes is a strategic priority this year &ndash; and one that will continue into next year.</p>
<p>While good retirement outcomes aren&rsquo;t all about financial advice, obviously advice has a big role to play &ndash; and Report 779 shows that there&rsquo;s still more work to do.</p>
<p>So, in this report, we examined the practices of advisers, licensees and superannuation trustees in situations where choice products had persistently underperformed against the benchmarks disclosed in their product disclosure statements (PDS).</p>
<p>I just want to emphasise that point &ndash; this was about the benchmarks set in the product&rsquo;s product disclosure statements and it was about persistent underperformance, not over one or two years.</p>
<p>We found in some cases, clients were not told their investment options were persistently underperforming and that there may have been better alternatives available.</p>
<p>To be really clear, it is not our view that underperformance over a period should automatically result in a recommendation to switch products. That&rsquo;s not feasible &ndash; and it&rsquo;s not always going to be in the best interest of clients.</p>
<p>But persistent underperformance should be identified and considered &ndash; and we were looking for evidence that was happening. For licensees, that means having processes in place to detect and deal with persistent underperformance in a timely way.</p>
<p>That can include ensuring that licensees&rsquo; advisers are detecting and addressing underperforming options held by their clients, and that licensees treat performance as a primary criterion when approving products for use by advisers or managing approved product lists.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s quite a lot in this report tailored to licensees &ndash; we did take a look at all the distinct players in that system &ndash; so if you haven&rsquo;t already looked at this report, I encourage you to do so &ndash; it&rsquo;s available on the ASIC website.</p>
<h4>Trustee oversight of fee deductions</h4>
<p>We also recently looked at the role of superannuation trustees in monitoring fee deductions for financial advice. Given the attention this report has attracted, I thought I would provide a bit of context.</p>
<p>Obviously one of the key lessons from the Financial Services Royal Commission was about how inappropriate fee deduction with inadequate oversight can eat away at members&rsquo; balances. On the flip side, some of our recent work has shown how vigilance by trustees can protect members from unscrupulous operators, particularly with regard to superannuation-switching cold-calling practices.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we are focusing on trustees and calling on them to improve their oversight practices &ndash; calling on them to take a risk-based approach to protecting their members&rsquo; interests.</p>
<p>To be really clear &ndash; we are not asking trustees to check every piece of advice &ndash; that would not be practical. Nor is it what the current law or what the proposed changes to the law require. We could not have been clearer on that point. But we are asking trustees to consider what controls and assurances they need to put in place to enable them to comply with the law.</p>
<p>To illustrate the point, during our year-long surveillance on this issue, almost $1 billion in fees were deducted from almost half a million member accounts - but trustees only reported around 1,500 checks of advice documents.</p>
<p>Three of the 10 trustees we looked at failed to check any advice documents on a risk or random basis &ndash; and that shows there is a way to go to strengthen member protections.</p>
<p>The reforms to section 99FA, the laws applying to advice fee deductions, are still working their way through the Parliament and are being considered by a current inquiry. While that is underway, we are happy to continue to make our view on the impact of those reforms clear and when they have passed, we will consider providing more formal regulatory guidance.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, I suspect the process of reform for how financial advice is regulated will never be completely done &ndash; for the simple fact that financial advisers live and work in an ever-changing world.</p>
<p>The Government and ASIC are always going to be laser-focused on ensuring the policy settings and regulations are right for the many people who trust their advisers, and for the financial advisers you authorise to help them.</p>
<p>To that end, licensees play a critical role in the system, so ASIC welcomes the opportunity to engage in forums like this one.</p>
<p>Thank you to Conexus for the invitation to speak with you today &ndash; I look forward to taking some questions.</p>

<div> Climate-related Disclosures, FMA, XRB, climate statements, CRD regime<br />
Summary: The FMA and XRB have created guides to help understand the new climate-related disclosures regime, including legislative requirements and evaluating climate statements. <div>
<p>The Financial Markets Authority (FMA) &ndash; Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko &ndash; and the External Reporting Board &ndash; Te Kāwai Ārahi Pūrongo Mōwaho (XRB) &ndash; have jointly produced a set of guides designed to help people understand the Climate-related Disclosures (CRD) regime and the information being provided in climate statements which are now starting to be published by climate reporting entities.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;&ldquo;What You Need to Know&rdquo;&nbsp;guide provides an overview of the CRD regime for people such as primary users (existing and potential investors, lenders, and other creditors) of climate statements, journalists and other intermediaries who use or communicate climate-related information.</p>
<p>It includes information on:</p>
<ul>
<li>the purpose of disclosing climate-related information&nbsp;</li>
<li>key legislative requirements&nbsp;</li>
<li>key considerations and context about the information in climate statements&nbsp;</li>
<li>the roles of the FMA, XRB and relevant government agencies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Navigating Climate Statements&rdquo; guide is a more detailed explanation of the information disclosed in climate statements. Given that climate statements are a new type of disclosure, this guide highlights the importance of topics such as uncertainty, comparability and context when evaluating and judging the information they contain.</p>
<p>XRB Chief Executive, April Mackenzie, said: &ldquo;We aim for these joint XRB/FMA guides to support the market in getting value from the information contained within climate statements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>FMA Head of Auditing, Financial Reporting and CRD, Jacco Moison, said: &ldquo;With reporting now underway and the first climate statements being published, we want to help inform the public of the purpose of the regime.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fma.govt.nz/library/guidance-library/crd-what-you-need-to-know/" title="link to Guidance page">View the CRD - What you need to know guidance page</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.xrb.govt.nz/dmsdocument/5123/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Link to XRB website">Download the Navigating Climate Statements guide from the XRB</a></p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>The Financial Sector (Climate-related Disclosures and Other Matters) Amendment Act 2021 introduced a requirement for &lsquo;large&rsquo; entities such as listed issuers, registered banks, licensed insurers, credit unions, building societies and managers of registered managed investment schemes (other than restricted schemes) (MIS managers) to publish annual climate statements in accordance with Climate Standards issued by the XRB.</p>
<p>The purpose of the CRD regime is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Encourage entities to routinely consider the short-, medium-, and long-term risks and opportunities that climate change presents for the activities of the entity or the entity&rsquo;s group;</li>
<li>Enable entities to show how they are considering those risks and opportunities; and</li>
<li>Enable investors and other stakeholders to assess the merits of how entities are considering those risks and opportunities.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Climate Standards state the ultimate aim is to support the allocation of capital towards activities that are consistent with a transition to a low-emissions, climate-resilient future.</p>
<p>The FMA is responsible for monitoring and enforcement of the CRD regime. It will monitor whether climate statements comply with the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 and the XRB&rsquo;s Climate Standards.</p>
<p>Annual climate statements must comply with Aotearoa New Zealand Climate Standards (Climate Standards) issued by the XRB. The XRB&nbsp;also prepares guidance to support Climate Reporting Entities (CRE&rsquo;s) required to prepare climate-related disclosures in accordance with the Climate Standards.&nbsp;</p>

<div> Financial Stability Board, Regional Consultative Group, Americas, meeting, discussion
Summary:<br />FSB RCG Americas met to discuss deposit insurance, resolution frameworks, macrofinancial risks, and FSB's work program for 2024. Initiatives on crypto-assets and outsourcing risks were addressed. <div>
<p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) Regional Consultative Group (RCG) for the Americas met on 17 and 18 June in the British Virgin Islands.</p>
<p>On the first day, members participated in a roundtable discussion with representatives from the International Association of Deposit Insurers to discuss the role of deposit insurance and resolution frameworks in maintaining depositor confidence. Members look forward to the FSB&rsquo;s resolution work following up on lessons learned from the March 2023 banking turmoil.</p>
<p>Discussions on the second day began with an appraisal of recent developments and macrofinancial risks and vulnerabilities, including tight financing conditions against the backdrop of high public and private sector debt levels. Members exchanged views on links between the sovereign and banking sectors and discussed whether such interconnections could pose risks to financial stability.</p>
<p>Members also received an update on the FSB&rsquo;s work programme for 2024 and discussed ways they could contribute to the FSB&rsquo;s work programme to bring in additional perspectives from the region.</p>
<p>One initiative the RCG Americas has taken forward relates to the FSB&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2023/07/fsb-global-regulatory-framework-for-crypto-asset-activities/">global framework for crypto-asset activities</a>. In May 2023, members agreed to review developments and the current state of regulations within the region. Members discussed this stocktake and ways to ensure effective, flexible, and coordinated implementation of the comprehensive policy response for crypto-assets and global stablecoin arrangements. Given the particularly acute risk of regulatory arbitrage in the crypto space, broad global implementation is crucial.</p>
<p>Members shared their experiences of the oversight and management of financial institutions&rsquo; risks from outsourcing of critical services to third parties considering the FSB&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2023/12/final-report-on-enhancing-third-party-risk-management-and-oversight-a-toolkit-for-financial-institutions-and-financial-authorities/">toolkit for financial authorities and financial institutions for enhancing their third-party risk management and oversight</a>, which was published in December 2023.</p>
<h2><span class="Heading2Char">Background</span></h2>
<p>The FSB RCG for the Americas is co-chaired by Kenneth Baker, Managing Director and CEO, British Virgin Islands Financial Services Commission, and Tiff Macklem, Governor of the Bank of Canada. Tiff Macklem was represented at the meeting by Carolyn Rogers, Senior Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada. Membership includes financial authorities from Argentina, Bahamas, Barbados, Bermuda, Bolivia, Brazil, British Virgin Islands, Canada, Cayman Islands, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Trinidad and Tobago, the United States of America and Uruguay.</p>
<p>The FSB has six Regional Consultative Groups, established under the FSB Charter, to bring together financial authorities from FSB member and non-member countries to exchange views on vulnerabilities affecting financial systems and on initiatives to promote financial stability.<a class="footnote-ref" href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/06/fsb-americas-group-discusses-risks-associated-with-the-sovereign-bank-nexus-and-crypto-asset-arrangements/#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">1</a>&nbsp;Typically, each Regional Consultative Group meets twice each year.</p>
<p>The FSB coordinates at the international level the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies and develops and promotes the implementation of effective regulatory, supervisory, and other financial sector policies in the interest of financial stability. It brings together national authorities responsible for financial stability in 24 countries and jurisdictions, international financial institutions, sector-specific international groupings of regulators and supervisors, and committees of central bank experts. The FSB also conducts outreach with approximately 70 other jurisdictions through its six Regional Consultative Groups.</p>
<p>The FSB is chaired by Klaas Knot, President of De Nederlandsche Bank. The FSB Secretariat is located in Basel, Switzerland and hosted by the Bank for International Settlements.</p>

<div> proposal, issuance, compensation, regulatory agencies, financial institutions
Summary:
The recent issuance of a proposal for incentive compensation practices lacks legal effect, exceeds authority, ignores industry comments, lacks research, and is inflexible.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>A recent issuance from the OCC, FDIC, NCUA and FHFA attempting to resuscitate a long-stalled proposal on incentive compensation practices under section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act&nbsp;<span>does not include the full set of financial regulatory agencies required to propose such a rule and therefore has no legal effect</span>, the American Bankers Association, Bank Policy Institute, Financial Services Forum and SIFMA wrote in a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sifma.org/resources/submissions/incentive-based-compensation-arrangements/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">joint letter</a>.</p>
<p>Moreover, the document largely mirrors the 2016 proposal and, like that proposal, exceeds the agencies&rsquo; limited legal authority under Section 956.&nbsp; Section 956 permits the agencies to prohibit incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage two types of &ldquo;inappropriate&rdquo; risks, but the 2016 proposal is largely styled as a rule that would affirmatively require all covered financial institutions to incorporate specific, universal requirements into their compensation arrangements.</p>
<p><span>Doubling down:&nbsp;</span>The recent issuance ignores industry comments on the 2016 proposal that highlighted the agencies&rsquo; limited authority under Section 956, and describes compensation restrictions under consideration that would be even more prescriptive than those in the 2016 proposal.</p>
<p><span>Lack of research:&nbsp;</span>While compensation practices in the financial services industry have evolved considerably over the past eight years, the proposal contains no analysis of that experience.</p>
<p><span>Inflexible:&nbsp;</span>Moreover, this document, like the 2016 proposal, would establish a rigid approach to compensation that deprives banks of the flexibility needed to ensure compensation practices are sensitive to the institution&rsquo;s particular risk profile.</p>

<div> global provider, business communication, cybersecurity incidents, SEC, settlement <br />
Summary:<br /> 
SEC fines R.R. Donnelley & Sons over $2.1 million for cybersecurity disclosure and control failures. RRD cooperated and agreed to adopt new cybersecurity technology and controls. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Company (RRD), a global provider of business communication and marketing services, agreed to pay over $2.1 million to settle disclosure and internal control failure charges relating to cybersecurity incidents and alerts in late 2021.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Commission instituted this enforcement action because RRD&rsquo;s controls for elevating cybersecurity incidents to its management and protecting company assets from cyberattacks were insufficient,&rdquo; said Jorge G. Tenreiro, Acting Chief of the Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit. &ldquo;RRD did, however, cooperate with our investigation in a meaningful way, and that is reflected in the terms of this settlement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s order, data integrity and confidentiality were critically important to RRD&rsquo;s business. Because client data was stored on RRD&rsquo;s network, its information security personnel and the third-party service provider RRD hired were responsible for monitoring the network&rsquo;s security. However, according to the order, RRD failed to design effective disclosure controls and procedures to report relevant cybersecurity information to management with the responsibility for making disclosure decisions, and failed to carefully assess and respond to alerts of unusual activity in a timely manner. The order further finds that RRD failed to devise and maintain a system of cybersecurity-related internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that access to RRD&rsquo;s assets &ndash; its information technology systems and networks &ndash; was permitted only with management&rsquo;s authorization.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order found that RRD violated Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Exchange Act Rule 13a-15a. Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, RRD agreed to cease and desist from committing violations of these provisions and to pay a $2,125,000 civil penalty. As described in the order, RRD cooperated throughout the investigation, including by reporting the cybersecurity incident to staff prior to filing a disclosure of the incident, by providing meaningful cooperation that helped expedite the staff&rsquo;s investigation, and by voluntarily adopting new cybersecurity technology and controls.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Arsen Ablaev of the Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit and Christine S. Bautista of the Chicago Regional Office, with assistance from Kathleen Sweeney and Christopher Carpenter, and was supervised by Amy Flaherty Hartman and Mr. Tenreiro of the Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit.</p>

<div> Cybersecurity, Internal accounting controls, R.R. Donnelley & Sons, Commission, Administrative controls<br />
Summary: The Commission's broad interpretation of internal accounting controls in the RRD cyberattack case blurs the distinction between administrative and accounting controls. It expands the reach of Section 13(b)(2)(B)(iii) and undermines the proper limits of its requirements.<br /> <div>
<p>As we have noted before, the Commission in recent years has taken to treating Exchange Act Section 13(b)(2)(B)&rsquo;s internal accounting controls provision as a Swiss Army Statute to compel issuers to adopt policies and procedures the Commission believes prudent.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-uyeda-statement-rr-donnelley-061824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;Identifying a link between the Commission&rsquo;s preferred policies and procedures and accounting controls seems a collateral concern, if it is a concern at all. In today&rsquo;s settled administrative proceeding against R.R. Donnelly &amp; Sons, Co. (&ldquo;RRD&rdquo;),<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-uyeda-statement-rr-donnelley-061824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;the Commission finds and uses a novel attachment on its multi-use tool&mdash;&ldquo;a system of cybersecurity-related internal accounting controls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Understanding the particulars of RRD&rsquo;s alleged violation of Section 13(b)(2)(B) requires careful parsing of the Order Instituting Proceedings. RRD was the victim of a cyberattack. For a period of approximately four weeks in 2021, a &ldquo;threat actor was able to utilize deceptive hacking techniques to install encryption software on certain RRD computers (mostly virtual machines) and exfiltrated 70 Gigabytes of data, including data belonging to 29 of RRD&rsquo;s 22,000 clients, some of which contained personal identification and financial information.&rdquo; On December 23, &ldquo;a company with shared access to RRD&rsquo;s network alerted RRD&rsquo;s Chief Information Security Officer [&ldquo;CISO&rdquo;] about potential anomalous internet activity emanating from RRD&rsquo;s network,&rdquo; and RRD &ldquo;began actively responding to the attack.&rdquo; Importantly, RRD&rsquo;s investigation into the incident &ldquo;uncovered no evidence that the threat actor accessed RRD&rsquo;s financial systems and corporate financial and accounting data.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Order notes that RRD did have an &ldquo;internal intrusion detection system&rdquo; that, as early as November 29, &ldquo;began issuing alerts . . . about certain malware in the RRD network&rdquo; that were &ldquo;visible&rdquo; to both RRD and its third-party managed security services provider (&ldquo;MSSP&rdquo;). The MSSP sent three of the alerts to RRD personnel who reviewed them, &ldquo;but, in partial reliance on its MSSP, did not take the infected instances off the network and [RRD] failed to conduct its own investigation of the activity, or otherwise take steps to prevent further compromise, before December 23, 2021.&rdquo; The MSSP also failed to escalate to RRD at least 20 other alerts related to the same activity. Although RRD&rsquo;s controls detected possible intrusions, according to the Order, the internal accounting controls nonetheless were deficient because &ldquo;RRD&rsquo;s cybersecurity alert review and incident response policies and procedures failed to adequately establish a prioritization scheme and to provide clear guidance to internal and external personnel on procedures for responding to incidents.&rdquo; This lack of an adequate &ldquo;prioritization scheme&rdquo; and &ldquo;clear guidance . . . for responding to incidents&rdquo; meant that &ldquo;RRD&rsquo;s external and internal security personnel failed to adequately review these alerts [generated by the intrusion detection system]&rdquo; and that RRD in consequence failed to &ldquo;take adequate investigative and remedial measures&rdquo; until after the CISO was alerted by an outside company. The delayed response created by RRD&rsquo;s inadequate policies and procedures &ldquo;was exploited by hackers&rdquo; who accessed RRD&rsquo;s computer systems and exfiltrated client data. From these findings, the Order concludes that RRD violated Section 13(b)(2)(B)(iii)&rsquo;s requirement that it &ldquo;devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that . . . (iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management&rsquo;s general or specific authorization.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-uyeda-statement-rr-donnelley-061824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>The Order states that the &ldquo;assets&rdquo; that were accessed were RRD&rsquo;s &ldquo;information technology systems and networks,&rdquo; which does not fit the category of assets captured by Section 13(b)(2)(B). The computer systems, while an RRD asset in a broad sense, are not an asset of the type covered by Section 13(b)(2)(B)&rsquo;s internal accounting controls provisions. To explain why requires some discussion of the source and function of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act&rsquo;s internal accounting controls provision.</p>
<p>Section 13(b)(2)(B) originates with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (&ldquo;AICPA&rdquo;) Statement on Auditing Standards No. 1 (&ldquo;SAS&rdquo;).<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-uyeda-statement-rr-donnelley-061824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;The SAS explains that, in the context of internal accounting controls, the &ldquo;safeguarding of assets refers only to protection against loss arising from intentional and unintentional errors in processing transactions and handling the related assets.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-uyeda-statement-rr-donnelley-061824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;The specific objectives codified in Section 13(b)(2)(B) come from a section of the auditing standards that were adopted to clarify what internal accounting controls that safeguard assets means &ldquo;in relation to the functions involved in the flow of transactions.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-uyeda-statement-rr-donnelley-061824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;To that end, the SAS explained that transactions &ldquo;include exchanges of assets or services&rdquo; and &ldquo;[t]he primary functions involved in the flow of transactions and related assets include the authorization, execution, and recording of transactions and the accountability for resulting assets.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-uyeda-statement-rr-donnelley-061824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;Authorization for transactions, in turn, &ldquo;refers to management&rsquo;s decision to exchange, transfer, or use assets for specified purposes under specified conditions,&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-uyeda-statement-rr-donnelley-061824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;and the related &ldquo;accountability function follows assets from the time of their acquisition in one transaction until their disposition or use in another.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-uyeda-statement-rr-donnelley-061824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<p>After setting out the functions involved and the meaning of the terms used, the SAS then defines two distinct, chronological categories of controls: administrative controls and accounting controls. Administrative controls precede accounting controls and include &ldquo;the plan of organization and the procedures and records that are concerned with the decision processes leading to management&rsquo;s authorization of transactions.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-uyeda-statement-rr-donnelley-061824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;Accounting controls, in contrast, focus on the transactions themselves and &ldquo;are concerned with the safeguarding of assets and the reliability of financial records.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-uyeda-statement-rr-donnelley-061824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;To that end, the SAS sets out four objectives for effective internal accounting controls: &ldquo;to provide reasonable assurances that:</p>
<ol>
<li><i>Transactions</i>&nbsp;are executed in accordance with management&rsquo;s general or specific authorization.</li>
<li><i>Transactions</i>&nbsp;are recorded as necessary (1) to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles or any other criteria applicable to such statements and (2)&nbsp;<i>to maintain accountability for assets</i>.</li>
<li><i>Access to assets</i>&nbsp;is permitted only in accordance with management&rsquo;s authorization.</li>
<li>The recorded&nbsp;<i>accountability for assets</i>&nbsp;is compared with the&nbsp;<i>existing assets</i>&nbsp;at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-uyeda-statement-rr-donnelley-061824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></li>
</ol>
<p>The SAS&rsquo;s focus on creating and maintaining an accurate accounting for the use and disposition of assets in transactions makes clear that the objective of permitting &ldquo;access to assets . . . only in accordance with management&rsquo;s authorization&rdquo; is concerned not with all corporate assets, but rather with assets of a particular character&mdash;those that are the subject of corporate transactions.</p>
<p>The asset at issue in the Order&mdash;RRD&rsquo;s computer systems&mdash;does not have that essential characteristic. While RRD&rsquo;s computer systems constitute an asset in the sense of being corporate property, computer systems are not the subject of corporate transactions. At most, computer systems process transactions in corporate assets, but the internal accounting controls are concerned with the use and disposition of the corporate assets themselves. The controls associated with the means of processing transactions in corporate assets are more appropriately categorized as administrative controls involving management&rsquo;s decisions prior to authorizing transactions.</p>
<p>The Commission&rsquo;s 2018 report related to the intersection of cybersecurity and internal accounting controls is consistent with this essential distinction between categories of administrative controls and internal accounting controls.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-uyeda-statement-rr-donnelley-061824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>&nbsp;For example, one of the schemes involved &ldquo;using spoofed email domains and addresses&rdquo; to entice &ldquo;the companies&rsquo; finance personnel&nbsp;<i>to cause large wire transfers to foreign bank accounts</i>&nbsp;controlled by the perpetrators.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-uyeda-statement-rr-donnelley-061824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>&nbsp;In another scheme, &ldquo;[a]fter hacking the existing vendors&rsquo; email accounts, the perpetrators inserted [an] illegitimate request for payments (and payment processing details) into electronic communications&rdquo; and sent the issuer &ldquo;doctored invoices [that] reflected the new, fraudulent account information.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-uyeda-statement-rr-donnelley-061824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>&nbsp;As a result, the issuer &ldquo;<i>made payments on outstanding invoices to foreign accounts</i>&nbsp;controlled by the impersonator rather than the accounts of the real vendors.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-uyeda-statement-rr-donnelley-061824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>&nbsp;The common thread in the schemes is that they involved access to corporate cash. The internal accounting controls were deficient not because the payment processing systems were the means to execute transactions disposing of corporate assets; the internal accounting controls were deficient because outside actors were able to access the corporate cash through fraudulent transactions. In other words, the payment processing systems implicitly were understood to be distinct from the cash itself, and the internal accounting controls were those controls directly related to the transactions that ended in the disbursement of cash.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-uyeda-statement-rr-donnelley-061824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a></p>
<p>The Commission&rsquo;s order faulting RRD&rsquo;s internal accounting controls breaks new ground with its expansive interpretation of what constitutes an asset under Section 13(b)(2)(B)(iii). By treating RRD&rsquo;s computer systems as an asset subject to the internal accounting controls provision, the Commission&rsquo;s Order ignores the distinction between internal accounting controls and broader administrative controls. This distinction, however, is essential to understanding and upholding the proper limits of Section 13(b)(2)(B)&rsquo;s requirements.</p>
<p>Eliding the distinction between administrative controls and accounting controls has utility for the Commission. As this proceeding illustrates, a broad interpretation of Section 13(b)(2)(B) to cover computer systems gives the Commission a hook to regulate public companies&rsquo; cybersecurity practices. Any departure from what the Commission deems to be appropriate cybersecurity policies could be deemed an internal accounting controls violation. The Commission&rsquo;s assurances in connection with the recent cyber-disclosure rulemaking ring untrue if the Commission plans to dictate public company cybersecurity practices indirectly using its ever-flexible Section 13(b)(2)(B) tool. Also concerning is the Commission&rsquo;s decision to stretch the law to punish a company that was the victim of a cyberattack. While an enforcement action may be warranted in some circumstances, distorting a statutory provision to form the basis for such an action inappropriately amplifies a company&rsquo;s harm from a cyberattack.</p>

<div> Treasury International Capital, TIC data, April 2024, foreign acquisitions, U.S. securities<br />
Summary:<br />

Overall net purchases of long-term securities estimated at $123.1 billion. Foreign holdings of U.S. Treasury bills decreased by $10.0 billion, and banks' own net dollar-denominated liabilities to foreign residents decreased by $55.9 billion. <div>
<p>The U.S. Department of the Treasury today released Treasury International Capital (TIC) data for April 2024.&nbsp; The next release, which will report on data for May 2024, is scheduled for July 18, 2024.</p>
<p>The sum total in April of all net foreign acquisitions of long-term securities, short-term U.S. securities, and banking flows was a net TIC inflow of $66.2 billion. &nbsp;Of this, net foreign private inflows were $44.2 billion, and net foreign official inflows were $22.0 billion.</p>
<p>Foreign residents increased their holdings of long-term U.S. securities in April; their net purchases were $159.4 billion.&nbsp; Net purchases by private foreign investors were $127.5 billion, while net purchases by foreign official institutions were $31.9 billion.</p>
<p>U.S. residents increased their holdings of long-term foreign securities, with net purchases of $36.3 billion.</p>
<p>After including adjustments, such as estimated foreign portfolio acquisitions of U.S. stocks through stock swaps, overall net foreign purchases of long-term securities are estimated to have been $123.1 billion in April.</p>
<p>Foreign residents decreased their holdings of U.S. Treasury bills by $10.0 billion.&nbsp; Foreign resident holdings of all dollar-denominated short-term U.S. securities and other custody liabilities decreased by $1.0 billion.</p>
<p>Banks&rsquo; own net dollar-denominated liabilities to foreign residents&nbsp;decreased&nbsp;by $55.9 billion.</p>
<p>Complete data are available on the Treasury website at:</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3>ABOUT TIC DATA</h3>
<p>The monthly data on holdings of long-term securities, as well as the monthly table on Major Foreign Holders of Treasury Securities, reflect foreign holdings of U.S. securities collected primarily on the basis of custodial data.&nbsp; These data help provide a window into foreign ownership of U.S. securities, but they cannot attribute holdings of U.S. securities with complete accuracy.&nbsp; For example, if a U.S. Treasury security purchased by a foreign resident is held in a custodial account in a third country, the true ownership of the security will not be reflected in the data.&nbsp; The custodial data will also not properly attribute U.S. Treasury securities managed by foreign private portfolio managers who invest on behalf of residents of other countries.&nbsp; In addition, foreign countries may hold dollars and other U.S. assets that are not captured in the TIC data.&nbsp; For these reasons, it is difficult to draw precise conclusions from TIC data about changes in the foreign holdings of U.S. financial assets by individual countries.</p>

<div> inflation, monetary policy, economic outlook, productivity growth, labor market<br />
Summary: Inflation remains high but shows signs of improvement. Wage growth moderates, and labor market supply grows. Emerging technologies and entrepreneurship contribute to potential productivity growth. The current monetary policy stance appears restrictive but is expected to ease later this year. <div>
<p>Thank you for your introduction, Adam, and thank you for the invitation to speak here today. It is great to come to Peterson to discuss the economic outlook and monetary policy, which is my topic this afternoon.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240618a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a></p>
<p>As I stand here today, inflation remains too high, but I am encouraged by the overall progress and trajectory. Recent data on the economy and inflation also give me cautious optimism that we are on track and making continued headway toward the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) inflation goal of 2 percent. That progress may have paused in the first three months of the year, but information since then on economic activity, the labor market, and inflation points to renewed progress.</p>
<p>Over the last year through April, personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation was 2.7 percent, down from 7.1 percent at its peak in 2022. Core PCE inflation&mdash;which excludes the volatile food and energy categories&mdash;was 2.8 percent through April, down from its peak of 5.6 percent. Based on consumer and producer price inflation for May released last week, I estimate that 12-month PCE inflation in May was a bit lower than in April. I was encouraged by some of the details of the recent reports, particularly the continued improvement in market-based services inflation, which is based on observation of actual market prices rather than imputed values. That's important because market-based prices are likely to be a better indication of the overall trend for core services inflation than nonmarket prices.</p>
<p>Housing services inflation, meanwhile, continues to be persistent. Market rents for new tenant leases have already cooled significantly, but further progress in overall housing services inflation will rely on the ongoing pass-through of the previous market rents deceleration to the rents of existing tenants with expiring leases.</p>
<p>So inflation is still too high, and further progress is likely to be gradual. However, there are several reasons why I remain optimistic that improving supply and cooling demand will support continued disinflation.</p>
<p>The first reason I am optimistic about further progress on inflation has to do with declining price increases and even declining prices as consumers become more price sensitive. I think of this from several, related angles&mdash;I will mention a few.</p>
<p>As I have discussed in previous speeches, reduced frequency of price adjustments helps moderate prices. And the frequency with which firms adjust prices, which accelerated to less than every five months in early 2022, moved closer to every seven months as of the end of 2023.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240618a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;Price adjustment frequency picked up some early this year, along with the temporary firming of inflation, but the general trend has been consistent with ongoing disinflation.</p>
<p>An additional basis for price-setting optimism is the fact that longer-run inflation expectations have remained well anchored. Research by the Richmond Fed has found that price-setting decisions by firms are related to their own expectations about the path of overall inflation, so anchored inflation expectations among firms are likely to result in price setting consistent with those lower price expectations.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240618a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a></p>
<p>In addition, there may still be room for markups of prices over labor costs to continue falling. While markups are famously difficult to measure, rough, simple estimates of markups of prices over labor costs have fallen back from high levels but still remain above their pre-pandemic trend, especially in the goods sector.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240618a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;A return of markups to this trend could help ongoing progress toward 2 percent inflation.</p>
<p>A final factor for optimism about positive price-setting developments is the range of anecdotes from firms themselves. The most recent edition of the Fed's Beige Book suggests firms are increasingly attentive to consumers pushing back against additional price increases and that these businesses expect to increase prices only moderately in the near term. Beyond the Beige Book, I have gleaned from recent earnings reports by publicly traded companies that lower-income consumers are pulling back from their purchasing and that firms are responding by moderating price increases or, in some cases, actually cutting prices. What I have heard in my own conversations with business contacts is that consumers are "trading down" to lower-cost products and that firms are responding with more discounting. And some large retailers have publicly spoken about cutting prices in the face of resistant consumers. These various indicators&mdash;markups, price adjustment frequency, inflation expectations, and anecdotes from a range of sources&mdash;suggest that, on balance, price-setting behavior is likely to continue to move closer to consistency with the FOMC's inflation target.</p>
<p>A second reason for my optimism about continued disinflation is slower growth in the costs faced by businesses. Among those, nominal wages are a big part of total costs in the services sector. Nominal wage growth has continued to trend down, consistent with a labor market where supply and demand are coming into better balance. Of course, as a general matter, I want to see Americans experiencing strong wage growth, but for that wage growth to be sustainable, it must be consistent with our inflation target. Notably, as inflation has come down, real wages have been rising and now exceed pre-pandemic levels, which means that the purchasing power of workers has also been increasing. But at the same time, we have seen slowing growth in nominal labor costs. For example, the 12-month increase in average hourly earnings has been running just above 4 percent over the past couple of months after peaking at around 6 percent in 2022 and falling more or less steadily since then. The latest readings compare with an average of around 3 percent a year before the pandemic, when inflation was running below our 2 percent goal. Wage moderation is especially evident in some service sectors for which labor is a large share of costs. If this moderation in wage growth continues, it will soon be at levels consistent with price stability. And I note that the market-based services inflation measure I mentioned earlier tends to move closely with wage growth.</p>
<p>Other developments in labor markets also point toward continued resilience, but there are signs of gradual cooling and continued wage moderation. Gains in payrolls averaged 218,000 over the past two months, which is a solid pace. But most other indicators point to a slow but steady easing of the labor market, supported by cooling demand for hiring as well as strong supply.</p>
<p>In terms of demand, both the job openings rate and the hiring rate have come down from their highs of late 2021 and early 2022. The job opening rate is not far above its pre-pandemic range, and the hiring rate is below pre-pandemic. Surveys of business hiring intentions likewise suggest cooler demand for workers. On the supply side, we have seen notable growth in labor supply over the past year. Labor force participation among prime-age women, in particular, reached another all-time record in May. And the strong inflows of immigrants I have discussed in previous speeches have continued this year, which points to continued labor supply growth as recent immigrants gradually make their way into the labor market.</p>
<p>With cooling demand and solid supply, measures of labor market tightness have continued to ease. The unemployment rate has been gradually rising and reached 4 percent in May, still very low in historical terms and the 30th straight month at 4 percent or lower. Another indicator of labor market tightness, the ratio of job vacancies to the number of people counted as looking for work, crossed an important threshold in April. After rising as high as 2 vacancies for each person seeking a job during the pandemic, that ratio fell to 1.2, which was the level before the pandemic. Another indicator of labor market tightness, the rate of people voluntarily quitting their jobs, is actually below the pre-pandemic level. The average duration for job vacancies is down, and it is becoming easier for employers to fill jobs. We policymakers like to make our judgments based on a preponderance of the data, and a preponderance of the labor market data indicates that labor market supply and demand are coming into better balance.</p>
<p>A third reason for my optimism about achieving 2 percent inflation is that I am also cautiously optimistic about productivity growth, which is a source of supply expansion that is likely to put downward pressure on inflation without slower economic growth. One factor is the remarkable rise in the rate of new business creation, which started early in the pandemic and has continued, more or less, even through last month.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240618a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;Economic research finds that while many new and young firms struggle to survive, a small subset of new firms are highly productive and grow rapidly, eventually making significant contributions to aggregate productivity.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240618a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;And the pandemic-era business creation surge has been particularly strong in high-tech sectors, such as computer systems design and research and development services.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240618a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;Some recent history favors a payoff to productivity growth from this surge in entrepreneurship. Before the jump in productivity growth in the late 1990s through the early 2000s, there was a similar wave of strong business entries in high-tech industries.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240618a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a>&nbsp;I suspect that most of the productivity benefits of the recent entry surge are still ahead of us.</p>
<p>Another basis for productivity optimism is the prospect for widespread implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in its various forms. To be sure, there is tremendous uncertainty around the future path of AI and its effects on the economy, and we must all think carefully about how it may affect workers and the kinds of tasks they perform. But AI technology has the potential to make workers and firms more productive&mdash;effectively boosting aggregate supply. Of course, many technologies can take a long time to show through to aggregate productivity. The spread of electrification more than a century ago required complementary assets like power lines and appliances to be created and installed. But I suspect that AI may diffuse more quickly, in part because many of the complementary assets needed for the initial spread of AI&mdash;such as computers, networks, and the like&mdash;are already in place, even while there is still an enormous amount of additional hardware buildout still ahead of us. And survey data from the Census Bureau suggest that firms in many sectors are already employing AI.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240618a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;Only time will tell, of course, but the prospect of higher productivity growth raises the possibility that inflation can fall without a significant slowdown in economic activity and employment.</p>
<p>My fourth and final reason for optimism on inflation is that I believe the current stance of monetary policy is sufficiently restrictive to help cool the economy and bring inflation back toward 2 percent without a sharp contraction in economic activity or a significant deterioration of the labor market. Interest rates remain elevated relative to a year ago, and certainly relative to two or three years ago, and are restricting economic activity. Of course, some aspects of financial conditions, such as house prices and, especially, stock prices, remain robust; and credit is still generally available, though high interest rates make borrowing expensive. These factors likely have some distributional implications: Higher-income people with large stock portfolios may not feel that conditions are so restrictive, while lower earners who need to borrow to buy a house or a car do not need to be told that finances are tight.</p>
<p>But the overall restrictiveness of financial conditions is apparent in interest rate&ndash;sensitive sectors. For example, the level of residential investment in the first quarter&mdash;though showing some modest improvement relative to last year's pace&mdash;was still roughly 15 percent below its peak in 2021. Business investment in equipment contracted a bit in 2023 and showed only tepid growth in the first quarter of this year. And while consumption growth has been resilient over the past couple of years, fueled in part by excess savings accumulated during the pandemic and solid real wages that now exceed pre-pandemic levels, it slowed noticeably in the first quarter, especially for spending on goods. Indeed, high interest rates have left a mark on consumer assessments of buying conditions for motor vehicles and other large durable goods, which often have to be financed.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240618a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a></p>
<p>The effects of restrictive financial conditions are also evident in labor markets. As I discussed earlier, the labor market has cooled gradually, and, looking ahead, I expect some cooling of economic activity to continue. But I am watching closely for any signs of labor market deterioration that may take hold, as the FOMC also pays attention to the other side of our mandate.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding my optimism about the economic outlook, I am mindful of a number of risks to both sides of the dual mandate. On the inflation side, the resurgence of import prices at the beginning of the year is concerning, even if import prices came down some last month, and could anticipate greater pressure on goods prices in the coming months. Goods prices have been a key source of disinflation over the past year or so, as supply chains have healed. While supply chains appear to have been fairly resilient to a series of shocks since the end of last year&mdash;including attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and low water levels in the Panama Canal&mdash;geopolitical developments in Ukraine and the Middle East still could lead to a sharp rise in global energy and food prices and disrupt global supply chains. Another risk I am focused on is that a further cooling of the U.S. economy could lead to a sharp deterioration in labor market conditions. Output growth appears to have slowed in the first half of this year, and while consumer spending still grew in the first quarter, the May retail sales report we received this morning may be another signal that the long-expected deceleration in consumer spending may finally be upon us. After a considerable decline in job vacancies, firms facing decreasing demand might increasingly resort to laying off workers. Lastly, I also see risks to the global economy that could spill back to the U.S. economy. While growth in some countries&mdash;notably in Europe&mdash;appears to be picking up from a soft patch last year, that pickup remains tentative. And the latest data from China suggest that economic momentum there has slowed considerably amid a continuing real estate crisis.</p>
<p>Let me now turn to the implications of my economic outlook for monetary policy. While I remain cautiously optimistic that inflation is coming down, it is still too high, and it is moving down only slowly. I believe that policy has more work to do, which is why I supported the FOMC's decision last week to keep the federal funds rate in a range of 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent. We need to see more progress toward 2 percent inflation before I will have confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward that objective. For the reasons I have outlined today, I believe economic conditions are moving in the right direction. If the economy evolves as I am expecting, it will likely become appropriate to begin easing policy sometime later this year. But, as always, my judgment will be guided by the data.</p>
<p>Let me conclude by acknowledging that the surge in inflation over the past few years means that prices are now significantly higher than they were just a few years ago, even as the rate of price increases has slowed dramatically since mid-2022. While I am heartened by data showing that nominal wages are now growing at a faster rate than prices, I know many Americans are still struggling with high costs. I also know that many Americans are facing high borrowing costs. That's why I will be watching the data carefully in the months ahead to ensure that we are on track to achieve both sides of our dual mandate.</p>

<p><a name="fn1"></a>1. The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn2"></a>2. These facts are from Hugh Montag and Daniel Villar (2023), "<a href="https://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.3298">Price-Setting during the Covid Era</a>," FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, August 29). I thank the authors for providing me with updated data through early 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn3"></a>3. For research on firms' price-setting and inflation expectations, see Felipe F. Schwartzman and Sonya Ravindranath Waddell (2024), "<a href="https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/economic_brief/2024/eb_24-03#:~:text=Evidence%20from%20a%20Federal%20Reserve,most%20firms%20set%20their%20prices">Inflation Expectations and Price Setting among Fifth District Firms</a>," Economic Brief 24-03 (Richmond, Va.: Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, January). With regard to overall measures of inflation expectations, anchored longer-run inflation expectations are apparent in the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, where 5-to-10-year-ahead expectations remain close to values seen a decade ago; in the Survey of Professional Forecasters, where 10-year inflation expectations are close to pre-pandemic norms; and in other sources.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn4"></a>4. For example, the ratio of the producer price index (PPI) for final demand goods to the employment cost index for private goods industries rose roughly 20 percent from the end of 2020 to the middle of 2022. In services, this ratio rose roughly 5 percent. The ratios for both sectors have come down from their peak levels but were still above their end-2020 levels as of the first quarter of this year&mdash;and they had been on downward trends before the pandemic. Similar analysis using PCE prices instead of PPI yields a qualitatively similar result for goods industries, though, in services, the PCE price-to-wage ratio has been roughly flat.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="fn9"></a>9. Data are from the Census Bureau's Business Trends and Outlook Survey. In data released May 23, 2024, the share of firms reporting current AI usage was 18 percent in the information sector and 12 percent in the professional services sector. Several other sectors had shares at 5 percent or above.&nbsp;</p>

In the Michigan Surveys of Consumers, the net shares of respondents reporting that now is a bad time to buy, versus a good time to buy, motor vehicles or large household durables, specifically because of high interest rates, remain well above pre-pandemic levels, though there has been some gradual improvement since mid-2022.&nbsp;</p>

<title>US Office Of The Comptroller Of The Currency Report Highlights Key Risks In Federal Banking System</title>

<div> economic cycle, credit risk, market risk, operational risk, compliance risk
<br />
The OCC's report highlights increasing credit risk, market pressure on net interest margins, elevated operational risk due to cyber threats, and compliance challenges.
<br /><br />Summary: The OCC's report addresses increasing credit and market risk, as well as elevated operational and compliance risk, emphasizing the need for firmwide resilience efforts. <div>
<p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) today reported the key issues facing the federal banking system in its&nbsp;<em>Semiannual Risk Perspective for Spring 2024</em>.</p>
<p>The OCC reported that the overall condition of the federal banking system remains sound. However, the maturing economic cycle may cause consumer headwinds. It is important for banks to continue identifying material risks and their interconnected impacts. Continuous risk management improvement remains appropriate as this allows banks to guard against complacency.</p>
<p>The OCC highlighted credit, market, operational, and compliance risks, as the key risk themes in the report. Highlights from the report include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Credit risk is increasing. Commercial real estate sectors, primarily the office sector and some multifamily property types, are experiencing stress due to a higher rate environment and structural changes. Office and multifamily loans, particularly those with interest-only terms, set to refinance over the next three years pose additional risk. Sticky inflation and elevated interest rates may increase consumer financial stress in some households and weigh on overall consumption growth.</li>
<li>From a market risk perspective, net interest margins (NIMs) are under pressure due to strong deposit competition. Trends observed, however, indicate that pressure on funding costs and NIMs may be nearing a peak. The future direction, timing, and extent of rate movements and uncharted depositor behavior present risk management challenges. Wholesale funding usage continued to grow albeit at a slower pace going into 2024. Investment portfolio depreciation improved but unrealized losses remain elevated as banks continue to increase asset liquidity and interest rates remain elevated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Operational risk is elevated. The financial industry is responding to an evolving and increasingly complex operating environment. Cyber threats continue as malicious actors target the financial services industry and their key service providers with ransomware and other attacks. Increasing digitalization, new and innovative product and service adoption, and third-party use increase bank operating environment complexity creating both opportunities and risks. Continued check and wire transfer fraud and increased payment fraud incidents both underscore the importance of fraud risk management.</li>
<li>Banks are operating in a dynamic banking environment because of changing customer needs and preferences related to products, services, and delivery channels. Risks are compounded if products and services, including changes, are not delivered or implemented in a fair and equitable manner. It remains important for banks to maintain a compliance risk management framework that is commensurate with their risk profiles and capable of growing and evolving as their risk profiles change. Fraud continues to be significant risk for banks. Effective processes to prevent, identify and file suspicious activity reports on fraudulent activity in a timely manner remain important to protect both banks and consumers. As banks work to process checks and other payments in a safe, fair, and efficient manner, check and wire fraud, and P2P transaction scams have become more prevalent. The OCC continues to assess banks&rsquo; Community Reinvestment Act performance under the 1995/2021 regulatory framework.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The report highlights the necessity of firmwide resilience efforts as risks may be interconnected and events could simultaneously affect multiple risk categories. It is crucial that banks establish an appropriate risk culture that identifies potential risk, particularly before times of stress. Each stress event may vary (e.g., operational, liquidity, credit, compliance, and other) and resiliency implications need to be proactively considered. Prudent planning from a firmwide perspective can enhance a bank&rsquo;s ability to maintain operations, remain financially sound, and service customers in times of stress.</p>
<p>The report covers risks facing national banks, federal savings associations, and federal branches and agencies based on data as of December 31, 2023, unless otherwise indicated. The report presents information in four main areas: the special topic, operating environment, bank performance, and trends in key risks. The report focuses on issues that pose threats to those financial institutions regulated by the OCC and is intended as a resource to the industry, examiners, and the public.</p>

<div> SEC, securities regulation, capital markets, government intervention, market integrity<br />
Summary:<br />
SEC emphasizes the importance of capital markets, advocates for minimal government intervention, and highlights the significance of individual liberty and freedom.<br /> <div>
<p>Welcome to the final day of the SEC&rsquo;s 30<span>th</span>&nbsp;International Institute for Securities Market Growth and Development. Based on my perusal of the agenda, your curriculum has been interesting and exhausting. I am honored to spend a few minutes with such a remarkable gathering of people who share my passion for securities regulation. Before I begin, I will give you a disclaimer, which you might have heard many times before: My views are my own views as a Commissioner and not necessarily those of the SEC or my fellow Commissioners.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, we celebrated the SEC&rsquo;s 90<span>th</span>&nbsp;birthday. Nine decades of regulating the securities markets has taught us many lessons, and I hope that our staff has shared those lessons with you over the last week. These discussions were likely focused and technical, so I want to take a step back and think more broadly about securities regulation and why it matters so much.</p>
<p>A country&rsquo;s capital markets, by feeding the rest of the economy, can form the basis for its prosperity. These markets drive financing toward the people that need it to build or expand businesses and enable investors to share in the success of these businesses. If capital markets are working properly, a person need not be rich or have wealthy friends and relatives, to get the capital she needs to turn a brilliant idea into a successful business. The more people participate as investors and users of capital, the more effective the markets are at getting capital into the hands of people who can use it best. Widespread participation in the capital markets helps not only the investors and entrepreneurs themselves and the communities in which they live and work, but the broader economy. Well-functioning capital markets ensure that people can make the most of their talents. They also give investors an opportunity to invest in other people&rsquo;s talents.</p>
<p>The wonder of capital markets is heightened when one realizes that they are organic. Societies, when left to their own devices, create capital markets. Capital markets do not require much government intervention, let alone government orchestration. They are the quintessential market&mdash;very responsive to price signals, which in turn reflect what people want and how much they want it. Regulators need only establish and enforce a basic set of market integrity rules. The markets&mdash;through the voluntary interactions of participants&mdash;will do the rest. Regulators, even when seated on a central perch that allows them to observe what every market participant is doing, cannot replicate the ability of uncoordinated market participants to adjust rapidly and effectively to new marketplace dynamics.</p>
<p>In our nine decades of existence, US capital markets have grown in size and stature. These markets serve not only domestic investors and companies, but their global counterparts. The integrity of the markets is the key to their success. There is, of course, no guarantee that you will make money as an investor or get access to capital on the terms you want. But you can trust that the financial statements, issuer disclosures, and the financial professionals you encounter are accountable if they lie to you. The SEC has played an important role in setting the ground rules for our successful capital markets, but generally has avoided micro-managing them.</p>
<p>One classic government failure is to seek to influence capital flows in the &ldquo;right&rdquo; direction. Whether trying to shift capital toward politically favored companies or industries that are perceived to be particularly deserving, government decisions are dangerously distortive. These kinds of interventions damage the capital markets&rsquo; ability to serve the economy&rsquo;s most pressing needs by substituting the preferences of government officials for the preferences of the rest of the population. A handful of government decision-makers is simply no match for the multitude of decision-makers, each with access to a unique reserve of knowledge, that drives capital flows in a competitive free market. Less really is better for a capital markets regulator: facilitate the provision of material information to investors, police the markets for fraud and manipulative behavior, and set some basic investor protection rules for market intermediaries.</p>
<p>We regulators want to intervene. Often the inclination to intervene stems from good intentions. We want to protect people from bad actors and bad decisions and we want to neaten up messy markets. A contractual tweak here, a product prohibition there . . . we look for ways to &ldquo;make markets better.&rdquo; We, of course, must regulate the markets in the manner that our elected governments have chosen. When we have discretion, however, we should use restraint. If two market participants voluntarily agree on a transaction or relationship, we ought to be careful about stepping in between them to alter the terms of the arrangement or prohibit it altogether. We should have a good reason for inserting ourselves into markets: a clearly identified market failure that we have determined will not resolve on its own and can be solved by government intervention without causing something worse to happen. If we really take each element of that analysis seriously, government interventions will be rare and sometimes may take the form of eliminating the regulatory instigator of the market failure.</p>
<p>As important as capital markets are, a prerequisite for their effectiveness is the liberty of the people they serve. When people are free to make decisions for themselves and their families, markets work effectively to provide them with what they need. The dignity of each individual, as reflected in the right to make choices for herself and her family, is core to every aspect of a free society, including its capital markets. In that spirit, for those of you who are staying in DC tomorrow, join with us in celebrating Juneteenth, our country&rsquo;s second independence day. We will commemorate the day in 1865 on which 250,000 Americans in Texas finally were emancipated from slavery, thus ending that abhorrent practice in the United States and underscoring the inalienable right of all people to be free.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-30th-international-institute-061824#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Thank you and enjoy your final day of the Institute.</p>

<title>Ontario Securities Commission’s Investor Advisory Panel Releases 2023 Annual Report</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ontario-securities-commissions-investor-advisory-panel-releases-2023-annual-rep/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ontario-securities-commissions-investor-advisory-panel-releases-2023-annual-rep/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Investor Advisory Panel (the IAP) today released its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/sites/default/files/2024-06/iap_20240618-annual-rpt.pdf">2023 Annual Report<span>&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;summarizing its activities, submissions, consultations, and meetings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2023, the IAP focused on the importance of securities regulation continuing to prioritize investor protection in a way that effectively keeps pace with a rapidly shifting environment for retail investors.</p>
<p>The IAP looked at risks and opportunities for retail investors from the increasing digitalization of financial services, such as reliance on social media influencers for investing advice, the use of digital engagement practices by trading platforms, and the use of artificial intelligence (AI) by fraudsters including deepfakes. The IAP also considered the rapid expansion of alternative assets available to retail investors, such as crypto assets and privately placed alternative assets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The IAP reflects with great pride on our work in 2023 and looks forward in the year ahead to continuing to encourage the OSC to prioritize investor protection as the cornerstone of its multi-pronged mandate,&rdquo; said IAP Chair Ilana Singer. &ldquo;We remain committed to bringing forward issues and perspectives that will advance investor protection in Ontario, improve investor outcomes and enhance the investor experience.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The IAP&rsquo;s advice has focused on approaches to protect investors that are responsive to the increasing digitalization of financial services and that are informed by similar trends in other sectors and jurisdictions (domestically and internationally) and regulators&rsquo; responses to them. In particular, the IAP reiterated its strong support for what it considers to be key opportunities to enhance investor protection, including:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>evaluating the types of advice that could benefit do-it-yourself investors given the steady increase in the number of investors who trade on Order-Execution-Only platforms;</li>
<li>conducting a compliance review of finfluencers to determine whether measures are needed to regulate their conduct;</li>
<li>assessing the effect of the Client Focused Reforms on investors and measuring whether they are attaining their desired outcomes;</li>
<li>continuing to strengthen oversight of crypto trading platforms and focusing future efforts on addressing investors&rsquo; ease of access to alternative assets which are speculative and high-risk and strengthening oversight of those who provide such access;</li>
<li>bolstering consumer awareness of fraud risks and continuing to collaborate with peer regulators and agencies to address the evolving fraud landscape and impact on vulnerable investors; and</li>
<li>ensuring that any uses of the Designated Fund be seen to directly benefit investors and be assessed through an investor protection lens.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The IAP has also long regarded consumer dispute resolution as a critically important issue. The IAP commends securities regulators for their leadership in developing a binding authority proposal for the Ombudsman for Banking Services and Investments (OBSI) through a framework that is accessible, fair and efficient.</p>
<p><span>About the IAP</span><br />Comprised of up to nine members, the IAP is an advisory committee to the Ontario Securities Commission that solicits and represents the views of retail investors on the Commission&rsquo;s policy and rule-making initiatives. Members of the IAP are appointed for terms of up to two years, with possible reappointment for one additional term. See the 2023 Annual Report for biographies of IAP members.&nbsp;</p>

<title>Accountability In Executive Pay: Let’s Not Wait Until The Next Financial Crisis, SEC Commissioner Jaime Lizárraga, Washington D.C., June 17, 2024</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/accountability-in-executive-pay-lets-not-wait-until-the-next-financial-crisis/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good afternoon. It is great to be with all of you here today. &nbsp;I appreciate the opportunity to be a part of this event and would like to extend my sincere thanks to Americans for Financial Reform for the invitation. I am fortunate to have a long history of working with AFR and the other sponsors of today&rsquo;s event: Public Citizen, Institute for Policy Studies, AFL-CIO, AFSCME, and the Committee for Better Banks, spanning my time as a staffer for Chairman Barney Frank on the Financial Services Committee, and later in Speaker Pelosi&rsquo;s office &ndash; and especially during the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
<p>Today, in my current role as a Commissioner at the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission, I&rsquo;d like to offer my personal thoughts on an important provision of the Dodd-Frank Act that unfortunately, remains unfinished business.</p>
<p>Section 956 of that landmark legislation requires federal financial regulators, including the SEC, to promulgate a joint rulemaking prohibiting any type of incentive-based compensation arrangement that encourages inappropriate risks by a covered financial institution. This includes compensation structures that (1) provide officers, directors, and employees with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits, or (2) could lead to material financial losses.</p>
<p>One of the criticisms we sometimes hear is that our rulemakings represent a solution in search of a problem. That is anything but the case with this rule. It has been well documented that in the lead up to the financial crisis, pay structures often encouraged big bets that maximized short-term profits but ignored bigger longer-term risks that threatened to take down our entire financial system. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And when the financial crisis hit, working families paid the price, with trillions of dollars of losses in hard-earned wealth in just a few short years.&nbsp; In fact, between 2007 and 2011, one fourth of American families lost at least 75 percent of their wealth, and more than half of all families lost at least 25 percent of their wealth. Unemployment peaked at 10 percent, and home values dropped by an average of 20 percent. Families&rsquo; hard-earned nest eggs, their kids&rsquo; college savings, and their rainy-day fund for medical and other emergencies disappeared almost overnight. Millions experienced home foreclosures and taxpayers funded massive bailouts.</p>
<p>Former SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro told the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission that: &ldquo;Many major financial institutions created asymmetric compensation packages that paid employees enormous sums for short-term success, even if these same decisions result in significant long-term losses or failure for investors and taxpayers.&rdquo;<a name="_Hlk169211594"></a></p>
<p>The bipartisan Senate subcommittee investigating the origins of the financial crisis found that lenders created compensation incentives that valued speed and volume over quality when it came to originating loans.</p>
<p>As an illustration of just how broken the system had become, even the former chief risk officer for home loans at the now defunct lender Washington Mutual had a 2007 performance evaluation that placed the growth of home loans as her number one performance goal for the year, a goal that included specific sales targets.</p>
<p>And in April 2009, the predecessor to the Financial Stability Board released its Principles for Sound Compensation Practices, which noted that &ldquo;Multiple surveys find that over 80 percent of market participants believe that compensation practices played a role in promoting the accumulation of risks that led to the current crisis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although fifteen years have elapsed since these events, the lessons they offer do not recede with the passage of time. If they do, history shows that we will be doomed to see a repeat of the same problems again.</p>
<p>Now some have argued that, even if there was a need for this rule at one point, it&rsquo;s no longer needed today.</p>
<p>But this is not how Congressional&nbsp;<i>mandates&nbsp;</i>work. Of 330 rulemaking provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act, only 148 were mandatory. And of those, only 22 had a deadline of less than a year after enactment. Section 956 was one of them.</p>
<p>And just because the SEC has implemented other mandatory Dodd-Frank rulemakings over the years, including reforms to make compensation committees more independent, allowing shareholders to have their voice heard through say-on-pay votes, clawing back erroneously awarded compensation, and requiring companies to tell shareholders about the relationship between pay and performance, that doesn&rsquo;t mean we don&rsquo;t need this one.</p>
<p>Different rules have different functions. Some are about transparency and disclosure, others about good governance hygiene, or holding bad actors accountable. And while supervising financial institutions and conducting exams are essential, it helps to have clear bright line rules, and not just principles-based concepts.</p>
<p>Section 956 is about ensuring sound compensation practices that ensure there is sensitivity to downside risks. It will benefit investors and contribute to the financial stability of our very interconnected system. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And to dispel some myths about what this provision isn&rsquo;t about: it isn&rsquo;t about naming-and-shaming executives or going after small community institutions. It&rsquo;s not about the government trying to set executive pay, and it&rsquo;s not about rank-and-file employees.</p>
<p>Finally, the regional banking crisis our country experienced last year, with the failures of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank, again illustrates why this rule is so essential.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve Board&rsquo;s April 2023 report examining the factors that contributed to SVB&rsquo;s failure found that its compensation packages for senior management were tied to short-term earnings and did not include any risk metrics, which may have contributed to an excessive focus on growth and short-term profitability at the expense of effective risk management. We&rsquo;ve seen this movie before and I commend our banking regulators and the Treasury Department for moving swiftly to contain the damage and avoid a wider crisis of confidence throughout the sector.</p>
<p>With over thirteen years past the mandatory deadline set by Congress, this rulemaking is long overdue but encouraging to see on our agency&rsquo;s short-term agenda. This is a joint rulemaking with a number of our sister agencies so it will take a lot of cooperation and coordination, but I am hopeful we can get there.</p>
<p>One of the three pillars of the SEC&rsquo;s mission is to protect investors, and implementing this rule will do just that. It will also contribute to reducing the excessive risk-taking that could prevent, or reduce the adverse impact of, a future financial crisis. Thank you again for the opportunity to share a few thoughts with you today. I look forward to learning from each of the panelists and from the ensuing discussion.</p>

<title>ESAs Propose Improvements To The Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: ESAs, Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation, green transition, consumer protection, greenwashing<br />
Summary: 
The ESAs published an assessment of the SFDR, recommending clear product categories, a sustainability indicator, improved disclosures, and consumer testing. They also offer support to the European Commission.<br /> <div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The three European Supervisory Authorities (EBA, EIOPA and ESMA &ndash; ESAs) today published a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-06/JC_2024_06_Joint_ESAs_Opinion_on_SFDR.pdf">joint Opinion</a>&nbsp;on the assessment of the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR). The ESAs call for a coherent sustainable finance framework that caters for both the green transition and enhanced consumer protection, taking into account the lessons learned from the functioning of the SFDR.</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The ESAs focus on ways to introduce simple and clear categories for financial products. The simplifications consist of two voluntary product categories, &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo; and &ldquo;transition&rdquo;, that financial market participants should use to ensure consumers understand the purpose of the products. The rules for the categories should have a clear objective and criteria to reduce greenwashing risks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ESAs recommend that the European Commission consider the introduction of a sustainability indicator that would grade financial products such as investment funds, life insurance and pension products.</p>
<p>In addition, the Opinion also covers the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>appropriate disclosures for products outside the two categories to reduce greenwashing,</li>
<li>improvements to the definition of sustainable investments,</li>
<li>simplification to the way disclosures are presented to investors,</li>
<li>other technical suggestions including on which products should fall under the scope of SFDR and on how to improve disclosures regarding the negative impact of investments on people and the environment, and</li>
<li>the need for&nbsp;consumer testing before putting forward any policy proposals to review the SFDR, such as to introduce a categorisation system and/or an indicator.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span>Background</span></h4>
<p>The ESAs deliver this Opinion on their own initiative. The Opinion is published in the context of a comprehensive review of the SFDR framework by the European Commission, which includes the SFDR regulation and&nbsp;<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2022/1288/oj">Delegated Regulation</a>. Going forward, the ESAs are ready to support the European Commission in future policy considerations on any review of the SFDR framework.</p>

HKEX plans to implement Severe Weather Trading (SWT) from 23 September 2024, subject to regulatory approval.</span><span class="eop spanHeading">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="paragraph spanHeading"><span class="normaltextrun spanHeading">HKEX is today (Tuesday) publishing the conclusions from a consultation paper on the Proposal on Severe Weather Trading of Hong Kong&nbsp;</span><span class="normaltextrun spanHeading">S</span><span class="normaltextrun spanHeading">ecurities and&nbsp;</span><span class="normaltextrun spanHeading">D</span><span class="normaltextrun spanHeading">erivatives Markets.

<p class="paragraph spanHeading"><span class="normaltextrun spanHeading">To ensure safety, remote working and the use of online services are strongly encouraged on a SWT day, and no public-facing physical outlets will provide services.

<p class="paragraph spanHeading"><span class="normaltextrun spanHeading">HKEX Chief Executive Officer, Bonnie Y Chan, said: &ldquo;Hong Kong&rsquo;s markets will remain open and operational during severe weather conditions.

<p class="paragraph spanHeading"><span class="normaltextrun spanHeading">To allow small-and-medium-sized brokers adequate preparation time, HKEX plans to offer special arrangements to eligible participants requiring assistance, for example by temporarily fulfilling margin payment or settlement obligations for these participants on a SWT day. These participants will be subject to trading restrictions on the SWT Day and will need to complete their unfulfilled obligations after the&nbsp;</span><span class="normaltextrun spanHeading">severe weather</span><span class="normaltextrun spanHeading">&nbsp;</span><span class="normaltextrun spanHeading">signals</span><span class="normaltextrun spanHeading">&nbsp;are lowered.&nbsp;The above special arrangements will be in place from the SWT effective date until the end of 2024.

Investors are also advised to consult their brokers and banks about the availability of services during SWT.</span><span class="eop spanHeading"></span></p>
<p class="paragraph spanHeading"><span class="normaltextrun spanHeading">In consultation with the HKSAR Government, HKEX has recommended best practices on severe weather work arrangements for employers and their employees. Certain clarifications have also been made in the conclusions paper in relation to market operations such as listing, trading, clearing and settlement arrangements during a SWT day.</span><span class="eop spanHeading"></span></p>
<p class="paragraph spanHeading"><span class="normaltextrun spanHeading">HKEX, along with the Securities and Futures Commission and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, and with the support of the HKSAR Government, formed a Severe Weather Trading Task Force (Task Force) in 2023 to seek industry views on trading under severe weather conditions and to engage in discussions beyond trading arrangements.

<div> SET, Thailand, sustainability, net-zero, ESG<br />
<br />Summary:<br />SET Sustainability Forum promotes Thai businesses' readiness for net-zero transition and resilience, featuring global climate finance experts and practical guidelines. <div>
<p>Embracing the urgency for sustainable and inclusive transition, the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) plays a pivotal role in propelling the Thai private sector towards net zero goals. Today, SET ESG Academy successfully hosted the SET Sustainability Forum 2/2024: Scaling up Synergies and Solutions for Net-Zero.&nbsp;This influential gathering brought together government agencies, business leaders, and capital market stakeholders from both local and international spheres to exchange insights and collaborate on advancing the Thai business sector across the entire supply chain.</p>
<p>The forum focused on empowering Thai businesses&rsquo; readiness to navigate uncertainties, foster robust growth, accelerate their science-based journey towards achieving net zero targets, and pursue long-run resilience. By aligning the quality of ESG data with international standards, the SET Sustainability Forum aims to unleash the potential of the Thai business sector and secure a prominent presence on the global stage, enabling the environment to compete on a global scale.</p>
<p>Highlighting the importance of robust corporate governance and resilience,&nbsp;<b>SET Senior Executive Vice President Soraphol Tulayasathien&nbsp;</b>emphasized the need to withstand volatility, be ready against incoming uncertainties, and seize future opportunities. Together with various sectors, SET is committed to preparing Thai businesses for the transition by uplifting ESG data toward global standards, increasing business integrity, and rebuilding&nbsp;trust. This collaborative effort reinforces global investor confidence and aligns with SET's determination to shape the future as approaching its 50th anniversary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Both shared their perspectives on the global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions crisis and presented science-based solutions to address the problem, such as carbon market and carbon credits. These agreed solutions can accelerate concrete climate actions toward Net-Zero, as well as deliver positive impacts across economic, social, and environmental aspects. The next discussions centered actions taken by&nbsp;the government and capital market regulatory agencies as an ecosystem to support Thai corporations in reducing corporate emissions in line with international practices.&nbsp;<b>The Second half started by the keynot</b><b>e,</b><b>&nbsp;Thai Bond Market Association President Somjin Sornpaisarn</b>&nbsp;highlighted ways to facilitate businesses' access to finance or international funding sources through capital market, and ended the event by portraying the adoption of financial mechanisms to ensure a sustainable transition and resilience throughout the supply chain, against future crises.</p>

<div> Derivatives, Global Markets, Competition, Tokenization, European Markets
<br />
Our industry faces political shifts, but is experiencing growth, competition, and technological advancements. There are opportunities for CMU development in the EU.
<br /><br />Summary: Derivatives industry faces political shifts, but is experiencing growth, competition, and technological advancements. Opportunities for CMU development in the EU. <div>
<p>Welcome to the International Derivatives Expo or what we affectionately call IDX. If you can believe it, this is our 16th year of hosting this fantastic conference!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />IDX brings together the entirety of the global derivatives markets to discuss developments and challenges facing this industry, with a special focus on Europe. It's also wonderful to be here in London, one of the greatest cities in the world!&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />As we gather here at IDX, we are going through an incredibly uncertain time. 2024 will see half the world heading to the polls in what is set to be a historic election year.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Two weeks ago, the EU elections saw the conservatives and centre-right groups gain ground, leading French President Macron to call for a snap election later this summer. Here in the UK, the Labour party is expected to sweep into power when elections are held on 4 July. And we have that boring election in the US where Americans will elect an unpopular President in November, no matter who is elected.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />These political shifts will undoubtedly increase volatility and uncertainty in global affairs and markets. With the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, as well as growing western tensions with China and Iran, it is likely that markets will reflect this uncertainty for the foreseeable future.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />But despite these constant negative headlines, there are many reasons to be optimistic about our industry. Today I want to talk about some of these good news stories that are happening right now in our markets.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Keep on Growing&nbsp;</strong><br />Take volumes and growth. Last year the number of futures and options traded on exchanges worldwide hit a record level of 137 billion contracts.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Last year&rsquo;s trading volume was 64% higher than the year before, and more than double the total number of contracts that traded in 2021. Our markets today trade more contracts in one month than our industry did in an entire year 20 years ago!&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />We may not like the heightened political tensions right now, but our markets were built for this moment. During these times of volatility, our products help investors and institutions manage risk and reduce the economic fallout from this turmoil.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />All around the world &ndash; whether in London, Paris, New York, Chicago, Singapore or developing regions like India, Brazil, and Dubai &ndash; our story is one of global growth.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />One traditional asset class that is thriving is energy. Two years ago, Europe was reeling from supply shocks brought on by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Energy prices surged to record highs.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Fast forward to today and energy markets have adjusted. Europeans have found new sources of supply, invested in renewable energy, and become more energy efficient. As a result, energy prices have come down.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />This was not because of price controls or government regulation. It was because our markets sent powerful pricing signals that changed behavior.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Today Europeans use 20% less natural gas than they did in 2021. And for the first time in 2023, electricity generated from renewables overtook electricity derived from fossil fuels in the EU. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Pricing signals from our markets helped drive this change in supply and demand for the better. Now that&rsquo;s powerful and worth bragging about.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Ain't No Mountain High Enough</strong><br />A second reason to be optimistic about our industry is heightened competition. I don&rsquo;t know about you, but this feels like the most competitive environment our industry has experienced in a couple of decades.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />We have existing and startup exchanges challenging each other with novel ideas and new models. We have transformative technologies that could revolutionize how markets work. And we have innovative products that promise to drive growth well into the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Here in Europe, there are fierce battles among exchanges in the equity options space, the power and gas markets and the ESTRs futures markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />In the US, the Treasury and repo clearing mandate has lit a fire in the interest rate markets. FICC, CME, ICE, LCH and FMX are all putting forward offerings to improve this $27 trillion Treasury market.&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition drives us to do better, to modernize and to become more cost efficient. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />That is why FIA champions responsible innovation and fair competition through initiatives like our Expo Innovators Pavilion and the awarding of an annual Innovator of the Year to a deserving startup.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />We all benefit from this enhanced competitive environment. And that is why I remain optimistic about our industry right now.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Blinded Me with Science&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br />A third reason I&rsquo;m feeling positive is the transformative technologies that are beginning to impact our markets for the better. One such promising technology is tokenization. It has the potential to revolutionize how our markets work by digitizing the settlement of trades.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Fifteen years ago, the G20 nations put forward our markets as a model of reform after the financial crisis. In doing so, they cited the importance of clearing &ndash; the process that provides our markets a safe and transparent way for trades to settle. This is ensured through the daily collection of margin and collateral to guard against default.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />This settlement process works well but has room for modernization. The workflow of clearing and margining requires a coordinated ballet of market participants working together to make sure the right money and assets are moved to the right account on the right day.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />But what happens when trading moves to 24/7 beyond banking hours?&nbsp; What happens when a settlement cycle falls on a bank holiday and margin cannot be collected from clients?&nbsp; If clearing and settlement cannot run, risk builds in the system where it is not expected.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Are there ways to simplify and modernize this process to avoid these risk anomalies?&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />One solution may be tokenization. Tokenizing cash and collateral would allow us to move margin and settle trades faster and safer, lowering the risk of defaults disrupting our markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />This would allow us to settle trades on public holidays or during extended trading hours, making our markets more efficient and safer.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />The good news is there is a lot of work being done on this concept and it&rsquo;s worth our industry paying close attention. Recent public-private initiatives by central banks, regulators and market participants show great promise for developing standards and approaches for tokenizing assets.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />These are exciting developments that our industry must embrace. This is another reason we should be optimistic about our future.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Crossroads&nbsp;</strong><br />Clearly, not everything is as doom and gloom as it seems. There is a real opportunity to continue to grow our markets and make them more competitive in Europe and beyond.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />This is also an opportune time to take stock and examine the goal of developing a strengthened Capital Markets Union in the EU. FIA and its members strongly support developing more choices for capital formation and investment wherever clients need funding for growth, including the EU.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />That said, we find ourselves at a crossroads. The further development of the CMU requires many ingredients, including a sound and proportional regulatory framework, a harmonised insolvency structure, and, importantly, strong incentives for citizens and institutions to want to invest their savings in European companies.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Unfortunately, many companies find doing business in the EU complicated and burdensome.&nbsp;<br /><br />Today FIA and Acuiti are&nbsp;<a href="https://email.fia.org/c/12bXklZiBAWknb4a4aP6jYGucLqRqA">releasing a survey&nbsp;</a>on the state of the European markets, which speaks to this point. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />When asked, 53% of market participants believe that regulatory burdens are the biggest challenge to growing the derivatives business over the next five years.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Forty percent of respondents do not believe that EU regulations are proportionate to the risks of their activity.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />The survey also shows that more companies are looking outside Europe, rather than internally, for client growth of their business.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Such concerns around balkanization are also echoed by others within the EU, including prominent European political leaders. Several have noted that entrepreneurs and businesses face significant red tape, fragmentation and costs due to overlapping regulations and administrative complexities in the EU.<br />&nbsp;<br />Moving to a more simple, centralized and proportional set of rules could incentivize investors to unlock the $33 trillion of savings currently sitting in EU deposits.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Without this untapped investment, the EU economy is at risk of falling further behind in a fiercely competitive world. But if these funds can be put to productive use, it will fuel European growth and offer significant opportunities for our industry on the continent.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />The EU plans to prioritize the completion of a CMU once the new Commission and Parliament are formed. And if they can get this right, with a balanced approach of incentives and fit-for-purpose regulations, the EU has a real shot of strengthening its capital markets and creating a culture of investing. This would be a boon for our global economy and markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>This is the End&nbsp;</strong><br />In closing, I want to reiterate my optimism for this industry. Afterall, this is the time of year for renewal and hope as many young students from around the world graduate from schools and universities. My daughter is one of those graduates, so I have been listening to many speeches advising students on the keys to fulfilment, success and happiness in life.&nbsp;<br /><br />A common theme is the importance of giving back to others and thinking beyond yourself to serve a greater cause.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />When I think about my own happiness, it is when I feel a part of a greater good&mdash;when I have worked with smart people who earnestly are trying to help others and build something meaningful.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I witness this all the time in our industry. One thing I love about our markets is we are always ready to roll up our sleeves when it matters to help the community.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Like seeing a backlog in trades at the start of Covid and our membership creating the standards body DMIST to address it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Or facing a major cyberattack last year and industry volunteers coming together to overcome the incident and prepare for the next attack.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Or even seeing injustice and a lack of opportunities among our youth and individuals from our community deciding to get involved with Futures for Kids and its Gala to raise money for this important cause.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Specifically, I want to give a shoutout to one such individual, SGX&rsquo;s Rama Pillai. Rama decided to take on the Kilt Challenge for Futures for Kids this year, more than doubling the record by raising &pound;60,000 pounds for this charity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />These are the human good news stories of the futures industry that I see all the time. It comes in the form of selfless acts of volunteers who give back, even when no one is looking.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />So, when you feel overwhelmed by the negative news that bombards us all day long, I challenge you to not retreat, but to combat it by giving back. Put positivity back into the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />It is this basic human interaction that connects us all and brings us happiness and joy. And I&rsquo;m humbled to be associated with an industry that comes together in times of troubles to solve problems for the greater good. That is the greatest good news story of them all.&nbsp;</p>

<div> Europe, growth, innovation, regulatory burden, interest rates, energy

Optimism for growth and innovation in Europe, but firms see more potential growth outside Europe. Regulatory burden, Brexit aftermath, cyber risk, and growth opportunities identified.<br /><br />Summary: Europe's derivatives industry sees growth potential but also challenges in regulation, Brexit aftermath, and cyber risks. Energy and interest rates have the most growth potential. <div>
<ul>
<li>
<h5><em>Report based on survey of market participants conducted by Acuiti</em></h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5><em>Report finds optimism regarding growth and innovation in Europe, but many firms see more growth potential in other parts of the world</em></h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5><em>Report finds that regulatory burden is widely viewed as a major challenge</em></h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5><em>Report finds interest rates and energy are the asset classes with the greatest potential for growth in trading volume over the next five years</em></h5>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FIA today released a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fia.org/sites/default/files/2024-06/State%20of%20the%20European%20Derivatives%20Market_June2024.pdf">report</a>&nbsp;on the challenges and opportunities facing the European listed derivatives markets. The report is based on responses to a survey conducted recently by Acuiti, a market intelligence firm, that gauged industry sentiment regarding the key trends, opportunities and challenges facing the industry in Europe.</p>
<p>Acuiti surveyed more than 100 individuals at a variety of firms active in Europe, including clearing brokers, asset managers, hedge funds, principal trading firms, exchanges and software vendors. The survey asked for opinions on current trends as well as the outlook for the next five years.</p>
<p>The survey found that the industry is optimistic about the potential for growth and innovation in Europe, but also aware that other parts of the world may offer better growth prospects. The survey also found a high level of concern about existing and prospective regulations as well as the aftereffects of Brexit.</p>
<p>The key trends identified in this report are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Global ambitions: Many firms see more potential growth in terms of clients and trading volume outside of Europe than inside Europe.</li>
<li>Regulatory headwinds: There is a broad consensus across the industry that the combined impact of multiple sets of regulations has created a major burden for the industry.</li>
<li>Brexit aftermath: Most listed derivatives market participants see Brexit as having a negative effect on London's stature as a global financial center and predict that Paris will be the European financial center with the greatest growth potential over the next five years.</li>
<li>Cyber risk: The threat of disruption from cyber-attack was identified as the single greatest risk that the industry is currently facing.</li>
<li>Growth opportunities: Futures and options based on interest rates and energy were viewed as having the greatest growth potential over the next five years. Crypto and carbon also look attractive to many firms, although a sizeable number of survey respondents said their firms have no intention of entering these new asset classes.</li>
<li>Efficiency vs Innovation: Views on technology trends vary significantly across the industry. Clearing brokers and other sell-side firms are prioritizing gains in efficiency from their investments in technology. In contrast, principal trading firms and exchanges are more interested in innovative new technologies such as artificial intelligence and blockchain.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"This report provides an important window into how the European listed derivatives industry views the major challenges and opportunities in the years ahead," said Bruce Savage, FIA Head of Europe. "We look forward to working with European policy makers and the industry on ways to leverage the findings of this report and accelerate the growth of European markets."</p>
<p>"To better serve the exchange-traded and cleared derivatives markets, FIA is keenly interested in understanding the dynamics of growth and innovation at both the regional and global level," said Walt Lukken, FIA President and CEO. "Many of our most important members are based in Europe, and we are delighted to partner with Acuiti on this initiative to understand how the industry sees the outlook for this region."</p>
<p>&ldquo;Market participants within Europe are optimistic about their growth prospects and the future of European derivatives markets, however, many are looking outside Europe for client growth,&rdquo; said Will Mitting, Founder and Managing Director of Acuiti. &ldquo;Fragmented markets are increasing the costs of trading in Europe while regulation is hampering many firms&rsquo; ability to commit capital to expansion. For Europe to fully realise its potential, it is essential that these issues are addressed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The report is being released in conjunction with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fia.org/fia/events/international-derivatives-expo">International Derivatives Expo (IDX)</a>, FIA's annual conference and trade show in London. IDX brings together more than 1,000 executives from clearing firms, trading firms, exchanges and technology providers for three days of discussions on the most critical issues related to the cleared derivatives industry in Europe.</p>

<title>The Payments Association Echoes Industry Calls For Policymakers And The Fintech Sector To Support Consumers With Community Finance</title>

<div> Financial resilience, community finance, credit unions, regulatory barriers, financial inclusion
<br />
The Payments Association highlights barriers to community finance growth and proposes policy recommendations to improve access and support for financially underserved communities.
<br /><br />Summary: Financial resilience, community finance, credit unions, regulatory barriers, and financial inclusion are addressed in The Payments Association's call for support. <div>
<ul>
<li><em>12.9 million adults (one in four) in the UK have low financial resilience and a record 6.7 million are now in severe financial difficulty.</em></li>
<li><em>The Payments Association&rsquo;s &ldquo;Redefining Community Finance: Unlocking Pathways to Financial Inclusion&rdquo; whitepaper highlights the role of community finance organisations in expanding access to financially underserved communities across the UK.</em></li>
<li><em>The paper identifies barriers like limited reach due to language barriers and biases, and common bond requirements, as well as stifling regulations designed for larger institutions.</em></li>
<li><em>The paper proposes policy recommendations which have been crafted following extensive conversations with experts across academia, the industry, the third sector and regulators, as well as a review of other studies which have looked at how the community finance sector can help tackle financial exclusion.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><br /> With millions of people in the UK struggling to access affordable financial services, The Payments Association is calling attention to underutilised solutions including community finance options like credit unions. The association&rsquo;s newly released paper: "<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://usw2.nyl.as/t1/207/c6zntaoi6ajqd3ukoj60b45fd/1/2e44cbbf0477021345650bb651d6cb638d08e55e894e536994e8cef700f100dc" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Redefining Community Finance: Unlocking Pathways to Financial Inclusion</em></a>" highlights the potential of these institutions but also the significant barriers hindering their growth.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Payments Association's Financial Inclusion Working Group has the specific purpose to inform and collaborate with government, regulators and third sector bodies, providing clarity on innovations and solutions in payments that can reduce financial exclusion and the poverty premium. It seeks to achieve this by collaborating with industry bodies, developing thought-leadership campaigns, and informing regulatory and legislative decisions.</p>
<p>The FCA estimates one in four UK adults have low financial resilience &ndash; meaning they don&rsquo;t have enough savings or resources to cover unexpected expenses without significantly impacting their standard of living. The Debt Justice reports a record 6.7 million Britons in severe financial difficulty. A greater public understanding of community finance could be the answer, but it needs support.</p>
<h4><strong>The specific problems</strong></h4>
<p>The whitepaper identifies several hurdles. The first step towards prompting greater private and public sector buy-in, attracting investment to the sector, and reaching more consumers is to reassess and redefine the &lsquo;brand&rsquo; of community finance. There needs to be a distinction between credit and debt. There is a tendency to talk about finances as &lsquo;debt&rsquo; for subprime borrowers, while it is &lsquo;credit&rsquo; for those classed as prime borrowers. These nuances matter as they serve to reinforce stereotypes.</p>
<p>Additionally, the traditional geographic definition of "community" limits their reach. The paper proposes broadening the definition to encompass shared values or experiences, citing successful examples like Sibstar, a debit card designed for dementia patients. By leveraging these connections, community finance can serve a wider range of underserved consumers.</p>
<p>Regulatory pressures further complicate matters. Community finance providers face the same regulations as large institutions despite having fewer resources.</p>
<h4><strong>The Payments Association&rsquo;s call to action</strong></h4>
<p>They recommend establishing a dedicated "sandbox" environment where community lenders and technology providers can collaborate and develop innovative solutions. Additionally, the government should learn from successful initiatives in other countries, such as Credit Union Service Organisations (CUSOs) in the US.</p>
<p>A fairer regulatory framework that acknowledges the unique mission of community finance organisations is also needed. This can be coupled with business rate relief and a kitemark system to signify trust and quality.</p>
<p>Finally, to encourage engagement from mainstream financial institutions, targeted investments, levies, mentorship programs, and improved signposting initiatives could be explored. Collaboration between community finance providers and regulators is also crucial to navigate the common bond challenge and share successful solutions across the sector. By implementing these recommendations, the potential of community finance could be unlocked and empower financially underserved communities.</p>
<p><strong>Tony Craddock, Director General of The Payments Association</strong>, said:<strong>&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;</em></strong><em>Financial inclusion remains critically important, with a staggering number of people in this country still struggling to access financial services. Community finance providers, such as credit unions and Community Development Finance Institutions, play a vital role in bridging this gap. However, the sector faces significant barriers to growth, including negative perceptions, limited resources, and regulatory burdens. We hope policymakers realise the enormity of this issue and take our recommendations on board.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong>Pooja Bhachu, Chair of the Payments Association's Financial Inclusion Working Group and Director, Public Policy, UK &amp; Ireland, Mastercard,</strong>&nbsp;wrote the foreword to the paper - commenting:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;At both Mastercard and The Payments Association, we advocate for a society where equal access leads to equitable opportunity for everyone. This whitepaper is a call to action for the financial services industry, policymakers, and innovators to come together and build a more inclusive financial system."</em></p>
<p><strong>Neil Harris, Chair of The Payments Association&rsquo;s Advisory Board,&nbsp;</strong>said:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Community finance organisations are doing enormously important work serving the underserved, but all too often they lack the resources and support to effectively carry out this mission at the scale that is needed. It is clear what a powerful tool for financial inclusion that community finance can be, but it needs a collective effort from government, policymakers, the finance industry, and technology providers to support this sector to thrive.&rdquo;</em></p>

<title>SIX Launches New Global Equity Indices</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/six-launches-new-global-equity-indices/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/six-launches-new-global-equity-indices/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> global equity indices, financial institutions, API technology, client experience, market representation
<br />
Summary: 
SIX launches global equity indices for financial institutions, using API technology to enhance the client experience and provide market representation. Exciting innovations anticipated. <div>
<p><span>The global financial information provider SIX has launched today a family of global equity indices designed specifically for the retail, private banking, and asset management sector. This marks the company&rsquo;s latest move in its push to further strengthen its position as a global index and data provider.</span></p>
<div class="textimage ">
<div>
<div>
<p>The new indices come in response to the growing appetite from financial institutions to gain a clearer view of the stocks and markets in which their clients&rsquo; money is invested, as well as their performance. Beyond empowering financial institutions to provide customers with a simple, digital portal through which to view their equities investments, the new offering will significantly reduce the administrative burden for many existing clients of SIX. Rather than subscribing to several sources, SIX can provide access to equivalent indices with reduced administrative overhead.</p>
<p>In addition, the use of API technology by SIX means financial institutions can offer additional data sets to customers like real-time pricing information surrounding a given equity, along with more granular detail on its performance. Financial institutions will also not need to interact with multiple index and data providers any longer in order to be able to offer these services to their customers.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.six-group.com/en/products-services/financial-information/indices/global.html" target="_blank">SIX Global Equity Indices</a>&nbsp;comprise the SIX World and the SIX Broad &amp; Blue-Chip Indices. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.six-group.com/en/products-services/financial-information/indices/global/world-indices.html" target="_blank">SIX World Indices</a>&nbsp;have a variable number of components that aim to provide the broadest market representation for a diversified set of major geographic regions. The indices are reviewed on a semiannual basis in June and December and their components weighted by free-float market capitalization. The calculation is performed in USD, EUR and CHF, while the dissemination occurs as end-of-day only.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.six-group.com/en/products-services/financial-information/indices/global/broad-blue-chip-indices.html" target="_blank">SIX Broad &amp; Blue-Chip Indices</a>&nbsp;include indices with a fixed number of components that aim to capture the most representative companies of geographic or economic agglomerations from medium to country level. The review frequencies are set individually (with the majority being rebalanced on a quarterly, annual or semi-annual basis). The index components are typically weighted by free-float market capitalization, although some indices are offered as price weighted.</p>
<p>The existing Swiss (SMI/SPI/SBI/SARON), Spanish (IBEX35), Nordic and ESG indices from SIX are already popular with a vast array of global banks, asset managers and asset owners. To enhance and simplify the client experience, the solution combines all essential indices and instrument data into one single delivery channel, the Web API. This includes equity prices, index values, index constituents, reference data, corporate actions information and regulatory data.</p>
<p>All indices are available in USD, EUR, CHF and local currencies and as price, net and gross return versions.

<div> TT Futures TCA, TT Trade Surveillance, transaction cost analysis, machine learning algorithm, multi-asset coverage <br />
Summary: 
Trading Technologies introduces TT Futures TCA for futures trading and expands TT Trade Surveillance across asset classes with machine learning-driven models. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>Trading Technologies International, Inc. (TT), a global capital markets technology platform provider, today announced the introduction of TT Futures TCA and TT Trade Surveillance, two new offerings that significantly enhance its Data &amp; Analytics and Compliance lines of business. TT Futures TCA, a comprehensive transaction cost analysis (TCA) tool for futures trading, leverages the largest collection of anonymized, millisecond-level futures market and trade data with a vast array of metrics and measures. TT Trade Surveillance, powered by the proprietary SCORE machine learning algorithm, combines new multi-asset coverage and dozens of new configurable models with the machine learning-driven models from TT Score, the company's first-generation trade surveillance platform. The firm plans to upgrade and shift all TT Score users to TT Trade Surveillance in the second half of this year.</p>
<div dir="ltr" id="dvprnejpgba16left"><img align="middle" alt="Trading Technologies" id="prnejpgba16left" src="https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1672454/Trading_Technologies_Logo.jpg" title="Trading Technologies" /></div>
<p>TT Chief Operating Officer Justin Llewellyn-Jones said: "We are constantly in a mode of identifying opportunities that will enhance our clients' experience, simplify their day-to-day operations, increase efficiencies and add value to the trade life cycle. The introduction of our new futures TCA and expanded multi-asset trade surveillance capabilities are the latest examples of how Trading Technologies and the TT platform play a pivotal role in the global financial markets."</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TT Futures TCA</span></b></p>
<p>In August,&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="http://email.prnewswire.com/ls/click?upn=u001.v9xoTZaCB3KDvUFxTt6K9ITfJcLtx-2FOvmuVizoBK57AacPgsRbirR6CuZGxkHSuSUbaW4H0zcZiBBl94Z1g4aeR0iawYtrzAw0cGevNynIO3dh-2BM55hIVdcizmxfRJpkM1kYXBlwQ5dCyP-2BBlf54bDHak8m6ioW1fE2y-2BzXRr4TMlEkKIK0CFQXKp4orXYQ6ARRbzjyYU-2F3DuSUXCK5jzQziwweMgqWwERqkR7EG-2FHf2VDy6bplxQiiGeOgbBAkU2H7mMMh0uFf32jcFgD-2FyKBgJcwpSOf3vgYkRZaXbgGk-3DdoyD_pIbxPfpDI69aAybPrpOfg1n6CWmKMnb3conIyNKCYgr-2BTRqxLAwMRExIXLpGb5DJcFeSrgRvYMmMz8o6ugzHtVc36MB3pQA3u0YeMrNsMJLKeV-2B7olPs6FUPD5JgB1-2FTAXopCBrXNeMj1cWisEcPLAv4nTmnQ93F28kkL4UUvVouWHpsd57aGPUTNbjOtIIe74riq-2FHhvP2zYpoZp-2B4auyPmnyhSG08r9H0Tl5ZJlSPTqdfMXk3CwQzqpDAeM8R6GDOX3X30UEsBOUzZrdEqLTl1Bp8F-2FvgtIPDWia1QuGkCLGrXP98AbIF5G-2BZ2oK4rBjfJL1-2BNOBx08DE8gQX4H084FIC7UczRpXl7iPDg2J4-3D" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">TT acquired Abel Noser Solutions</a></span>, the leading global provider of TCA solutions. A pioneer in the space, Abel Noser co-created the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) methodology that is now one of the financial markets' most widely used technical analysis tools. TCA has been popular in equity markets and other asset classes for many years, but it hasn't yet been widely adopted as a tool for futures.</p>
<p>Peter Weiler, TT's EVP Managing Director, Data &amp; Analytics, said: "Historically, investment managers and traders have not been able to rely on a TCA tool tailored for futures. By leveraging the massive amount of real-world futures trading data &ndash; anonymized &ndash; that only a firm like TT can bring to the table, we're able to combine it with Abel Noser's extensive TCA data and custom reporting that has been an essential tool in other asset classes, and produce what is without question the most comprehensive TCA solution for futures. We'll be providing anonymized peer benchmarks for detailed, post-trade analyses down to the millisecond. Users can look at like trades under historically similar circumstances to make apples-to-apples comparisons, understand their success relative to their peers, ensure they are achieving best execution and more."</p>
<p>The new TCA for futures capability will enable users to choose from an array of customizable reports to analyze and improve their trading strategies while measuring the efficacy of their trading counterparties. The capability is available now and will be integrated in early 2025 into the TT platform as a widget on the front end, with the customized analytics available to the client based on the metrics, breadth and level of granularity desired. Clients will have an option of three levels of service dependent upon their analytical needs.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TT Trade Surveillance</span></b></p>
<p>TT is upgrading its trade surveillance capabilities beyond listed derivatives to a wide range of asset classes, including equities and equity-adjacent subclasses such as preferred, warrants and SPACs; equity options; foreign exchange (FX); and fixed income. TT Trade Surveillance adds 47 new user-configurable surveillance models to its existing suite of models driven by machine learning technology. The new models are designed to detect a wide range of manipulative or disruptive trading activities, including insider trading, front-running and naked short-selling practices.</p>
<p>Ted Morgan, Trading Technologies EVP Managing Director, Compliance, said: "We're building on our track record of innovation and investment in the product by extending our capabilities into new asset classes &ndash; consistent with our company-wide expansion &ndash; and more than doubling our surveillance models, putting more power into the users' hands. They can adjust settings and thresholds that pertain to any particular model and run them on any subset of data they want to filter, such as defining parameters differently for specific countries or distinguishing between retail and institutional flow."</p>
<p>Morgan said users will continue to enjoy the online suite of analysis tools and out-of-the-box features available to compliance officers investigating alerts, such as the market replay tool, reconciliation module and other graphical aids. TT Trade Surveillance provides the market data needed for particular surveillance models at no extra cost. Users can also create and configure a synthetic instrument to identify potential manipulation across products and markets.</p>

<title>A Transformative Experience, Federal Reserve Governor Lisa D. Cook, At The 2024 Marshall Forum: A U.S.-U.K. Strategic and Economic Dialogue, Chicago, Illinois</title>

<div> Marshall Scholarship, Marshall Medal, Oxford, transformative experience, U.S.-U.K. relationship <br />
<br />
Summary: <br />
Marshall Scholar grateful for honor, discusses transformative experiences at Oxford, deep U.S.-U.K. relationship, and financial stability efforts. <div>
<p>Thank you, John. And thank you to the Marshall Aid Commemoration Commission and the commissioners for this most extraordinary honor. To be mentioned alongside previous Marshall Medal recipients, such as Secretary Madeleine Albright, Secretary Colin Powell, Justice Stephen Breyer, and eminent political scientist and university president Nan Keohane, is humbling. The distinction is especially meaningful to me, because I have taken great pride in being a Marshall Scholar from the moment I was selected during my senior year at Spelman College. In the years since, I have enjoyed meeting and being inspired by Marshall Scholars throughout the country and around the world. I also have enjoyed reviewing the applications of future Marshall Scholars, one way in which I have taken seriously the responsibility to serve as an ambassador for the program. I look forward to continuing to serve in such an ambassadorial role as a Marshall Medal recipient. Again, I am beyond grateful to the Commission for the truly humbling and thrilling honor.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20240617a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a></p>
<p>My Marshall experience completely changed my thinking about my life and career. The people I met had many different interests and experiences and were preparing for careers I had never heard of until I began my studies at the University of Oxford. I relished learning more about British culture and immersing myself in one of the U.K.'s and the world's storied universities. Likewise, I took pride in the fact that I could share my ideas, culture, and experiences with others during my time as a Marshall Scholar, and I forged strong friendships that endure to this day. Gaining a fuller understanding of the friendship and respect between the U.S. and U.K., and the global importance of these two economies and democracies, has held me in good stead for many years and continues to be important in my current role as a member of the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors.</p>
<p>In fact, I had my eyes on studying in Europe as far back as junior high school, when, during Latin class, I dreamed of following the Appian Way and other Roman routes that stretched from Britain to Israel to Morocco. I was eager to put my Girl Scout navigation and itinerary-building skills to the test on another continent. My first taste of European life came during my junior year abroad, when I won a Charles L. Merrill Scholarship to study in Strasbourg, France. During spring break of that year, I purchased a student Britrail pass and traveled to London, Southampton, and Stratford-upon-Avon. I met students and other people from all over Europe throughout the year, and I had many conversations on trains, ferries, and beaches, as well as in hostels and homes to which I was invited. I was immensely grateful to be able to do so many things my parents never had the opportunity to do, and I was eager to continue such experiences. As a result, on the advice of my mentors at Spelman&mdash;Professors Ethel Githii, Margery Ganz, and Lois Moreland&mdash;as well as the president at the time, Donald M. Stewart, I applied for the Marshall Scholarship and was humbled to be the first Spelman student to receive it.</p>
<p><strong>Transformative Experience</strong><br />Reflecting on the essay I wrote for my Marshall application, I invoked Plato's allegory of the cave from Book VII of the<em>&nbsp;Republic</em>&nbsp;to describe the transformation in my world view that occurred during my junior year abroad when it was challenged almost daily. My time as a Marshall Scholar would become the next phase of this ongoing transformation.</p>
<p>When I arrived in Oxford, I was excited and transfixed. The bucolic setting of Oxford was conducive to learning and sharing ideas. As a philosophy major at Spelman and long a student of Latin and the classics, I was incredulous that I had the chance to study philosophy at Oxford with a tutor employing the Socratic method. It was a dream come true. I lived with students from all over the world and made life-long friends. My studies at Oxford shined a bit more light on the subject of economics, perhaps subtly beginning the transformation to my eventual career. In my first (Michaelmas) term, I had a tutorial in mathematical economics, only my third economics course ever. I learned a lot, and I was surprised that I loved it! Maybe that should have been a hint? However, I did not choose it as my concentration. I had to select two subjects out of the three from philosophy, politics, and economics. I chose philosophy and politics, because I thought economics was too much fun.</p>
<p>My most influential tutor, as we called our professors at Oxford, was philosopher of mind and metaphysics Galen Strawson. Through my interactions with him, he helped me answer the question, "How does one construct a thoughtful, systematic world view?" After I completed my studies at Oxford, Galen also helped me hone further academic pursuits and advised me on plans that ultimately led me to pursue a PhD in economics. He was generous with his time and offered very useful advice in comparing British and American economics programs.</p>
<p>Outside of my studies, I enjoyed participating in extracurricular activities that I did not have the opportunity to participate in during high school or college. Those included the Oxford Union, the debate society, and traveling through Italy, Greece, and the Middle East during spring break of my first year. One of my favorite experiences at Oxford was producing, acting in, and serving as the dialect coach for the performance of "For Colored Girls&hellip;" by Ntozake Shange. I did so alongside my still very close friends, Ambassador Susan Rice and Congresswoman Terri Sewell. It was sponsored by the Oxford University Dramatic Society and presented in the historic Oscar Wilde Theatre at Magdalen College. It was the first time "For Colored Girls&hellip;" was put on at Oxford, because it was the first time there were six Black women to put it on! I helped actors from Liverpool and Trinidad and Tobago (and some from the U.S.) learn regional American accents. They joined four of us from the U.S. in the show, which included singing the Aretha Franklin hit "Respect." We sold out every single show.</p>
<p>In addition to sharing American culture, I picked up on the cultural influences of the British Isles. Songs from Irish rock band U2, such as "Pride (In the Name of Love)" and "New Year's Day," seemed to constantly play in the background during my time at Oxford. That exposure proved vital a few years later when I was teaching at Harvard and two gentleman named Paul and David came to speak to my colleagues and me about debt relief for highly indebted poor countries. Initially, I did not understand why everyone was abuzz about these visitors, until someone whispered the familiar song titles in my ear. Those words instantly transported me back to my time in Britain. I was, of course, speaking to Bono and The Edge.</p>
<p><strong>Lasting Bonds</strong><br />While the U.S. and U.K. share close cultural bonds&mdash;look no further than James Bond, Adele,&nbsp;<em>Downton Abbey</em>, Tom Jones,&nbsp;<em>Monty Python</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Bridgerton</em>&mdash;the relationship between the two countries runs much deeper than that. The Marshall Scholarship has its roots with George C. Marshall and the history-changing partnership between the U.S. and U.K during World War II. It is easy to see why a long friendship has endured. We share a language (for the most part!), a history, and a belief in democratic values. Our close economic ties are one aspect of the U.S.-U.K. relationship that stands out. Our countries feature two of the world's great financial centers and share other important connections. The U.K. is the top destination of U.S. direct investment and is the second-largest source of direct investment into this country. The U.S. is the U.K.'s largest trading partner, with 22 percent of U.K. exports heading here last year.</p>
<p>Our central banks have a close relationship as well. We at the Fed respect and work with our counterparts at the Bank of England, including through the Bank for International Settlements, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the G7, and the G20. Given our similar economic structures and banking systems, there is always much to learn from each other to help ensure a resilient financial system. Those efforts are especially important to me as I serve as chair of the Board's Committee on Financial Stability. We know economic shocks tend to reverberate around the world, so having clear and open communication with my fellow central bankers plays a valuable part in assuring financial stability.</p>
<p>It has been wonderful to have the opportunity today to reflect on my time as a Marshall Scholar and to consider how it more fully opened my eyes, allowing me to pursue my career and my passions. As a girl from a small town in Georgia, I debated and discussed ideas and issues during and outside of my tutorials that I had never done before. I met people from many different parts of the U.K. and the world I had never encountered before and who held views I had never heard articulated before. And that, I think, is the very spirit of the Marshall Scholarship and the Marshall Medal: building respect and understanding and strengthening the enduring friendship between our two countries.</p>
<p>Once again, thank you so very much to the Marshall Commission for this honor. I am most grateful and humbled to receive it.</p>

<div> whistleblower, CFTC, enforcement actions, derivatives market, insider information
Summary:<br />Whistleblower awarded $8 million for providing key information in enforcement actions related to derivatives market deception, saving time and resources. CFTC's Whistleblower Program continues to grant awards. <div>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced it awarded over $8 million to one insider whistleblower who provided significant information and assistance that led the CFTC and other agencies to bring multiple enforcement actions. The whistleblower helped the CFTC establish that one or more derivatives market participants deceived clients about key aspects of trades.</span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>&ldquo;This&nbsp;</span>is an important<span>&nbsp;whistleblower&nbsp;</span>whose&nbsp;<span>information led multiple regulators to bring multiple enforcement actions,&rdquo;&nbsp;</span>said Director of Enforcement Ian McGinley. &ldquo;The whistleblower&rsquo;s assistance enabled the CFTC and other agencies to more efficiently investigate and prosecute the misconduct.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>&ldquo;Based on the whistleblower&rsquo;s involvement in the underlying conduct, the whistleblower provided extremely valuable insider information at a critical time during the investigations,&rdquo; said Whistleblower Office Director Brian Young.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The whistleblower provided direct evidence of not only the whistleblower&rsquo;s own intent in the relevant transactions, but also the whistleblower&rsquo;s knowledge and observations about clients, co-workers, and senior leadership at the liable entity or entities. This ultimately saved substantial time and resources for staff and resulted in a far stronger and more triable case in the event of litigation.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Attorney Advisor Nina Liao of the CFTC&rsquo;s Whistleblower Office handled this whistleblower award.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>About the CFTC&rsquo;s Whistleblower Program</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The Whistleblower Program was created under Section 748 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. Since issuing its first award in 2014, the CFTC has granted whistleblower awards amounting to approximately $380 million. Those awards are associated with enforcement actions that have resulted in monetary sanctions totaling more than $3.2 billion. The CFTC issues awards related not only to the agency&rsquo;s enforcement actions, but also in connection with actions brought by other domestic or foreign regulators if certain conditions are met.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) provides confidentiality protections for whistleblowers. Regardless of whether the CFTC grants an award, the CFTC will not disclose any information that could reasonably be expected to reveal a whistleblower&rsquo;s identity, except in limited circumstances. Consistent with this confidentiality protection, the CFTC will not disclose the name of the enforcement action in which the whistleblower provided information or the exact dollar amount of the award granted.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Whistleblowers are eligible to receive between 10 and 30 percent of the monetary sanctions collected. All whistleblower awards are paid from the CFTC&rsquo;s Customer Protection Fund, which was established by Congress, and is financed entirely through monetary sanctions paid to the CFTC by violators of the CEA. No money is taken or withheld from injured customers to fund the program.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p align="center"><span><span><span><span>* * * * *</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Anyone with information related to potential violations of the CEA or the CFTC&rsquo;s rules and regulations can submit a tip electronically by filing a&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.whistleblower.gov/overview/submitatip"><span>Form TCR&nbsp;</span></a><span>(Tip, Complaint or Referral) online</span><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<title>Statement Of CFTC Commissioner Caroline D. Pham Regarding Settlement Order With Trafigura Trading LLC</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/statement-of-cftc-commissioner-caroline-d-pham-regarding-settlement-order-with/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Commissioner Caroline D. Pham, CFTC, Trafigura Trading LLC, administrative order, manipulation<br />Summary: Commissioner Pham criticizes CFTC's order, citing lack of evidence, overreaching, and voting process concerns. She questions the interpretation of the rule and lack of transparency. <div>
<p><span><span><span><span>Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Commissioner Caroline D. Pham released the following statement regarding the CFTC&rsquo;s administrative order regarding Trafigura Trading LLC announced today:</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>&ldquo;While I commend the CFTC Division of Enforcement for their efforts to pursue manipulation in global markets, the Commission inappropriately tacks on an additional charge to fly under the radar with a wholly new interpretation of a 7-year-old rule that has never been the subject of a staff advisory or other notice to the public since it was issued.&nbsp;<span>I&rsquo;m incredibly grateful for those whistleblowers that report bad actors&ndash;often at great risk to their own wellbeing.&nbsp;<span>Of course, we should always encourage open lines of communications and prevent whistleblowers from being silenced.&nbsp;But t</span></span>his settlement order essentially wordsmiths job offer letters and other employment-related agreements with confidentiality provisions for commodity firms around the world that have no CFTC registration requirements and other market participants. Because the settlement order not only inaccurately uses the term &ldquo;non-disclosure agreements,&rdquo; but also fails to include important details about what contractual language the CFTC thinks violates Regulation 165.19, companies and lawyers all over the world are left playing a guessing game to revise tens or hundreds of thousands of documents for both current and former employees that fail to include a carve-out for the magic words &ldquo;Commodity Futures Trading Commission.&rdquo; I made numerous requests for examples of the agreements that the CFTC found violative, and I received only one job offer letter and one separation agreement. Only the job offer letter had language requiring written pre-approval from the firm regarding confidential information, similar to prior SEC&mdash;not CFTC&mdash;enforcement actions, but it also had&nbsp;<strong><span>two</span></strong>&nbsp;savings clauses that voided any language that may violate any law or regulation whether current or prospective. In addition, the firm did not enforce these confidentiality provisions and the separation agreement actually&nbsp;<strong><span>required</span></strong>&nbsp;cooperation in government investigations. Let me be clear: These were not &ldquo;non-disclosure agreements&rdquo; as is commonly understood by in-house lawyers and external legal counsel. The Commission once again overreaches in its zeal to fine millions of dollars for technical issues like nitpicking legal documents in the absence of a firm taking any action to &ldquo;enforc[e] [] confidentiality and pre-dispute arbitration clauses respecting actions by potential whistleblowers in any pre-employment, employment or post-employment agreements&rdquo; as stated in the Commission&rsquo;s only interpretation of Regulation 165.19 to date, in its 2016 proposed rulemaking. As I keep reminding the Commission, we are not the SEC, and the SEC&rsquo;s orders or precedents do not provide sufficient notice to the public for CFTC interpretations because we are a different agency with a different statute, regulations, and markets.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>&ldquo;In addition, I could not vote on this matter because I did not have sufficient evidence to determine there was a reasonable basis for the alleged charges, even after repeated requests. Yet, this case was called for a vote anyway while I was still attempting to access and review the record. These actions are yet another example of why I have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024b"><span>called for a GAO study</span></a>&nbsp;on the CFTC&rsquo;s internal procedures.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></p>

<div> Credit Suisse AG, Touchmark National Bank, Manuel Alejandro Ramirez Perez, Avianna Rivera, Commonwealth National Bank <br />
Summary:<br /> 
Enforcement actions taken by the OCC against banks and individuals for compliance deficiencies, unsafe practices, and embezzlement. Termination actions also announced. <div>
<p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) today released enforcement actions taken against national banks and federal savings associations (banks), and individuals currently and formerly affiliated with banks the OCC supervises.</p>
<p>The OCC uses enforcement actions against banks to require the board of directors and management to take timely actions to correct the deficient practices or violations identified. Actions taken against banks are:</p>
<ul>
<li><span><a href="https://www.occ.gov/static/enforcement-actions/eaAA-ENF-2024-53.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Formal Agreement</a>&nbsp;with Credit Suisse AG New York Branch,</span>&nbsp;New York, New York, to address deficiencies in the branch&rsquo;s compliance related to the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering laws and regulations. The branch&rsquo;s execution of this formal agreement was a condition for the branch&rsquo;s conversion to a federal license. The provisions of the formal agreement are substantially the same as a prior written agreement between the branch and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the New York State Department of Financial Services. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2024-53)</li>
<li><span><a href="https://www.occ.gov/static/enforcement-actions/eaAA-SO-2024-25.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Formal Agreement</a>&nbsp;with Touchmark National Bank,</span>&nbsp;Alpharetta, Georgia, for unsafe or unsound practices, including those relating to the bank&rsquo;s strategic planning, board and management oversight, liquidity risk management, interest risk management, credit risk management, audit, and information technology. (Docket No. AA-SO-2024-25)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The OCC uses enforcement actions against an institution-affiliated party (IAP) to deter, encourage correction of, or prevent violations, unsafe or unsound practices, or breaches of fiduciary duty. Enforcement actions against IAPs reinforce the accountability of individuals for their conduct regarding the affairs of a bank. The term &ldquo;institution-affiliated party,&rdquo; or IAP, is defined in 12 USC 1813(u) and includes bank directors, officers, employees, and controlling shareholders. Orders of Prohibition prohibit an individual from any participation in the affairs of a bank or other institution as defined in 12 USC 1818(e)(7). Actions taken against IAPs are:</p>
<ul>
<li><span><a href="https://www.occ.gov/static/enforcement-actions/eaAA-ENF-2024-43.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Order of Prohibition</a>&nbsp;against Manuel Alejandro Ramirez Perez,</span>&nbsp;former Relationship Banker and Credit Solutions Advisor at Bonita Springs and North Naples, Florida branches of Bank of America, N.A., Charlotte, North Carolina, for improperly accessing customer accounts and providing information on those accounts to a third-party individual. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2024-43)</li>
<li><span><a href="https://www.occ.gov/static/enforcement-actions/eaAA-ENF-2024-40.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Order of Prohibition</a>&nbsp;against Avianna Rivera,</span>&nbsp;former Personal Banker at a Bryan, Texas branch of First National Bank Texas, Killeen, Texas, for embezzling $11,500 from the account of a bank customer. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2024-40)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The OCC terminates enforcement actions when a bank has demonstrated compliance with all articles of an enforcement action; or when the OCC determines that articles deemed &ldquo;not in compliance&rdquo; have become outdated or irrelevant to the bank&rsquo;s current circumstances; or when the OCC incorporates the articles deemed &ldquo;not in compliance&rdquo; into a new action. Termination actions include:</p>
<ul>
<li><span><a href="https://www.occ.gov/static/enforcement-actions/eaAA-ENF-2024-44.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Order Terminating the Formal Agreement</a>&nbsp;with Commonwealth National Bank,</span>&nbsp;Mobile, Alabama, dated January 31, 2022 (Docket No.&nbsp;<a href="https://occ.gov/static/enforcement-actions/ea2022-001.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">AA-ENF-2021-50</a>), for unsafe or unsound practices, including those relating to strategic planning, loan portfolio management, and internal audit. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2024-44)</li>
</ul>

<div> enforcement action, Regulation 165.19(b), whistleblower program, NDAs, CFTC<br />
The Commissioner criticizes the CFTC's enforcement action against Trafigura for overextending the interpretation of Regulation 165.19(b). The regulation lacks clear notice and imposes unrealistic expectations.<br /><br />Summary: The Commissioner criticizes the CFTC's enforcement action against Trafigura for overextending the interpretation of Regulation 165.19(b. The regulation lacks clear notice and imposes unrealistic expectations. <div>
<p>I respectfully concur on the Commission&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement061724?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt1" id="fntref1" name="fntref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;enforcement action settling charges against Trafigura Trading LLC (&ldquo;Trafigura&rdquo;). But I cannot fully support it because once again, we are falling victim to regulating by enforcement, this time through a first-of-its-kind-charge under Regulation 165.19(b) of the Commission&rsquo;s Whistleblower Rules. While I am a strong proponent of our whistleblower program, the Commission&rsquo;s decision to bring this specific charge is inconsistent with the regulation&rsquo;s text and prior Commission statements regarding the regulation&rsquo;s intent.</p>
<p><strong>Silence is Golden&hellip;And Now Illegal</strong></p>
<p>Seven years after the Commission adopted Regulation 165.19(b), today&rsquo;s settlement embraces a new interpretation, empowering the Commission to line-item edit non-disclosure agreements (&ldquo;NDAs&rdquo;).</p>
<p>The Commission&rsquo;s Order finds Trafigura violated Regulation 165.19(b) by requiring employees to sign agreements that contained broad non-disclosure provisions that prohibited sharing Trafigura&rsquo;s confidential information with third parties. The Commission is taking issue with the agreement&rsquo;s lack of &ldquo;carve-out language that would have expressly permitted sharing information with the Commission or law enforcement.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement061724?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt2" id="fntref2" name="fntref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;And it is the lack of these very specific words &ndash; words that the Commission has never required before or even identified previously &ndash; that underpins this violation.</p>
<p>Not only am I concerned that the Commission is taking this position as to words not included in an NDA without any previous public notice or communication, I also question the Commission&rsquo;s interpretation of the regulation. Specifically, I disagree with the Commission: (1) ignoring the regulatory definition of the word &ldquo;action&rdquo; that is used in Regulation 165.19(b) as well as the common understanding of the meaning of that word; (2) failing to point to an affirmative duty to include carveout language; and (3) disregarding statements in the proposed rulemaking release issued by the Commission when it adopted Regulation 165.19(b).</p>
<p><strong>Defining Inaction as Action</strong></p>
<p>Section 23 of the Commodity Exchange Act (&ldquo;CEA&rdquo;)<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement061724?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt3" id="fntref3" name="fntref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;authorizes the CFTC to establish a comprehensive whistleblower program and to protect certain parties who provide information to the Commission or who assist in an investigation or an administrative or judicial action related to such information. As relevant here, the statute prohibits waiver of a whistleblower&rsquo;s rights and remedies.</p>
<p>Regulation 165.19(b) is part of the Commission&rsquo;s implementation of the CEA&rsquo;s whistleblower provisions, and states: &ldquo;No person may take any&nbsp;<em>action</em>&nbsp;to impede an individual from communicating directly with the Commission&rsquo;s staff about a possible violation of the Commodity Exchange Act, including by enforcing, or threatening to enforce, a confidentiality agreement or predispute arbitration agreement with respect to such communications.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement061724?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt4" id="fntref4" name="fntref4">[4]</a></p>
<p>A foundational defect in the finding that Trafigura violated this regulation is the failure to identify an &ldquo;action&rdquo; satisfying the definition of that word in Regulation 165.2, which applies to all the Whistleblower Rules. As defined in Regulation 165.2, &ldquo;action&rdquo; &ldquo;generally means a single captioned judicial or administrative proceeding.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement061724?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt5" id="fntref5" name="fntref5">[5]</a></p>
<p>Applying the definition of the word &ldquo;action&rdquo; as defined in Regulation 165.2 to the use of the word in Regulation 165.19(b) limits the scope of the prohibition in the latter to enforcement through a judicial or administrative proceeding. This construction is consistent with the clause at the end of Regulation 165.19(b) that speaks to &ldquo;enforcing, or threatening to enforce,&rdquo; a confidentiality agreement.</p>
<p>Even if the use of the word &ldquo;generally&rdquo; in the definition of an &ldquo;action&rdquo; in Regulation 165.2 loosens the definition&rsquo;s construction somewhat, it still cannot support the Commission&rsquo;s finding in the settlement Order that an employment agreement, in and of itself, can rise to the level of an &ldquo;action&rdquo; that impedes an individual from communicating directly with the Commission&rsquo;s staff. Simply put, an agreement is not an &ldquo;action&rdquo; as that word is commonly understood.</p>
<p>This understanding is confirmed by the clause in Regulation 165.19(b) providing that an &ldquo;action&rdquo; to impede, includes &ldquo;enforcing, or attempting to enforce,&rdquo; a confidentiality agreement. If the agreement itself can be an &ldquo;action&rdquo; to impede, then there would have been no need for Regulation 165.19(b) to provide that the &ldquo;action&rdquo; of enforcing, or threatening to enforce, such an agreement is a violation &ndash; because the Regulation would already have been violated by the agreement itself.</p>
<p>The settlement Order does not contain any suggestion that Trafigura enforced, or threatened to enforce, a confidentiality agreement during the course of our staff&rsquo;s investigation of this matter. Accordingly, I cannot agree that Trafigura &ldquo;acted&rdquo; to impede its employees from communicating with our staff in violation of Regulation 165.19(b).</p>
<p><strong>We Can Learn from the Past, But We Cannot Change It</strong></p>
<p>The conclusory discussion of this issue in the settlement Order ignores the simple fact that Regulation 165.19(b) contains no requirement for a company&rsquo;s NDA to affirmatively inform employees that they may make voluntary disclosures to the Commission. Nor is such a duty ever meaningfully discussed in the rulemaking record in the&nbsp;<em>Federal Register</em>&nbsp;regarding the Commission&rsquo;s adoption of Regulation 165.19(b).</p>
<p>Indeed, the rulemaking record not only fails to support an affirmative obligation for NDA carveout language &ndash; it actually undercuts the finding of the settlement Order that Trafigura violated Regulation 165.19(b). While the CFTC&rsquo;s Whistleblower Rules were originally adopted in 2011, it was a rulemaking in 2017 that amended the Whistleblower Rules to add the provision in Regulation 165.19(b) that is at issue. The Commission&rsquo;s proposing release for those amendments specifically stated that Regulation 165.19(b) was added &ldquo;to prohibit the&nbsp;<em>enforcement of</em>&nbsp;confidentiality and pre-dispute arbitration clauses respecting actions by potential whistleblowers in any pre-employment, employment or post-employment agreements.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement061724?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt6" id="fntref6" name="fntref6">[6]</a></p>
<p>The Commission&rsquo;s approach to this issue will have far-reaching implications, affecting every company that requires its employees to sign NDAs similar to those used by Trafigura. Any of these companies that has participated in a market regulated by the CFTC is now at risk of a &ldquo;knock on the door&rdquo; from the CFTC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement seeking to impose a civil monetary penalty for failing to fulfill an obligation that the Commission has neither provided any notice of nor expressly imposed.</p>
<p><strong>Unspoken Expectations = Unrealistic Expectations</strong></p>
<p>If the Commission wants to implement a policy that an NDA can constitute an &ldquo;action&rdquo; that impedes employees from communicating with CFTC staff, and that companies using such agreements have an affirmative duty to inform employees that they may make voluntary disclosures to the Commission, it should do so by amending its rule.</p>
<p>But at a minimum, if that is how the Commission intends to interpret Regulation 165.19(b), it should provide notice of that interpretation to the marketplace. For the past seven years, neither the Commission nor its staff has issued any advisory, guidance, frequently asked questions (&ldquo;FAQs&rdquo;), or any other statement informing the public of how it interprets Regulation 165.19(b).<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement061724?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt7" id="fntref7" name="fntref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;By failing to do so, and instead enforcing Regulation 165.19(b) beyond its textual bounds, the Commission engages in a textbook case of &ldquo;regulation by enforcement,&rdquo; which I have repeatedly opposed.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement061724?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt8" id="fntref8" name="fntref8">[8]</a></p>

However, the mere mention of this SEC matter does not negate the fact that the Commission&rsquo;s 165.19(b) rulemaking record expressly stated the purpose was &ldquo;to prohibit the&nbsp;<em>enforcement of</em>&nbsp;confidentiality&rdquo; provisions. This plain language undermines the Order&rsquo;s conclusion that an unenforced NDA provision, in and of itself, can establish a violation. Moreover, SEC settlements under its similarly worded rule do not constitute fair notice to participants in CFTC-regulated markets. Trafigura illustrates this point nicely. It is a global commodities dealer, not an issuer of securities, and its participation in SEC-regulated equities markets is unknown. As a result, it cannot be assumed that it (and other companies in a similar situation) devote significant resources to monitoring settled enforcement actions of the SEC &ndash; let alone considering what such actions might foreshadow about how the CFTC will interpret its separate rule set.</p>

<div> violations, Trafigura Trading LLC, CEA, manipulative conduct, whistleblowers
Summary:
Trafigura Trading LLC charged with CEA violations including manipulation of benchmark rates, interfering with whistleblower communications, and misappropriation of material nonpublic information. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today issued an order simultaneously filing and settling charges against&nbsp;Trafigura Trading LLC, a global commodities merchant with its principal place of business in Houston, Texas, for multiple violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and associated CFTC regulations. The order requires Trafigura to pay a $55 million civil monetary penalty and implement certain remedial measures to ensure future compliance with the CEA.</p>
<p>The order includes three violations: &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Between 2014 and 2019, Trafigura traded gasoline while in knowing possession of material nonpublic information it knew or should have known had been misappropriated from a Mexican trading entity (MTE).</li>
<li>In February 2017, Trafigura manipulated a fuel oil benchmark to benefit its futures and swaps positions, including derivatives traded on United States registered entities.</li>
<li>Between 2017 and 2020, Trafigura required current employees and former employees to sign employment and/or separation agreements containing non-disclosure provisions prohibiting them from disclosing company information, with no exception for law enforcement agencies or regulators, which illegally impeded individuals from voluntarily communicating with Division of Enforcement (DOE) staff during the investigation.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As reflected in today&rsquo;s Order, Trafigura misappropriated material non-public information and engaged in manipulative conduct that affected published benchmark rates,&rdquo; said Director of Enforcement Ian McGinley.&nbsp; &ldquo;This enforcement action is yet another example of the CFTC&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring the derivatives markets remain free from trading abuses that undermine their integrity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Director of the Whistleblower Office Brian Young commented, &ldquo;This is the first CFTC action charging a company for interfering with whistleblower communications. This groundbreaking action demonstrates the CFTC&rsquo;s commitment to protecting potential whistleblowers and puts the market on notice that the CFTC will not tolerate attempts to silence potential witnesses.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Case Background</p>
<p><i>Misappropriation of Material Nonpublic Information</i></p>
<p>The order finds that between&nbsp;2014 and April 2019, directly and through intermediaries, Trafigura improperly obtained nonpublic information material to the gasoline market from an MTE employee in breach of the employer&rsquo;s rules.&nbsp;Among other things, Trafigura received MTE&rsquo;s pricing formulas used to sell its physical gasoline to another trading entity in Mexico, as well as the MTE&rsquo;s monthly import &ldquo;program,&rdquo; meaning the volumes, types, and destination ports for gasoline the MTE planned to import in the next month. Trafigura also sometimes received competitor pricing information in the context of bilateral negotiations. The MTE considered this information confidential and material to its own business, while the information was material to Trafigura&rsquo;s trading and business decisions, such as its negotiation and pricing strategies for gasoline products. Trafigura traders in Houston, Texas entered into physical and derivative gasoline transactions while knowing this confidential information.</p>
<p><i>Manipulative Conduct</i></p>
<p>The order further finds that Trafigura manipulated the benchmark price of U.S. Gulf Coast high-sulfur fuel oil throughout the month of February 2017. From approximately January to March 2017, Trafigura developed and deployed a large fuel oil export program designed to export fuel oil from the U.S. Gulf Coast to Singapore in order to profit from an observed open arbitrage for fuel oil. In connection with its arbitrage strategy, Trafigura established a long derivative position in U.S. Gulf Coast high-sulfur fuel oil, in part as an economic hedge for its anticipated purchases of physical fuel oil to export to Singapore. However, the long derivative position Trafigura entered was in excess of its short physical position that resulted from its intent to buy fuel oil in the U.S. Gulf Coast for arbitrage&mdash;the excess essentially constituting a long speculative bet on fuel oil prices in February 2017.</p>
<p>Beginning on February&nbsp;1, 2017, and continuing through the end of the month, Trafigura bid heavily for and bought cargoes of fuel oil in the benchmark&rsquo;s trading window, in an amount much larger than it had ever previously purchased in the window in a single month. Trafigura&rsquo;s heavy bidding and buying activity in that short period tended to increase prices paid in the window, and ultimately created artificially high benchmark values, which benefited Trafigura&rsquo;s long derivatives position. This impact on the fuel oil benchmark was to the detriment of market participants who looked to rely on the benchmark as a fair price reference.</p>
<p><i>Impeding Voluntary Communications with the CFTC</i></p>
<p>Finally, the order finds that between July 31, 2017 and 2020, Trafigura required its employees to sign employment agreements, and its former employees to sign separation agreements, with broad non-disclosure provisions that prohibited the sharing of Trafigura&rsquo;s confidential information with third parties. These non-disclosure provisions did not contain carve-out language expressly permitting communications with law enforcement or regulators such as the CFTC. The provisions caused confusion that resulted in an impediment to voluntary and direct communications with the CFTC about possible violations of the CEA and CFTC regulations in violation of the CEA&rsquo;s prohibitions against impeding direct communications with the CFTC.</p>
<p>The order finds that Trafigura&rsquo;s conduct defrauded its counterparties, harmed other market participants, and undermined the integrity of U.S. and global oil markets. This case is brought in coordination with the DOE&rsquo;s Corruption Task Force and Insider Trading Task Force.</p>
<p>&nbsp;* * * * * *</p>
<p>The CFTC thanks the Comisi&oacute;n Nacional Bancaria y de Valores of Mexico and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority for their assistance in this matter.</p>
<p>The DOE staff responsible for this matter are Doug Snodgrass, Matthew S. Edelstein, Patrick Marquardt, Joe Patrick, Ben Sedrish, Allison V. Passman, Scott Williamson, and Robert Howell.</p>
<p>Additional DOE staff who provided assistance are Gates S. Hurand and former staff Elise Kent Bernanke and Ilana Waxman. &nbsp;</p>
<p>* * * * * * *</p>
<p>CFTC&rsquo;s Foreign Corrupt Practices Advisory</p>
<p>The DOE issued an advisory on March 6, 2019 [See CFTC Press Release No.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/7884-19">7884-19</a>] on self-reporting and cooperation for CEA violations involving foreign corrupt practices. As set forth in the advisory, where a company or individual not registered or required to be registered with the CFTC voluntarily discloses violations of the CEA involving foreign corrupt practices, provides full cooperation and appropriately remediates, DOE will apply a presumption that it will not recommend the CFTC impose a civil monetary penalty in resolution of an action, absent aggravating circumstances.</p>
<p>Customers and other individuals can report suspicious activities or information, such as possible violations of commodity trading laws, to the Division of Enforcement via a toll-free hotline 866-FON-CFTC (866-366-2382),&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cftc.gov/ConsumerProtection/FileaTiporComplaint/index.htm">file a tip or complaint</a>&nbsp;online, or contact the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.whistleblower.gov/">Whistleblower Office</a>. Whistleblowers may be eligible to receive between 10 and 30 percent of the monetary sanctions collected paid from the CFTC Customer Protection Fund, which is financed through monetary sanctions paid to the CFTC by violators of the CEA.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<title>SEC’s New Public Service Campaign Emphasizes Investor Protection</title>

<div> campaign, investor protection, Investor.gov, SEC, knowledge-sharing<br />
Summary:<br />
SEC launches "Is This Right?" campaign on Investor.gov, featuring TV spots emphasizing fraud protection, investing knowledge-sharing, and resources for informed investors. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy (OIEA) today unveiled its new public service campaign, which highlights investor protection and encourages investors to explore the free tools and resources on Investor.gov.</p>
<p>The campaign, &ldquo;Is This Right?&rdquo; takes a multi-generational knowledge-sharing approach to educating investors. It features two TV spots and resources pages in both&nbsp;<a href="http://www.investor.gov/neverstoplearning">English</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.investor.gov/nuncadejedeaprender">Spanish</a>&nbsp;focusing on fraud protection, including the importance of investors monitoring their investment accounts, conducting a background check on investment professionals, and avoiding unsolicited investment pitches that could be scams.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Informed investors are better investors,&rdquo; said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. &ldquo;With this public campaign, Americans can learn more about how to meet their financial goals and invest for a strong financial future. I encourage everyone to take advantage of our resources on Investor.gov.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This year&rsquo;s public service campaign shows that although different generations may have various kinds of knowledge when it comes to investing and recognizing scams, they can each learn from one another,&rdquo; said Lori Schock, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy. &ldquo;Sharing knowledge and having a conversation with your family members can make talking about finances more comfortable and can also encourage younger members to become interested in saving and investing at an early age."</p>
<p>Nearly 70 million new users have accessed&nbsp;Investor.gov&nbsp;since it launched in October 2009, and thousands of investors test their investing knowledge by taking a new quiz published each month. This month&rsquo;s quiz, available at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investor.gov/additional-resources/spotlight/investing-quizzes">Investor.gov/quiz</a>, highlights messaging from the new campaign focused on investor protection.</p>
<p><span>TV Spots</span></p>
<p><span>Mother/Husband/Daughter/Granddaughter&nbsp;</span>[<a href="https://youtu.be/PKoWrjuc3Fs">English</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/tSh3KuwoRN0">Spanish</a>] ‒ Highlights the importance of being suspicious of unsolicited investment pitches, making sure you&rsquo;re dealing with a registered investment professional, and monitoring your investment accounts.</p>
<p>A mother, her daughter and teenage granddaughter sit at a kitchen island looking at their personal devices, with the mother&rsquo;s husband nearby. The mother shows her daughter an email about an influencer pitching a &ldquo;once in a lifetime&rdquo; investment and asks, &ldquo;Does this look right?&rdquo; The daughter says it seems suspicious and that she should check Investor.gov to see if they are registered. As the daughter checks her retirement statement, she notices a &ldquo;weird fee&rdquo; and asks her mother, &ldquo;Does this look right?&rdquo; The mother is glad her daughter is monitoring her accounts and says she should call and check it out. The spot also gives the teenager an introduction into discussing these kinds of important investing topics.</p>
<p><span>Father/Son/Aunt</span>&nbsp;[<a href="https://youtu.be/hNcl85ukNeg">English</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/pscG7CblArk">Spanish</a>] ‒ Stresses the importance of conducting a background check on an investment professional and spotting and avoiding scams.</p>
<p>A son is on his cell phone holding an infant and his father is on a laptop sitting in a living room. The son sees a message on his phone from an &ldquo;investment guy&rdquo; who&rsquo;s promising 15 percent return with zero risk. He asks his father, &ldquo;Does this seem right?&rdquo; The father tells him it sounds too good to be true, to ignore the message, and to conduct a background check on anyone offering zero risk. The father sees a random message from his investment firm asking him to wire money, and asks his son, &ldquo;Does this seem right?&rdquo; The son responds by saying they wouldn&rsquo;t do that and tells his father it sounds like a scam. An aunt is sitting nearby witnessing the exchange.</p>
<p>Both TV spots end with a bit of humor and the message: &ldquo;No matter your age, we can all learn something about investing. Explore our resources at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.investor.gov/neverstoplearning">Investor.gov/NeverStopLearning</a>.&rdquo;</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>VIXTLT Index leverages Cboe's proprietary VIX&reg; Index methodology, applied to highly liquid, listed options on the iShares&reg; 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT)</li>
<li>Designed to provide a VIX Index-like measure for U.S. Treasury market volatility</li>
<li>VIXTLT Index available in both percentage price volatility and basis point volatility terms</li>
<li>New index complements Credit VIX Indices as Cboe expands its fixed income volatility index suite</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cboe Global Markets, Inc. (Cboe: CBOE), the world's leading derivatives and securities exchange network, today announced plans to launch the Cboe 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF Volatility Basis Point Index ("VIXTLT Index"). Using an adaptation of Cboe's proprietary VIX&reg; Index methodology, the VIXTLT Index will be calculated using listed options on the iShares&reg; 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) and provide market participants with the ability to track future (30-day) expected volatility in the U.S. Treasury market, the deepest and most liquid government securities market in the world. The VIXTLT Index is expected to launch in the third quarter of 2024.</p>
<p>Developed by Cboe Labs, the company's product innovation hub, and benchmark administered by Cboe Global Indices, the VIXTLT Index leverages the combined strengths of Cboe's derivatives and data businesses. The new index expands Cboe's growing volatility index suite and adds to Cboe's current offering of more than&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4192417-1&amp;h=4061598917&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cboe.com%2Fus%2Findices%2Findicesproducts%2F&amp;a=450+derivatives-based+indices" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">450 derivatives-based indices</a>, covering a range of strategy benchmarks and asset classes.</p>
<p>TLT is a transparent and highly liquid exchange-traded fund (ETF) composed of U.S. Treasury bonds with remaining maturities exceeding twenty years that have a relatively high duration. Highly liquid options on TLT with a wide range of strikes help convey information about how investors potentially view the future of U.S. interest rates, which is in turn distilled by the VIXTLT Index methodology down to one number designed to represent a consensus view on expected U.S. Treasury volatility.</p>
<p>Similar to how the Cboe Volatility Index&reg; (VIX&reg;) measures 30-day expected volatility of the U.S. equity market, the VIXTLT Index is designed to offer a comparable gauge for the U.S. Treasury market. Monitoring the VIXTLT and VIX indices together may afford investors a broad view of perceived uncertainty in two important asset classes that have historically experienced periods of co-movement as well as significant divergence.</p>
<p>"For more than 30 years investors across the globe have used the VIX Index as a benchmark to help gauge U.S. equity market volatility, and today Cboe is proud to further expand its volatility suite to include a U.S. Treasury market measure," said Rob Hocking, Senior Vice President and Head of Product Innovation at Cboe. "Cboe offers a comprehensive ecosystem of services, touching every aspect of the customer experience &ndash; from market access and data, to tradable products and beyond. By combining our derivatives expertise with leading indexing capabilities, we are able to identify gaps in our product offering and utilize our robust technology, data and customer feedback to continuously drive product development that meet customers' needs."</p>
<p>To reflect prevailing bond market pricing convention, VIXTLT will be available in basis point volatility terms. Basis point volatility is a key concept in fixed income markets where risk is more commonly perceived as the absolute&mdash;not percentage&mdash;change in yield or spread, multiplied by the price value of a basis point. Potential drivers of the VIXTLT Index may include unexpected shifts in monetary policy by the Federal Reserve, surprises in macroeconomic indicators, technical supply and demand shocks, adverse risk events or behavioral factors triggering sudden shifts in investor risk aversion.</p>

Investors should seize these emerging opportunities to navigate the evolving landscape and drive future growth.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note: Historic data may change in case some deals get added to previous months because of a delay in disclosure of information in the public domain.</span></span></p>

<li>CEDX recently expanded its range of equity options and now offers contracts on over 300 European companies</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cboe Europe Derivatives (CEDX), Cboe's pan-European equity derivatives marketplace, today announces that IMC has become a new direct trading participant, gaining access to the exchange's range of pan-European index derivatives and equity options.</p>
<p>Iouri Saroukhanov, Head of European Derivatives at Cboe Europe, said: "We are thrilled to welcome IMC to CEDX and further diversify the types of liquidity the exchange is offering to its institutional and retail participants.

<div> Federal Reserve, Interest Rates, IMF, Inflation, Stock Exchanges <br />
<br />Summary: The Federal Reserve plans to maintain higher interest rates due to slow inflation. The FTSE Mondo Visione Index increased by 1.3% in May. Bursa Malaysia was the top performer.

<title>Innovation In The Financial System, Federal Reserve Governor Michelle W. Bowman, At The Salzburg Global Seminar On Financial Technology Innovation, Social Impact, And Regulation: Do We Need New Paradigms?, Salzburg, Austria</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/innovation-in-the-financial-system-federal-reserve-governor-michelle-w-bowman/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It is a pleasure to be back in Salzburg again for the next chapter in the Global Seminar, focusing on financial technology innovations and the developing financial regulatory framework.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240617a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;At this same gathering last year, we discussed the potential evolution of the bank regulatory framework in response to the banking stress during the spring of 2023. At that time, we were taking stock of the regulatory reforms implemented after the 2008 financial crisis and evaluating whether those reforms&mdash;and the resulting bank regulatory and supervisory framework we have now&mdash;were effective and efficient, and whether improvements may be appropriate. Of course, many of those conversations are ongoing in the United States, with proposals&mdash;in varying levels of formality&mdash;under discussion, including new and expanded long-term debt requirements for non-global systemically important banks (G-SIBs), new liquidity requirements, and a host of other supervisory and regulatory reforms. These are in addition to other regulatory reform matters, including Basel III capital reforms and changes to the G-SIB surcharge framework, that are not directly related to the 2023 banking stress.</p>
<p>Policy reforms in the United States, at times and to varying degrees, have arguably suffered from a lack of appropriate prioritization and focus.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240617a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;This trend has been evident recently, when one considers the sheer volume of reforms that have recently been completed, that have been proposed, or that are in the pipeline. Often shortchanged in the rush to implement reforms are considerations of effectiveness and efficiency&mdash;effectiveness in addressing identified shortcomings, and efficiency in providing solutions that address these shortcomings without imposing unnecessary costs or compliance burdens or resulting in unintended consequences.</p>
<p>While much of the reform agenda in the United States has been focused on the response to the 2023 banking stress, in my view, we also need to consider whether we have an appropriate bank regulatory and supervisory framework when it comes to innovation. So, today I would like to discuss how we can create a regulatory environment that fosters successful innovation. I will focus my remarks on the United States, specifically innovation within the "regulatory perimeter" in which regulated institutions&mdash;banks, holding companies, and their affiliates&mdash;operate. However, I think this approach has broader relevance for how regulation can more effectively support and promote innovation, including internationally.</p>
<p>The implications of our regulatory approach go beyond just the banking system. A reflexive "no" from regulators can encourage activity to migrate out of the banking system. The result could be decreased transparency, lower regulatory standards, and increased risks to financial stability. We tend to think that the "stakes" are confined to a particular technology or innovation, but this is a misleading approach. Instead, we should adopt a broader approach that considers financial system stability. To implement a successful "same activity, same risk, same regulation" approach requires either broad-based legislation to coordinate these standards or an effective interagency approach that incorporates regulators beyond traditional banking regulators.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits of Innovation</strong><br />In my experience, regulators love innovation&mdash;in the abstract. The idea of innovation is an alluring one. Among other things, innovation can help develop a faster and more efficient banking and payments system, it can lower the cost and expand the availability of products and services to consumers and businesses, it can improve the speed and reduce counterparty risk of securities transactions, and it can promote market competition.</p>
<p>And we see evidence all around in the banking system where innovation has had transformative effects: we have automated teller machines (ATMs) that allow ready access to cash and basic account services, we have the ability to make electronic payments at merchants both in-person and online, and almost every bank customer can access their bank account or transfer money to a friend by using only their mobile phone. When innovation becomes commonplace, and with the passage of time, we lose sight of the long and sometimes tortured road these innovators traveled to introduce and embed them into customer expectations for banking services.</p>
<p>I see a common theme between innovation as an abstract idea and "established" innovation that has become the new norm in the financial landscape&mdash;namely, that neither of these versions force us to confront the risks of the unknown. The abstract version does not force us to confront its practical implications, including: How does it work? What benefits could it bring? What risks does it present, and how will those risks be managed? Similarly, by the point at which the innovation becomes widely adopted and accepted, hopefully we have done the difficult work. We have come to understand the challenges it presents and have accepted the tradeoffs between the benefits, and the associated risks and costs, of allowing the new technology or process improvement to be introduced into the banking system.</p>
<p>When we think about the abstract, or look back on successful innovation, we lose sight of the unique path forged to ensure its success. Many of the technologies that we will discuss during this conference have the potential to bring benefits, including greater efficiency to banking and payments. So how do we create an environment that allows innovation to flourish and in which regulated banking institutions are able to play a role? In the past I have spoken about three principles that I believe are necessary building blocks to fostering innovation: developing an understanding of the technology, having an open approach to innovation, and making innovation a priority in the development of regulatory frameworks.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240617a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;I would like to revisit these principles today.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding Innovation</strong><br />As a threshold matter, regulators and innovators share some responsibilities when it comes to innovation. Regulators must work hard to understand the functionality of new innovation, including the benefits innovation can bring and its accompanying risks. Regulators must not fall into the trap of complacency. Comfort with the known and familiar risks of how things have always been done can present a barrier. Regulators must be willing to thoughtfully consider the possibilities of innovation within the regulated banking system.</p>
<p>At the same time, innovators must be committed to sharing their understanding and knowledge of innovation with regulators. But in doing so, innovators must not adopt the "sales" mentality that they may use when pitching investors or partners, and instead, acknowledge the unknowns&mdash;the risks that new technology presents, the various ways that the technology could be used or evolve over time, and how the technology could either complement or disrupt the current financial system. Going a step further, they may be best positioned to propose how regulators can best develop a regulatory framework to manage these risks.</p>
<p>This deeper level of understanding may assist regulators in their responsibility to consider how innovation could impact different financial sectors, from small banks to wholesale financial markets, and how those impacts may ultimately affect end users. Of course, regulators must also consider not only the intended objectives of innovation, but they must also anticipate and understand the unintended consequences.</p>
<p>Within the broad category of "understanding" innovation, I see three critical steps that regulators must take: understand the technology and landscape, recognize the use case for the technology, and anticipate the consequences. Each of these is a necessary ingredient for accepting the technology and developing a regulatory framework that effectively fosters innovation.</p>
<p><em>Understanding technology and the landscape</em><br />At its most basic level, many innovations involve a technological component and are situated in a landscape of different parties who may play a role in the use of the technology.</p>
<p>Take for example, distributed ledger technology (DLT), including blockchain, which is the backbone of some innovations that are being explored in the financial system. DLT highlights the challenges presented to regulators in understanding innovation. There are many variations in the application of DLT&mdash;with ongoing research and development creating more variability over time&mdash;which ultimately may complicate understanding how the technology can be used and how different functionality can be incorporated into DLT solutions for different use cases. DLT provides a way for parties to record transfers of digital assets without the need for any centralized authority and relies on multiple participants who coordinate to maintain a synchronized version of the "ledger." DLT combines a number of different design elements&mdash;like distributed data storage, cryptography, and consensus mechanisms&mdash;that support the transfer process, information visibility, and transaction recordkeeping. These design elements can be combined in a number of different ways, and different parties may play a role in its ultimate use.</p>
<p>Understanding technology is an important first step, but regulators also need to be confident in the players who operate in a particular innovative space. Banks of all sizes have a long history of innovation. And the many nonbank providers in this space, including core service providers, often hold the "keys" to innovation when they facilitate the add-on of new technology to core systems. There are also fintechs that may focus on even more transformational uses of technology, in ways that can affect all aspects of banking. Many of the parties involved in financial innovation describe themselves as financial system "disruptors." This may be an apt word to describe some of their ambitions, but it is certainly one that proves the need for a deliberate and cautious approach to regulation. The broad range of participants involved in this space presents another layer of complication. It is especially important for regulators to be able to distill the reality from the prototype hype to achieve a comprehensive understanding necessary to inform a policy viewpoint and ultimately an effective regulatory framework.</p>
<p><em>Understanding the use case</em><br />Apart from understanding the technology, and who may use it, regulators also need to clearly understand the use case&mdash;what existing problem does this technology solve? What are the costs and benefits, and are there tradeoffs policymakers would need to consider if the new technology were introduced or integrated in the existing financial system? DLT has inspired new ways of thinking about the exchange of assets and data, in addition to the role of intermediaries and trusted third parties. And of course, as will be discussed during this conference, artificial intelligence, or "AI," is increasingly discussed for its transformative potential not only in banking, but also in the broader world economy.</p>
<p>While innovation can take many forms, from the regulatory perspective, it is helpful to understand how innovation fits&mdash;or could fit&mdash;into the existing financial system. Does innovation meet customer demands for cheaper or new and innovative products? Does it operate in the background to reduce both the incidence and cost of fraud? Does it lower the cost of basic banking services or improve financial inclusion? Does it allow banks to do a better job evaluating the creditworthiness of their customers and make safer loans?</p>
<p>The "use case" is important because it helps to define the parameters around any particular innovation. Instead of saying the innovation is AI, or tokenization, or DLT, what is it exactly? How does it work? What technology underpins it, and what constraints would be placed on its use? Does its implementation rely on external participants or third parties to accomplish its use? Who has ultimate control over, and responsibility for, the function of the product or service?</p>
<p><em>Understanding the consequences</em><br />While understanding both the technology behind a new innovation and its use case is important, these steps alone are not sufficient. Regulators must also understand, to the extent possible, the consequences of specific innovations. Take, for example, the increasing interest in tokenization. There is a risk that tokenized products and platforms could duplicate existing bank deposits and payment rails, potentially creating parallel systems. How would these parallel systems interact with, or even replace, current systems? Will the products and platforms that duplicate these deposit and payment functions provide the same legal protections for customers and the overall financial system that they currently receive? In the long run, the goal of financial innovation is to integrate the new technology into the fabric of the financial system. To do so in a responsible way, we need to understand the effects the technology will have, including the risks and consequences of introducing it, and the risks and consequences of its wide adoption in the financial system.</p>
<p>It is not my intent to downplay the difficulty of understanding new developments that could change key activities, technology, products, or processes within the financial system. We are in an era of rapid change, and there are a wide range of innovations that may play an important role in the future of the financial system. But within the regulatory perimeter of the banking system, we need to be cautious about the risks of new technology, not only to the safety and soundness of individual financial institutions, but also to financial stability concerns.</p>
<p><strong>Openness to Innovation</strong><br />Earlier I mentioned the importance of ensuring the regulator understands the new technology. But while education is an important first step, it often runs headlong into regulatory skepticism. Often, a regulator's first reaction to proposed innovation in the banking system is not one of openness and acceptance but rather suspicion and concern. The use of emerging technology and innovation may require a change in policy or supervisory approach. It also very often requires regulatory feedback&mdash;ideally before the innovation is introduced or after it has been integrated by a bank and is reviewed during the supervisory process.</p>
<p>To be sure, skepticism is an understandable first reaction to new activities, particularly those that someone seeks to conduct within the regulatory perimeter after its integration. For regulators, the challenge is one of balance. How do we allow innovation to flourish, with sensible supervision and regulation, so that our financial system can reap the gains of innovation while preserving safety and soundness and consumer compliance?</p>
<p>Regulators need to ask whether we have considered the intended and unintended outcomes of a new innovation, and do the benefits of the new technology outweigh its risks? Would the introduction of a new technology or innovation in the banking system require updating our regulatory framework to incorporate clear oversight? Who should have responsibility for oversight, and what roles do we see for different regulators at both the state and federal level?</p>
<p>Transformational technology requires clear, consistent, and transparent guardrails and expectations to govern the activities that are allowed into the regulated financial system. Where current regulation does not contemplate a new activity, should it be acceptable for financial agencies to regulate the activity through supervision and enforcement alone? Or should congressional action address the treatment of these activities in the financial system?</p>
<p>I think it is vital that regulators work with banks through all stages of the innovation life cycle to achieve that baseline understanding I mentioned before. But it is incumbent on regulators to fight the temptation to say "no" and resist new technology and instead focus on solutions&mdash;how can we mitigate the risk of new technology? What benefits will technology bring to the financial system? How can we provide clear regulatory expectations?</p>
<p>I would suggest that adopting a posture receptive to innovation requires a shift in regulatory approach. The current temptation is to pre-judge financial innovation and to take a harsh view. But this resistance approach carries significant risks. One of the most important risks is that financial innovation stagnates or is pushed out of&mdash;and kept out of&mdash;the banking system. Eliminating innovation could result in significant harm to the stability of the financial system and in terms of limiting the role of banking in the economy. Ultimately, this approach could lead to a banking system that may be safer and smaller but also much less effective in providing banking products and services to support the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>In developing this regulatory "openness," I think it is important to acknowledge the shortcomings of our regulatory posture. This requires looking beyond the most immediate impacts on the banking system and considering the broader effects on the financial system. Hostility to innovation&nbsp;<em>within&nbsp;</em>the banking system often results in activity migrating&nbsp;<em>outside&nbsp;</em>of the banking system. This is not an elimination of the underlying risk of these activities. They remain in the financial system but are often subject to less transparency and less regulation than the same activities conducted by banks. There have been a number of examples in which regulatory approach has driven activity outside the banking industry, thereby creating different and less transparent risks.</p>
<p>Take for example mortgage servicing rights. In May, the U.S. Financial Stability Oversight Council released a report on nonbank mortgage servicing, documenting the growth of nonbank mortgage servicing since 2008, and the potential vulnerabilities that these servicers pose, vulnerabilities that could manifest as shocks to the U.S. financial system. As noted in the materials announcing this report, nonbank mortgage companies had servicing rights on 4 percent of U.S. mortgage balances in 2008; by 2022, this percentage had risen to 54 percent.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240617a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;The rapid shift of such activity out of banks and into nonbank mortgage companies should surprise no one, as this was a predictable result of post-2008 regulatory reforms that made it more costly for these activities to be conducted by banks. But equally unsurprising (in my view) is that this shift did not insulate the U.S. financial system from the risks of these activities. The U.S. mortgage industry in the United States is very large&mdash;shifting which entities are favored to conduct these activities merely transferred the risk to less-regulated entities. The mortgages did not disappear, nor did the underlying activities necessary to support this market.</p>
<p><strong>Innovation as a Priority in the Regulatory and Supervisory Agenda</strong><br />Financial innovation must be a core regulatory priority, in the sense that we must devote regulatory and supervisory resources and attention to building a framework that permits responsible innovation to flourish. Our approach must shift from reactive to active and one that facilitates innovation. Regulators must also promote innovation through transparency and open communication, ideally demonstrating a willingness to engage during the development process and within a restricted environment for experimentation.</p>
<p>Shifting to a more tangible example, in some instances there are policy reasons for regulatory hesitation. In the past, I have spoken about cross-border payments as one area that has historically presented many frictions that, at least in theory, could be improved with new innovations and technology. This challenge involves achieving the goal to serve new types of customers and increase the speed of payments without losing or diluting important compliance safeguards that deter criminal activity. Some perceived payment frictions exist for specific policy reasons, not because of issues with existing technology. Therefore, new technology alone cannot solve a particular issue unless it also incorporates the required safeguards.</p>
<p>The challenge is not just understanding innovative solutions to address cross-border payments, but also understanding how the framework itself could or should adjust in the face of innovation. Regulators can serve a valuable role in identifying where a technology solution may have an important "gap," as in the case of cross-border payments, by identifying how a solution can meet the needs of both customers and regulators. Innovation and regulatory and legal requirements can coexist&mdash;providing both enhanced capability and regulatory compliance. Transparency itself can promote innovation.</p>
<p>Our goal should be to develop&mdash;and continually invest in&mdash;building and supporting a clear and sensible regulatory framework. One that allows the private sector to innovate while also maintaining appropriate safeguards. A clear regulatory framework supports private-sector innovators by providing the clarity and consistency that encourage long-term business investment in pursing innovation, while continuing to support today's products and services. A clear regulatory framework empowers supervisors to focus on safety and soundness, while also ensuring a safe and efficient payment system.</p>
<p>The best way to build a regulatory system that is receptive to new financial technologies and innovations is to build on what has been effective in the past. This includes providing clear guidance to banks and the broader public, incorporating innovation into the regulatory agenda in a comprehensive way, and encouraging interaction between industry and regulators. This industry&ndash;regulator interaction must allow for feedback and information sharing throughout the innovation life cycle and incorporate regulatory feedback on innovation.</p>
<p>There is more that can be done to accomplish this. While we should expand opportunities for regulators to provide clear, actionable, and timely feedback on innovation proposals, we should also consider developing regulatory "sandboxes," those designed to allow some degree of testing and experimentation. We should also ensure our regulatory staff understands and appreciates the value of responsible new technologies, so they may contribute to crafting a sensible regulatory approach to financial innovation. The more that regulators understand innovation, the more comfortable they will be in accepting and promoting its adoption in the financial system.</p>
<p>As part of this framework, we also must consider the broader financial system. The "regulatory perimeter" between regulated banks and other parts of the financial system is a permeable barrier, and not only can activities shift between the two&mdash;as we saw with the migration of mortgage servicing in the United States&mdash;but&nbsp;<em>risk</em>&nbsp;can shift between the two as well. As our financial system has grown and become more complex over time, it has also become much more interconnected. Banks often have direct exposure to activities and risks that occur in other parts of the financial system. Even when they do not have direct exposures, they may have indirect exposures to financial stability risks originating in other parts of the financial system.</p>
<p><strong>Closing Thoughts</strong><br />The most unfortunate approach to innovation would be to simply prohibit it, or to impose such onerous standards that effectively discourage innovation or prevent it from developing and flourishing. This approach would not only decrease the importance and relevance of the banking system, but it could also generate new financial stability risks as activity migrates to areas with lower regulatory standards and less transparency. Broadly speaking, the regulatory framework should be dynamic, one that can and should accommodate new technology and services. Where the same underlying activity presents the same risk, there is a strong case to be made for imposing the same type of regulation. But we must successfully balance the standards that protect households and businesses and prohibit criminal and other illicit financial activity with maintaining the safety and soundness of individual financial institutions and the stability of the broader financial system. We must also prioritize working on a whole-of-government approach to ensure we appropriately monitor and manage the risks of financial activity, no matter where those occur. As we continue to enhance our understanding, my hope is that we can strike a more receptive tone to financial innovation, in a way that enables a more innovative, efficient, and effective financial system for the future.</p>

<div> Founders, AEASP, achievements, mentorship, diversity<br />
Summary: Celebrating 50 years of AEASP, reflecting on lessons learned: humility, agility, outreach, mentorship, and celebrating the program's success.<br /><br /> <div>
<p>I am delighted to celebrate 50 years of the American Economic Association's Summer Program (AEASP) with you this evening.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20240614a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;This is a momentous achievement and an historic moment. Not only is the program's continued success a testament to the dedicated efforts of the various faculty, fellows, and administrators, but it is also a testament to the achievements and efforts of its students and alumni. I am incredibly proud of all of you, the program, and its legacy. As an alumna of the program at Stanford University, I was deeply humbled, honored, grateful, and proud to be named co-director and then director of the AEA Summer Program at Michigan State University (MSU) from 2016 to 2020. I am also honored to be the first woman to have served as director of the program and proud to have worked with such an extraordinary group of instructors, administrators, seminar speakers, graduate students, and partners from all over the country who sacrificed their summers and time throughout the year over five years to execute this program each summer. The leadership team&mdash;Thomas Jeitschko, Christine Moser (from Western Michigan University), Antonio Doblas-Madrid, Mary Wortley, and Kirstin Heard&mdash;were great colleagues and instrumental in implementing the program each year. Finally, I am eternally grateful to the staff and leadership of the American Economic Association, who provided critical infrastructure, funding, and guidance; the National Science Foundation for its investment in training economists and in the future of economics; the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, our consummate host during our visit to Chicago each summer; the Board of Governors and individual Federal Reserve Banks for their support; and Western Michigan University, the co-sponsor of the program with MSU.</p>
<p>I would like to share with you just a few lessons I learned while leading the AEASP at MSU. Although the program's main priority is to teach courses that will encourage and prepare students to pursue further study in economics, I would like to highlight a few other features that I think led to success.</p>
<p>First, two key features of the AEASP team and program at MSU were humility and agility. As many of the former directors here know well, every program is a startup when it moves from one university to another. While we started with a detailed plan for all five years, we did not know how everything would turn out and had to be open to experimentation and innovation.</p>
<p>After the first year, it became obvious that the program needed a systematic advising component. Armed with this intensive training in economics, the students still needed help planning next steps back at their home institutions and for the future. The second year, we instituted a mandatory advising session with a faculty administrator on the last day of the program. The students completed a survey with their educational objectives for the next two to three years, and we commented on them. This became a critical and ongoing souvenir of the program. It has been heartwarming to see program alumni stick to these plans and execute them many years after leaving the AEASP.</p>
<p>During the second year, we also realized how important machine learning was becoming to conducting research and to preparing for graduate study in economics. One August, after the program was over, we enrolled in a machine learning short course, learned more about the power of these tools, and incorporated it into the program the next summer. Humility, agility, and being open to new ideas held us in good stead throughout the program in East Lansing.</p>
<p>Second, outreach and recruiting efforts are very important. My own journey and that of many others are evidence that not everyone comes to the field of economics the same way. In our experience, it was helpful to find novel ways to broaden our reach. In addition to traditional outreach methods, we engaged social media, including going to where economists were&mdash;EconTwitter&mdash;to introduce economics departments and interested students to the new program at MSU, to provide general information, and to give updates on students, program activities, and alumni. There were several memorable social media events: Two live social media sessions on different platforms, the Instagram photo contest, and the "Selfies with Sue" [Dynarski] sessions during our excursion to Detroit and Ann Arbor. Successful execution of a social-media strategy resulted in a more diverse applicant pool by type of educational institution and geographical location.</p>
<p>Third, anyone can be a mentor and influence the trajectory of a student or young scholar interested in economics. Students spontaneously became peer mentors to each other, using time they could have used to do their own problem sets or study for their own exams to mentor a student struggling in a course or grappling with misgivings about the path to a PhD instead. Fellows (TAs) came from all over the country and from a variety of economics programs to support the AEASP students and each other as participants in the dissertation brown bag seminar. Instructors, some of whom came from a plethora of other institutions, like Western Michigan University and Barnard College, gave 110 percent to the program and mentored students inside and beyond the classroom, as well as beyond the program. Finally, it was extraordinary, if not moving, to witness so many economists from many different subfields and from around the country come forward and volunteer to be research mentors for the students, especially during the pandemic. I was grateful for all these important mentoring relationships that were forged, that made a substantial contribution to the program, and that demonstrated that anyone at any stage of their career in economics could be a mentor.</p>
<p>Before concluding, I want to take the opportunity to recognize my classmate at Berkeley, gifted and prolific economic theorist, friend, and mentor, Gary Charness. Gary was a dedicated instructor in the AEASP at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and provided very helpful advice as we got the MSU program up and running. He also embodied the notion that people come to economics in different ways, as I mentioned earlier, having had a full career before undertaking graduate work in economics. He passed away last month; otherwise, given his legendary commitment to the program, I believe he would have been here to celebrate with us.</p>
<p>In closing, as an alumna and former director, I feel great joy witnessing the success of the AEASP students and alumni, with many having enrolled in economics PhD programs and others having pursued master's degrees or taken research jobs, including at the Board of Governors and elsewhere in the Federal Reserve System. AEASP alumni also have received National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowships and other competitive fellowships for graduate study. I hope that current AEASP students and alumni will continue not only their own research efforts but also their connections with each other and with a broader network of mentors and alumni.</p>
<p>Congratulations, again, on a half century of the AEA Summer Program! I am honored to have been a part of this important initiative and wonderful event. I am beyond grateful to Marcus Alexis, James Tobin, Andrew Brimmer, Robert Dorfman, Charles Schultze, George Borts, and all of the other founders and early supporters of the program for their vision and to the National Economic Association and all those who have contributed to advocating for and executing this vision over the years. With great pride for its past achievements, I look forward to seeing the program's legacy embodied in the future endeavors of each of its participants. Best of luck over the next 50 years!</p>

<div> Plenary, financial stability, banking sector, non-bank financial intermediation, crypto-asset<br />
Summary:<br />
The FSB Plenary discussed the financial stability outlook, lessons from banking sector turmoil, non-bank financial intermediation, implementation of global regulatory framework for crypto-assets, and nature-related risks. <div>
<p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) Plenary met today in Toronto. The Plenary discussed follow-up work to the lessons learned from the banking sector turmoil and the outlook for global financial stability, as well as the FSB&rsquo;s deliverables to the July G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors meeting.</p>
<h3>Financial stability outlook</h3>
<p>Members discussed recent developments and implications for the financial stability outlook. Although there has been some improvement in the macroeconomic outlook, there are still a number of vulnerabilities in the financial system that require close monitoring. Some asset prices appear to have high valuations, bringing the risk of a sharp correction in the event of a large shock. Members are closely monitoring developments in commercial real estate markets. Market interest rates remain at higher levels than in recent years in a number of jurisdictions. Members noted vulnerabilities and uncertainties in private finance as well as concerns about leverage in non-bank financial institutions. A high-for-long environment could add to debt servicing pressures for borrowers, including more highly indebted companies and households that would need to rollover their financing at higher rates. The challenges arising from the high level of public debt globally and geopolitical uncertainties were also discussed.</p>
<h3>Lessons from the March 2023 banking turmoil</h3>
<p>The FSB&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2023/10/2023-bank-failures-preliminary-lessons-learnt-for-resolution/">review of lessons from the 2023 bank failures</a>, published in October 2023, confirmed the soundness of the international framework provided by the FSB Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes. It also highlighted areas that deserve further attention to ensure effective implementation of the framework.</p>
<p>The Plenary discussed the progress made on the key international work following up on the March 2023 turmoil, including work on public sector backstop funding mechanisms as a last resort; examining interest rate and liquidity risk in the financial system; and exploring vulnerabilities associated with depositor behaviour in light of new technologies and social media.</p>
<p>Members look forward to the completion of this work and will build on this next year by drawing together a holistic view on liquidity risk.</p>
<h3>Non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI)</h3>
<p>The FSB is pursuing a comprehensive work programme to enhance the resilience of non-bank financial intermediation, in coordination with other standard-setting bodies (SSBs). The Plenary discussed progress and next steps for this work.</p>
<p>In 2013, the FSB developed an overall framework to strengthen the oversight and regulation of NBFI, including recommendations with respect to securitisation. The Plenary reviewed the FSB&rsquo;s draft public consultation report on its evaluation of the effects of the G20 financial regulatory reforms on securitisation. The evaluation assesses the extent to which securitisation reforms implemented to date have achieved their financial stability objectives and examines the implications for financing to the real economy. The FSB will launch its public consultation in July and encourages responses.</p>
<p>As part of its NBFI work programme, the FSB is also working on policies to enhance the monitoring of, and to address financial stability risks stemming from, leverage in NBFI, and to enhance the liquidity preparedness of non-bank market participants for margin and collateral calls.</p>
<p>The Plenary also discussed the importance for policy-making of good data quality and availability. Members discussed the value of a data pilot programme to identify and close data gaps for monitoring key open-ended fund vulnerabilities related to liquidity mismatch and discussed how to address other identified data gaps.</p>
<p>The FSB will deliver a report detailing progress on the overall NBFI work programme to the G20 in July.</p>
<h3>Implementation of the FSB&rsquo;s global regulatory framework for crypto-asset activities</h3>
<p>The Plenary welcomed the progress made in implementing the FSB&rsquo;s July 2023&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2023/07/fsb-global-regulatory-framework-for-crypto-asset-activities/">recommendations for addressing financial stability risks relating to crypto-assets</a>. The FSB will continue to closely monitor implementation, not only in FSB member jurisdictions but also in jurisdictions beyond the FSB. Given the particularly acute risk of regulatory arbitrage in the crypto space, broad global implementation is crucial.</p>
<p>Members discussed recent developments in crypto-asset markets and areas that warrant further attention. In emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), crypto-assets pose particular challenges for monetary policy and capital flow management. Members discussed the challenges posed by the relatively higher levels of adoption and risks of global stablecoin arrangements in EMDEs. The FSB will undertake further work to consider how these challenges can be addressed.</p>
<h3>Nature-related risks</h3>
<p>G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors asked the FSB to carry out a stocktake on participating members&rsquo; initiatives concerning financial risks related to nature degradation and biodiversity loss. The Plenary discussed the FSB&rsquo;s draft stocktake on supervisory and regulatory initiatives related to nature-related financial risks. As well as supervisory and regulatory initiatives, the report provides an overview of members&rsquo; analytical work, and members discussed whether and to what extent the degradation of nature and the loss of biodiversity represent a financial risk. The Plenary looks forward to the publication of the report and delivery to the G20 in July.</p>
<h2>Notes to editors</h2>
<p>The FSB published in November 2020 a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2020/11/holistic-review-of-the-march-market-turmoil/">Holistic Review of the March Market Turmoil</a>, which lays out a comprehensive and ambitious work programme for strengthening the resilience of the NBFI sector while preserving its benefits. This work is being carried out within the FSB as well as by its member standard-setting bodies and international organisations, to ensure that relevant experiences and perspectives are brought to bear.</p>
<p>In August 2023, the FSB published a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2023/08/evaluation-on-effects-of-g20-reforms-on-securitisation-summary-terms-of-reference/">Summary Terms of Reference</a>&nbsp;on its evaluation on the effects of G20 reforms on securitisation. The summary terms of reference&nbsp;provide more details on the objectives, scope and process for this evaluation.</p>
<p>The FSB launched a public consultation on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/04/liquidity-preparedness-for-margin-and-collateral-calls-consultation-report/">liquidity preparedness for margin and collateral calls</a>&nbsp;in April. The comment period ends on Tuesday 18 June.</p>
<p>The FSB coordinates at the international level the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies and develops and promotes the implementation of effective regulatory, supervisory, and other financial sector policies in the interest of financial stability. It brings together national authorities responsible for financial stability in 24 countries and jurisdictions, international financial institutions, sector-specific international groupings of regulators and supervisors, and committees of central bank experts. The FSB also conducts outreach with approximately 70 other jurisdictions through its six Regional Consultative Groups.</p>
<p>The FSB is chaired by Klaas Knot, President of De Nederlandsche Bank. The FSB Secretariat is located in Basel, Switzerland and hosted by the Bank for International Settlements.</p>

New York Attorney General Letitia James secured a settlement with Gemini for defrauding investors in its cryptocurrency investment program. Gemini will return $50 million to investors. Attorney General James encourages affected individuals to come forward. <div>

<p>&ldquo;Hundreds of thousands of people, including at least 29,000 New Yorkers, had their trust broken and their money swindled by Gemini through its bogus Earn program,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span>Attorney General James</span>. &ldquo;Gemini marketed its Earn program as a way for investors to grow their money, but actually lied and locked investors out of their accounts.

<p>Under today&rsquo;s settlement, Gemini will return approximately $50 million worth of digital assets to Gemini Earn investors who were locked out of their accounts. Investors do not need to take any action to recover their digital assets and they will be able to access their digital assets in their accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In October 2023, Attorney General James&nbsp;<a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/vmm0dj30.r.us-east-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:*2F*2Fag.ny.gov*2Fpress-release*2F2023*2Fattorney-general-james-sues-cryptocurrency-companies-gemini-genesis-and-dcg/2/010001901790b7f8-11d117ea-a546-4aea-b9e9-f6a4fb14d759-000000/1RDs-xBvTPh72J48PnzFHzwIotQ=378__;JSUlJSU!!Ke5ujdWW74OM!6LjZPKx9mG7mE-8P8OENt5Aqx_duCzxIymm7YsTvME3Fk7xhQMmwn4YsM53CsFkVG9uvY1KnwAkrIOksKQMHnU-Rx60Eggfz8qyRjla3VDKs$">sued Gemini for lying to investors</a>&nbsp;about its Gemini Earn program. Gemini repeatedly assured investors that investing with Genesis through their Gemini Earn program was a low-risk investment. However, OAG&rsquo;s investigation found that Gemini&rsquo;s internal analyses of Genesis showed that the company&rsquo;s financials were risky. The lawsuit alleged that Gemini knew Genesis&rsquo; loans were under-secured and at one point highly concentrated with one entity, Sam Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s Alameda, but did not reveal this information to investors.

<title>Remarks At The 30th Annual International Institute For Securities Market Growth And Development, SEC Commissioner Mark T. Uyeda, Washington D.C., June 14, 2024</title>

<div> Securities, Market, Regulation, Cooperation, Technology
Summary:
Regulatory framework, international cooperation, and technology are crucial for efficient capital markets, investor protection, and economic growth.<br /><br /> <div>
<p>Thank you to all of you for participating in the SEC&rsquo;s 30th Annual International Institute for Securities Market Growth and Development.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-30th-intl-institutes-securities-mrket-growth-development-061424?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;It is a privilege to be here at the end of the first week of the Institute. We are gathered here because of our mutual goals of effective and efficient capital markets, that can lead to economic growth, jobs creation, higher standards of living, and the protection of investors.</p>
<p>The Institute provides a valuable opportunity to meet colleagues from around the world and to discuss regulatory perspectives, technology that you use or have used in the past, and to compare notes. In other words, we can learn from each other&rsquo;s successes and failures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, I will provide some thoughts about a strong regulatory framework, the importance of international cooperation, and the role of technology in finance. I hope we can continue to learn from each other and continue to improve our globally connected capital markets.</p>
<h3>Regulatory Framework</h3>
<p>For capital markets to succeed, there should be a respect for the rule of law and the upholding of contracts. These objectives are rooted in the goals of protecting investors and promoting capital formation. While there are honest firms that seek to raise capital in the market, there are also bad actors that lie, cheat, and steal. Regulators should strive to root out bad actors and promote transparency of disclosures. Otherwise, investors may not trust the markets and will not invest due to fears that they will be defrauded.</p>
<p>Increased cost of capital can negatively impact a country&rsquo;s economic growth and resulting job creation, infrastructure development, and decreased standards of living. When a regulator fails to address fraud and the cost of capital increases, honest entrepreneurs may also be adversely affected, and as a result, they may withdraw from the market. Removing bad actors from the market should lower the cost of capital, resulting in increased investments, greater economic growth, and more prosperity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, any regulatory framework must be cost efficient. When regulation is too costly, especially relative to any benefits from that regulation, it may have the unintended consequence of interfering with capital formation and damaging the capital market&rsquo;s potential. One method for reducing costs is to look for opportunities to eliminate duplicative regulations for companies that access more than one capital market and to cooperate internationally with regulators&rsquo; efforts to oversee and regulate the markets.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>International Cooperation</h3>
<p>The importance of international cooperation cannot be overstated. In 2002, the International Organization of Securities Commissions (&ldquo;IOSCO&rdquo;) adopted its Multilateral Memorandum of Understanding (&ldquo;MMOU&rdquo;), and there are currently 130 signatories to that MMOU.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-30th-intl-institutes-securities-mrket-growth-development-061424?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;In 2016, IOSCO adopted the Enhanced Multilateral Memorandum of Understanding (&ldquo;EMMOU&rdquo;), which included additional powers to obtain and share information.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-30th-intl-institutes-securities-mrket-growth-development-061424?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;As one example of the importance of cooperation, last week, the Korean Financial Supervisory Service acknowledged the growing need for reciprocal international cooperation given the increasing number of cross-border issues.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-30th-intl-institutes-securities-mrket-growth-development-061424?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cooperation goes both ways. The SEC staff routinely seeks international assistance and the assistance that many of you have provided to us has been invaluable. In turn, the SEC has often assisted non-U.S. regulators in their investigations.</p>
<h3>Technology in Finance</h3>
<p>Another way that we can learn from, and cooperate with, each other is through technology. Modern capital markets have the advantage of technology, which has significantly reduced costs and made the capital markets more efficient. Last week, the SEC celebrated its 90th anniversary. Technology has come a long way in 90 years. For example, the settlement of securities transactions used to require the movement of physical securities certificates, checks, and other paper documents. Today, with the benefit of technology, that is no longer the case.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-30th-intl-institutes-securities-mrket-growth-development-061424?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;In fact, countries in Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America have stopped issuing physical certificates all together.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-30th-intl-institutes-securities-mrket-growth-development-061424?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;Technology allows transactions to be settled in a faster, more cost-effective manner and in much larger volumes, and thus facilitated a T+1 settlement cycle for equity securities in the United States.</p>
<p>New technologies and innovations might provide further efficiencies to our global markets and investors. One such technology is tokenization, or the process of converting asset rights into a digital token on a blockchain. Proponents suggest that a wide range of assets can be tokenized, including securities holdings. Tokenization may provide transactions with a higher level of security, transparency, and immutability. It also may remove the need for most intermediaries, streamlining the process and reducing transaction costs.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-30th-intl-institutes-securities-mrket-growth-development-061424?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p>However, as with any new technology or innovative idea, regulators should understand its costs, benefits, and risks. In November 2023, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority&rsquo;s (&ldquo;FCA&rdquo;) Asset Management Task force published a report detailing a &ldquo;blueprint&rdquo; for the implementation of tokenization for FCA-authorized funds.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-30th-intl-institutes-securities-mrket-growth-development-061424?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;In March 2024, a second interim report was published, highlighting use cases and the next stages for fund tokenization.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-30th-intl-institutes-securities-mrket-growth-development-061424?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;While the FCA continues its review of securities tokenization, it is important to highlight the depth of research they are undertaking to allow for innovation and growth while still protecting investors from harm. More importantly, other regulators can review the FCA&rsquo;s research in considering what steps, if any, they might take regarding tokenization.</p>
<p>As technology continues to evolve, regulators will face new and challenging issues. It is important that we continue our regulatory cooperation in order to advance our shared goal of protecting investors and facilitating capital formation.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time this morning. I invite you to maintain communications with my office, should you return to Washington, D.C. in the future. I can be reached through the Office of International Affairs, whom I also thank for their tremendous efforts in organizing this Institute.</p>

<div> elder financial abuse, BCSC, warning signs, prevention, resources<br />
Summary:<br />
BCSC urges awareness of elder financial abuse. Signs include unusual transactions, changes in living, and disappearance of possessions. Prevention and resources available. <div>
<p>The B.C. Securities Commission (BCSC) is urging British Columbians to learn the signs of elder financial abuse ahead of World Elder Abuse Awareness Day on June 15, 2024.</p>
<p>Elder financial abuse &ndash; the use of someone&rsquo;s money without their permission or in a fraudulent way &ndash; continues to be the most common form of elder abuse. The BCSC is highlighting elder financial abuse through a social media outreach campaign during the month of June, reaching thousands of British Columbians to raise awareness that elder financial abuse is a serious issue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Raising awareness about elder financial abuse is one of the most effective tools we have to prevent abuse,&rdquo; said Pamela McDonald, the BCSC&rsquo;s Director of Communications and Education. &ldquo;I encourage all British Columbians to learn the warning signs of elder financial abuse because by doing so, you can help prevent your older loved ones from becoming victims of financial exploitation.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following are some common warning signs of elder financial abuse:</p>
<ul>
<li>unusual financial transactions like increased bank withdrawals or liquidating investments</li>
<li>sudden changes in living arrangements, spending habits or inability to pay bills</li>
<li>unexplained disappearances of valuable possessions, such as jewelry and art, and</li>
<li>discrepancy between standard of living and financial assets.</li>
</ul>
<p>The abuser can be someone the older person trusts and cares about, such as a family member, caregiver, or friend. This personal relationship makes it difficult for the older person to come forward to get help. The abuser may use a variety of tactics to take control of the victim&rsquo;s finances. They may steal their money or bank cards, attempt to take over their investment portfolio or pressure them to make changes to their will or power of attorney.</p>
<p>Older adults can be vulnerable to financial abuse due to isolation, cognitive decline or fear of asking for help because it could affect their independence.&nbsp;Older adults may also be attracted to fraudulent investment offers, like promises of high-returns and low-risk, because they want to maximize their investments for retirement, or they want to leave money for their children and grandchildren.</p>
<p>Resources about elder financial abuse are available on the BCSC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investright.org/avoid-fraud/identify-frauds-and-scams/elder-financial-abuse/" target="_blank">InvestRight.org website</a>, including tips on how to initiate a conversation with a loved one about financial abuse, information about why having a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investright.org/news-and-insights/investing-articles/the-value-of-choosing-a-trusted-contact-person/" target="_blank">Trusted Contact Person</a>&nbsp;is important and instructions on how to report suspected investment fraud.</p>

<title>Canadian Securities Administrators Urge Vigilance Against Online Financial Abuse Of Older Canadians And Highlights The Importance Of A Trusted Contact Person</title>

<div> Elder Abuse, Online Scams, Financial Security, Trusted Contact Person, Canadian Securities Administrators
<br />
The Canadian Securities Administrators urge vigilance against online elder financial abuse, offer tips to avoid scams, and recommend appointing a Trusted Contact Person.
<br /><br />Summary:
The article discusses the growing issue of online financial elder abuse, provides tips to avoid scams, and recommends appointing a Trusted Contact Person for financial security. <div>
<p>In recognition of World Elder Abuse Awareness Day, the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) is urging older adults, and their loved ones, to remain vigilant in the face of growing online financial elder abuse and to remember the importance of naming a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asc.ca/en/News-and-Publications/News-Releases/2024/06/www.securities-administrators.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CSA_TCP101_What_is_a_Trusted_Contact_Person.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Trusted Contact Person</a>&nbsp;(TCP).</p>
<p><strong>Canadian seniors are being targeted with sophisticated online scams</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Older adults can often be the target of financial scams. Scam artists take advantage of those who may be socially isolated or have diminished capacity and who have accumulated savings over time. Advancements in technology, like artificial intelligence (AI), have created new avenues for criminals to exploit these vulnerabilities and deceive victims. AI voice cloning allows scammers to impersonate family members or friends in urgent need of money. AI can also be used to easily manipulate images and videos, known as deepfakes, to create credible personas on dating sites and social media along with fake celebrity endorsement ads.</p>
<p>The CSA urges older Canadians to be cautious and offers these tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Restrict the amount of personal information you share publicly on social media sites by adjusting your privacy settings.</li>
<li>Avoid celebrity or public figure endorsements or investment opportunities promoted online. These are often AI-generated scams.</li>
<li>Be skeptical of new acquaintances or love interests online that take an immediate interest in your finances or offer unrequested investment opportunities, especially involving crypto.</li>
<li>Do not send money online to anyone or invest based solely on the advice of someone you have not met in person.</li>
<li>Check the registration of any individual, firm or platform you plan to invest with by visiting AreTheyRegistered.ca and confirming the identity of the representative by calling the phone number listed.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Trusted Contact Person: a valuable safeguard</strong></p>
<p>Canadians can further protect themselves by assigning a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asc.ca/en/News-and-Publications/News-Releases/2024/06/www.securities-administrators.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CSA_TCP101_What_is_a_Trusted_Contact_Person.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Trusted Contact Person</a>&nbsp;(TCP) to their financial accounts. An appointed TCP gives a financial advisor another resource to turn to if they cannot reach their client, or if they suspect their client may be a victim of financial abuse or fraud. A TCP does not have power of attorney or any access or view into the clients&rsquo; accounts at any time.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p><strong>What is a TCP?</strong></p>
<p>A TCP is a person you authorize your financial firm to contact in limited circumstances.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p><strong>Why have a TCP?</strong></p>
<p>A TCP can be contacted by your registered financial advisor to help you, if needed.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p><strong>Who should have a TCP?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>A TCP is recommended for anyone who has an investment account, especially older Canadians.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take action if you think you or someone you know is being taken advantage of financially. A trusted friend, family member, police officer, lawyer, local securities regulator, or staff member at your financial institution can provide guidance.<br /><br />The CSA also has a number of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/investor-tools/avoiding-fraud/financial-abuse/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">investor tools and resources available online</a>&nbsp;to help Canadians become more informed investors. Investors can follow&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/csa_news?lang=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">@CSA_News</a>&nbsp;on X (formerly Twitter),&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/CSA.ACVM" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">@CSA.ACVM</a>&nbsp;on Facebook and subscribe to the CSA&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/investor-alerts/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Investor Alerts</a>.<br /><br />The CSA, the council of the securities regulators of Canada&rsquo;s provinces and territories, co-ordinates and harmonizes regulation for the Canadian capital markets.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor, has published its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-06/ESMA22-50751485-1453_2023_Annual_Report.pdf">Annual Report for 2023</a>. It sets out the key achievements of the authority&nbsp;in the first year of implementing its new 5-year strategy, delivering on the mission of enhancing investor protection and promoting stable and orderly financial markets in the European Union (EU).</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>Verena Ross, Chair of ESMA, said:&nbsp;</p>
<h6><em>&ldquo;Retail investors are at the core of our strategy through the key role they play in financial markets. In 2023 we saw for the first time that the average cost of investing in certain funds had declined year on year, but there are still significant differences across the Union. We continued our mission to protect investors, including through a mystery shopping exercise on costs and charges under MiFID and targeted warnings about the risks of crypto assets.&nbsp;</em></h6>
<h6><em>As geopolitical tensions and macro-economic developments continued to impact European financial markets in 2023, vigilance and proactive measures by supervisory authorities remained fundamental. ESMA was again at the forefront of coordinating the actions and sharing information between national supervisors in the EU, ensuring common approaches to any crisis responses.</em></h6>
<h6><em>I would like to thank my colleagues in the ESMA Board of Supervisors and Management Board for their continued support.&rdquo;</em></h6>
<p>Natasha Cazenave, Executive Director of ESMA, said:</p>
<h6><em>&ldquo;Consistent with our strategic priority to strengthen supervision of EU financial markets we continued to reinforce and streamline the framework we use to identify supervisory risks, not just within ESMA but also with national supervisors.&nbsp;</em></h6>
<h6><em>As ESMA grows and evolves in a complex environment with rapid technological innovation and challenging economic conditions, we focus on retaining a strong culture internally and stay rooted in a clear set of values. This allows us to have the necessary agility needed to continue delivering on our strategic priorities.</em></h6>
<h6><em>I would like to warmly thank all the staff for their commitment and enthusiasm in delivering on ESMA&rsquo;s mission.&rdquo;</em></h6>
<h4><br /><span>ESMA's key achievements in 2023&nbsp;</span></h4>
<p>Throughout the year, ESMA actively monitored risks and resilience of financial markets, contributed to completing the single rulebook and supported supervisory convergence notably through extensive work in the digital finance space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ESMA&rsquo;s key accomplishments during 2023 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exploring new areas of regulation and working closely with EBA and EIOPA in preparation for the implementation of Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA).</li>
<li>Preparing for Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) implementation and together with the NCAs fostering convergent authorisation and supervision approaches,&nbsp;providing guidance to market participants,&nbsp;conducting consultations on detailed rules,&nbsp;and collaborating with international bodies on crypto-asset regulation.</li>
<li>Enhancing supervisory convergence through peer reviews on the supervision of central counterparties (CCPs) and central securities depositories (CSDs),&nbsp;identifying areas for improvement and issuing recommendations to ensure consistent supervision across the EU.</li>
<li>Monitoring retail investment markets and reporting on the costs and performance of retail investment products,&nbsp;highlighting cost reductions and variations across products and Member States,&nbsp;and recommending that investors carefully evaluate costs and diversify investments.</li>
<li>Enhancing sustainability disclosures through active participation in the development and application of European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) and in the IOSCO endorsement of the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Launching a new data strategy for 2023-2028,&nbsp;aiming to leverage technology and data to improve market supervision and investor protection.&nbsp;The strategy outlines six key objectives to enhance data utilization, reduce reporting burden and promote data-driven supervision.</li>
<li>Assessing greenwashing through a progress report on greenwashing risks and supervision,&nbsp;setting out a definition of greenwashing agreed with EBA and EIOPA, identifying material risks across the sustainable investment value chain and outlining preliminary remediation actions.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>These achievements reflect ESMA's commitment to navigating the evolving financial landscape,&nbsp;ensuring effective regulation and supervision,&nbsp;and protecting investors in the EU.</p>

<title>LuxSE Reports 7% Revenue Growth For 2023</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: Luxembourg Stock Exchange, financial results, sustainable finance, trading offering, sustainability strategy<br />
Summary: LuxSE had a strong year in 2023, with increased activity and market share, particularly in sustainable finance and trading offerings. Sustainability is integrated into its strategy.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p class="paragraph"><span class="eop"><b><span>Despite a challenging macro-economic and geopolitical context, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange maintained a strong activity level in 2023, increased its global market share in international debt listings, and kept its position as the reference exchange for sustainable securities.</span></b></span><span class="normaltextrun"><b><span></span></b></span></p>
<p class="paragraph">At the annual general meeting of<b> </b>the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (LuxSE) held earlier today, the stock exchange released its financial results for the financial year ending on 31 December 2023, reporting a solid performance against the backdrop of a complex geopolitical and economic environment.</p>
<p class="paragraph">LuxSE reported operational revenues of EUR 40.8 million for 2023, which represents a year-over-year revenue growth of 7%. The stock exchange also reported a net profit of EUR 10.6 million for the same period, driven by robust operational results.</p>
<p class="paragraph">&ldquo;We are delighted to report that the Luxembourg Stock Exchange has demonstrated a strong performance last year, marked by a significant increase in activity levels across listing, data and trading, which we see as a direct result of our strategic developments. Beyond achieving substantial revenue growth, LuxSE remained the reference exchange for sustainable finance and further expanded its leadership position in international bond listings. We also explored AI solutions and advanced the digital transformation of our core listing system, and we remain committed to driving progress and innovation in these critical areas,&rdquo; commented Julie Becker, CEO of LuxSE.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph"><b>Listing activity at a 15-year high</b></h4>
<p class="paragraph">LuxSE welcomed 13,900 new listings in 2023, a 13% increase year over year and representing the highest number of new listings in a single year since 2007. This led LuxSE to increase its global market share in listed international bonds, capturing 34% of the market in 2023, according to figures from Dealogic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="paragraph">With 42,494 securities admitted on its markets and on the Securities Official List as of 31 December 2023, including more than 38,000 debt instruments, LuxSE reported a 4% increase year over year in the total number of listed securities at year end.</p>
<p class="paragraph">&ldquo;LuxSE remains the undisputed leader in the listing of international debt securities. However, competition is getting fiercer and through the implementation of our 4-year strategic plan, we are working to strengthen our core activities while exploring new business opportunities. LuxSE has a key role to play both in Luxembourg and in global markets, and we are capitalising on its unique expertise and positioning to ensure that it will remain a relevant,</p>
<p class="paragraph">innovative and sustainable exchange in the long term,&rdquo; stated Alain Kinsch, President of the Board of Directors of LuxSE.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph"><b>Doubling down on sustainable finance</b></h4>
<p class="paragraph">The macroeconomic environment caused a slowdown in the global sustainable bond market in 2023, resulting in a 6% decline in global issuance volumes compared to 2022, according</p>
<p class="paragraph">to estimates from Dealogic. Despite the global trend, LGX displayed 554 new green, social, sustainability and sustainability-linked (GSSS) bonds in the course of 2023, a 4% increase compared to 2022. The new GSSS bonds on LGX raised a total of EUR 207 billion for specific green and social projects and sustainable developments across the world, which is consistent with the previous year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph"><b>Strengthening the trading offering</b></h4>
<p class="paragraph">In the context of the discussions around the Capital Markets Union and the European Union&rsquo;s Retail Investment Strategy, in 2023, LuxSE made it a priority to further facilitate access to its trading platform. The exchange welcomed four new trading members and made available LuxTrader, a tool which greatly reduces the costs and complexities of setting up a technical connection to LuxSE&rsquo;s markets for brokers and banks. This and other developments resulted in a 20% increase in the number of trades executed on LuxSE&rsquo;s markets in 2023.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph"><b>Sustainability an integrated part of the strategy </b></h4>
<p class="paragraph">Along with its financial results, LuxSE also published its Sustainability Report 2023. The report reflects the progress made towards the three pillars of the exchange&rsquo;s sustainability strategy, namely climate transition, education and gender equality, and describes how LuxSE is embedding its sustainability strategy into its operations and business strategy.</p>

<div> Collaboration, Ripple, Archax, XRPL, RWA tokenization
Summary:<br />Ripple and Archax extend collaboration to bring real world assets to the XRPL, establishing it as a leading blockchain for RWA tokenization. Compliance-focused partnerships drive mainstream adoption. <br /> <div>
<p align="left"><span>Ripple, the leader in enterprise blockchain and crypto solutions, and Archax, the UK&rsquo;s first Financial Conduct Authority regulated digital asset exchange, broker and custodian, today announced an extension to their existing collaboration which is expected to bring hundreds of millions of dollars of tokenized real world assets (RWAs) onto the XRP Ledger (XRPL) over the coming year and establish the XRPL as one of the leading blockchains for RWA tokenization.</span></p>
<div class="dombanner"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Archax works with leading financial institutions to enable them to tokenize their financial RWAs. As a result of this collaboration, financial institutions will be able to select the XRPL to tokenize their RWAs, creating opportunities for numerous downstream use cases for these assets.</span></p>
<p><span>The agreement represents an evolution of the relationship between Ripple and Archax which was established in 2022 when Archax collaborated with Metaco to offer digital asset custody services to its clients. Metaco was acquired by Ripple in mid-2023.</span></p>
<p><span>The XRPL is an open-source public decentralized Layer 1 blockchain. With built-in capabilities like tokenization, a native decentralized exchange, compliance features and more, the XRPL is built to power institutional-grade financial use cases.</span></p>
<p><span>"Our industry is at the start of the next major adoption stage in which blockchain technology will deliver real utility in financial markets at scale," said Markus Infanger, SVP, RippleX. "Ripple is excited to see Archax&rsquo;s vision of driving the adoption of blockchain and digital assets technology amongst financial institutions come to life, while further underlining the credentials of the XRPL as one of the leading blockchains for RWA tokenization.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>Ripple and Archax share a compliance-first mindset. Both companies work proactively with regulators and policymakers around the world to bring the benefits of crypto and blockchain technology to the world&rsquo;s global financial infrastructure. As the first and only FCA-regulated digital securities exchange, custodian and brokerage, Archax is uniquely positioned to provide its clients with the means to derive the benefits of DeFi through RWA tokenization, all underpinned by the strength and capabilities of the XRPL.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;We have hit the tipping point for mainstream adoption of digital assets for real world use cases,&rdquo; said Graham Rodford, CEO, Archax. &ldquo;There is clear real-world utility in use cases like RWA tokenization for the operational efficiency, access to liquid markets and transparency inherent to crypto, and Archax has already tokenised assets such as equities, debt instruments and money market funds. Financial institutions are now understanding this and we are excited to play our part in helping them to embrace the technology by bringing their assets onto the XRPL.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>The XRPL provides a strong foundation for RWA tokenization and institutional-grade DeFi thanks to its proven reliability, efficiency, and its roadmap of comprehensive features such as an Automated Market Maker (AMM) currently live on the XRPL as well as the upcoming Decentralized Identifier (DID), Multi-Purpose Tokens (MPT) capability, a Lending Protocol, and Oracles. Over the past decade, the XRPL has been the home of over 1,000 projects, processing over 2.8 billion transactions without failure or security breach since 2012 and supporting over 5 million active wallets with a network of over 120 validators.</span></p>
<p><span>The partnership has been announced at XRP Ledger APEX 2024, the largest annual XRPL summit, which is taking place between June 11-13, 2024 in Amsterdam.</span></p>

We are therefore pleased to be presenting for consultation the latest proposed enhancements to the Corporate Governance Code.

<li class="spanHeading"><span>Promoting diversity</span><span>&nbsp;&ndash; to require: (i) the nomination committee to comprise directors of different genders (<em>New CP</em>); (ii) annual reviews of board diversity policy (<em>Upgraded to MDR</em>); and (iii) a workforce diversity policy (<em>New Rule</em>).</span><br /><br /></li>
<li class="spanHeading"><span>Enhancing risk management and internal controls</span><span>&nbsp;&ndash; to require (at least) an annual review of these systems and enhanced disclosures of the review and findings (<em>Upgraded to MDR</em>).</span><br /><br /></li>

<div> enforcement, technology, ASIC, court, digital transformation
Summary: ASIC presents enforcement statistics, court outcomes, and its digital transformation plans. It highlights specific cases and the importance of data and technology. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to appear today.</p>
<p>I am joined today by Deputy Chair Sarah Court and Commissioners Kate O&rsquo;Rourke, Alan Kirkland and Simone Constant.</p>
<p>Also present today are Chief Executive Officer, Greg Yanco, our General Counsel, Chris Savundra; our Executive Director of Markets, Calissa Aldridge and our Chief Financial Officer, Peter Dunlop.</p>
<p>Last time we appeared before this Committee in April, there was significant interest by members in relation to our enforcement activity and actions.</p>
<p>As at 30<span>th</span>&nbsp;April (over a 12-month period), we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>commenced over 130 new investigations, this is an increase of around 25% on the previous year; and</li>
<li>filed 29 new civil proceedings in the Federal Court (against 64 defendants), representing an increase of 11% in civil proceedings on the previous year.</li>
<li>Investigations have led to 23 individuals charged by the CDPP for criminal offences with 16 convictions with a total $936,000 in fines ordered by the courts.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ASIC is one of the nation&rsquo;s most active law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>Amongst our domestic peers, I don&rsquo;t think you will find a regulator in court more often than we are.</p>
<p>As members will be aware, court action can be costly, resource-intensive, and it can be complex. No two cases are the same.</p>
<p>We pursue court-based outcomes and substantial penalties when we find evidence of serious misconduct and it is in the public interest to do so.</p>
<p>Our enforcement outcomes are strong &ndash; our record shows that ASIC is securing materially higher penalties than it did a decade ago.</p>
<p>We also pursue difficult cases where the outcome is not guaranteed, but we consider it important to test the law.</p>
<p>Some matters can run over several years, particularly if appeals are involved.</p>
<p>There are two recent examples I&rsquo;d like to share with the Committee which demonstrate public interest outcomes that ASIC has achieved through the courts.</p>
<p>Firstly, the Committee will be familiar with the final stop order we issued under the design and distribution obligations regime against Coral Coast Distributors Pty Ltd.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s stop order prohibits Coral Coast from allowing its customers to use Centrepay to pay for items at its Urban Rampage stores.</p>
<p>Coral Coast has applied to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for a review of ASIC&rsquo;s decision to make a final stop order and for a stay of that order pending the hearing of this application.</p>
<p>We strongly defended our position.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the Tribunal rejected Coral Coast&rsquo;s application for a stay.</p>
<p>This is a positive and welcome outcome for vulnerable First Nations consumers.</p>
<p>Where ASIC sees conduct that places consumers at risk of financial harm, we will act to stop it.</p>
<p>Secondly, in late May, ASIC secured a guilty plea in its ongoing proceedings against John Bigatton, the Australian promoter of the now-collapsed investment vehicle BitConnect.</p>
<p>BitConnect was a financial services business and online crypto platform, which required investors to acquire a BitConnect Coin - a form of cryptocurrency token - in order to invest its investment opportunities.</p>
<p>In promoting this financial product, Mr Bigatton provided unlicensed financial advice in seminars around the country, as well as online via social media.</p>
<p>Mr Bigatton will proceed to sentencing hearing next month.</p>
<p>Back in September 2020, ASIC banned Mr Bigatton from providing financial services for seven years.</p>
<p>This work demonstrates our ongoing commitment to combatting misconduct arising from emerging technologies like cryptocurrency using the regulatory tools and legal frameworks available to us.</p>
<p>Both the Coral Coast and BitConnect examples highlight the complexity, time and resources involved in many of our cases.</p>
<p>But we run them for good reason.</p>
<p>We do not believe that it is in the public interest for serious contraventions to go unpunished.</p>
<h2>ASIC&rsquo;s digital transformation</h2>
<p>Enforcement and compliance work requires investment in technology &ndash; any regulator will tell you that.</p>
<p>In this environment of rapid change, that technology is more important than ever.</p>
<p>The Financial Regulator Assessment Authority (FRAA) recommended that ASIC needed a substantial uplift in its data and technology capability.</p>
<p>ASIC wholeheartedly agrees with this recommendation.</p>
<p>ASIC is in a digital arms race, with AI rapidly being adopted in financial services firms and digitally-enabled misconduct is on the rise.</p>
<p>We need to be a leading digitally enabled and data-informed regulator who is ahead of the game.</p>
<p>To support this vision, we have developed a digital target state and we received initial funding in the recent federal budget to commence a program of work to uplift our cyber security across our regulatory systems which will set us on firm foundations for our digital uplift.</p>
<p>We will now move to implement these initiatives, including a new &lsquo;threat intelligence platform&rsquo; to improve information collection and real-time detection of internal and external cyber threats.</p>
<p>Last year, ASIC seized and reviewed 2.6 million documents, as part of its investigations.</p>
<p>The time to collect, process and sift through this volume of data to find the "needle in the haystack" and make the connections with other data sets we've previously collected is exceedingly labour-intensive, relying heavily on manual efforts from our investigators.</p>
<p>Bolstering our data and analytics capabilities through investment in creating a unified view of entities, coupled with advanced analytics, would significantly expedite ASIC's ability to connect disparate data sets, and accelerate the investigation process.</p>
<p>This improvement would not only aid in bringing relief to victims more swiftly, but also serve as a deterrent to potential bad actors.</p>
<p>Transitioning to a leading digitally enabled and data-informed regulator reduces the dependency on human intuition and experience for decision-making.</p>
<p>We know that utilising innovative digital and data driven approaches works.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s innovative approach to tackling investment scams with website takedown powers, has seen us shutter about 5000 scam websites since 1 July 2023, all to help protect consumers.</p>
<p>This is work that has been recognised globally in the last fortnight, with ASIC to help lead a new anti-scams working group of regulators in Asia-Pacific to tackle the issue in our region.</p>
<p>A further uplift in data capabilities will empower ASIC to make more timely decisions regarding resource allocation and fine-tuning of priorities across prevention, investigation, and enforcement efforts.</p>
<p>These advancements will enable us to achieve better outcomes and bolster public trust and confidence in the Australian financial system.</p>
<p>Finally, in recent weeks, I have had the opportunity to discuss the priorities of financial and markets&rsquo; regulators across a range of jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The rise and use of AI and the proliferation and impact of digitally-enabled scams were significant areas of focus at the recent meeting of the International Organization of Securities Commissions.</p>
<p>So too were the growth in private markets and sustainable finance and climate disclosure reporting.</p>
<p>It is reassuring that the issues ASIC is focused on in Australia, are the same as our global peers.</p>
<p>We look forward to answering the Committee&rsquo;s questions.</p>

<div> FMA, smaller firms, Fair Conduct Programme, Financial Institution licence, CoFI
Summary:<br /><br />The FMA has published an information sheet for smaller firms on establishing and maintaining a Fair Conduct Programme and applying for a CoFI licence. It provides support with examples and principles-based guidance. The FMA is taking an educative approach to help firms transition into the new CoFI regime, providing ongoing support through the application process. Fair Conduct Programmes should be proportionate to the size and complexity of each firm's business and are expected to evolve over time. Small firms are encouraged to read the information sheet and attend CoFI workshops. It's important for all firms to get their licence applications in well in advance of the deadline. <div>
<p><span class="EOP SCXW234653080 BCX8">The Financial Markets Authority (FMA) &ndash; Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko &ndash; has today published an information sheet specifically for smaller firms to assist in establishing and maintaining a Fair Conduct Programme (FCP) and applying for a Financial Institution (CoFI) licence. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="EOP SCXW234653080 BCX8">The sheet provides information and examples to help smaller firms establish, implement and maintain their FCP. Financial institutions are required to have an FCP that is designed to ensure their compliance with the fair conduct principle, as set out in the Financial Markets (Conduct of Institutions) Amendment Act 2022. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="EOP SCXW234653080 BCX8">The fair conduct principle is the overarching principle of CoFI that a financial institution must treat consumers fairly. The CoFI regime is designed to protect consumers by putting them at the forefront of institutions&rsquo; decisions and actions. CoFI is principles-based and the requirements for FCPs have been designed to enable and accommodate a wide variety of financial institutions to design and implement processes and controls in their business that work to ensure that consumers they deal with are treated fairly.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="EOP SCXW234653080 BCX8">The information sheet is the latest piece of support from the FMA to help smaller firms prepare for the new regime when it comes into effect in March 2025. The FMA continues to take a supportive and educative approach to implementing and transitioning firms into the new CoFI regime, as it has shown with the Financial Advice regime and the new Climate Related Disclosure regime.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="EOP SCXW234653080 BCX8">The FMA has held numerous market engagements to help firms understand what obligations and requirements they must meet under the new legislation. This includes two webinars with approximately 150 people in attendance. Forty firms provided feedback on how the FMA can best support them following recent engagement. FMA staff have held 11 one-on-one clinics with smaller firms, while 20 other firms have expressed interest in a one-on-one session. The FMA will continue to provide ongoing support to firms through the application process.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="EOP SCXW234653080 BCX8">FMA Executive Director of Regulatory Delivery Clare Bolingford said: &ldquo;We have some great examples of working with a diverse range and size of businesses from the financial advice sector while we implemented the new advice regime. CoFI is also principles-based and therefore we won&rsquo;t be taking a &lsquo;one size fits all&rsquo; approach to the way that firms meet the minimum requirements. Each firm&rsquo;s Fair Conduct Programme needs to be the proportionate to the nature, size and complexity of its business. We expect smaller firms will need a less complex FCP compared to bigger financial institutions. We also expect firms to review and evolve their FCPs over time. FCPs do not need to be fully implemented until the regime comes into force.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="EOP SCXW234653080 BCX8">&ldquo;I encourage all small firms to read the information sheet and attend our CoFI workshops. The FMA is here to support firms on their journey. It is also a timely reminder for all firms to get their licence applications in well in advance of the March 2025 deadline for obtaining a licence.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>

<title>SEC: Terraform And Kwon To Pay $4.5 Billion Following Fraud Verdict - Kwon To Contribute More Than $200 Million, Terraform To Wind Down, And Assets To Be Distributed To Investor Victims And Creditors In Bankruptcy</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-terraform-and-kwon-to-pay-45-billion-following-fraud-verdict-kwon-to-co/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Terraform Labs PTE, Ltd. and Do Kwon agreed to pay more than $4.5 billion following a unanimous jury verdict holding them liable for orchestrating a years-long fraud involving crypto asset securities that led to massive investor losses when the scheme unraveled.</p>
<p>A nine-day jury trial in April exposed the extent of the defendants&rsquo; lies to victims about the false use of the Terraform blockchain to settle transactions and about the stability of their crypto asset security, UST. The SEC also offered evidence at trial showing that, in May 2022, after UST de-pegged from the U.S. dollar, the price of UST and Terraform&rsquo;s other tokens plummeted to close to zero. This wiped out $40 billion in market value nearly overnight and caused devastating losses to countless investors, including numerous retail investors who believed defendants&rsquo; lies and poured their life savings into Terraform&rsquo;s ecosystem.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This case affirms what court after court has said: The economic realities of a product&mdash;not the labels, the spin, or the hype&mdash;determine whether it is a security under the securities laws,&rdquo; said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. &ldquo;Terraform and Do Kwon&rsquo;s fraudulent activities caused devastating losses for investors, in some cases wiping out entire life savings. Their fraud serves as a reminder that, when firms fail to comply with the law, investors get hurt. Terraform and Kwon fought our efforts to investigate &ndash; taking a fight over investigative subpoenas all the way to the Supreme Court. Thankfully, with this settlement, the victims of their massive fraud will now get some justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do Kwon and Terra orchestrated one of the largest securities frauds in U.S. history by, among other things, falsely claiming that they had achieved the Holy Grail of crypto: a non-illicit use case. As the jury found, that was a lie, as was their claim of creating an &lsquo;algorithmic stablecoin.&rsquo; In the end, all they succeeded in doing was lying to investors, wiping out tens of billions of dollars in market value, and creating a trail of victims,&rdquo; said Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s multi-billion dollar settlement not only holds them accountable and prioritizes the return of hundreds of millions of dollars to harmed investors, but also makes clear that, despite the vast resources that crypto asset defendants deploy against us, the dedicated staff of the Division of Enforcement will not stop until they achieve justice for the victims of these breathtaking frauds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC charged Terraform and Kwon in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on February 16, 2023, with securities fraud and for offering and selling securities in unregistered transactions. On December 28, 2023, the District Court found Terraform and Kwon liable for offering and selling crypto asset securities in unregistered transactions. On January 21, 2024, Terraform filed a voluntary Chapter 11 petition in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. On April 5, 2024, a jury unanimously found Terraform and Kwon liable for securities fraud after less than two hours of deliberation.</p>
<p>As part of the settlement, Terraform agreed to pay $3,586,875,883 in disgorgement, $466,952,423 in prejudgment interest, and a $420,000,000 civil penalty. Terraform also agreed to stop selling its crypto asset securities, wind down its operations, replace two of its directors, and distribute its remaining assets to investor victims and creditors through a liquidation plan, subject to approval by the court in Terraform&rsquo;s pending bankruptcy case.</p>
<p>Kwon agreed to pay $110,000,000 in disgorgement and $14,320,196 in prejudgment interest on a joint and several basis with Terraform, as well as an $80,000,000 civil penalty.</p>
<p>In addition, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining them from violating the registration and fraud provisions they violated.</p>
<p>The litigation is being handled by Devon Staren, Laura Meehan, Christopher Carney, and Carina Cuellar from the Trial Unit, as well as Roger Landsman, and supervised by James Connor and Jorge Tenreiro. The SEC is represented in Terraform&rsquo;s bankruptcy case by Therese Scheuer, Michael Kelly, and William Uptegrove, with supervision by Alistaire Bambach. The investigation was conducted by Mr. Landsman, Elisabeth Goot, Kathleen Hitchins, James Murtha, Daniel Koster, Donald Battle, and David Crosbie and was supervised by Reid Muoio, Osman Nawaz, Mr. Tenreiro, and David Hirsch from the Complex Financial Instruments and Crypto Assets and Cyber Units.</p>

<title>FSI, ICI, IRI, SIFMA Urge Senate Passage Of Financial Exploitation Prevention Act - Call Comes Ahead Of World Elder Abuse Awareness Day</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/fsi-ici-iri-sifma-urge-senate-passage-of-financial-exploitation-prevention-ac/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/fsi-ici-iri-sifma-urge-senate-passage-of-financial-exploitation-prevention-ac/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As World Elder Abuse Awareness Day approaches, the Financial Services Institute (FSI), the Investment Company Institute (ICI), the Insured Retirement Institute, and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) call on senators to pass the Financial Exploitation Prevention Act (S. 1841) and for President Biden to sign it into law. The bill aims to protect vulnerable adults from financial exploitation by permitting companies to postpone securities redemption if they suspect exploitation of seniors or individuals unable to protect their interests.</p>
<p>The bipartisan legislation, introduced by Senators Bill Hagerty (R-TN) and Jon Tester (D-MT) and Representatives Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ-05) and Ann Wagner (R-MO-02), comes at a time when financial exploitation of seniors is increasing. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, in 2022, there were 167,889 reported fraud or other financial incidents committed against adults aged 65 or older&nbsp;<a href="https://learcat.bjs.ojp.gov/IncidentsCrime?Data%20Year=2022&amp;Unit%20of%20Analysis=Count&amp;Crime%20Type=Fraud%20and%20Other%20Financial%20Crimes&amp;Victim%20Age%20-%20Null%20Handle=Age%2065%20and%20Older">[1]</a>. In 2023, elder fraud complaints increased by 14%, with corresponding losses rising by 11%&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2023_IC3ElderFraudReport.pdf" target="_blank">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As we mark World Elder Abuse Awareness Day, we applaud lawmakers for their commitment to preventing elder financial abuse and increasing protection for seniors,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span>FSI President and CEO Dale Brown</span>. &ldquo;However, there is more to do, which is why we urge the Senate to pass the Financial Exploitation Prevention Act now. With the increase in new technologies, including AI, financial fraudsters are growing more sophisticated in their schemes to defraud seniors. Financial advisors often serve as the first line of defense in detecting and preventing elder financial abuse and fraud, and this legislation equips our members with the necessary tools to best protect senior clients.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We strongly support the efforts in the Senate to pass the Financial Exploitation Prevention Act (S. 1841) to protect our senior citizens from the threat of financial exploitation,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span>SIFMA President and CEO Ken Bentsen</span>. &ldquo;This legislation is a helpful, additional tool in providing essential safeguards for vulnerable adults. As financial crimes against seniors continue to rise, it is imperative that we equip our industry with the tools needed to combat these increasingly sophisticated schemes. We commend the bipartisan effort behind this bill and call on President Biden to sign it into law. By doing so, we take an additional step towards ensuring the financial security and dignity of our elder population.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mutual funds are vital to building financial security for millions of Americans, and around a third of those are seniors. The bill would give our industry better tools to address suspected financial exploitation and abuse of seniors and those with mental and physical disabilities,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span>ICI CEO and President Eric J. Pan</span>. &ldquo;As we approach World Elder Abuse Awareness Day, ICI thanks Senators Hagerty and Tester and Representatives Wagner and Gottheimer for their leadership on this important legislation. We urge the Senate to pass the bipartisan Financial Exploitation Prevention Act swiftly so seniors and vulnerable investors can receive a greater level of protection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prevention of financial exploitation and the protection of older and vulnerable Americans is an important IRI objective,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span>Wayne Chopus, President and CEO of IRI</span>. &ldquo;Our members are on the front lines of this issue, working with clients across America every day. As a result, they are often the first to notice that a client may be the victim of a financial crime. We urge the Senate to act quickly to pass this bipartisan solution to protect retirees and their hard-earned savings from the potentially devastating effects of economic exploitation and fraud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Last year, the House of Representatives unanimously passed the bill, a pivotal step in preventing the financial exploitation of vulnerable adults.</p>

<title>Oral Testimony Before The Subcommittee On Financial Services And General Government, SEC Chair Gary Gensler, Washington D.C., June 13, 2024</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> SEC, budget request, market growth, funding, oversight <br />
Summary: The SEC is requesting increased funding due to market growth, increased workload, and the need for more oversight to prevent wrongdoing.  <div>
<p>Good morning, Chair Van Hollen, Ranking Member Hagerty, and members of the Subcommittee. Thank you for inviting me to testify today on the Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s Fiscal Year (FY) 2025 budget request.</p>
<p>As is customary, I&rsquo;d like to note that my views are my own as Chair of the SEC, and I am not speaking on behalf of my fellow Commissioners or the SEC staff.</p>
<p>At the SEC, we just had our 90th birthday last week.</p>
<p>Congress and President Roosevelt set up our agency in the aftermath of the Great Depression to ensure that our capital markets work for investors and issuers alike.</p>
<p>They knew this was critical to restoring trust in the markets and promote the economy. The SEC they created serves investors building for a better future and issuers raising money to fund innovation, while overseeing the capital markets where they meet.</p>
<p>The SEC is the cop on the beat watching out for the investing public and issuers.</p>
<p>I believe the securities laws and this agency have been a significant contributor to our economic success as well as the U.S. dollar&rsquo;s global role ever since.</p>
<p>Today, the $110-plus trillion U.S. capital markets are the deepest, most liquid in the world.</p>
<p>We cannot, however, take this leadership for granted.</p>
<p>Today, our limited resources contrast against the tremendous growth and change in our markets.</p>
<p>In the face of this significant growth in registrants, complexity, and individual investor engagement in markets, one may have thought that our agency would have grown. The reverse was the case&mdash;the SEC actually shrank between 2016 and 2022. With Congress&rsquo;s help, we were authorized to hire 400 people in FY 2023 to bring us just modestly above where we were in 2016.</p>
<p>While our funding was kept flat for FY 2024, growth in market activity was anything but flat. We are losing pace with the ever-increasing scale of the capital markets.</p>
<p>Transaction volume in listed equities doubled in the last five years and tripled in the last 17.</p>
<p>Today, more than 15,400 registered investment advisers advise 57 million clients. At the end of 2016, by comparison, 12,000 registered investment advisers advised 43 million clients.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d note that the more than $32 trillion in registered funds and $30 trillion in private funds each are larger than the entire $23 trillion U.S. banking system.</p>
<p>Such growth and rapid change also mean more possibility for wrongdoing. We&rsquo;ve seen the number of tips, complaints, and referrals we get climb from 16,700 in 2019 to 40,000 in 2023.</p>
<p>Allow me to put flat funding into context. Seventy percent of our budget is for staff, 15 percent technology, 5 percent facilities, and 10 percent everything else. Flat funding means cutting staffing, technology, and real estate.</p>
<p>We have paused on nearly all job postings and backfilling for departing staff. We are currently more than 300 positions below the level Congress authorized for both FY 2023 and 2024.</p>
<p>While the agency&rsquo;s rules get outsized attention in the media, the vast majority of the SEC&rsquo;s staff works on oversight of the markets and responding to inquiries. We collectively review tens of thousands of filings a year.</p>
<p>Without additional resources, oversight of markets is at risk. Our ability to find bad actors is at risk. Our responsiveness to market participants is at risk. American capital formation and innovation are at risk as issuers will have to wait longer to hear from us.</p>
<p>As this Committee continues its work, it&rsquo;s worth noting the SEC&rsquo;s funding is deficit-neutral; our appropriations are offset by transaction fees.</p>
<p>I am pleased to take your questions.</p>

<div> repatriation, misappropriated funds, 1MDB, international money laundering, embezzlement
<br /><br />Summary:
The Justice Department repatriated $156 million in misappropriated 1MDB funds, totaling $1.4 billion. The funds were laundered through major financial institutions worldwide. The embezzlement proceeds were used for bribes and extravagant items. The Justice Department led the seizure of over $1.7 billion in stolen assets. The funds were intended to promote economic development in Malaysia but were misappropriated for personal use. The Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative aims to forfeit the proceeds of foreign official corruption. <div>
<p>The Justice Department announced today that it has repatriated an additional $156 million in misappropriated 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) funds to the people of Malaysia, bringing the total returned by the department to approximately $1.4 billion.</p>
<p>According to court documents, the funds from 1MDB, formerly Malaysia&rsquo;s investment development fund, were laundered through major financial institutions worldwide, including in the United States, Switzerland, Singapore, and Luxembourg. As alleged in the civil forfeiture complaints, from 2009 through 2015, high-level officials of 1MDB, their associates, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-entertainer-convicted-engaging-foreign-influence-campaign">Low Taek Jho</a>, also known as Jho Low, misappropriated more than $4.5 billion in funds belonging to 1MDB through a criminal scheme involving international money laundering and embezzlement. Some of the embezzlement proceeds were also allegedly used to pay bribes.</p>
<p>Beginning in 2016, a landmark effort encompassing 41 civil forfeiture actions filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California and one in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia by the Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section (MLARS) of the Justice Department&rsquo;s Criminal Division led to the seizure of over $1.7 billion in stolen assets. This is the largest recovery to date under the department&rsquo;s Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative. The funds include both funds finally forfeited and funds the department assisted in recovering and returning. The department continues to litigate actions against additional assets allegedly linked to this scheme.</p>
<p>1MDB was created by the government of Malaysia to promote economic development in Malaysia through global partnerships and foreign direct investment. Its funds were intended to be used for improving the well-being of the Malaysian people. Instead, funds held by 1MDB and proceeds of bonds issued for and on behalf of 1MDB were misappropriated and spent on a wide variety of extravagant items, including luxury homes and properties in Beverly Hills, New York, and London; a 300-foot superyacht; and fine art by Monet and Van Gogh. The funds were also sent into numerous business investments, including a boutique hotel in Beverly Hills, a movie production company that made &ldquo;The Wolf of Wall Street,&rdquo; the redevelopment of the Park Lane Hotel in Manhattan, and shares in EMI, the largest private music rights holder. As alleged, other funds were provided to various public officials and co-conspirators.</p>
<p>Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department&rsquo;s Criminal Division; Assistant Director Michael D. Nordwall of the FBI&rsquo;s Criminal Investigative Division; and Chief Guy Ficco of the IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) made the announcement.</p>
<p>The FBI&rsquo;s International Corruption Squads in New York and Los Angeles and IRS-CI are leading the investigation.</p>
<p>MLARS Trial Attorneys Barbara Levy, Josh Sohn, Jonathon Baum, and Sean Fern are prosecuting the case, with assistance from former MLARS Deputy Chief Woo S. Lee; Trial Attorney Kyle Freeny; and former Asset Forfeiture Section Chief Steven Welk, Asset Forfeiture Section Chief Jonathan Galatzan, and former Assistant U.S. Attorneys John Kucera and Michael Sew Hoy for the Central District of California.</p>
<p>The Justice Department&rsquo;s Office of International Affairs is providing substantial assistance. MLARS&rsquo; Program Operations Unit and the U.S. Marshals Service also provided significant support.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Significant assistance has also been provided to the department over the course of its work in the investigations and civil and criminal litigation by the Attorney General&rsquo;s Chambers of Malaysia, the Royal Malaysia Police, the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, the United Kingdom Prudential Regulation Authority, the United Kingdom National Crime Agency (NCA), the Attorney General&rsquo;s Chambers of the Territory of the British Virgin Islands, the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office of the Bailiwick of Guernsey and the Guernsey Economic Crime Division, the International Anti-Corruption Coordinate Centre, the Attorney General&rsquo;s Chambers of Singapore, the Singapore Police Force&ndash;Commercial Affairs Division, the Office of the Attorney General and the Federal Office of Justice of Switzerland, the judicial investigating authority of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Criminal Investigation Department of the Grand-Ducal Police of Luxembourg, and Indonesian, Latvian and French authorities.</p>
<p>The Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative is led by a team of dedicated MLARS prosecutors in partnership with federal law enforcement agencies, and often with U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Offices, to forfeit the proceeds of foreign official corruption and, where appropriate, to seize, forfeit, and repatriate those recovered assets to benefit the people harmed by these acts of corruption and abuse of office. Individuals with information about possible proceeds of foreign corruption located in or laundered through the United States should email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:kleptocracy@usdoj.gov">kleptocracy@usdoj.gov</a>&nbsp;or submit information at&nbsp;<a href="https://tips.fbi.gov/">https://tips.fbi.gov/</a>.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<div> revocation, registration, CFTC, guilty plea, wire fraud <br />
Summary:<br />
The CFTC revoked Ted Brent Alexander's registrations as a Commodity Trading Advisor and Associated Person due to his guilty plea for conspiracy to commit wire fraud. <div>
<p><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today issued an opinion and order revoking the registrations of&nbsp;<span>Ted Brent Alexander</span>&nbsp;of Jackson, Mississippi. The CFTC filed a Notice of Intent to Revoke Registration Pursuant to Section 8a(2) of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) against Alexander on March 13, 2024. [See CFTC Press Release No.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8876-24">8876-24</a>]. The CFTC action is based on Alexander&rsquo;s guilty plea to conspiracy to commit wire fraud in a federal criminal case.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Case Background</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Alexander has been registered with the CFTC as a Commodity Trading Advisor (CTA) and Associated Person (AP) since October 2008. On April 26, 2003, Alexander pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud in&nbsp;<i>United States v. Alexander</i>, No. 3:20-cr-00031 (S.D. Miss.). On November 13, 2023, a judgment of conviction was entered against Alexander. Because Alexander&rsquo;s guilty plea involved a crime involving one or more of embezzlement, theft, fraud, fraudulent conversion, misappropriation of funds, securities or property, and/or false pretenses, federal commodity laws allow Alexander&rsquo;s registrations to be permanently revoked.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The CFTC&rsquo;s order finds that Alexander is subject to statutory disqualification from registration with the CFTC under Section 8a(2)(D)(iii) of the CEA and permanently revokes Alexander&rsquo;s registrations under the terms of the order.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Settlement Revokes Alexander&rsquo;s Registrations</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Alexander, who admits the charges in the Notice of Intent, consented to the entry of a CFTC order that revokes his registrations as a CTA and AP.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The Division of Enforcement (DOE) thanks the National Futures Association for its assistance in this matter.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>DOE staff responsible for this case are Eugenia Vroustouris and Rick Glaser.</span></span></p>

<div> technical standards, guidelines, prudential matters, asset-referenced tokens, e-money tokens
<br />
Regulatory products under MiCAR for asset-referenced and e-money tokens, including own funds, liquidity requirements, and recovery plans.
<br /><br />Summary:
Technical standards and guidelines on prudential matters, own funds adjustment, liquidity requirements, highly liquid financial instruments, and recovery plans for asset-referenced and e-money tokens. <div>
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) publishes today the package of technical standards and guidelines under MiCAR on prudential matters, namely own funds, liquidity requirements, and recovery&nbsp; &nbsp;plans. These products are part of the EBA&rsquo;s ongoing efforts to foster a well-regulated market for asset-referenced and e-money tokens in the EU.</span></p>
<p>The package of EBA regulatory products comprises:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Final&nbsp;draft regulatory technical standards specifying adjustment of own funds requirement and minimum features&nbsp;of stress testing programmes of issuers of asset-referenced tokens (ARTs) and of e-money tokens (EMTs) subject to such requirements.</span>&nbsp;These standards&nbsp;specify: i) the criteria for the assessment of&nbsp;&lsquo;higher degree of risk&rsquo;, ii) the procedure for competent authorities to determine the period of time considered appropriate for issuers to increase the own funds amount to the higher own funds requirements and the measures to be taken to ensure the timely compliance thereof and iii) a minimum set of requirements to issuers for the design and implementation of their stress-testing programmes.</li>
<li><span>Final draft regulatory technical standards specifying the procedure and timeframe for an issuer to adjust the amount of its own funds to 3% of the average amount of the reserve of assets</span>&nbsp;when the relevant issuer is issuing an ART or EMT classified as &lsquo;significant&rsquo;. Considering the feedback received on both RTSs, following the consultation period, the timeframe for the issuer to provide an implementation plan to increase the own funds requirements has been changed to 25 working days. Additionally, the maximum amount of time that the competent authority may grant to the issuer to comply with the plan has been adjusted upwards to 6 months maximum.</li>
<li><span>Final draft RTS further specifying the liquidity requirements of the reserve of assets.&nbsp;</span>The draft RTS set specific minimum percentages of the reserve of assets according to daily and weekly maturities. They also establish the minimum amount of deposits in each official currency referenced. Furthermore, they envisage overall techniques of liquidity management to seek minimum creditworthiness, liquidity soundness and minimum diversification of bank deposits counterparties in the reserve of assets as well as to ensure minimum overcollateralisation to seek correlation between the reserve of assets and the assets referenced.</li>
<li><span>Final draft RTS to specify the highly liquid financial instruments</span>.&nbsp;These draft RTS set the highest quality liquid assets in the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) as eligible highly liquid financial instruments. At the same time, and in order to seek for correlation between the highly liquid financial instruments and the assets referenced, in the case of ARTs referencing assets other than official currencies, financial instruments tracking the value of the assets referenced by the token or derivatives relating to them, are deemed eligible as highly liquid financial instruments. Furthermore, the draft RTS set concentration limits of highly liquid financial instruments by issuer.</li>
<li><span>Final draft RTS to specify the minimum content of the liquidity management policy and procedures.</span>&nbsp;These draft RTS envisage procedures for identifying, measuring and managing liquidity risk, a contingency policy and mitigation tools as well as minimum aspects of liquidity stress testing.</li>
<li><span>Guidelines on recovery plans&nbsp;</span>specifying the format and the content of the recovery plan that issuers need to develop and maintain. Considering the feedback received during the consultation period, the Guidelines further specify the content of the communication and disclosure plan. A number of targeted amendments were also made to streamline the wording and provide further clarity, inter alia by adding new definitions and by introducing a new paragraph to clarify that any provision regarding certain requirements applicable to the reserve of assets (e.g. certain recovery plan indicators and scenarios) does not apply to issuers of EMTs that are not subject to hold a reserve of assets in accordance with MiCAR.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Legal basis and next steps</h4>
<p>The&nbsp;<span>draft RTS relating to own funds</span>&nbsp;have been developed in close cooperation with the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the European Central Bank (ECB), in accordance with Article 35(6) and Article 45(7)(c) of Regulation (EU) 2023/1114 on Markets in Crypto-assets (MiCAR), and specify the procedure and timeframe for own funds adjustments.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<span>draft RTS on liquidity</span>&nbsp;have been developed, in close cooperation with ESMA and the ECB, to further specify the liquidity requirements of the reserve of assets, to specify the highly liquid financial instruments in the reserve of assets and to specify the minimum content of the liquidity management policy and procedures, in accordance with Articles 36(4), 38(5) and 45(7)(b) of MiCAR respectively.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<span>Guidelines on recovery plans&nbsp;</span>have been developed in accordance with&nbsp; Article 46(6) of MiCAR after consultation with ESMA. The Guidelines specify the format of the recovery plan and the information to be provided therein.</p>

<div> Securities and Exchange Commission, budget request, fiscal year 2025, capital markets, investment advisers<br />Summary:
SEC requests budget increase to match market growth, addresses need for additional resources in technology, real estate, and programmatic divisions. <div>
<p>Good morning, Chair Van Hollen, Ranking Member Hagerty, and members of the Subcommittee. Thank you for inviting me to testify today on the Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s Fiscal Year (FY) 2025 budget request. As is customary, I&rsquo;d like to note that my views are my own as Chair of the SEC, and I am not speaking on behalf of my fellow Commissioners or the SEC staff.</p>
<h2>The SEC at 90 Years</h2>
<p>At the SEC, we had our 90<span>th</span>&nbsp;birthday just one week ago.</p>
<p>After the 1929 market crash, President Franklin Roosevelt signed the first of the federal securities laws in 1933. He followed a year later with the passage of the Securities Exchange Act&mdash;making June 6, 1934, our birthday at the SEC.</p>
<p>The SEC was created to ensure that the markets worked free of fraud and manipulation&mdash;and that investment advisers carried their duties to the clients they advised.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Congress and Roosevelt understood how important our capital markets are to investors, issuers, and more broadly our economy. Today, the $110-plus trillion U.S. capital markets are the deepest, most liquid in the world. At 40 percent of the world&rsquo;s capital markets,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;they outpace our roughly 24 percent of the world&rsquo;s economy.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;The U.S. capital markets also play an integral role in the dollar&rsquo;s dominance.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>We cannot, however, take this leadership for granted.</p>
<p>The SEC is a remarkable agency. We serve investors building for a better future and issuers raising money to fund innovation, while overseeing the capital markets where they meet. The essence of this is captured in our three-part mission to protect investors, facilitate capital formation, and maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets.</p>
<p>The SEC is the cop on the beat watching out for the investing public and issuers. The dedicated staff of this agency does extraordinary work with limited resources.</p>
<h2>Growth and Change in the Markets</h2>
<p>Our limited resources contrast against the tremendous growth and change in our markets.</p>
<p>The U.S. capital markets benefit from significant engagement from everyday investors. About 58 percent of U.S. households own stocks, up from 52 percent in 2016.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;More than half of American households, representing nearly 121 million individual investors, own registered funds.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p>The U.S. has long benefitted from robust competition between nonbanks and banks. The Commission plays a key role in overseeing many aspects of the nonbank sector. Each of the registered funds and private funds sectors surpasses the size of the banking sector.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Further, U.S. debt capital markets facilitate 75 percent of debt financing of non-financial corporations. In Europe, the U.K., and Asia, only 12-29 percent is raised in capital markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p>Today, more than 15,400 registered investment advisers advise 57 million clients.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;This includes advising on more than $32 trillion in registered funds,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;$30 trillion in private funds,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;and nearly $50 trillion in separately managed accounts.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p>At the end of 2016, by comparison, 12,000 registered investment advisers advised 43 million clients.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></p>
<p>Let me put this in context. The entire U.S. banking system is $23 trillion.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;Thus, the capital markets are nearly five times the size of our banking sector.</p>
<p>The Commission has a role in both public and private markets, each of which offer investors and companies opportunities. Our public markets have approximately 7,400 actively reporting issuers, of which more than 4,000 companies list on U.S. exchanges.</p>
<p>We now oversee approximately 40,000 entities&mdash;including more than 13,000 registered funds, more than 15,400 investment advisers, more than 3,300 broker-dealers, 24 national securities exchanges, 103 alternative trading systems, 10 credit rating agencies, 33 self-regulatory organizations (SROs), and six active registered clearing agencies, among other external entities. The SEC oversees the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB), the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).</p>
<p>Technology is rapidly transforming markets and business models. These changes range from electronic trading and the cloud to artificial intelligence and predictive data analytics, just to name a few. There has been dynamic change in communications to and among investors, from Reddit forums to celebrity influencers. Further, we&rsquo;ve seen the Wild West of the crypto markets, rife with noncompliance, where investors have put hard-earned assets at risk in a highly speculative asset class. Many of those investments have disappeared after a crypto platform or service went under due to fraud or mismanagement, leaving investors in line at bankruptcy court.</p>
<p>Today, there are more than 54 million separately managed accounts; in 2018, there were 37 million.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>&nbsp;Transaction volume in listed equities has doubled in the last five years and tripled in the last 17 years.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></p>
<p>Such growth and rapid change also mean more possibility for wrongdoing. We&rsquo;ve seen the number of tips, complaints, and referrals we get at the SEC climb from about 16,700 in 2019 to more than 40,000 in 2023. As the cop on the beat, we must be able to meet the match of bad actors.</p>
<p>Despite the increasing workload, the SEC staff again has rated us among the best places to work in the federal government; this year, we ranked third among midsized agencies.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>&nbsp;Our attrition this fiscal year is at historically low levels, so far averaging around 3 percent at an annualized rate.</p>
<h2>Budget Request</h2>
<p>I am pleased to support the President&rsquo;s FY 2025 request of $2.594 billion for SEC operations in support of 5,621 positions and 5,073 full-time equivalents (FTEs). In addition, we&rsquo;ve requested $8.4 million for needs supporting General Services Administration (GSA)-led real estate projects. As this Committee considers this request, it&rsquo;s worth noting the SEC&rsquo;s funding is deficit-neutral; our appropriations are offset by transaction fees.</p>
<p>In the face of significant growth in registrants, complexity, and individual investor engagement in markets, one may have thought that our agency would have grown over the last eight years. Unfortunately, the reverse was the case&mdash;the SEC actually shrank between 2016 and 2022. With Congress&rsquo;s help, we were authorized to hire 400 people in FY 2023 to bring us just modestly above where we were in 2016. &nbsp;</p>
<p>While our funding was kept flat for FY 2024, the growth in market activity was anything but flat. We are losing pace with the ever-increasing scale of the capital markets we oversee.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Allow me to put flat funding into the context of the SEC&rsquo;s overall budget. Approximately 70 percent of our budget is for staff, about 15 percent is for technology, 5 percent is for facilities, and 10 percent is for everything else. This agency doesn&rsquo;t give out grants or other programmatic money. Thus, given year-over-year price and wage increases, flat funding means cutting staffing, technology, and real estate. &nbsp;</p>
<p>At the start of FY 2024, we paused on nearly all job postings and backfilling for departing staff. As a result, we are currently more than 300 positions below the level authorized by Congress for both FY 2023 and FY 2024.</p>
<p>While the agency&rsquo;s rules get outsized attention in the media, it&rsquo;s worthwhile noting that the vast majority of the SEC&rsquo;s staff works on day-to-day oversight of the markets and responding to public and registrant inquiries. We collectively review tens of thousands of filings a year.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>&nbsp;More than 10 percent of the agency reviews disclosure documents, more than half of the agency is within the Divisions of Enforcement and Examinations, and 13 percent of the agency is in support operations. Shrinking any of these efforts will inevitably mean that the agency will be less responsive to the public and less able to protect the public.</p>
<p>As it relates to technology, we cut IT spending by roughly a quarter in FY 2024. These reductions in technology spending will delay transitions to the cloud, investments in data analytics, modernizations of key systems, and important enhancements to our technology infrastructure. As a result, we are scaling back our technology programs at a time when the markets we oversee are growing more technologically complex with each passing year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As it relates to facilities, in fiscal years 2021 to 2024, we will have shed 275,000 usable square feet from the SEC&rsquo;s real estate footprint. This includes vacating one of our three headquarters buildings in Washington, D.C., at the end of FY 2023, resulting in approximately $14 million per year in savings. Furthermore, the SEC announced it will close our Salt Lake City office early in FY 2025.</p>
<p>As it relates to other expenses, we also have reduced spending on contracts that support mission critical efforts. An example includes our ability to update and improve the Division of Enforcement&rsquo;s document management and review systems&mdash;tools that are critical to reviewing massive document productions during the course of investigations and litigations.</p>
<p>If we are again flat funded, there will be significant further implications on our ability to monitor the markets, maintain SEC programs, adequately resource technology, and meet the agency&rsquo;s critical mission.</p>
<p>Without additional resources, the oversight of markets is at risk. Our ability to find bad actors is at risk. Our responsiveness to market participants is at risk. American capital formation and innovation are at risk as issuers will have to wait longer to hear from us.</p>
<p>The SEC currently has 30 Divisions and Offices across our 11 regional locations<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a>&nbsp;and Washington, D.C., headquarters. I&rsquo;m summarizing below the budget requests for our six Divisions and will briefly touch on technology and real estate. For further details as well as a review of the other offices of the SEC, please reference the FY 2025 Congressional Budget Justification.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<h2>Enforcement and Examinations</h2>
<p>As I mentioned, the Divisions of Enforcement and Examinations account for more than half of the SEC&rsquo;s staff. Without examination of our registrants and enforcement of rules and laws when they are broken, we can&rsquo;t instill the trust necessary for our markets to thrive. Stamping out fraud, manipulation, and abuse lowers risk in the system. It means that fewer bad actors will get away with misconduct. It protects investors and reduces the cost of capital. The whole economy benefits from that.</p>
<h3>Division of Enforcement</h3>
<p>As I noted, in FY 2023, the SEC received more than 40,000 separate tips, complaints, and referrals from whistleblowers and others, a 13 percent increase over FY 2022.</p>
<p>Even with limited resources, the Division brought 784 enforcement actions in FY 2023, a three percent increase over fiscal year 2022. When looking only at the 501 original, or &ldquo;stand-alone,&rdquo; enforcement actions we file&mdash;whether settled or litigated&mdash;it&rsquo;s an 8 percent increase over the prior fiscal year. Our actions resulted in orders for $4.9 billion in penalties and disgorgement. The SEC distributed $930 million to harmed investors in FY 2023.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, rapid technological innovation in the financial markets has led to misconduct in emerging and new areas, not least in the crypto space. Further, the complexity of the frauds we are investigating&mdash;and the sophistication of the fraudsters&mdash;is ever increasing.</p>
<p>Addressing this requires new tools, expertise, and resources. When the cars become faster and the highways more congested, you want more cops, not fewer.</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s request would grow the team by 27 FTEs to 1,447. The additional staff will provide the Division with more capacity to meet these challenges, investigate misconduct on a larger scale, accelerate the pace of enforcement investigations to resolution, and represent the Commission and protect investors in increasingly complex litigations.</p>
<h3>Division of Examinations</h3>
<p>The Division of Examinations serves a critical role in helping to ensure firms comply with the law.</p>
<p>In FY 2023, we conducted more than 3,100 examinations across our tens of thousands of registrants. From investment advisers to broker-dealers to exchanges, the Division helps ensure that registrants are following their legal obligations to customers and clients, including seniors and other vulnerable investors.</p>
<p>Importantly, the Division is the first line of defense for the investing public relying on investment advisers. It is responsible for examining and overseeing a growing registrant population, including more than 15,400 investment advisers and approximately 800 investment company complexes.</p>
<p>Further, we work in parallel with SROs to examine the more than 3,300 broker-dealers with roughly 150,000 branch offices.</p>
<p>This stretches thin the limited resources of the Division.</p>
<p>Our FY 2025 request would help the Division grow 20 FTE to reach 1,156 FTEs.</p>
<p>These additional resources are the minimum just for the Division to stay abreast of the growth in market participants and make key investments to help protect the American public regarding emerging cyber and information security risks.</p>
<h2>Programmatic Divisions</h2>
<p>Next, I will turn to our three programmatic Divisions.</p>
<h3>Corporation Finance</h3>
<p>The Division of Corporation Finance oversees the disclosures of new issuers and public companies so that investors can make informed investment decisions. It&rsquo;s important for investors to receive useful, timely, and accurate disclosure. It&rsquo;s important that issuers can get timely feedback on their registration statements and other filings. Today, there are more than 7,400 active reporting companies, up from about 6,800 in 2020.</p>
<p>In FY 2023, the Division reviewed the filings of more than 3,700 reporting companies and new issuers.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 2025 budget request would grow the team to 447 FTEs. With this increase of 16 FTEs, the Division would still be 30 FTEs under the 2016 level.</p>
<p>Additional resources would allow the Division to serve investors and issuers more ably as markets grow and evolve.</p>
<h3>Investment Management</h3>
<p>The Division of Investment Management oversees the 13,000 registered funds and 15,400 investment advisers that steward nest eggs for 57 million clients. At the end of 2016, by comparison, 12,000 registered investment advisers advised 43 million clients.</p>
<p>As noted earlier, both the registered funds market and the private funds market are each bigger than the banking sector, and we&rsquo;ve seen significant growth in both. More than half of American households, representing more than 115 million individual investors, own registered funds. When I started on Wall Street 45 years ago, household penetration was less than 6 percent.</p>
<p>In FY 2023, the Division reviewed more than 4,200 annual and periodic reports as well as more than 8,600 total portfolios and insurance contracts.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a></p>
<p>Given this growth in the markets, we&rsquo;ve asked to grow the division by nine FTEs to a total of 237.</p>
<h3>Trading and Markets</h3>
<p>The Division of Trading and Markets serves on the front line for maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets. Market monitoring and supervision are essential parts of the Division&rsquo;s activity&mdash;especially during times of market stress.</p>
<p>The Division oversees 24 national securities exchanges, 103 alternative trading systems, more than 3,300 broker-dealers, 51 security-based swap dealers, six active registered clearing agencies, and more than 200 transfer agents, among other entities.</p>
<p>In FY 2023, the Division responded to more than 16,000 public inquiries. In FY 2023, the Division also reviewed more than 660 filings of broker-dealers as well as more than 1,700 SRO proposed rule changes and advance notices.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a></p>
<p>As market centers, broker-dealers, and clearance and settlement systems continue to grow in size and activity, so does the need for robust supervision of these entities and intermediaries.</p>
<p>In FY 2025, we&rsquo;ve requested 14 additional FTEs, for a total of 293, to support this important function of the Commission.</p>
<h3>Economic and Risk Analysis</h3>
<p>Economic analysis is critical to all of the agency&rsquo;s work. The Division of Economic and Risk Analysis provides impartial economic analyses that consider the costs and benefits of our rules as well as their effects on efficiency, competition, and capital formation.</p>
<p>We get feedback from the public on these economic analyses, which benefits our rulemaking. Our economic analyses also benefit the markets broadly because making data available creates a public good.</p>
<p>In the Enforcement context, the Division&rsquo;s staff is instrumental in assisting Enforcement staff with identifying potential wrongdoing, assessing ill-gotten gains, and working to return funds to harmed investors.</p>
<p>DERA assists the Commission in its efforts to identify, analyze, and respond to economic and market issues, including those related to new financial products, investment and trading strategies, systemic risk, and fraud.</p>
<p>Given the critical nature of the Division&rsquo;s work, for FY 2025, we&rsquo;ve asked for funding to support 196 FTEs total, just one additional FTE.</p>
<h2>Additional Matters</h2>
<h3>Technology</h3>
<p>Technology and data continue to fuel rapid change in our markets. The rise of big data, algorithms, and AI in our markets has put more pressure than ever on the SEC to keep pace. For example, the data processing by the Division of Enforcement alone has grown 20 percent year over year for the last three years. Cyber threats represent an ever-increasing threat to the agency and our markets alike. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet, as I mentioned, the SEC is cutting its IT program by about a quarter this fiscal year because of budget pressures. We have had to delay technology upgrades, some migrations to the cloud, and enhancements in data analytics.&nbsp; For example, we cut back significantly our investments in Enforcement case management; Enforcement, Exams, and DERA analytics capabilities; implementation of the government-wide Zero Trust security program; and the workflow system supporting the Division of Corporation Finance&rsquo;s disclosure review program. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus, we have requested $457 million for information technology. This would help support the Commission&rsquo;s cybersecurity, migration to the cloud, modernization of key systems like EDGAR, implementation of the Financial Data Transparency Act, and other critical IT needs. This request assumes full use of an additional $50 million from the SEC Reserve Fund for multi-year IT projects and programs. To put these figures in context, this spending is dwarfed by what some of the biggest market participants spend in a month on technology.</p>
<h3>Facilities</h3>
<p>We currently have offices in Washington, D.C., and 11 regional offices. The total facilities cost in FY 2024 is only 5 percent of our budget. We continue to work with GSA to manage it prudently, significantly reducing our space footprint as I described earlier.</p>
<p>Part of the SEC&rsquo;s FY 2025 request is $8.4 million for lease procurements managed by GSA. This amount represents the additional funds needed for GSA&rsquo;s recompete of the lease for the SEC&rsquo;s Chicago Regional Office.</p>
<p>We will continue looking for opportunities to achieve cost savings across our leasing footprint in the years to come.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The U.S. capital markets are the deepest, most liquid in the world. We cannot, however, take this leadership for granted. The SEC needs to be funded to meet the match of the growing and evolving markets we oversee. I thank the Committee for providing me the opportunity to summarize this budget request.</p>
<p>I am pleased to take your questions.</p>

Summary: <div>
<p>Thank you, Chairman Van Hollen, Ranking Member Hagerty, and members of the Subcommittee.&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate the opportunity to testify before you today on the President&rsquo;s fiscal year 2025 budget request for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC or Commission).</p>
<p>For over a century, derivatives markets have played a key role in the U.S. economy, promoting economic growth and contributing to financial stability and the predictability of prices that impact the daily lives of all Americans.&nbsp;&nbsp;This October, the CFTC will commemorate its 50th&nbsp;anniversary as an independent agency with exclusive jurisdiction over futures trading in&nbsp;all<i>&nbsp;</i>commodities.&nbsp;&nbsp;This milestone provides a natural inflection point as we consider how the past 50 years will impact the next.</p>
<p>Over the last nearly 15 years, I have witnessed the massive expansion of the CFTC&rsquo;s jurisdiction through Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act, organic growth in our historic markets, the introduction of new products, including the digital commodity asset class, and the significant expansion of market participants, both institutional and retail as a result of technological disruption.&nbsp;&nbsp;To put a number on it, trading volumes in exchange-traded futures and options have more than doubled; and the swaps market is now over $350 trillion,<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam47?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;which is approximately half of the estimated $715 trillion global market.&nbsp;&nbsp;Given this exponential global growth, and working individually, through our operating divisions, and the Office of International Affairs (OIA), I have prioritized a collaborative working relationship with our domestic and international regulatory partners to ensure regulatory harmonization, market efficiency, and reducing unintended and negative consequences to U.S. derivatives markets.</p>
<p>As Chairman, I am focused on: identifying and addressing regulatory gaps and uncertainty; strengthening the agency organizationally so that we are an operationally effective, diverse, and competitively attractive employer; better understanding and incorporating the digital asset ecosystem and&nbsp;artificial intelligence (AI)&nbsp;into our decision making; and addressing the need for guidance regarding emerging product and market structures such as voluntary carbon credit (VCC) derivative contracts and vertical integration.</p>
<p>Today, technology is driving change in the financial markets, and the CFTC must keep pace in order to fulfill its mission and Congressional mandate.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our work centers on customer protection and market resiliency, while supporting continued growth and innovation that will take the agency into the next 50 years.</p>
<p>To date, and thanks to my fellow Commissioners and the incredibly hardworking staff of the CFTC, the agency has stayed on course following an agenda I outlined in early 2023 to consider and vote on roughly 30 new regulatory and policy matters in addition to all proposed rules and orders from the prior year.&nbsp;&nbsp;I bucketed these actions into themes that address:&nbsp;risk management and resilience; customer protections; efficiency and innovation; reporting and data policy; duplicative regulatory requirements; and international comity.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fundamental to&nbsp;all of these themes is the need to update our ruleset to address the derivatives industry&rsquo;s current course, which is driven by technology and seeks to both leverage and, in some instances, move away from traditional and familiar models.&nbsp;&nbsp;The dominant disruptors of our current era raise important questions about conflicts of interest, the strength of capital, margin, and segregation requirements, the role and responsibilities of self-regulatory organizations, affiliate risk management and customer protections.</p>
<p>As the CFTC&rsquo;s Chairman, I have made very conscious and intentional decisions aimed at ensuring that we not only exemplify good stewardship of taxpayer dollars, but also provide genuine organizational support for our valued employees.&nbsp;&nbsp;My first priority as Chairman included directing an agency-wide strategic approach to human capital management focused on rebalancing and upskilling our workforce through succession planning and building a bench of future expertise that brings diversity of thought, experience, and background.&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been over four years since our people left the confines of their offices and we assumed an expansive telework posture.&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that while we have been productive and achieved success in certain mission critical functions, we are keenly aware of the benefits of being together in person in the office.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, we have heard from some of our staff and supervisors their desire to return to the office.&nbsp;&nbsp;A resolution to the impasse in our negotiations will allow staff to plan their lives accordingly.&nbsp;&nbsp;The CFTC has always been a place that valued its peoples&rsquo; needs to balance work and home life, and we will continue to do so as we negotiate the next steps.</p>
<p>In addition, I have led reforms in how the Commission collects, interprets and reports on market data. This data connects our infrastructure, security, surveillance, analytical, and enforcement needs and duties, and will significantly impact how we meet our mission in the tech-driven future.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam47?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2">[2]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The CFTC has, under my direction, moved to the cloud, achieved significant advancement in cybersecurity protections, reorganized, increased the visibility of, and added new leaders to, our Division of Data (DOD)&mdash;including our first Chief Data Scientist who will lead our AI training and implementation-- and launched a CFTC-wide technical training initiative.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our goal is the long game: building capabilities over time towards organizational maturity and technical achievement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, I am proud to say that under my direction, the CFTC&rsquo;s new AI Task Force issued a request for comment (RFC) on the use of AI in CFTC-regulated markets.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam47?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3">[3]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The AI RFC is part of a greater vision to advance analytical capabilities through building talent, leveraging the cloud, and developing a forward-looking culture.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a process in place for exploring AI use cases to&nbsp;help the agency better monitor, regulate, surveil, identify pockets of stress, and enforce compliance.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are currently reviewing the RFC comments to better understand what, if any, policy changes are needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, the Office of Customer Education and Outreach (OCEO), the agency&rsquo;s education arm, issued a Customer Advisory in January warning the public about emerging AI-driven fraud and scams.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam47?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4">[4]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Consistent with mandates by the Administration and OMB guidance, I recently announced that our Chief Data Officer and DOD Director will serve as the CFTC&rsquo;s first Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer responsible for&nbsp;promoting the agency&rsquo;s use of AI and guide us in managing AI risks.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam47?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5">[5]</a></p>
<p>Said a bit differently, my goal is to modernize the CFTC to ensure our continued success well into the future. We are seeing changes in market structure and in the demographics of market participants.&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that institutions, products, and processes that prove valuable enough to producers, consumers, investors, and the general public&mdash;however such value is determined&mdash;will inevitably find a way to integrate with established regulatory systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is our role to ensure market safety and integrity by enforcing existing standards under our governing statute and regulations, and by determining new approaches when warranted and consistent with the law.</p>
<p>The proposed budget before you today reflects the minimum resources needed for the CFTC to perform its role as the primary regulator of the U.S. futures, swaps, and options markets, and to properly enforce the law to protect markets and market participants.&nbsp;&nbsp;It provides the resources we absolutely need to ensure that the agency has the appropriate and necessary capabilities to keep up with technological innovation shaping our markets in 2024 and beyond.&nbsp;&nbsp;It optimizes resources to ensure the protection of the market data we receive and keeps the agency&rsquo;s systems and infrastructure shielded from emerging risks and cyber threats. It funds oversight and surveillance responsibilities generated by an increasing number of derivatives exchanges offering products that require consideration of new and emerging risks.&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the budget&nbsp;ensures that our enforcement program continues its proactive approach in identifying and addressing misconduct within our ever expanding and transforming markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is especially critical in light of growing retail participation and the need for greater protections in the digital asset space.&nbsp;&nbsp;The planned prioritization in these areas will help the CFTC fulfill its mission in a rapidly changing marketplace.</p>
<p>The CFTC&rsquo;s Budget Request for Fiscal Year 2025</p>
<p>The Commission is requesting a total of $399 million and 725 FTE for FY 2025.&nbsp;&nbsp;The request for its operational budget was developed with the &ldquo;Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023&rdquo; in mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;With the understanding that the budgetary challenges we are currently addressing will likely bleed into the coming year, and that some difficult decisions will be made, we have sought to focus on the most critical areas to reach this number that represents about a 2.9 percent decrease below the FY 2024 budget request, and just over a nine percent increase above the FY 2023 and 2024 enacted budget.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Division of Enforcement (DOE)</p>
<p>The Commission requests $74 million and 163 FTE to protect the public and preserve market integrity by detecting, investigating, and prosecuting violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and Commission regulations through the activities of its Division of Enforcement. This is an increase of $5.5 million over the FY 2024 enacted budget.</p>
<p>The Commission&rsquo;s exercise of its enforcement authorities to address misconduct that has a direct impact on CFTC jurisdictional markets, affects the larger economy, causes public harm, or interferes with market integrity is one facet of our approach to innovation and the evolution of financial markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;This increase will, among other things, support the development of innovative approaches utilizing cutting edge technologies and upskilling of Commission staff with the goal of identifying misconduct earlier and addressing bad actors expediently.</p>
<p>A review of the filings for FY 2024 demonstrates that while digital asset related cases are rightfully demanding significant attention,<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam47?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6">[6]</a>&nbsp;DOE is ensuring that we take necessary action in all of our directly regulated markets and in the retail fraud space involving precious metals and forex (foreign exchange).&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also building even stronger networks and partnerships through cooperative enforcement efforts with other civil and criminal agencies domestically and internationally.&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the matters that have stood out this fiscal year, several in the agricultural, energy, and financial sectors exemplify our unwavering commitment to ensuring that registrants meet their regulatory obligations, that customers receive the protections they deserve, that our markets remain free from manipulation and fraud, and that misconduct in the digital asset space receives swift attention.</p>
<p>Nowhere have we been more active than in the digital asset space.&nbsp;&nbsp;In FY 2023, we&nbsp;brought 47 actions involving conduct related to digital commodities, representing more than 49 percent of all CFTC actions filed during that period.&nbsp;&nbsp;A staggering statistic given the fact that no federal agency retains any direct regulatory authority over the underlying (or cash) digital commodity asset market.&nbsp;&nbsp;We can only act on digital asset fraud or manipulation when we uncover or discover anomalies through regulated market surveillance and oversight, or through tips and complaints we can pursue. With many agency resources which are not considered in our budget appropriation being allocated to an unregulated market, I fear the current trajectory is unsustainable.&nbsp;&nbsp;Namely, we will continue to see rampant fraud and manipulation in the digital asset market that will hurt American customers, and possibly infect the traditional financial markets.</p>
<p>To date, FY 2024 is demonstrating a similar cadence.&nbsp;The lack of legislation addressing the regulatory gap over the digital commodity asset spot market has not hindered the public&rsquo;s enthusiasm for digital assets, and I continue to believe Congress must act, as the 2022 FSOC (Financial Stability Oversight Council) report highlighted<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam47?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7">[7]</a>, and as I have mentioned publicly on multiple occasions.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam47?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8">[8]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Until such time, the Commission will continue to use its expertise and the tools it has to protect our markets and the public.</p>
<p>Division of Market Oversight (DMO)</p>
<p>The Commission requests $36 million and 88 FTE for the Division of Market Oversight to continue its commitment to maintaining the integrity of the markets as it reviews new applications and monitors ongoing compliance with core principles and regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>DMO is expecting growth in 2024 and 2025 given the growing interest in offering novel, innovative, and increasingly complex products. Currently, there are seven exchange or DCM (designated contract market) applications in review.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each registration application requires both intra-divisional and inter-divisional teams of staff to review the application and the applicant&rsquo;s planned operations, and determine compliance with the CEA and Commission regulations.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Division will need to train and dedicate additional staff to registrations as the number and variability of applicants continues to grow.</p>
<p>In FY 2025, the Commission&rsquo;s system safeguards examinations&mdash;an essential component of the examination program for DCMs, SEFs (swap execution facilities), and SDRs (swap data repositories)&mdash;will remain crucial to economic stability. Effective cybersecurity practices and system safeguards of regulated entities requires increased direct surveillance and vigilance for the scope of examinations conducted each year.</p>
<p>With respect to rule and product filings, in FY 2023, the Commission continued to receive a diverse array of product filings from exchanges seeking to meet market participants&rsquo; varying needs, including many innovative products. The number of filings and the diversity of product offerings require additional resources to ensure Division staff can complete their reviews, and stay abreast of market developments and the technological advancements underlying these new products and attendant rules.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example,&nbsp;since 2021, there has been a significant uptick in the number of event contracts listed for trading by CFTC-registered exchanges.&nbsp;&nbsp;From 2006 through 2020, DCMs listed for trading an average of approximately five event contracts a year. In 2021, this number increased to 131, and the number of newly-listed event contracts per year has remained at a similar level in subsequent years.</p>
<p>With respect to rulemakings, in FY 2024 the Division continues to plan and undertake rulemakings to amend Commission rules, as appropriate, to address changes in the constantly evolving derivatives markets. The Division expects efforts in proposing, adopting, and implementing rules to ensure the Commission&rsquo;s regulatory framework keeps pace with recent market innovations, to continue in FY 2025.</p>
<p>Division of Clearing and Risk (DCR)</p>
<p>Market events and the volatility in the global financial markets linked to geopolitical issues, continued pandemic recovery and reformation, weather and climate-related risk, and monetary and fiscal policy consistently raise challenges related to liquidity and margin requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;These factors also fuel active debate on the need for additional tools and resources to manage risks, including collateral management.&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the importance of clearing to the financial system, and the role of U.S.-regulated central counterparties (CCPs) as among the strongest in the world, the Commission requests $35.6 million and 86 FTE for the Division of Clearing and Risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;These funds are necessary to maintain current capabilities and expand examination and surveillance of activities that will impact clearing markets, credit, liquidity, and modeling risks, enhance cyber and operational resilience, and support the safety and soundness of derivatives clearing organizations (DCOs).</p>
<p>Currently, the CFTC has ten registered DCOs in the United States, including two DCOs that have been designated as systemically important by FSOC. In addition, the Commission regulates five registered DCOs located outside the United States, including some that have a direct impact on U.S. markets, given the volume of swaps and futures cleared for U.S. entities.&nbsp;&nbsp;DCO examinations, which are time and staff resource intensive, help the Commission identify issues that may affect a DCO&rsquo;s ability to identify, manage, and monitor its risks. DCOs represent single critical points of managing risk in the global financial system where the failure or disruption to the functioning of these DCOs could create or increase the risk of liquidity or credit problems spreading among other financial institutions.</p>
<p>There are four DCOs outside the United States exempted from registration by the Commission that are permitted to clear proprietary swap transactions for U.S. entities. Although the CFTC relies principally on foreign authorities for oversight, it does engage in limited monitoring and surveillance of these exempt DCOs. The Commission maintains an active, data-driven quantitative risk surveillance function. It expects to continue investing additional resources in human capital, data, and technology to improve its current analytical capabilities and keep up with growth in both the scale and complexity of risk transmission in the derivatives markets - both cleared and uncleared.</p>
<p>Market Participants Division (MPD)</p>
<p>The Commission requests $28.5 million and 69 FTE&nbsp;for the Market Participants Division to maintain effective oversight of registered market participants using current delegated authorities and improved cooperative oversight policies.&nbsp;&nbsp;The CFTC oversees the registration and compliance of thousands of derivatives market participants, including swap dealers (SDs), major swap participants (MSPs), Futures Commissioners Merchants (FCMs), retail foreign exchange dealers (RFEDs), introducing brokers (IBs), commodity trading advisors (CTAs), commodity pool operators (CPOs), floor brokers, and floor traders. MPD also oversees the self-regulatory organizations (SROs), including the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the National Futures Association (NFA), by assessing whether the SROs&rsquo; compliance programs over member firms meet established regulatory standards.</p>
<p>Regulated market participants are a cornerstone of the Commission&rsquo;s regulatory framework. To date, 62 registered FCMs hold more than $474 billion in customer funds, and 106 registered SDs collectively transact hundreds of trillions in notional value swap contracts annually, serving as a vital source of liquidity for financial institutions and commercial end users seeking to hedge their risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, the CFTC directs its registration and compliance resources to provide critical policy and regulatory guidance to registered market participants, both directly and in coordination with the SROs. In addition, the Commission oversees the National Futures Association (NFA) in its role implementing delegated authorities to register and oversee compliance by registered market participants. The Commission ensures that registration rules, standards, and reporting requirements continue to be responsive to the needs of the evolving marketplace.</p>
<p>Division of Data</p>
<p>The Division of Data develops and implements the CFTC&rsquo;s enterprise data strategy, providing the specialized technical, analytical, and related services necessary for the Commission to standardize, acquire, process, examine, govern and exploit mission critical market and industry data.&nbsp;&nbsp;As the agency&rsquo;s designated authority on data issues, DOD provides CFTC regulatory and enforcement staff with the data and analytical capabilities needed to perform mission work, develops and oversees data sharing and protection agreements with external entities, and enables policymakers to make data-driven decisions for overseeing the U.S. derivative markets. In accordance with this mission, the responsibilities of DOD include establishing the Commission&rsquo;s data strategy, data standards, data architecture and governance, and building/maintaining the agency&rsquo;s core data infrastructure.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission requests $42.1 million and 41 FTE to continue leveraging cloud and other new technology to enhance and transform its ability to collect, analyze and draw informed conclusions from market data to both conduct and support effective enforcement actions, oversee rapidly evolving markets, and formulate sound regulatory policy.</p>
<p>Whistleblower Incentives and Protection</p>
<p>A key to the effectiveness of our enforcement division is the CFTC&rsquo;s whistleblower program.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dodd-Frank Act established the Customer Protection Fund<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam47?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9">[9]</a>&nbsp;that supports our Whistleblower Program<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam47?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10">[10]</a>&nbsp;and the OCEO.&nbsp;As of FY 2023, the Whistleblower program has issued 41 orders granting awards totaling almost $350 million since its inception in FY 2010.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam47?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11">[11]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;In fiscal year 2024, the program has, thus far, awarded $18 million to whistleblowers.&nbsp;&nbsp;The total sanctions ordered in all whistleblower-related enforcement actions has surpassed the $3 billion milestone.</p>
<p>As this Committee knows, the overwhelming success of the Whistleblower Program has unintentionally led to the potential for disruptions in these two vital offices due to their funding mechanisms.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the importance of a long-term fix to avoid depletions greater than the total balance of the fund,&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;believe Congress should amend the statutory provisions to clarify the permitted uses of the Customer Protection Fund by the OCEO.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam47?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12">[12]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;This change would allow the Commission to implement a host of new investor protection programs and provide information aimed at ensuring American families have the knowledge and tools to not only protect themselves from fraud and manipulation, but to more fully engage with the Commission and the markets we oversee.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>I know I speak for all the Commissioners when I thank CFTC staff for their commitment to the agency and its mission.&nbsp;&nbsp;My team and I are working closely with staff and their union representatives in order to find a suitable work posture, post-pandemic, that honors the importance of being present and together in the office with appropriate flexibility, and ensures our accountability as good stewards of taxpayer money.&nbsp;&nbsp;The agency&rsquo;s long-term health and success depend on it.</p>
<p>As we move through 2024, I am proud of the CFTC&rsquo;s undeniable record of using regulation, innovation, and collaboration to ensure our markets function well, and of providing risk management and transparency for all stakeholders, including, most notably, America&rsquo;s commercial end-users who rely on derivatives markets to manage risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;More than ever, in these uncertain times both domestically and internationally, we need thorough and thoughtful regulation to ensure confidence and accountability in the derivatives markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;To continue delivering results to the derivatives markets and American public, we need consistency and certainty so that we can allocate resources towards critical and multi-year investments.</p>
<p>Thank you again for the opportunity to appear before you today.&nbsp;&nbsp;I look forward to your questions.</p>

<div> municipal, corporate, CUSIP, issuance, volume
Summary: Municipal CUSIP issuance surged in May, while corporate volumes remained steady. International debt CUSIP requests saw a significant increase. <div>
<p align="left"><a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=8Y6jULk71JCJVWAHccbE23Hd8yr6H9OVDOO4qu1xfmOcFwR0IRnsdOQKRp2sDwWYBjqHD6gGFZW4UBqRidJGNeFLHJGnmAN6TK0q3KIK-k8NHQQW4HXreypGLgJ_QpaT" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="CUSIP Global Services">CUSIP Global Services</a>&nbsp;(CGS) today announced the release of its CUSIP Issuance Trends Report for May 2024. The report, which tracks the issuance of new security identifiers as an early indicator of debt and capital markets activity over the next quarter, found a fourth-consecutive monthly increase in request volume for new municipal identifiers, while corporate volumes were steady overall.</p>
<p>North American corporate requests totaled 7,362 in May, which is down 3.2% on a monthly basis. On a year-over-year basis, North American corporate requests closed the month up 10.2%. The monthly volume decline was driven by a decrease in issuance volume for medium term notes. Other key asset classes, such as U.S. corporate equity (13.5%), U.S. corporate debt (17.8%) and Canadian corporate securities (17.9%) all saw monthly request volume increases.</p>
<p>The aggregate total of identifier requests for new municipal securities &ndash; including municipal bonds, long-term and short-term notes, and commercial paper &ndash; rose 51.5% versus April totals. On a year-over-year basis, overall municipal volumes are up 8.4%. Texas led state-level municipal request volume with a total of 143 new CUSIP requests in May, followed by New York (102) and California (90).</p>
<p>&ldquo;New issuance activity in the municipals space has been consistently high for the past four months, but we saw a major surge in the May data,&rdquo; said Gerard Faulkner, Director of Operations for CGS. &ldquo;Similarly in the corporate asset classes, we see pockets of high volume in U.S. corporate debt and equity, Canadian corporates and certificates of deposit, all of which points to issuers finding opportunity to bring new securities to market in the current economic cycle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Requests for international equity CUSIPs rose 5.1% in May and international debt CUSIP requests rose 19.0%. On an annualized basis, international equity CUSIP requests are down 4.4% and international debt CUSIP requests are up 106.5%.</p>

Summary:
MarketAxess introduces portfolio trading tool for tax-exempt municipal bonds, allowing efficient negotiation and execution for up to 1,500 unique CUSIPs. Growing market share and automated execution suite. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>MarketAxess Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: MKTX), the operator of a leading electronic trading platform for fixed-income securities, today announced the platform&rsquo;s first ever portfolio trade for tax-exempt municipal bonds. The portfolio trade was executed earlier this month between a large bank and a large asset manager.</p>
<p>The new Portfolio Trading for Tax-Exempt Munis tool allows clients to send lists to multiple counter-parties or a single dealer, negotiating price improvements and trading discreetly on a diversified basket of Tax-Exempt Munis in one singular point of transaction. Clients can load portfolio trades manually or utilize straight-through-processing via their OMS. Once loaded, clients can see instantly the changes in portfolio metrics, any impact on the portfolio&rsquo;s overall market value and utilize MarketAxess&rsquo; technology to make split-second decisions on portfolio composition and pricing. During the portfolio negotiation process, clients also have the option to counter or remove individual line items for optimal execution.</p>
<p>Daniel Kelly, Head of Municipal Securities at MarketAxess, commented, &ldquo;The portfolio trading tool was among the most requested enhancements to our Municipal bond franchise. Now muni traders can finally experience the same efficiency their counterparts in the corporate bond market have enjoyed for years&mdash;the flexibility to negotiate on individual line items without sacrificing certainty of execution for up to 1,500 unique CUSIPs in a single transaction.</p>
<p>With the launch of our automated execution suite of tools for munis last year and now, portfolio trading&mdash;we are proud to be delivering the innovation municipal market participants have asked for, and needed, to effectively scale their businesses,&rdquo; he continued.</p>
<p>MarketAxess is one of the fastest growing electronic marketplaces for muni bonds. Last month, MarketAxess accounted for 8.1% estimated market share of municipal bonds&mdash;up from 5.6% the year prior&mdash;and representing $577 million in average daily volumes.</p>

<br /><br />Summary: Brickken, a Barcelona-based startup, is selected for the European Commission's Regulatory Sandbox to collaborate with regulators and expand its market. <div>
<ul>
<li>This regulatory sandbox, driven by the European Commission, fosters a secure and reliable environment where blockchain technology providers and regulators can collaborate and reach agreements.</li>
<li>The Spanish startup, which has already tokenized assets worth 200 million euro, continues to lead the tokenization path following its recent inclusion in PwC's digital assets program and its partnerships with industry leaders such as Chainlink, Psalion and Keyrock among others.</li>
<li>Coinbase will work with Brickken and each of the partners engaging the European Commission sandbox to help shape best practices for institutions to engage in products safely and securely onchain.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Brickken, a Barcelona-based startup pioneering in the tokenization of real-world assets, announced today its selection to participate in the European Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) Regulatory Sandbox. This regulatory sandbox will provide legal certainty for decentralized technological solutions, including blockchain, by identifying deployment obstacles from a legal and regulatory perspective. Additionally, it will offer legal advice, regulatory expertise, and guidance in a secure and confidential environment.</span></p>

<title>Retail Investors Bullish On Gold And Silver In May: Spectrum Markets</title>

<ul>
<li>Spectrum's European retail investor sentiment indicator shows bullish behaviour on gold and silver</li>
<li>Sentiment suggests retail investors saw a buying opportunity as gold prices dipped in May</li>
<li>Retail investor sentiment has remained bullish on silver since its introduction on Spectrum in December 2023</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spectrum Markets (&ldquo;Spectrum&rdquo;), the pan-European trading venue designed for retail investors, has published its SERIX sentiment data for European retail investors for May, revealing bullish trading behaviour for both available precious metal underlyings, gold and silver.</p>
<p>Gold prices fluctuated in May, peaking at $2,449 per ounce by 20<sup>th</sup> May before dropping to $2,325 towards the end of the month<a href="file://C:/Users/Herbie%20Skeete/Downloads/Spectrum%20Markets_European%20Retail%20Investors%20bullish%20on%20Gold%20and%20Silver%20in%20May.docx#_ftn1">[1]</a>. This dip created a buying opportunity for investors and was likely a key driver of the bullish SERIX sentiment of 104.</p>
<p>Silver also reached a record high of $32.391 per ounce by the end of May<a href="file://C:/Users/Herbie%20Skeete/Downloads/Spectrum%20Markets_European%20Retail%20Investors%20bullish%20on%20Gold%20and%20Silver%20in%20May.docx#_ftn2">[2]</a>. However, retail investors remained bullish, with the SERIX for silver closing at 108 points for the month. Since Spectrum introduced products with silver as an underlying asset to trade in December 2023 in response to investor demand, sentiment towards the precious metal has been consistently bullish, starting with a peak SERIX value of 125 points.</p>
<p>The SERIX value indicates retail investor sentiment, with a number above 100 marking bullish sentiment, and a number below 100 indicating bearish sentiment. (See below for more information on the methodology).</p>
<h4><b>Market opinion</b></h4>
<p>&ldquo;Despite the SERIX sentiment on gold indicating tactical buying behaviour from retail investors, the SERIX on silver tells a different story, aligning with its high market price,&rdquo; says Michael Hall, Head of Distribution at Spectrum Markets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While the performance of gold is strongly connected with currencies and interest rates, the SERIX sentiment indicator suggests European retail investors track the silver market based on rising demand patterns. This increasing demand is driven in part by the search for alternative energy solutions, as silver is essential in photovoltaic panels, which convert sunlight into electricity,&rdquo; adds Michael Hall.</p>
<h4><b>Spectrum&rsquo;s May data</b></h4>
<p>In May 2024, order book turnover on Spectrum was &euro;246.7 million, with 36% of trades taking place outside of traditional hours (i.e., between 17:30 and 9:00 CET).</p>
<p>70.5% of the order book turnover was on indices, 16.8% on commodities, 5.4% on equities, 3.6% on currency pairs, and 3.7% on cryptocurrencies, with the top three traded underlying markets being DAX 40 (25.1%), NASDAQ 100 (24.9%), and DOW 30 (9%).</p>
<p>Looking at the SERIX data for the top three underlying markets, the DAX 40 sentiment decreased from 101 to a bearish 98. Similarly, the NASDAQ 100 dropped from 101 to 99 and the DOW 30 fell from 103 to 99 this month.</p>

<div>
<p align="center"><b>Calculating SERIX data</b></p>
<p>The Spectrum European Retail Investor Index (SERIX), uses the trading venue&rsquo;s pan-European trading data to shed light on investor sentiment towards current development in financial markets.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The index is calculated on a monthly basis by analysing retail investor trades placed and subtracting the proportion of bearish trades from the proportion of bullish trades, to give a single figure (rebased at 100) that indicates the strength and direction of sentiment:</p>
<p align="center"><i>SERIX = (% bullish trades - % bearish trades) + 100</i></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;<span>Trades where long instruments are bought and trades where short instruments are sold are both considered bullish trades, while trades where long instruments are sold and trades where short instruments are bought are considered bearish trades.

<p>This Guide will equip prospective venture capital (VC) and private equity (PE) fund managers, service providers and investors with in-depth practical knowledge to navigate the Malaysian policy landscape governing VC and PE operations.</p>
<p>The VC and PE are important components of the alternative financing ecosystem in the Malaysian capital market. VC and PE firms play an essential role in nurturing promising startups and high growth enterprises, which are key to catalyse innovation, opportunities for local talent and contribute to the growth of the Malaysian economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SC Chairman, Dato&rsquo; Seri Dr. Awang Adek Hussin said, &ldquo;The Practical Guide on VC and PE in Malaysia is our commitment to fostering a conducive environment for investment and innovation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With clarity on the Malaysian business landscape for VC and PE firms, we aim to build a more vibrant community of professional investors to support entrepreneurs in Malaysia,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Key contents of the Guide include information on local capital market regulations pertaining to the VC and PE industries, foreign exchange policy, tax matters, fund structuring considerations and other areas critical to fund operations.</p>
<p>The issuance of the Guide is part of the SC&rsquo;s efforts to fostering a more dynamic private market sector under the Capital Market Masterplan 3. It will enhance the role of professional fund managers and cultivate a more vibrant investor base capable of channelling investments into startups and high growth micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs).</p>
<p>This initiative aligns with the SC&rsquo;s broader efforts to deepen market-based financing avenues for MSMEs and mid-tier companies (MTCs).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Guide also supports the national KL20 agenda to establish Malaysia as a leading startup ecosystem globally by providing practical guidance for prospective fund managers and investors seeking to establish or expand their presence in Malaysia.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The VC and PE industries have demonstrated steady growth. In 2023, the total fund commitments for VC and PE totalled RM17.85 billion, up from RM16.08 billion in 2022.&nbsp; VC and PE investments accounted for RM5.9 billion of total funds raised in Malaysia&rsquo;s capital markets between 2017 and 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Guide is part of SC&rsquo;s collaboration with Bank Negara Malaysia, Labuan Financial Services Authority, Malaysian Venture Capital and Private Equity Association and EY Tax Consultants.</p>

<title>Report: 65% Of Financial Institutions Struggle To Enforce Compliant Electronic Communications Policies - Annual Research From Global Relay Reveals That 79% Of Financial Services Firms Use Communication Surveillance Technology To Prevent Off-Channel Communications Violations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: WhatsApp bans, communication surveillance technology, compliance solutions, Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policies, AI in financial compliance
Summary:<br /><br />More firms use WhatsApp bans, surveillance technology, and compliance solutions. Difficulty in getting staff to comply persists. BYOD policies increase, AI adoption uncertain. North American firms cautious about AI. Regulatory scrutiny intensifies. <div>
<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.globalrelay.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Global Relay</a>, the&nbsp;leading provider of electronic communication compliance and archiving solutions,&nbsp;released its second annual&nbsp;<i>Industry Insights Report: Compliant Communication 2024</i>, discovering that despite a decrease of 15% year-over-year (YoY), WhatsApp bans prevail as the most-commonly used solution (43%) to marshal internal business communications. The report also revealed that four out of five firms (79%) are increasingly using communication surveillance technology to identify misconduct and culture risk.</p>
<p>The global survey examines how compliance, surveillance, and risk leaders in financial services are responding to intensified regulatory scrutiny surrounding recordkeeping and compliant communications, charting attitudes to WhatsApp, social media risks, monitoring and surveillance, sentiment around AI, and what the future might hold for compliance.&nbsp;Despite many firms noting that they ban the use of WhatsApp at work to mitigate the risk of non-compliant off-channel communications, only 50% of respondents said they thought that channel bans would withstand regulatory scrutiny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Asset managers, broker-dealers, and investment banks are all grappling with the WhatsApp conundrum,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<strong>Alex Viall, Chief Strategy Officer for Global Relay</strong>. &ldquo;We engineered Global Relay&rsquo;s unified platform to help institutions adapt to the fast-evolving business communications recordkeeping environment. It&rsquo;s significant progress that compliance solutions are more road-worthy than during the initial panic when the US Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission started their rolling enforcements. Many firms know they ultimately will have to enable this type of communication to stay competitive. We have worked hard to understand firms&rsquo; communications compliance needs and craft technology that addresses them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since the publication of last year&rsquo;s global&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Industry Insights Report</span>,&nbsp;U.S. regulators have continued to issue significant fines to firms that &ldquo;did not maintain or preserve the substantial majority of these off-channel communications,&rdquo; with three tranches of enforcements totalling&nbsp;nearly $450 million, most recently in February with the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2024-18" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SEC&rsquo;s $81 million in penalties against 16 firms</a>.</p>
<h4><b>Majority of firms encounter difficulty getting staff to comply with communication rules</b></h4>
<p>Global Relay&rsquo;s report also revealed that more firms &ndash; up 4% YoY &ndash; around the globe are facing difficulty getting staff to comply with rules around electronic communication channels, with nearly two-thirds (65%) citing this issue as part of their ongoing challenge around off-channel communications risk.&nbsp; Financial services firms are making progress toward monitoring business communications with significantly fewer respondents having difficulty monitoring all communication channels, down to 24% from 54% last year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Financial institutions are reacting in response to the substantial regulatory penalties,&rdquo; continued&nbsp;<strong>Viall</strong>. &ldquo;They have got the message and are implementing strategic compliant solutions that ensure the capture, storage, and monitoring of all essential business communication channels. This is no easy task. Compliance and risk officers are more aware that banning social media channels and forbidding the use of personal mobile devices are impractical measures that are difficult to enforce. Many are still in the planning phase but all are tackling this and prepared to show stakeholders and regulators how they best plan to manage off-channel communications.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Contrary to industry perception, the report revealed the number of financial institutions using Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policies has ballooned from 36% in 2023 to 53% in 2024. Considering continued enforcement for personal device usage, 45% of respondents have looked to clarify their BYOD policies, with 17% moving away from BYOD altogether.</p>
<h4><b>72% of global firms seek to introduce&nbsp;AI&nbsp;in the next year, but North American interest lags behind</b></h4>
<p>Respondents reported general uncertainty about AI in financial compliance, including whether it is a risk (17%), reward (10%) or both (32%). Despite this caution, 42% of global respondents said they would be looking to introduce AI to compliance workflows in the next 12 months, with 57% saying that they would not be. Leaders at North America firms demonstrated reticence compared to their European and Global counterparts, with 65% of North American firms noting they do not have plans to introduce AI within the next year.</p>
<p><i>Industry Insights Report: Compliant Communication 2024</i>&nbsp;serves as a litmus test for market responsiveness to regulatory action for recordkeeping and communications compliance. Regulators have taken steps to clarify expectations, including guidance from the&nbsp;SEC&nbsp;on when it will&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.globalrelay.com/resources/blog/fair-warning-sec-sets-out-trigger-factors-for-acting-against-ccos" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">enforce against Chief Compliance Officers</a>&nbsp;directly and the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.globalrelay.com/resources/blog/remediate-recordkeep-rinse-repeat" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">factors it considers</a>&nbsp;when imposing fines for recordkeeping violations.<span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<title>CalPERS To Vote Against Tesla CEO’s Multibillion-Dollar Pay Package</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> compensation, Tesla, CalPERS, CEO, vote<br />
Summary:<br />
CalPERS opposes Tesla CEO Elon Musk's $46 billion compensation package due to excessive dilution, lack of performance ties, and board independence concerns. Additionally, CalPERS opposes a shareholder lawsuit's proposed $5.6 billion attorneys' fees in Tesla stock. <div>
<p>CalPERS today announced that it will again vote against a multibillion-dollar compensation package that Tesla proposes to give its chief executive officer at the company&rsquo;s annual meeting on June 13. The package would allow Elon Musk to buy 304 million shares of Tesla stock at its 2018 value, which would be worth approximately $46 billion. CalPERS also opposed the deal when shareholders approved the measure in 2018.</p>
<p>"This exorbitant compensation package is at odds with CalPERS' longstanding views on executive pay," said CalPERS CEO Marcie Frost. "The compensation is excessive when compared to executives at peer companies, highly dilutive to shareholders, and isn&rsquo;t tied to the long-term profitability of Tesla."</p>
<p>CalPERS has developed an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.calpers.ca.gov/docs/executive-compensation-analysis-framework.pdf" target="_blank" title="opens in new window">Executive Compensation Analysis Framework (PDF)</a>&nbsp;to help guide decisions on "say on pay" votes. The framework helps CalPERS assess whether executive pay is aligned with company performance and is reasonable relative to peers.</p>
<p>"While we agree that Mr. Musk is entitled to be well compensated for his work, we also believe that a pay package should be commensurate to a company&rsquo;s performance with reasonable salary caps," Frost added. "These features are absent in the deal as structured."</p>
<p>Some data points highlight the excessive nature of the award:</p>
<ul>
<li>The value is approximately $46 billion, accounting for the cost to exercise the options, which is larger than the last four years of Tesla&rsquo;s aggregate net income of $33.8 billion (2020-2023).</li>
<li>The award would be highly dilutive to existing shareowners and reduce their ownership proportion.</li>
<li>While the award does have a five-year holding period, it is concentrated in a single individual.</li>
<li>Compared with other high-performing companies over the same period, the Tesla option award is nearly 140 times the annual pay opportunity for other high-performing CEOs.</li>
<li>The payout rewards short-term growth and not sustained profitability. Tesla&rsquo;s value has fallen by more than half from its peak in 2021.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"We do not think a payout based on short-term market exuberance is warranted without sustained performance," said CalPERS Global Equities Investment Director Drew Hambly. "Additionally, this deal concentrates power in a single shareholder and was negotiated by board members whose independence from Tesla's CEO is questionable. For these reasons, CalPERS could not support the deal in 2018 and remains opposed today."</p>
<p>In addition, CalPERS also announced that it&nbsp;<a href="https://secure.fileandservexpress.com/Document/Download/517b5336-476e-4385-adcf-7b97caa71bdc3" target="_blank" title="Opens in new window">filed an objection</a>&nbsp;in a related matter involving Tesla. Early this year, a judge nullified the 2018 pay package after a shareholder filed suit. The plaintiff&rsquo;s lawyers have asked the court to award them $5.6 billion in attorneys&rsquo; fees, taken in the form of Tesla stock. CalPERS believes this sum is also exorbitant and would dilute shareholders&rsquo; interests in Tesla. As a result, CalPERS is joining at least one other Tesla shareholder in protesting this proposed windfall.</p>
<p>CalPERS owned nearly 9.2 million Tesla shares as of June 7.</p>

Goltry and JAG Advisors raised funds by lying about the fund's performance, investment activity, and risks. They used more than $1.1 million on personal expenses and lost over $1.7 million through high-risk trading and speculative investments. They falsified documents to conceal the trading losses. Goltry and JAG Advisors agreed to settle the charges against them, which includes a permanent injunction from violating the federal securities laws. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey announced criminal charges against Goltry. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Joshua Goltry and his investment management firm, JAG Capital Advisors LLC (JAG Advisors), in connection with a three-year scheme to defraud investors of at least $3 million.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, from 2020 to 2023, Goltry, the founder and Chief Investment Officer of a purported equity fund called JAG Cap, LLC, and JAG Advisors, the purported equity fund&rsquo;s investment manager, raised at least $3 million from approximately nine investors by lying about nearly every aspect of the fund, including its performance, investment activity, and investment risks. Goltry is the principal of JAG Advisors. As alleged, of the funds raised, Goltry and JAG Advisors used at least $1.1 million on personal expenses, including travel and jewelry, and lost more than $1.7 million through high-risk trading and speculative investments. The complaint further alleges that Goltry and JAG Advisors falsified documents, including expense invoices, to conceal the trading losses from investors. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As alleged in the complaint, Goltry and JAG Advisors repeatedly lied to investors to lure them into investing in the JAG Fund and then lost their money or stole it to pay for lavish personal expenses,&rdquo; said Nicholas P. Grippo, Regional Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Philadelphia Regional Office. &ldquo;We will continue to diligently hold accountable those who exploit investors&rsquo; trust for personal gain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint charges Goltry and JAG Advisors with violating antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. Goltry and JAG Advisors agreed to settle the charges against them. The settlement, which is subject to court approval, would permanently enjoin Goltry and JAG Advisors from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and allows the court to decide the amounts of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties at a later date.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the District of New Jersey announced criminal charges against Goltry.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Suzanne C. Abt and Michael Cuff and supervised by Julia C. Green, Scott A. Thompson, and Mr. Grippo, all of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Judson T. Mihok and supervised by Gregory R. Bockin.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<div> Securities, Research, Regulation, AI, Capital Markets
<br />
Investment research, regulation, and AI are discussed. SEC rules, including research regulations, and the impact of AI in the capital markets.
<br /><br />Summary: 
Investment research regulation, including SEC rules and global impact. The role of AI in the capital markets. <div>
<p>Thank you for the kind introduction. I&rsquo;m pleased to be at the International Bar Association&rsquo;s Asset Management Industry Conference on Global Challenges and Opportunities.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-intl-bar-assoc-asset-mngmtindustry-conference-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;For the participants attending from abroad, welcome to Boston. It is an exciting time to be in the city, with the Boston Celtics competing at this moment for the NBA championship.</p>
<p>I understand that this particular IBA committee focuses on the global fund industry. It is no small feat to navigate the maze of laws and regulations and to counsel clients on complex issues that cross jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Despite our differences around the world, one constant is that the effectiveness of capital markets depends on the quality of the information environment. Today, I will discuss investment research provided by sell-side firms to asset managers and the rules governing such research. I have followed with much interest the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority&rsquo;s (&ldquo;UK FCA&rdquo;) recent consultation on modifying certain research unbundling rules required by the UK Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (&ldquo;UK MiFID&rdquo;), which were derived from the European Union&rsquo;s MiFID II.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-intl-bar-assoc-asset-mngmtindustry-conference-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;I commend the UK FCA for taking up this important issue and believe it is past time to review how investment research is regulated, including in the United States.</p>
<p>Investment research serves an important role in the global capital markets. It promotes the efficient allocation of capital and risk, resulting in increased economic growth and market liquidity. Sell-side and independent investment research help contribute to the efficient market hypothesis, in which prices reflect publicly available information. By contrast, buy-side research is typically proprietary and often only becomes incorporated into market prices when reflected by a manager&rsquo;s buy and sell orders. The decline of third-party investment research runs the risk that social media and rumors may increase in outsized influence &ndash; as nature abhors a vacuum. The result might be less informed and less efficient markets that do not serve investors and increase the cost of capital.</p>
<p>Regulators are demanding more disclosure than ever from public companies. For example, in the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s (&ldquo;SEC&rdquo;) climate-related disclosure rule would require extensive new public company disclosure.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-intl-bar-assoc-asset-mngmtindustry-conference-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;Public companies are also now required to disclose material cybersecurity incidents and describe their approach to cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-intl-bar-assoc-asset-mngmtindustry-conference-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;The New York Stock Exchange (&ldquo;NYSE&rdquo;) and Nasdaq-listed companies must also adopt and file policies regarding the recovery or &ldquo;clawback&rdquo; of excessive incentive-based compensation from current and former executive officers in the event of an accounting restatement.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-intl-bar-assoc-asset-mngmtindustry-conference-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;Third-party research can be an important resource in helping investors and asset managers digest the increasing volume of public company disclosures mandated by regulators. After all, what good is disclosure if no one has time to read it?</p>
<p>Despite the role played by investment research in price discovery and market efficiency, sell-side investment research that is bundled with trade execution has been viewed with skepticism by regulators, including by the SEC, due to potential conflicts of interest. First, a brief history about sell-side research in the United States: until May 1, 1975, when the SEC adopted Rule 19b-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (&ldquo;Exchange Act&rdquo;), NYSE required brokers to charge a minimum brokerage rate.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-intl-bar-assoc-asset-mngmtindustry-conference-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p>Fixed commission rates meant that broker-dealers had to compete in other ways, such as by providing customers with bundled research. The elimination of fixed commission rates thus raised questions for investment managers and the capital markets: for example, would managers be required by their fiduciary duty to pay the lowest commission rate and forgo bundled research? If brokers decided to stop producing research and compete solely on execution costs and speed, would smaller companies receive less research coverage and be less successful in raising capital? Would fewer companies decide to go public due to a concern about research coverage?</p>
<p>Congress recognized these potential problems and enacted section 28(e) of the Exchange Act in 1975.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-intl-bar-assoc-asset-mngmtindustry-conference-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;Section 28(e) provides a safe harbor for investment managers to pay more than the lowest commission rate if the manager determines in good faith that the commission is reasonable in relation to the value of such services. This permitted investment managers to &ldquo;pay up&rdquo; for soft dollars (e.g., research) alongside execution services and continue to use client funds to do so. With this safe harbor, however, came difficult interpretative questions about whether a product or service could be paid with soft dollars. To this end, the Commission and its staff have studied and issued guidance over the years about certain services and practices that were remotely connected to the investment decision-making process and thus did not likely qualify to be paid with soft dollars.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-intl-bar-assoc-asset-mngmtindustry-conference-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p>However by its terms, section 28(e) expressly permits broker-dealers to continue bundling execution and research and recognized that research can benefit investors by promoting more informed decision making from asset managers. Section 28(e) also demonstrates Congress&rsquo;s view of the importance of the service that broker-dealers provide in producing research, and that it is acceptable for managers to use client funds to pay for bundled research and execution, subject to certain safeguards.</p>
<p>During the dot-com bubble of the late-1990s that eventually crashed, concerns were raised about the role played by sell-side investment research. It culminated in the global research analyst settlements, when the then-NASD (now FINRA), the SEC, the NYSE, the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA), and the New York State Attorney General settled with 12 major broker-dealer firms for conflicts of interest between their research analysts and investment bankers (&ldquo;Global Research Settlement&rdquo;).<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-intl-bar-assoc-asset-mngmtindustry-conference-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;Investment bankers also were alleged to have supervised and taken part in research analyst compensation decisions. The Global Research Settlement required these broker-dealers to wall off research analysts from investment banking due to allegations that analysts published research designed to attract investment banking business based on favorable company reports. The Global Research Settlement&rsquo;s terms were modified in 2010. Only specific 12 firms were subject to the Global Research Settlement, and two &ndash; Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers &ndash; are no longer in existence, and Credit Suisse has since been acquired by UBS.</p>
<p>In addition, Regulation AC &ndash; which stands for &ldquo;Analyst Certification&rdquo; &ndash; was adopted by the SEC in 2003. While the proposal predated the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (&ldquo;SOX&rdquo;), which required the SEC to adopt certain rules regarding research analysts, the SEC noted that it would abide by the SOX directives in adopting Regulation AC.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-intl-bar-assoc-asset-mngmtindustry-conference-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;Regulation AC generally requires research analysts to certify to the truthfulness of the views they express in research reports and public appearances, and to disclose whether they have received any compensation related to the specific recommendations or views expressed in those reports and appearances.</p>
<p>Regulators elsewhere in the world, notably the EU and the UK, have taken a different approach, viewing the bundling of execution and research as an inducement to asset managers and thus an investor protection issue. Accordingly, MiFID II generally requires managers to pay for research separately from execution services, charge clients a separate fee, or pay for research themselves. MiFID II&rsquo;s research rules may have intended for independent research and lower commissions to offset the reduction in sell-side research; however, it appears that this experiment may have not accomplished these goals and has had unintended results.</p>
<p>For example, due to concerns about MiFID II leading to a decline in research on small and medium companies, the French Authorit&eacute; de March&eacute;s Financiers has recommended that MiFID II&rsquo;s inducements regime should not apply to research on companies with market capitalizations of &euro;1 billion or less.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-intl-bar-assoc-asset-mngmtindustry-conference-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;Across the English Channel, the UK FCA has issued a consultation requesting input on re-bundling investment research with brokerage execution services. This consultation follows up other work by the UK FCA, including the concerns noted by an Independent Research Review (&ldquo;IRR&rdquo;) study.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-intl-bar-assoc-asset-mngmtindustry-conference-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;The IRR found that the UK MiFID unbundling requirements adversely affected the quality and coverage of investment research for UK companies, and the UK&rsquo;s economic growth as a result. In addition, UK asset managers were disadvantaged as compared to their international peers in accessing global investment research, making them less competitive. Finally, the IRR noted a possible decline in the quality of UK research due to a &ldquo;juniorization&rdquo; in the ranks of sell-side research analysts. The efforts of these regulators to take a hard look at whether their regulatory policies achieved their intended goals is commendable.</p>
<p>MiFID II&rsquo;s inducements regime also caused challenging conflicts of laws issues for U.S. broker-dealers: charging separately for research services implicated questions of whether U.S. broker-dealers could rely on the exclusion from the definition of an investment adviser if they complied with MiFID II.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-intl-bar-assoc-asset-mngmtindustry-conference-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>&nbsp;To that end, the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Investment Management issued temporary no-action letter relief to permit U.S. broker-dealers to comply with MiFID II&rsquo;s research requirements and continue their business models.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-intl-bar-assoc-asset-mngmtindustry-conference-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>&nbsp;This relief was left to expire in July 2023, which was most unfortunate. In my view, the no-action letter should have been extended for a modest period to accommodate potential changes in UK MiFID and MiFID II.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-intl-bar-assoc-asset-mngmtindustry-conference-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>&nbsp;With the UK FCA&rsquo;s consultation, it become even more apparent that allowing the letter to expire was premature.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the Global Settlement, the SEC&rsquo;s then-enforcement director stated that &ldquo;the full impact remains to be seen&rdquo; and others hoped that it would lead to &ldquo;more straight talk on Wall Street.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-intl-bar-assoc-asset-mngmtindustry-conference-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>&nbsp;The impact, unfortunately, has been a lot less research out of Wall Street, particularly for small and medium sized companies. I hope that the SEC can learn from our international colleagues and examine our own research rules, including the Global Research Settlement.</p>
<p>The SEC should further undertake a retrospective review of the similarly 20-year-old Regulation AC, which would be an exercise of good government and responsible regulation. In this regard, the SEC should take heed of the 2017 recommendation from the U.S. Department of the Treasury that the SEC should conduct a holistic review of the Global Research Settlement and the research analyst rules to determine which provisions should be retained, amended, or removed, with the objective of harmonizing a single set of rules for all financial institutions.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-intl-bar-assoc-asset-mngmtindustry-conference-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a></p>
<p>Turning to today, I noticed that the IBA is holding two discussions on artificial intelligence (&ldquo;AI&rdquo;). AI is a hot topic, as it touches many areas of financial services and the capital markets, including investment research. AI and machine learning can automate and analyze vast quantities of data, such as financial statements and other public company disclosures. With AI, the research analyst&rsquo;s role could change, perhaps focusing less on data collection and more on interpretation and qualitative analysis. AI also could increase the resources available for smaller company coverage. &nbsp;Of course, AI is fallible and if not properly constructed and monitored, it could miss patterns, correlations, and risks. Therefore, while I am not overly concerned about a dystopian future where we are ruled by AI, we should continue to evaluate its use.</p>
<p>Thank you again for the invitation to speak and for your continued commitment to the global rule of law.</p>

<div> indicators, economic activity, inflation, monetary policy, Committee
Summary: Economic activity remains solid with strong job gains and low unemployment. Inflation is elevated but easing. Committee maintains federal funds rate and is committed to achieving 2 percent inflation. <div>
<p>Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. Job gains have remained strong, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Inflation has eased over the past year but remains elevated. In recent months, there has been modest further progress toward the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective.</p>
<p>The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals have moved toward better balance over the past year. The economic outlook is uncertain, and the Committee remains highly attentive to inflation risks.</p>
<p>In support of its goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent. In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent. In addition, the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage‑backed securities. The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.</p>
<p>In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.</p>
<p>Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chair; John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Thomas I. Barkin; Michael S. Barr; Raphael W. Bostic; Michelle W. Bowman; Lisa D. Cook; Mary C. Daly; Philip N. Jefferson; Adriana D. Kugler; Loretta J. Mester; and Christopher J. Waller.</p>

<div> monitoring report, cross-zonal transmission capacities, EU electricity market, grid congestion, future-looking assessment<br />
Summary:<br />
ACER and JRC will present findings on 70% transmission capacity requirement, integration of EU electricity market, and future assessment of grid congestion. <br /> <div>
<p>ACER and the Joint Research Centre (JRC) are organising a joint webinar to present and discuss the key findings from their&nbsp;2024 publications, focusing on electricity grid congestion and transmission capacities for cross-border electricity trade:</p>
<ul>
<li>ACER&rsquo;s yearly monitoring report on cross-zonal transmission capacities and the progress of Member States in reaching the minimum 70% requirement (to be published on 3 July 2024);</li>
<li><a href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsCVAYABVIBV0wIDwFSHVZbAFIdCggIAxpTAVZWVlADBw5QDgIdUAVbU1tTVVcdVAAAVx0GXwQAGldSVgMZAVZRAFBXVFBUXFJQRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" target="_blank">JRC&rsquo;s future-looking assessment on the evolution of congestion management in the current EU electricity market design</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">When?</span></p>
<p>Wednesday, 10 July 2024, 14:30 - 15:30 CET, online</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tackling barriers in the EU&rsquo;s transition to net-zero</span></p>
<p>A successfully integrated EU electricity market is crucial for the EU&rsquo;s ambitions of achieving net-zero emissions while maintaining its global competitiveness. How efficiently the electricity market design addresses grid congestion is key to this effort.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Realising the 70% transmission capacity requirement helps further integrate markets</span></p>
<p>EU rules mandate that grid operators ensure at least 70% of transmission capacity is available for electricity trade with neighbouring countries by the end of 2025. Why? Making the required 70% of capacity available for cross-zonal trade better integrates markets, enhances security of supply, reduces price volatility and increases the flexibility of the system. ACER monitors annually the availability of cross-zonal capacities in the EU and the progress of Member States in reaching the 70% requirement.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Future-proofing the European electricity market</span></p>
<p>The European Commission&rsquo;s JRC has developed a future-looking assessment of the volume and cost of addressing congestion in the electricity grid for the target years 2030 and 2040, based on different grid expansion scenarios.</p>

<p>The CanDeal marketplace, which offers trading across Government of Canada, Provincials, CMBs, Municipals, Corporate Bonds, Treasury Bills, Canadian Money Market, Repo and Interest Rate Swaps, is on track for a record year of trading activity.</p>

<title>DTCC’s FICC Launches CCLF Public Calculator To Support Expansion Of U.S. Treasury Clearing - In Anticipation Of The New SEC Requirements For Expanded U.S. Treasury Clearing, This New Tool Simulates Estimated CCLF Obligations Associated With FICC GSD Membership</title>

<div> DTCC, FICC, CCLF, liquidity obligations, transparency<br />
Summary:<br />
DTCC launches public-facing CCLF calculator for U.S. Treasury market participants to estimate liquidity obligations and understand GSD membership requirements. <div>
<p>DTCC, the premier post-trade market infrastructure for the global financial services industry, today announced the launch of FICC&rsquo;s interactive, public-facing&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.dtcc.com/managing-risk/stress-testing-and-liquidity-risk-management/ccfl-public-calculator" target="_blank">Capped Contingency Liquidity Facility (CCLF) Calculator</a></span>.</p>
<p>With the expansion of central clearing in U.S. Treasuries on the horizon and given the size of transactions in the U.S. Treasury market - now exceeding USD $7 trillion daily - CCLF is a critical risk management tool used for managing DTCC&rsquo;s Fixed Income Clearing Corporation&rsquo;s (FICC) liquidity risk arising from settlement activity. Market participants can input their current unique settlement activity into the calculator to estimate and understand the CCLF-related liquidity obligations that could arise from membership.</p>
<p>CCLF is a rules-based liquidity resource facility that would provide FICC with additional liquid financial resources to meet its cash settlement obligations in the event of a default of the largest GSD family of affiliated Netting Members. To anticipate this potential funding need, GSD Netting Members incorporate their individually determined CCLF obligation amounts into their own liquidity plans. While the CCLF obligation is a committed obligation for the Netting Members, FICC does not require pre-funding or deposits of the obligation amount. Instead, as an ongoing FICC membership requirement Netting Members provide up-front attestations regarding their ability to provide such CCLF amounts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By providing the public CCLF calculator, we continue to increase transparency into our financial risk management program, empowering potential members to understand their role and obligations as a FICC GSD member,&rdquo; Tim Hulse, Managing Director, Financial Risk &amp; Governance at DTCC. &ldquo;CCLF provides a critical backstop to address the financial impact of volatility and stress across repo markets while safeguarding the industry and individual members.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The new CCLF calculator, accessible on dtcc.com, requires a series of data points to be provided by users. Once entered on screen, the calculator processes the data points using the existing GSD CCLF engine logic, delivering an estimated individual CCLF obligation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;FICC recognizes that many firms are considering membership with GSD to comply with the final SEC rule on expanded clearing of U.S. Treasury activity,&rdquo; said Claire Lough, Executive Director, Financial Risk &amp; Governance at DTCC. &ldquo;This calculator will enable market participants to simulate their potential CCLF obligations to assist in understanding what is required of a GSD Netting Member.&rdquo;</p>
<p>FICC is the leading provider of trade comparison, netting and settlement for the Government Securities marketplace. As part of its commitment to the industry, DTCC continues to assess calculators, tools and enhanced access methods to best support the expansion of U.S. Treasury clearing activity.</p>

<div> MOU, TFEX, RAOT, rubber reference prices, Thailand
Summary:<br />TFEX and RAOT partner to establish standardized Rubber Reference Prices, benefiting the industry and enhancing transparency and confidence.<br /> <div>
<p class="BodyA">Thailand Futures Exchange PCL (TFEX) has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Rubber Authority of Thailand (RAOT) for collaboration to establish the standardized Rubber Reference Prices. These benchmarks will serve as references trading transactions for both domestic and international players and facilitate the development of related products.</p>
<p class="BodyA"><b>TFEX Managing Director Rinjai Chakornpipat </b>said that<b> </b>the initiative is aimed to develop a recognized Rubber Reference Prices for Thailand, which will benefit both the rubber and related industries.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BodyA">"TFEX and RAOT aim for the reference prices to be widely accepted and used in trading transactions domestically and internationally. TFEX will calculate and publish the reference prices. The methodology for established reference price will be published for general public to ensure transparency of the benchmark. TFEX and RAOT also have a plan to consult with the industry to explore the development of rubber reference prices that comply with the European Union Deforestation-Free Regulation (EUDR). Besides, TFEX will further explore to utilize these reference prices for Rubber Futures product development," said Rinjai.</p>
<p class="BodyA"><b>RAOT Governor Nakorn Tangavirapat</b> said that even though Thailand is the world's major rubber producer, the country had relied on international rubber market prices as reference for its export contracts. Development of its domestic reference prices will help reflect the costs of Thai rubber farmers and local producers. To address this issue, RAOT, the central agency overseeing the entire rubber industry including domestic and export markets, has partnered with TFEX to develop the reference price calculation methodology for trading Thai rubber with aims to ensure transparency and adhere to international standards. The established reference prices will be publicly published, enabling relevant stakeholders to use them as a basis for determining contract prices for rubber exports (FOB prices). This development is expected to enhance confidence among stakeholders in the rubber industry. Under the collaboration, RAOT will gather and provide data on trading volumes, product information for various types of rubber, and other necessary information from RAOT&rsquo;s central rubber markets in each province. TFEX will use such data to calculate reference prices. RAOT and TFEX will disseminate these reference prices.</p>
<p class="BodyA">"We firmly believe that this collaboration marks a significant step in establishing internationally accepted methodology to establish Thai rubber reference prices and will pave the way for Thailand to become a hub for the rubber product industry, ultimately benefiting rubber farmers and Thai rubber entrepreneurs by strengthening their livelihoods and ensuring career stability,&rdquo; added Nakorn.</p>
<p>The MOU signing ceremony was held on June 12, 2024. The rubber reference prices will be calculated and published twice daily as follows: the price for Ribbed Smoked Sheet Grade 3 (RSS3) will be released at 12:00 hrs. (planned to launch in July 2024), while the prices for concentrated latex and block rubber will be announced at 19:00 hrs. (planned to launch in September 2024). For information on the Rubber Reference Prices, please visit TFEX website (<a href="http://www.tfex.co.th/">www.TFEX.co.th</a>) and the RAOT website (www.raot.co.th).</p>

<title>Three Million 'Frankenstein' Identities Pose A Multi-Billion Pound Fraud Threat: LexisNexis Risk Solutions</title>

<div> fraud, synthetic identity, UK, businesses, credit checks
Summary:<br /><br />New research from LexisNexis Risk Solutions shows that synthetic identity fraud threatens UK businesses with potential losses of £4.2billion by 2027. Scammers are creating synthetic identities to bypass fraud defenses, leading to potential significant financial losses for organizations. Noreen Altaf, an Identity Fraud specialist at LexisNexis Risk Solutions, advises businesses to invest in tools capable of spotting synthetic identities and review existing portfolios for any synthetic identities that may have infiltrated before they result in financial losses. <div>
<p>The latest fraud threatening the UK could cost businesses at least &pound;4.2billion if appropriate steps are not taken, new research from&nbsp;LexisNexis Risk Solutions shows.</p>
<div class="PRN_ImbeddedAssetReference" id="DivAssetPlaceHolder1">
<p><img src="https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2436045/LexisNexis_Risk_Solutions.jpg" title="Hotspots showing the fast-growth of synthetic Frankenstein identities across the UK" /></p>
</div>
<p>A new study looked at over 72million consumer profiles and found 2.8million showing several signs of 'Frankenstein cloning', where fraudsters stitch real and made-up personal details together to create a 'new' synthetic identity to spoof credit checks and commit high-value fraud against banks and credit providers.</p>
<p>In the U.S. where synthetic fraud is already a major issue, businesses report an average $15k<sup>[1]</sup>&nbsp;loss to each confirmed synthetic fraud case. As a result, experts at LexisNexis Risk Solutions estimate that it could cost the UK economy around &pound;4.2billion by 2027, unless firms start properly screening now, for the threat.</p>
<p>Most organisations' existing fraud defences are ineffective against synthetic identities because they appear as normal, good customers until the fraud is committed. Once they 'bust out' with the funds, the lender is left to suffer the loss, as there's no 'real' person to pursue for the debt.</p>
<p>Noreen Altaf, Identity Fraud specialist at LexisNexis Risk Solutions, explains: "At first, a synthetic ID has little value to a fraudster, as it has no credit history, so they need to play the long game. Scammers nurture each false identity by building what appears to be a real credit profile over time, making the synthetic ID seem like a trustworthy customer &ndash; because of this the fraud threat is effectively invisible to firms' existing fraud defences, until it's too late.</p>
<p>"Once a fraudster thinks the synthetic ID has enough plausibility, they'll aim to max out available credit lines. This might be applying for a loan or credit card for thousands of pounds, taking a PCP contract for a new vehicle, or making a high-value purchase via a buy now pay later arrangement. The fraudster has no intention of repaying this, leaving organisations to foot the bill and chasing ghosts to recover the debt.</p>
<p>"There is still much businesses don't know about this fast-emerging threat, so it's difficult to predict the true potential cost of synthetic fraud to the UK. However, even a very conservative estimate of a &pound;1,500 loss per fraud attack amounts to &pound;4.2 billion in future credit write-offs for companies, with synthetic identities already hiding amongst their customer base &ndash; and it could be a lot higher."</p>
<p>The study found strong evidence of scammers up and down the country using 'synthetic farms' in rural locations and 'synthetic factories' in urban areas to build up the credit scores of new synthetic identities on an industrial scale, in readiness for fraud attacks.</p>
<p>In one example, rental cottages based on a farm in Chichester appeared to have 439 highly suspect identities 'living' there over the past seven years, only 22 of which showed any evidence of being real people. The identities were making hundreds of applications for credit, such as short-term and payday loans and some were also linked to a similar farm hundreds of miles away near Dundee, Scotland.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A heat map produced alongside the report shows similar activity is happening across the whole UK. Suspected synthetic farms can be seen in multiple locations across rural Wales and the Scottish Highlands.</p>
<p>Noreen continues: "A common characteristic of synthetic farms and factories is that they are properties where the mail can be easily intercepted by the fraudsters making credit applications. A farm, for example, might have a mailbox that's at the end of a track, while empty buildings or shared mailboxes in cities can be exploited in a similar way.</p>
<p>"Synthetic fraud has been around for a while, but with sophisticated fraud modelling, we can, for the first time, more accurately detect and put a figure on it.</p>
<p>"Businesses need to act fast to protect themselves by investing in tools capable of spotting synthetic identities at application or onboarding stage, before they become customers. Given the length of time fraudsters have already been creating and nurturing synthetic identities in the UK &ndash; as evidenced by our research &ndash; banks, lenders and credit providers, in particular, should take appropriate action to review their existing portfolios to ascertain the extent to which synthetic identities may have infiltrated their organisations over time, before those identities get a chance to cash out."</p>

<div> Blueprint, Climate risk platform, Financial authorities, Integration, Data

Summary:
- Project Viridis integrates regulatory and climate data
- Developed by BIS and MAS
- A platform to identify, monitor and manage climate risks
- Uses EDKP technology
- Demonstrates integration of regulatory and climate data<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<ul>
<li>Project Viridis explores how regulatory and climate data could be integrated to provide insights into climate-related financial risks.</li>
<li>The project&rsquo;s report outlines a blueprint for a climate risk platform that can be used to identify, monitor and manage climate risks in the financial system.</li>
<li>The platform uses technology architecture developed by the BIS Innovation Hub Singapore Centre and MAS, enhanced in collaboration with other financial authorities from around the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) have developed a blueprint for a platform that integrates regulatory and climate data to help financial authorities identify, monitor and manage climate risks in the financial system.</p>
<p>2&nbsp;<span> </span>Integrating climate risk analysis into financial stability surveillance is challenging due to the complex nature of climate change, notable data gaps and limited understanding of how to measure the associated risks. To help tackle this challenge, a blueprint of a climate risk platform has been developed at the BIS Innovation Hub Centre in Singapore through Project Viridis.</p>
<p>3&nbsp;<span> </span>The blueprint lays out the key features and metrics required for a climate risk platform. These incorporate data and information on financed emissions, physical risk exposure and forward-looking assessments under different climate scenarios.</p>
<p>4&nbsp;<span> </span>&ldquo;As the impact of climate change on the global financial landscape intensifies, the need for adaptive and forward-thinking strategies has never been more urgent. Project Viridis helps equip financial authorities with the insights needed to integrate emerging climate risks into their analysis &ndash; and thereby help promote global financial stability,&rdquo; said Maha El Dimachki, Head of the BIS Innovation Hub Singapore Centre.</p>
<p>5&nbsp;<span> </span>&ldquo;Project Viridis is an innovative, collaborative blueprint that leverages technology solutions to systematically track climate-related data and metrices, thereby augmenting regulators&rsquo; efforts in assessing physical and transition climate risk exposures of individual banks and the financial system. This project addresses a common need of global financial authorities, and we look forward to further collaboration to expand such toolkits,&rdquo; said Celine Sia, Assistant Managing Director (Economics &amp; Knowledge Management), MAS.</p>
<p>6&nbsp;<span> </span>Project Viridis demonstrates how regulatory data can be integrated with climate data, which are extracted from corporate disclosure documents using natural language processing techniques. This provides authorities with insights into climate-related financial risks, helping them form an initial view of financial institutions&rsquo; risk exposures, and to identify areas that may require deeper risk assessment.</p>
<p>7&nbsp;<span> </span>More information on the platform can be found in the Project Viridis final report published&nbsp;<a class="mas-link" href="https://www.bis.org/publ/othp85.htm" target="_blank"><span class="mas-link__text">here</span>&nbsp;<span class="mas-icon mas-glyphs-external--link">&nbsp;</span></a>.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p><span><span>Additional Information</span></span></p>
<p>Project Viridis was first announced during BIS Innovation Hub&rsquo;s workplan in January 2022. For more information, please refer to this&nbsp;<a class="mas-link" href="https://www.bis.org/press/p220125.htm" target="_blank"><span class="mas-link__text">link</span>&nbsp;<span class="mas-icon mas-glyphs-external--link">&nbsp;</span></a>. As its foundational architecture, the Viridis platform uses the Ellipse Data and Knowledge Platform (EDKP), which was developed by the BIS Innovation Hub Singapore Centre and MAS under&nbsp;<a class="mas-link" href="https://www.bis.org/about/bisih/topics/suptech_regtech/ellipse.htm" target="_blank"><span class="mas-link__text">Project Ellipse</span>&nbsp;<span class="mas-icon mas-glyphs-external--link"></span></a>. The EDKP enables the integration of structured and unstructured data from various sources, and is being collaboratively enhanced by more than 15 central banks and financial regulators around the world. More information on EDKP can be found&nbsp;<a class="mas-link" href="https://www.bis.org/innovation/bis_open_tech_ellipse.htm" target="_blank"><span class="mas-link__text">here</span>&nbsp;<span class="mas-icon mas-glyphs-external--link"></span></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<title>New Zealand Financial Markets Authority Files Civil Proceedings Against Booster Investment Management Ltd And Individual Directors And Senior Managers</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-files-civil-proceedings-against-booster/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-files-civil-proceedings-against-booster/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The FMA has filed civil proceedings against Booster Investment Management Limited (BIML), a wholly owned subsidiary of Booster Financial Services Limited. The proceedings allege breaches of the Financial Markets Conduct Act (FMCA) by BIML and the following directors and senior managers of BIML:&nbsp;Allan Yeo (director), Paul Foley (director), Brendon Doyle (former director), David Beattie (senior manager) and Nicholas Craven (senior manager).</p>
<p>The FMA proceedings allege that multiple breaches occurred through 2017-2022, arising from investments made by BIML into a related, limited partnership, the Booster Tahi Limited Partnership (Tahi), which in turn invested into a series of domestic wine businesses, later amalgamated into the Booster Wine Group (BWG).&nbsp;The investors referred to in this case are retail investors and the funds involved come from three Booster Schemes (the Booster KiwiSaver Scheme, Booster Super Scheme and Booster Investment Scheme, (the&nbsp;Schemes)).&nbsp;Booster has advised that as at 31 May 2024, 24 of the 61 retail funds Booster manages have exposure to BWG, including six KiwiSaver Funds. Those Funds&rsquo; exposure ranges from 0.77% to 3.83%.</p>
<p>The FMA alleges 75 causes of action that:</p>
<ul>
<li>BIML breached its duties and obligations as the manager of the Schemes when investing in the manner described above;</li>
<li>the individuals involved used their positions improperly as directors or senior managers, in circumstances where conflicts of interest and related party benefits were not properly managed, when making investments of Scheme funds to benefit Tahi and the BWG; and</li>
<li>failures to follow required processes meant that the relevant transactions were made in breach of the prohibition against related party transactions.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Relevant provisions of the FMCA</p>
<p>Managers&rsquo; Duties</p>
<p>The entity, BIML:</p>
<ul>
<li>section 143(1)(b)(i) - to act in best interests of scheme participants (six causes of action);</li>
<li>section 143(2) - to carry out the functions of a manager in accordance with the governing document (18 causes of action);</li>
<li>section 143(3) - to comply with the same duties and liabilities as those imposed on a trustee (one cause of action); and</li>
<li>section 144 - to exercise any powers, or perform any duties, with the care, diligence and skill that a prudent person engaged in that profession would exercise (14 causes of action).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Individuals:</p>
<ul>
<li>sections 145(1)(b) - duty to not make an improper use of their position to gain an advantage for another (17 causes of action); and</li>
<li>section 533(1)(c) - being knowingly concerned in a breach of s 143 (for Mr Yeo and Mr Doyle only) (one cause of action).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Related party transactions</p>
<ul>
<li>section 173(1) - general prohibition on transactions giving a related party benefit (18 causes of action).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The basis for the FMA filing a case for these alleged breaches is broadly as follows:</p>
<p>As the Manager of these schemes, BIML is responsible for selecting and managing the investment portfolios of Scheme funds in accordance with its governing documents (including the trust deed, Product Disclosure Statement and Statement of Investment Policy and Objectives). BIML&rsquo;s Investment Committee (BIML IC) is delegated to make specific investment decisions within the framework of those governing documents, and in accordance with BIML&rsquo;s Investment Charter.</p>
<p>The FMA alleges the relevant Tahi investments were made without any consideration by the BIML Investment Committee:</p>
<ul>
<li>where the specific circumstances of an investment suggest that it was not in the best interests of Scheme participants. These circumstances include the concerns of BWG's lenders (that were known to BIML), the purpose of advances, and the underperformance of the BWG;</li>
<li>where the specific investment was not made in accordance with Tahi's investment criteria (which BIML was obliged to monitor);</li>
<li>the size and timing of particular requests for funding, and the timeframe for responses; and where there were material changes in the underlying business or the broader circumstances of that underlying business, without any reassessment of the appropriateness of the ongoing investment.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Margot Gatland, FMA Head of Enforcement, said: &ldquo;The FMA considers the alleged breaches to be serious, and that civil proceedings are the proportionate response. The allegations are centred around important governance provisions of the FMCA, including fiduciary duties of managers and related party transactions. The Court&rsquo;s determination will provide guidance to the market about the application of these core FMCA investor protection provisions, that managers and directors are required to comply with when making investment decisions on behalf of others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The FMA will be seeking declarations of contravention, pecuniary penalties to be paid to the Crown, and an inquiry into damages. As the case is now before the courts, the FMA cannot comment further on these matters.</p>
<p>FMA&rsquo;s approach to supervision during a litigation process</p>
<p>The FMA's regulatory delivery team has increased engagement with BIML to ensure it is satisfied with aspects of BIML&rsquo;s governance and operations, with a focus on its direct investment activities. Booster is cooperating with the FMA&rsquo;s supervisory team. This work will continue in parallel with the proceedings and is focused on current and future compliance and investor outcomes.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Each contravention has a maximum penalty of $600,000 for the entity, and $200,000 for an individual.</p>
<p>A court directed inquiry into damages would determine, if agreed to by the court, what harm or loss any investors have suffered as a result of the alleged breaches.</p>

<div> SEC, PCAOB, Erica Y. Williams, Chairperson, appointment<br />
Summary:<br />SEC appoints Erica Y. Williams as PCAOB Chairperson for a second term, overseeing public company audits and standards. Williams has extensive SEC and legal experience. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the appointment of Erica Y. Williams to a second term as Chairperson of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) beginning on Oct. 25, 2024, and running through Oct. 24, 2029.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank Erica for her leadership and am pleased that she will continue to serve as Chairperson of the PCAOB,&rdquo; said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. &ldquo;I also thank the PCAOB staff and the Board for their diligent work to ensure that public company financial disclosures can be trusted by investors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>SEC Chief Accountant Paul Munter added, &ldquo;I look forward to continuing to work with Chairperson Williams to further the PCAOB&rsquo;s long-overdue plan to modernize standards and improve audit quality to promote investor protection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>"I am honored to have Chair Gensler and the Commission's confidence and grateful for the opportunity to continue working alongside my fellow Board Members and the talented and dedicated PCAOB staff to protect investors," said Chair Williams. "I'm proud of our work together and eager to continue executing our mission on behalf of investors who depend on U.S. capital markets to build their American dream."</p>
<p>Prior to joining the PCAOB in January 2022, Erica Y. Williams was a litigation partner with Kirkland &amp; Ellis LLP.

<title>SEC Charges Founder Of AI Hiring Startup Joonko With Fraud</title>

<div> charged, fraud, artificial intelligence, SEC, investor <br />
<br />
Ilit Raz, CEO of Joonko, charged by SEC for defrauding investors of $21M with false statements about company's clients, revenue, and AI capabilities. Criminal charges also filed. <br />
Summary: <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Ilit Raz, CEO and founder of the now-shuttered artificial intelligence recruitment startup Joonko, with defrauding investors of at least $21 million by making false and misleading statements about the quantity and quality of Joonko&rsquo;s customers, the number of candidates on its platform, and the company&rsquo;s revenue.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Joonko claimed to use artificial intelligence to help clients find diverse and underrepresented candidates to fulfill their diversity, equity, and inclusion hiring goals. To raise money for Joonko, the complaint alleges that Raz falsely told investors that Joonko had more than 100 customers, including Fortune 500 companies, and provided investors with fabricated testimonials from several companies expressing their appreciation for Joonko and praising its effectiveness. Raz also allegedly lied to investors that Joonko had earned more than $1 million in revenue and was working with more than 100,000 active job candidates. When an investor grew suspicious of Raz&rsquo;s claims, Raz allegedly provided the investor with falsified bank statements and forged contracts in an effort to conceal the fraud. According to the complaint, the scheme unraveled in mid-2023 when the investor confronted Raz, who admitted to forging bank statements and contracts and lying about Joonko&rsquo;s revenue and number of customers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We allege that Raz engaged in an old school fraud using new school buzzwords like &lsquo;artificial intelligence&rsquo; and &lsquo;automation,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;As more and more people seek out AI-related investment opportunities, we will continue to police the markets against AI-washing and the type of misconduct alleged in today&rsquo;s complaint. But at the same time, it is critical for investors to beware of companies exploiting the fanfare around artificial intelligence to raise funds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges Raz with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and seeks a permanent injunction, civil money penalties, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and an officer-and-director bar against Raz.</p>
<p>In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Raz.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Alicia Guo, Ariel Atlas, Neil Hendelman, and Lindsay S. Moilanen and was supervised by Sheldon L. Pollock of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Guo and Ms. Atlas, and supervised by Daniel Loss and Mr. Pollock. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Southern District of New York and the FBI.</p>

<div> SEC, capital markets, securities laws, agency, international dialogue <br />
Summary:<br />
SEC Chair welcomes Class of 2024 to International Institute. Discusses capital markets, securities laws, and SEC's role. Emphasizes international cooperation. <div>
<p>Thank you, YJ, for that kind introduction.</p>
<p>As is customary, I&rsquo;d like to note that my views are my own as Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and I am not speaking on behalf of my fellow Commissioners or the staff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to welcome you&mdash;the nearly 120 members of the &ldquo;Class of 2024&rdquo; attending the SEC&rsquo;s International Institute on Securities Market Growth and Development.</p>
<p>Traveling from approximately 70 different countries and territories, and spending the next week and a half here, is a big commitment on your part.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re investing in your own human capital, taking time out of your busy lives, and learning about our securities markets, U.S. securities laws, and the SEC.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re also investing in your nation&rsquo;s capital by learning about how to promote your capital markets to the best they can be.</p>
<p>This is the 30<span>th</span>&nbsp;International Institute. It&rsquo;s also the 90<span>th</span>&nbsp;anniversary of this agency&rsquo;s formation. One of the SEC&rsquo;s founding principles is what President Roosevelt called &ldquo;complete and truthful disclosure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the spirit of disclosure, I will share that the SEC has a direct interest in sharing our expertise and experience with each of you.</p>
<p>First, robust regulatory frameworks across the globe limits opportunities for fraudsters to harm U.S. investors when investing overseas. It also limits opportunities for regulatory arbitrage.</p>
<p>Second, meeting the highest standards for international cooperation will ensure that you have the legal authority and tools to assist us on regulatory, enforcement, and supervisory matters, when needed.</p>
<h2>History of the Institute</h2>
<p>This program has its roots in post-World War II. President Truman envisioned a coordinated U.S. effort to assist its allies around the world and help them develop their own market-based economies.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-iismgd-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Then, just months before the Berlin Wall collapsed in 1989, SEC Chair Richard Breeden created the Office of International Affairs.</p>
<p>He crafted a global strategy to assist other countries in developing their capital markets, which began this very program. It&rsquo;s a great example of how this agency has continually responded to the unique challenges of the times.</p>
<p>Let me now turn to say a bit about our capital markets, our securities laws, and who we are as an agency.</p>
<h2>Capital markets</h2>
<p>First, the U.S. has the deepest, most liquid capital markets in the world. At over $110 trillion, we&rsquo;re over 40 percent of the world&rsquo;s capital markets, though we&rsquo;re only roughly 24 percent of the world&rsquo;s economy.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-iismgd-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Second, the U.S. capital markets benefit from significant engagement from everyday investors. Over half of American households, representing more than 115 million individual investors, own registered funds.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-iismgd-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>About 58 percent of U.S. households own stocks, up from 52 percent in 2016.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-iismgd-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p>Third, the U.S. has long benefitted from robust competition between nonbanks and banks. In fact, each of the registered funds and private funds sectors surpasses the size of the banking sector. Further, U.S. debt capital markets facilitate 75 percent of debt financing of non-financial corporations. In Europe, the U.K., and Asia, only 12-29 percent is raised in capital markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-iismgd-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p>Today, registered investment advisers advise 57 million clients with respect to $129 trillion in assets. Roughly speaking, that breaks down to advising on more than $32 trillion in registered funds, $30 trillion in private funds, and nearly $50 trillion in separately managed accounts.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-iismgd-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p>Let me put this in context. The entire U.S. banking system is $23 trillion.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-iismgd-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;Thus, the capital markets are nearly five times the size of our banking sector. Each of these sectors, in and of themselves, are larger than our banking sector.</p>
<p>Fourth, we also have robust competition between both public and private markets. Our public markets have approximately 7,400 actively reporting issuers, of which more than 4,000 companies listed on U.S. exchanges.</p>
<p>With the privileges of dollar and capital markets dominance also comes real responsibilities and challenges. Given how integrated our capital markets are into the world&rsquo;s capital markets, events in our capital markets can flow into others&mdash;and, events in yours can flow into ours.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen this time and again. For instance, in the 2008 mortgage crisis, we exported instability to the rest of the world, which then had further reverberations back into the United States.</p>
<p>In terms of challenges, foremost of course is that nothing stands still. The economies, rule of law, and capital markets of other countries will continue to evolve and compete for leadership.</p>
<p>Technology and business models continue to change. Further, nation states, including the United States, can be prone to policy mistakes.</p>
<h2>Our securities laws</h2>
<p>Our securities laws play a crucial role behind our success. After the 1929 market crash, President Roosevelt signed the first of the federal securities laws in 1933. He followed a year later with the passage of the Securities Exchange Act&mdash;making June 6, 1934, our birthday at the SEC.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-iismgd-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p>Roosevelt went on to work with Congress to enact five more securities laws, ending with the Investment Company Act and Investment Advisers Act of 1940.</p>
<p>Taken together, they formed the foundation of our capital markets. These laws were about protecting the investing public by ensuring they had what Roosevelt called, &ldquo;complete and truthful disclosure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC was created to ensure that the markets worked free of fraud and manipulation&mdash;and that investment advisers carried their duties to the clients they advised.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our laws have been updated over the years in response to changes in technology, markets, business models, and, from time to time, inevitable turmoil in the markets.</p>
<p>At its core, the SEC has a three-part mission: protect investors; maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and facilitate capital formation.</p>
<h2>Who we are as an agency</h2>
<p>That brings me back to who we, the SEC, are as an agency and as a Commission.</p>
<p>Our responsibility is vast. We oversee approximately 40,000 entities&mdash;including more than 13,000 registered funds, more than 15,400 investment advisers, more than 3,400 broker-dealers, 24 national securities exchanges, 103 alternative trading systems, 10 credit rating agencies, 33 self-regulatory organizations, and six active registered clearing agencies, among other entities.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re led by a five-member Commission appointed by the President&mdash;which, by law, requires that no more than three Commissioners can be from his or her party.</p>
<p>The SEC has nearly 5,000 staff here in Washington and in regional offices across the nation. Many may think of us as the largest group of securities lawyers in the world, with over 2,000 lawyers at the agency&mdash;but we do a lot more. Our work is organized across 6 main divisions and 25 offices.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-iismgd-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<p>The Divisions of Enforcement and Examinations account for about half of the SEC&rsquo;s staff. Without examination of compliance with and enforcement of our rules and laws, we can&rsquo;t instill the trust necessary for our markets to thrive.</p>
<p>Last year, we filed 784 enforcement actions and conducted approximately 3,000 examinations.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-iismgd-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;Stamping out fraud, manipulation, and abuse lowers risk in the system. It protects investors and reduces the cost of capital. The whole economy benefits from that.</p>
<p>Think about a football match without referees. It would quickly break down&mdash;it would start to look like rugby, and get worse from there.</p>
<p>Next, we have three programmatic divisions.</p>
<p>The Division of Corporation Finance oversees the disclosures of public companies so that investors can make informed investment decisions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Division of Investment Management oversees the funds and advisers that steward nest eggs for millions of American investors.</p>
<p>The Division of Trading and Markets serves on the front line for maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets. Market monitoring and supervision are essential parts of the Division&rsquo;s activity&mdash;especially during times of market stress.</p>
<p>Intertwined in everything we do is the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, which supports the Commission in every role, whether it&rsquo;s enforcement or examinations, monitoring the markets, or rulemaking.</p>
<p>As I said, we also have 25 other offices that contribute to our mission every day.</p>
<h2>Closing</h2>
<p>Finance knows no geographical boundaries. With a tap of a smart phone, money and risk can move across the globe in less than a second.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what makes it so important to foster international dialogue and coordination regarding global capital markets.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also why, with appropriate safeguards around confidentiality, that we&rsquo;ve come to collaborate on information sharing around our examination and enforcement efforts.</p>
<p>In the coming days, you&rsquo;ll hear from SEC staff about securities regulation, including building strong disclosure, examination, and enforcement programs.</p>
<p>They also will share lessons learned on oversight, creating an effective secondary market for securities, capital formation, and international cooperation.</p>
<p>Finally, they will cover new and emerging issues in data analytics, fintech, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that you all play an important role in our international capital markets. You were hand-selected by your agencies to represent your nations.</p>
<p>I encourage you to invest in the human capital in this room. Look around&mdash;there are likely future finance ministers and world leaders amongst you. Some of the alumni of this Institute have gone on to become Chairs of securities regulators and Ministers of Finance. Some have taken on leadership roles at the highest levels of their governments.</p>
<p>Finally, beyond all the technical skills and networking you take home with you, I hope you also remember the words of President Roosevelt&rsquo;s advisor, Felix Frankfurter, who would go on to be an Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p>90 years ago, when Roosevelt was first setting up the SEC, Frankfurter wrote: &ldquo;You need administrators who have stamina and do not weary of the fight, who are moved neither by blandishments nor fears, who in a word, unite public zeal with unusual capacity.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-iismgd-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></p>
<p>I hope we can all answer Frankfurter&rsquo;s call. Thank you.</p>

<title>Cboe Announces Expanded Collaboration With FTSE Russell To Drive Innovation In Digital Asset Derivatives</title>

<div> collaboration, derivatives, digital assets, FTSE Russell, Cboe
<br />
Cboe and FTSE Russell are collaborating to develop new derivatives products for digital assets, beginning with options tied to the FTSE Bitcoin and Ethereum indices. They aim to provide trusted, transparent, and regulated trading options in response to growing investor demand for crypto exposure. Cboe is expanding its digital assets business, consolidating its US futures products onto one exchange and introducing new products to complement existing initiatives. The planned cash-settled index options on the FTSE Bitcoin and Ethereum indices will provide a more comprehensive product suite and foster greater liquidity and hedging opportunities in the digital asset markets. 
Summary: <div>
<p>Cboe Global Markets, Inc. (Cboe: CBOE), the world's leading derivatives and securities exchange network, today announced it is expanding its collaboration with FTSE Russell, a leading global index provider, to drive product innovation in the digital assets space. This new initiative builds on Cboe and FTSE Russell's longstanding relationship and will leverage their combined expertise to develop new derivatives products, potentially beginning with cash-settled index options tied to the FTSE&nbsp;<span>Bitcoin</span>&nbsp;Index and the FTSE&nbsp;<span>Ethereum</span>&nbsp;Index.</p>
<div class="dombanner"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The collaboration underscores the companies' shared commitment to growing the digital assets space and expanding investor access to the asset class. Cboe's plans to list cash-settled index options on FTSE's indices, subject to regulatory approvals, would help meet growing investor demand for exchange-traded derivatives to gain and manage&nbsp;<span>crypto</span>&nbsp;exposures in a trusted, transparent and U.S.-regulated trading environment.</p>
<p>"For many years, Cboe and FTSE Russell have worked together to offer index options based on FTSE Russell indices, which have grown into some of the world's most actively traded products," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Catherine Clay</span>, Global Head of Derivatives at Cboe. "Our expanded relationship today mirrors that successful model of collaboration, combining Cboe's unrivalled derivatives expertise with FTSE's world-class indexing capabilities to potentially bring new solutions to the digital assets space. Derivatives has long been an area where Cboe excels, and now we are strategically expanding our expertise into the digital assets space. As these two asset classes converge, we look forward to driving continued innovation and our relationship with FTSE Russell will be key to this strategy."</p>
<p>The FTSE&nbsp;<span>Bitcoin</span>&nbsp;Index and FTSE&nbsp;<span>Ethereum</span>&nbsp;Index are part of the FTSE Digital Asset Indices Series, which is developed in partnership with Digital Asset Research (DAR). These indices are designed to capture the performance of&nbsp;<span>bitcoin</span>&nbsp;and ether, as determined by the FTSE DAR Reference Price, and provide institutional-quality, liquidity-screened exposure to the digital asset market.</p>
<p>Talking about the expanded collaboration,&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Fiona Bassett</span>, CEO of FTSE Russell, said: "We are delighted to continue working alongside Cboe Global Markets, realizing our mutual commitment to enable new asset innovation in financial markets. Our indices are used by some of the largest&nbsp;<span>crypto</span>&nbsp;asset managers in the world for their best-in-class data and processes built to manage regulatory and trading risk &ndash; critical differentiators for the data in this asset class."</p>
<p><b>Cboe's Broader Digital Assets Franchise</b></p>
<p>Cboe's expanded collaboration with FTSE Russell follows the recent realignment of its digital assets business &ndash; a move that will consolidate all Cboe U.S. futures products, including digital asset futures, onto one exchange, subject to regulatory review, powered by Cboe's broader global derivatives franchise and technology platform.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the collaboration is expected to introduce new products that will complement Cboe's existing digital assets initiatives. These currently include the listing and trading of cash-settled&nbsp;<span>bitcoin</span>&nbsp;and ether margin futures, along with spot&nbsp;<span>bitcoin</span>&nbsp;ETFs, where Cboe BZX Equities Exchange lists six out of the 11 ETFs listed domestically. Additionally, Cboe submitted five of the eight recently SEC-approved rule filings to list ETFs tied to the price of ether.</p>
<p>"Our plans to develop&nbsp;<span>bitcoin</span>&nbsp;and ether index options come at an exciting time as more investors of all types enter the&nbsp;<span>crypto</span>&nbsp;markets and are increasingly seeking exchange-listed derivatives to manage their&nbsp;<span>crypto</span>&nbsp;exposures," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Rob Hocking</span>, Head of Product Innovation at Cboe. "Many of our customers are already trading Cboe-listed digital asset products, whether margin futures or ETFs, tied to&nbsp;<span>bitcoin</span>&nbsp;and ether. The launch of cash-settled index options will be additive &ndash; resulting in a more comprehensive product suite and helping to foster greater liquidity and hedging opportunities in these markets. We believe that derivatives will drive the next phase of the digital asset market's maturation, and we're excited about the potential benefits that cash-settled index options can bring to the space."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cboe intends to share more details about its plans for cash-settled index options on the FTSE&nbsp;<span>Bitcoin</span>&nbsp;Index and the FTSE&nbsp;<span>Ethereum</span>&nbsp;Index potentially later this year.</p>

<title>DTCC And Cboe Clear Europe To Introduce New Clearing Workflow For OTC Cash Equities Trades And Deliver Enhanced Efficiencies To The Industry</title>

<div> DTCC, Cboe Clear Europe, post-trade workflow, OTC cash equities, settlement efficiencies
Summary:
DTCC and Cboe Clear Europe collaborate to enhance post-trade workflow for OTC cash equities, increasing settlement efficiencies and reducing risks. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>DTCC, the premier post-trade market infrastructure for the global financial services industry, today announced it is working with Cboe Clear Europe to deliver an enhanced post-trade workflow for over-the-counter (OTC) cash equities trades to help increase settlement efficiencies across UK and European markets.</p>
<p>DTCC, the leading post-trade market infrastructure, will collaborate with Cboe Clear Europe, the largest and most-connected pan-European cash equities CCP, to increase post-trade efficiencies while providing clients with the benefits of an established risk management counterparty. The service will bring OTC cash equities trades into Cboe Clear Europe&rsquo;s cleared environment, which can then be netted against on-exchange transactions for settlement purposes, delivering potentially significant efficiencies.</p>
<p>As part of this initiative, DTCC and Cboe Clear Europe will develop a proof of concept that links DTCC CTM's tri-party trade matching workflow with Cboe Clear Europe. This connection will allow Prime Brokers to receive a golden copy of transaction details when a match is achieved between a Hedge Fund and Executing Broker via DTCC&rsquo;s CTM service. Once the Prime Broker enters into this tri-party match, CTM automatically sends those matched trades to the CCP, providing netting and clearing benefits to mutual clients.</p>
<p>The new workflow will help reduce operational and settlement risk, as well as post-trade friction as additional markets consider and prepare for accelerated settlement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are pleased to be working with Cboe Clear Europe on this important initiative to bring greater post-trade efficiencies to the industry as the global markets look to accelerate to a T+1 settlement cycle. Cboe Clear Europe&rsquo;s extensive venue coverage combined with CTM&rsquo;s large client base will deliver increased operational efficiency and netting opportunities across European trading venues,&rdquo; said Val Wotton, Managing Director and General Manager, DTCC Institutional Trade Processing. &ldquo;DTCC remains committed to bringing greater post-trade automation to increase efficiencies for global financial markets as they work toward implementing accelerated settlement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are excited to be the first CCP to connect to DTCC&rsquo;s CTM tri-party matching workflow,&rdquo; said Vikesh Patel, President, Cboe Clear Europe. &ldquo;This joint solution enables us to bring greater efficiencies to our clients, helping to optimise their current post-trade workflows and operational processes as the global financial markets look to accelerate settlement cycles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The benefits of this initiative include reductions in post-trade processing time, risks associated with OTC transactions and settlement costs between Executing Brokers and Prime Brokers. It is anticipated that the joint solution will also help facilitate a reduction of capital requirements when moving from OTC to CCP settlement as well as lower trade fails and defaults.</p>
<p>CTM is DTCC Institutional Trade Processing&rsquo;s (ITP&rsquo;s) central matching service for cross-border and domestic transactions across multiple asset classes, including OTC and on exchange cash equity transactions. Today, there are 6,000+ clients in more than 80 countries using CTM to streamline workflows.</p>
<p>Cboe Clear Europe is a pan-European Central Counterparty, the most connected CCP in Europe - offering clearing services to 46 trading venues. Cboe Clear Europe is approved to clear cash equities, depositary receipts, ETFs and equity derivatives (index futures and options and equity options) contracts.</p>
<p>The first effort in this initiative to link DTCC&rsquo;s CTM to Cboe Clear Europe&rsquo;s CCP is, subject to the satisfactory completion of regulatory procedures, projected to go live in Q2 2025.</p>

<title>The IFRS Foundation Monitoring Board Welcomes The Progress Of Standard-Setting Activities And Underscores The Importance Of The Oversight By The IFRS Foundation Trustees</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Trustees, IFRS Foundation, Monitoring Board, IASB, ISSB <br />
Summary: The IFRS Foundation Monitoring Board discussed sustainability standards, oversight of IASB and ISSB, and the development of new accounting standards. Effective governance and funding were also emphasized. <br /> <div>
<p>During last week&rsquo;s meeting of the IFRS Foundation Monitoring Board in Singapore, the Monitoring Board discussed the activities of the Trustees of the IFRS Foundation, including their oversight responsibilities in respect of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB). The meeting was joined by the members of the Trustees of the IFRS Foundation under the leadership of Erkki Liikanen, Chair of the Trustees, as well as Andreas Barckow, Chair of the IASB, and Emmanuel Faber, Chair of the ISSB.</p>
<p>Among other activities, the Monitoring Board welcomed the finalization of the&nbsp;<em>Inaugural Jurisdictional Guide for the adoption or other use of ISSB Standards</em>&nbsp;in May 2024. The Monitoring Board members shared their views on different ways to adopt, apply or make use of sustainability-related disclosures. They also acknowledged the usefulness of consistency, comparability and interoperability of sustainability-related information for the benefit of investors and the ISSB&rsquo;s capacity-building efforts as jurisdictions consider incorporation of climate-related and other disclosures in their corporate reporting regimes. In this context, effective functioning of a multi-location model<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;would be essential for close engagement with stakeholders in various regions in the ISSB&rsquo;s effort to promote the implementation of IFRS S1 and S2 around the globe.</p>
<p>The Monitoring Board noted the importance of rigorous due process in the development of high-quality IFRS Accounting Standards and the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards and that the Monitoring Board will continue to collaborate with the Trustees to ensure both sets of Standards are developed under robust governance, due process and oversight while ensuring independence in their individual standard setting activities. In this context, the Monitoring Board took particular note of the finalization of the two new IFRS Accounting Standards, IFRS 18&nbsp;<em>Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements</em>&nbsp;and IFRS 19&nbsp;<em>Subsidiaries without Public Accountability: Disclosures</em>&nbsp;by the IASB and the recent decision by the ISSB to commence research projects related to biodiversity, ecosystems and ecosystem services as well as human capital.</p>
<p>As for the broad strategies of the IFRS Foundation, the Monitoring Board reaffirmed that stable and diversified funding should be achieved in a transparent manner in support of both Standard Setting Boards&rsquo; activities. The Monitoring Board also noted the importance of connectivity between the two Boards under the &ldquo;Two Boards under One Foundation&rdquo; model.</p>
<p>Takashi Nagaoka, Chairman of the IFRS Monitoring Board and Deputy Commissioner for International Affairs of Japan Financial Services Agency said:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I am pleased to co-host a discussion between the IFRS Foundation Trustees and the Monitoring Board members at an important juncture where the ISSB finalized its &ldquo;Inaugural Jurisdictional Guide for the adoption or other use of ISSB Standards,&rdquo; providing much-awaited support to jurisdictional approaches, and the IASB released two new accounting standards, IFRS 18 and 19, which is the first such output of new accounting standards in over six years. The IFRS Foundation Trustees and the Monitoring Board members are aligned in support of good governance of the Foundation to promote sustainability-related disclosures and continuing development of high-quality financial reporting standards to serve the capital markets globally.&rdquo;</em></p>

<title>World Federation Of Exchanges: Demystifying Tokenisation: Dispelling Myths, Explaining The Muted Traction, And Setting Out The Starting Point For Regulation</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/world-federation-of-exchanges-demystifying-tokenisation-dispelling-myths-expl/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/world-federation-of-exchanges-demystifying-tokenisation-dispelling-myths-expl/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Tokenisation, traditional assets, benefits, limitations, regulatory certainty
<br />
Tokenisation is a modern version of traditional finance with benefits such as fractional ownership and enhanced liquidity, but it has limitations and regulatory uncertainty.
<br /><br />Summary: 
Tokenisation offers new opportunities but faces limitations in technology, infrastructure, costs, and regulatory uncertainty. <div>
<p>As the European Commission today gathers stakeholders in Brussels to discuss the further tokenisation of assets, the WFE (the global industry association for exchanges and clearing houses) has published a paper, &ldquo;Demystifying Tokenisation: Embracing the Future&rdquo;, that provides a reality check: we shouldn&rsquo;t curtail the further development of tokenisation, nor should we run blindly towards it.<br /><br />Rather than a radical departure from the norm, tokenised traditional assets should be viewed as nothing more than a modernised and innovative iteration of traditional finance, providing new opportunities for investors and market participants. This is one of the many ways in which exchanges continue to invest serious effort and money in innovation.<br /><br />Tokenisation has many benefits that could make it a natural next step for financial markets. Fractional ownership, allowing multiple investors to own a share of an asset thereby lowering the capital requirement for individuals to invest in high-value assets; enhanced liquidity, which arises from fractionalisation enabling access to investments that may have been out of reach for many; and enhanced trust could all lead to greater financial inclusion, diversification and ultimately economic growth.&nbsp;<br /><br />Some of the supposed benefits are overexaggerated or frankly don&rsquo;t exist at all. Continuous 24/7 trading &ndash; if truly needed &ndash; can be achieved without tokenisation. Disintermediated models face conflicts of interest and instantaneous settlement in tokenised trading may have unpredictable timing, affecting market liquidity and trading costs, especially if assets and funding need to be blocked prior to execution.<br /><br />With over 15 years passed since the Bitcoin white paper, tokenisation has not &ldquo;taken off&rdquo; in traditional markets and there are several reasons why:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DLT has limitations</strong>, particularly in high transaction environments, as the technology is currently not fast enough to execute and settle all the trades running through a highly active exchange in any given moment. There are also other limitations such as storage problems caused by the distributed ledger.</li>
<li>The nature of different DLT creations means that there is a&nbsp;<strong>fragmented infrastructure&nbsp;</strong>with tokenised assets managed on different blockchains which are not interoperable. Financial institutions would have to build connections with each platform, leading to significant operational costs and challenges, meaning there are only marginal efficiency gains in certain markets, particularly those that are already liquid.</li>
<li>There are&nbsp;<strong>significant sunk costs</strong>&nbsp;involved in implementing DLT. It is a capital-intensive investment to move to the new technology and build the relevant infrastructure. These costs would be felt across the market, from infrastructure providers to market participants and end users. Even then, there may not be sufficient demand if customers do not have the correct infrastructure or capital to invest.</li>
<li>The lack of&nbsp;<strong>regulatory certainty</strong>, which is improving thanks to the efforts of regulators and industry, persists. Most jurisdictions&rsquo; bodies of law do not reflect the creation of tokenised assets, leaving firms apprehensive. Anything that is, in effect, a financial instrument, should be treated in the same way, regardless of whether it is tokenised.</li>
<li>The lack of adoption further inhibits tokenisation because, without widespread use, there are&nbsp;<strong>no network effects</strong>&nbsp;and there is little value to firms and exchanges to update their technology stacks to incorporate tokenised assets.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tokenisation should be seen as a creative and modern version of traditional finance that offers new possibilities to investors and market players. However, current limitations mean that it won&rsquo;t be right for every type of asset.<br /><br /><strong>James Auliffe, Manager, Regulatory Affairs at the WFE commented,</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;The fundamentals of tokenisation and the infrastructures these assets trade on need to be better understood. Regulation in this area should reflect that tokenisation is a natural evolution in the financial industry, rather than a drastic break from the norm. Its usage is suitable in particular environments and for particular assets, but in these cases, market participants can reap great benefits.&rdquo;<br /><br />The full paper can be read&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://world-exchanges.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=48ddcbc11eb58f141a51219ea&amp;id=10c6fc2baf&amp;e=979576350c" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

The scope of the change impacts the entire bank&rsquo;s customer base, including individual and business customers served by its Corporate, Affluent, International and Private Banking divisions.</p>
<p><b>Michalis Louis, Chief Executive Officer, Eurobank Cyprus, commented:</b>&nbsp;&ldquo;The go-live with Temenos is a major milestone that allows us to transform the bank at a high level. This was a complex and challenging project, but it was expertly delivered by our internal teams and Temenos working closely together. The new Temenos platform gives us business&nbsp;agility&nbsp;to achieve our goals and opens the roadmap for further expansion, enhancements and growing the Bank&rsquo;s position as a market leader through the latest technology. We look forward to building on this success for customers in Cyprus and across the Eurobank Group&rdquo;.</p>
<p><b>Mark Yamin-Ali, Managing Director - Europe, Temenos, said:</b>&nbsp;&ldquo;I wish to congratulate Eurobank Cyprus for its vision and execution in transforming the bank for the modern digital age. Eurobank has always been a pioneer, and the move to Temenos including a full breadth of banking capabilities from digital and core banking to payments on an agile, open platform will enable the bank to continue to drive innovation, deliver an outstanding customer experience across all segments and grow sustainably. Temenos has enjoyed a long and successful partnership with Eurobank Group, and we are delighted to support the bank and its future success in Cyprus.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Eurobank Cyprus is now well positioned to advance its long-term business strategy of expanding its banking services in addition to ESG compliant banking and advancing sustainability through paperless and efficient banking operations. The Bank has also recently received four prestigious awards by Euromoney Magazine for Best International Private Bank in Cyprus as well as Best for Digital Solutions, Best for Sustainability and Best for High-Net-Worth Clients. These awards are a testament to the Bank&rsquo;s effective use of technology.</p>
<p>Focused on innovation and sustainability, Eurobank Group designs and implements initiatives using cutting-edge technology and following ESG rules.</p>

<div> monitoring, regional banks, securities investment, risk management, financial institutions
Summary: The FSA monitors regional banks' securities investment, targeting high-risk banks. It seeks to improve risk management and governance in financial institutions. <div>
<p class="indent mb0">The Financial Services Agency (FSA), from the perspective of maintaining the stability of the financial system in Japan, conducts intensive monitoring of regional banks' securities investment, targeting those with large risk-taking in securities investment.</p>
<p class="indent mt0">The report summarizes key points and observed cases during the monitoring process.</p>
<p class="indent">It is intended not only for the targeted financial institutions but also as a reference for risk management by other financial institutions (primarily those institutions with substantial risk exposure to securities investment).</p>
<p class="indent">The FSA will continue to encourage financial institutions&rsquo; enhancement of their securities investment management and risk management systems and demonstration of effective risk governance through monitoring focused on such issues in the future. We expect financial institutions to put effort into further improving their risk management practices.</p>

<title>New Zealand Financial Markets Authority Opens Consultation On Proposed Standard Conditions For Derivatives Issuers</title>

<div> Feedback, Derivative Issuer Licences, Leverage, Suitability, Monitoring

Summary:
The FMA seeks feedback on potential changes to Derivative Issuer licences, particularly regarding leverage and investor suitability. Changes aim to align with international norms.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW191560321 BCX8">The Financial Markets Authority (FMA) &ndash; Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko &ndash; is seeking feedback on potential changes to the standard conditions imposed on Derivative Issuer (DI) licences. The changes relate to leverage and the suitability of investors for derivative trading. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW191560321 BCX8">The proposed changes have been identified in the FMA&rsquo;s 2020 Derivatives Issuer Sector Risk Assessment (SRA) and subsequent monitoring of the sector. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Proposed leverage standard condition</span></p>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW191560321 BCX8">Investing with leverage amplifies the risk by enabling an investor to have much greater exposure to an increase and decrease in value. Currently, there is no limit to the amount of leverage a licensed DI can offer to retail investors in New Zealand. For example, while some licensed DIs limit contracts for difference (CFDs) leverage to 30:1, others offer up to 500:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW191560321 BCX8">The higher the level of leverage, the greater the financial impact felt from price volatility. For example, if a trade is leveraged 10:1, an investor with $1,000 in their account can control a position in an underlying asset valued at $10,000. When a position is leveraged 500:1, that same investor with $1,000 can control a $500,000 position. Leverage can enable efficient asset allocation, but highly leveraged derivatives mean retail investors may experience much higher losses. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW191560321 BCX8">The proposed standard condition is similar to those in the UK, Europe and Australia and varies depending on the underlying asset class of the derivative. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Changes to suitability standard condition&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW191560321 BCX8">The SRA and subsequent monitoring indicated some licensed DIs were not always taking sufficient steps to determine suitability for the investor. Monitoring also found that some of the suitability assessments were poorly designed or ineffective. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW191560321 BCX8">Licensed DIs offer a wide range of derivatives with varying degrees of risk. While some are straightforward, others, like binary options or cryptocurrency CFDs, can be opaque or volatile and are therefore riskier.</span></p>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW191560321 BCX8">The FMA considers it both appropriate and necessary to revise the suitability standard condition to ensure that DIs ask retail investors for relevant information needed to assess whether the derivative is suitable.</span></p>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW191560321 BCX8">The FMA has revised the suitability condition to require that DIs must determine whether the retail investor understands the derivative before investing.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW191560321 BCX8">Director of Markets, Investors and Reporting, John Horner said: &ldquo;The proposed changes are about ensuring retail investors fully understand the nature and extent of the risk around derivatives and to align protection measures with international norms.&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW191560321 BCX8">The consultation period runs until 7 August.&nbsp;</span></p>

<div> Securities and Exchange Commission, 90th anniversary, Securities Exchange Act of 1934, market trust, economic welfare
Summary:
SEC celebrates 90th anniversary, highlighting the importance of Securities Exchange Act of 1934, market trust, and economic welfare for everyday Americans. <div>
<p>Good afternoon. As is customary, I&rsquo;d like to note that my views are my own as Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and I am not speaking on behalf of my fellow Chairs or the staff.</p>
<p>I want to welcome the public and thank you for tuning in as we celebrate the 90<span>th</span>&nbsp;anniversary of a milestone in American history.</p>
<p>In the depths of the Great Depression, President Roosevelt worked with Congress to enact the Securities Exchange Act of 1934&mdash;creating the SEC and making June 6 our official birthday.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-90thsec-060624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>It's just one of a handful of the original securities laws. But taken together, those laws and this agency put our markets on a path in which investors and issuers alike can have trust in the markets.</p>
<p>These time-tested laws have played an important part in boosting the economic welfare of everyday Americans.</p>
<p>For anyone who doubts the significance of these laws and regulations, think about the schemes and frauds throughout the 1920s that contributed to the Great Depression.</p>
<p>For the sports fans, imagine what would happen to teams, athletes, and fans without fair competition.</p>
<p>The SEC remains a steward of trust, efficiency, and competition within our markets. While the U.S. is roughly 24 percent of the world&rsquo;s economy, it represents over 40 percent of the world&rsquo;s capital markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-90thsec-060624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s part of why the U.S. dollar is the world&rsquo;s leading currency.</p>
<p>I want to close with two letters FDR received before he signed our founding document.</p>
<p>On April 12, 1934, Richard Whitney, then-President of the New York Stock Exchange, wrote to Roosevelt that he was &ldquo;sincerely disturbed as to what may happen if unsound legislation is enacted.&rdquo; He went on to write about Sam Rayburn&rsquo;s modified bill, saying, &ldquo;I am confident that its enactment would be a disaster.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-90thsec-060624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>A few months later, FDR received a letter from Felix Frankfurter, his adviser who later would become a Supreme Court justice. Frankfurter wrote regarding the &ldquo;effective administration&rdquo; the SEC would need to succeed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need administrators,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;who have stamina and do not weary of the fight, who are moved neither by blandishments nor fears, who in a word, unite public zeal with unusual capacity.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-90thsec-060624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p>90 years later, thousands of SEC staff and over 100 Commissioners and Chairs have answered Frankfurter&rsquo;s call. I thank them for their service. I thank them for their rectitude. Contrary to Whitney&rsquo;s belief, the SEC has made it work for investors, issuers, and the over $110 trillion markets we oversee today.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<div> Meeting, Global Markets Advisory Committee, GMAC, recommendations, Subcommittee
Summary:
- Thanking attendees for participation
- Update on status of GMAC recommendations
- Welcome new members
- Overview of today's agenda
- Recognition of impactful work of GMAC
- Highlighting importance of GMAC's work <div>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Good morning. It&rsquo;s great to convene another Global Markets Advisory Committee (GMAC) meeting in New York. I want to start by thanking everyone for taking the time to travel here&mdash;from all across the United States, and as far away as London, Frankfurt, Tokyo and more&mdash;to share your expertise with the GMAC. I know that a lot of time and work goes into preparing for these meetings, so I also want to thank the GMAC members and Subcommittee members for their service, and our presenters for joining us today. The GMAC&rsquo;s recommendations have real impact and add value to not only the Commission, but also to the international policy dialogue. I especially want to recognize the GMAC&rsquo;s leadership team for your continued stewardship of the GMAC, and all the Subcommittee workstream leads for their tireless efforts. We have a truly impressive group of leaders to examine the issues.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Of course, I want to acknowledge and thank my team: Harry Jung, the GMAC Designated Federal Officer, and Nicholas Elliot, the GMAC Alternate Designated Federal Officer, as well as Meghan Tente and Taylor Foy. And, as always, many thanks to all the CFTC staff in both the New York office and our DC headquarters who made the GMAC&rsquo;s meeting today possible.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>I will provide a brief update on the status of each of the GMAC&rsquo;s 11 recommendations to date and potential next steps. I will also recognize the new members of the GMAC and its Subcommittees, and then provide an overview of today&rsquo;s agenda and speakers.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The GMAC Continues to Deliver</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The GMAC continues to support the growth of liquid and efficient markets and make great progress developing thoughtful recommendations and insightful work product to aid the CFTC, both U.S. and non-U.S. authorities, and indeed, all stakeholders in global markets and financial services.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The GMAC was first created in 1998 to handle the issues associated with globalization and access to markets. These issues remain critically important given the interconnected market environment, everchanging geopolitical dynamics, and emerging and innovative products and tools. Accordingly, global collaboration and coordination amongst authorities is critical to promoting regulatory cohesion and financial stability, and mitigating market fragmentation and systemic risk. That is why the GMAC&rsquo;s mandate includes assessing and informing international standards.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Since it was relaunched, the GMAC has worked to ensure that global markets are well-functioning, promote market integrity and resilience, facilitate compliance, and foster innovation and growth. As the GMAC&rsquo;s sponsor, I&rsquo;m honored to help provide a public venue for preeminent industry experts and regulators to discuss and develop pragmatic solutions to global challenges. I hope we have built a union of minds brought together for a common purpose.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Status of GMAC Recommendations and Next Steps</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>First, I want to commend the GMAC for kicking off last year with a comprehensive stock-take of the most significant current and emerging issues in global markets and the financial system. This global stock-take informed the development of the GMAC&rsquo;s work program and included input from policymakers, dealers, asset managers, liquidity providers, exchanges, trading facilities, clearinghouses, technology service providers, and end users.&nbsp;</span>I particularly note that the GMAC&rsquo;s work is based on data and observations from the markets that will support better policy outcomes.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>In less than a year, the GMAC has adopted 11 recommendations to date on a variety of issues, including U.S. Treasury market liquidity, well-functioning repo and funding markets, exchange volatility controls, T+1 securities settlement, improved collateral management, central counterparty (CCP) default simulation, streamlining trade reporting data to monitor systemic risk, and a foundational digital asset taxonomy to facilitate alignment in regulation across jurisdictions.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>These recommendations have provided data-driven and transparent resources for the CFTC and our counterparts around the world. Just last week, I was honored to present the GMAC&rsquo;s recommendations at the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) 49<span>th</span>&nbsp;Annual Meeting, and I note Chairman Behnam serves as IOSCO Vice Chair. The CFTC has long been a leader in various international fora. The degree of interest in the GMAC&rsquo;s work speaks for itself.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><i><span><span>Global Market Structure Subcommittee (GMSS)</span></span></i></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/9606/GMAC_NewBlockCap110623/download"><i>GMSS Recommendation 1 &ndash; New Block and Cap Sizes</i></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>Appropriately calibrated block and cap sizes are vital to the proper functioning of derivatives markets, including price discovery and transparency. However, the CFTC&rsquo;s new post</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>‐</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>initial block and cap sizes that will require compliance starting July 1, 2024, may negatively affect market liquidity and could significantly raise trading and hedging costs for buy</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>‐</span></span></i><i><span><span>side market participants and end users such as pension and other retirement plans.</span></span></i></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The GMAC recommends extending the compliance date for the post</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>‐</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>initial block and cap sizes for all asset classes to at least December 4, 2024. The GMAC further recommends that, during the extension period, the Commission engages with market participants in discussions and analysis to ensure the post</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>‐</span></span></i><i><span><span>initial block and cap sizes are appropriately tailored, including with respect to current market and macroeconomic conditions.</span></span></i></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The CFTC recently issued a letter that will allow for further study including implications of decreased liquidity and access to markets. I believe that the GMAC&rsquo;s presentations and recommendations were key, especially the market data and observations. I appreciate the support of Commissioner Mersinger, and Chairman Behnam&rsquo;s pragmatic approach and consideration of this issue.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/9731/gmac_Rule1_25d2_110623/download"><i>GMSS Recommendation 2 &ndash; Proposal to Add CCPs as Permitted Counterparties</i></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>Further alignment of SEC and CFTC regulations would support critical risk management functions that will promote well-functioning repo and funding markets. While CFTC rules impose customer protection requirements and permit a futures commission merchant (FCM) or derivatives clearing organization (DCO) to utilize repos to manage customer funds, an SEC-registered clearing agency is not a permitted counterparty under Rule 1.25(d)(2).</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The GMAC recommends that the Commission allow a CCP that meets the definition of a &ldquo;covered clearing agency&rdquo; under SEC Rule 17-Ad-22(a)(5) to be designated a &ldquo;permitted counterparty&rdquo; pursuant to CFTC Rule 1.25(d)(2).</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>I&rsquo;m pleased to note that I have discussed this recommendation with Chairman Behnam, and it will be considered for CFTC rulemaking given that this recommendation will facilitate implementation of the SEC&rsquo;s Treasury clearing mandate.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/9591/gmac_FICC_CME110623/download"><i>GMSS Recommendation 3 &ndash; FICC-CME Customer Position Cross-Margining Structure</i></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>For two decades, the CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have approved cross-margining for Treasury securities transactions and Treasury futures, promoting the efficiency and well-functioning of the U.S. Treasury markets&mdash;the backbone of the global financial system.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The GMAC recommends the Commission make the benefits of cross-margining available to a broader range of sophisticated customers, including those customers that will be subject to the new SEC Treasury clearing requirements, as well as to all customers that voluntarily elect to clear Treasury transactions and will post margin.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>This GMAC recommendation is being actively considered as part of the implementation of the SEC&rsquo;s Treasury clearing mandate. I thank FICC and CME&rsquo;s leadership on this issue. Both are members of the GMAC&rsquo;s Global Market Structure Subcommittee and led this work.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/9736/gmac_FIAExecutiveSummary110623/download"><i>GMSS Recommendation 4 &ndash; Endorsement of Futures Industry Association (FIA) Volatility Controls Mechanism Paper</i></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The efficient management of financial market volatility is paramount. During recent crises in markets, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as in commodity markets, the Futures Industry Association (FIA) has noted the pivotal role volatility control mechanisms have played in preserving market integrity. Consequently, FIA engaged with global derivatives exchanges and market participants to explore the most effective ways to mitigate disruptions while ensuring transparent price discovery.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The GMAC recommends the Commission use the best practices as a tool for understanding exchange market risk controls and when engaging with global regulators and international standard setters.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>This GMAC recommendation has been a beneficial resource to ensuring market integrity during periods of high market volatility, market stress, or other disruptions through effective application of exchange market risk controls and other volatility control mechanisms and sharing best practices across jurisdictions.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/10331/CFTC_GMAC_GM_Structure_Subcommittee_Recommendation-UST_ETF_as_UMR_Collateral/download"><i>GMSS Recommendation 5 - Inclusion of U.S. Treasury ETFs as Eligible Initial Margin Collateral</i></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The use of exchange traded funds (ETFs) that invest in U.S. Treasury bonds has dramatically increased in recent years. While standalone U.S. Treasury bonds can be used as initial margin (IM) collateral for uncleared swaps, ETFs that invest in them are not similarly eligible as collateral, despite being more diversified which can mitigate idiosyncratic risk.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>During many historic volatile trading sessions, certain UST ETFs have acted globally as &ldquo;shock absorbers,&rdquo; providing real-time prices and liquidity. Most notably, during the bond market volatility in 2020, volatility increased in U.S. Treasury bonds as dealers&rsquo; balance sheets were constrained. During this time, many UST ETFs traded at tighter bid-ask spreads than their portfolio of underlying bonds. For example, dislocations in U.S. Treasuries caused the bid/ask spreads of &ldquo;off-the-run&rdquo; bonds with a maturity of 20+ years to widen to almost 20 times that of the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT).</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The inclusion of U.S. Treasury ETFs as eligible IM collateral under the CFTC Margin Rules for Covered Swap Entities would enhance the robustness and resilience of the collateral pipeline. This enhancement, driven by factors such as diversification, liquidity, efficiency, and market stability, could prove beneficial for end-users seeking a wider range of eligible IM, CSEs and the broader financial markets. Allowing UST ETFs as IM collateral could not only help safeguard CSEs from counterparty default, but also help reduce the overall risk in the financial system and limit the potential for contagion arising from uncleared swaps.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The GMAC recommends the CFTC expand the universe of liquid assets that can be posted as uncleared margin, specifically to include U.S. Treasury ETFs.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The CFTC has been considering various aspects of margin and eligible collateral requirements. This GMAC recommendation and associated market data and observations are timely given recent developments in Treasury markets, and have contributed to an informed analysis of appropriate collateral management practices.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><i><span><span>Technical Issues Subcommittee (TIS)</span></span></i></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/9576/gmac_TechnicalSubcommitteeRecommendationsDefault110623/download"><i>TISS Recommendation 1 - Global Default Simulation</i></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>In November 2023, CCP Global conducted a global default simulation across CCPs. Global regulator support of the exercise was critical to its success. The default simulation was arranged in consultation and with input from regulators. It is critical the CFTC continue its support and valuable input, alongside its role in convening regulators and market participants.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The GMAC recommends the CFTC consider inclusion of lessons learned and best practices arising from such simulations into its capacity building programs with, especially, some emerging market regulatory homologues.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The CFTC, through the work of the Office of International Affairs, actively provides technical assistance to many other jurisdictions in the development of effective derivatives markets. CCP resilience, recovery, and resolution has been a top financial stability priority, and the GMAC recommendation has supported ongoing efforts to identify and mitigate systemic risk.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/9721/gmac_TechnicalSubcommitteeRecommendationsMMF110623/download"><i>TIS Recommendation 2 &ndash; MMFs as Eligible Collateral</i></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The CFTC&rsquo;s proposed rule amendment to remove the asset transfer restriction from money market funds (MMFs) used as eligible collateral for non</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>‐</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>cleared margin will harmonize the parameters for MMF use with the UK and resolve one of the impediments to the use of MMFs between the U.S. and European Union (EU). The proposed rule will also allow the CFTC to self</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>‐</span></span></i><i><span><span>align MMFs with its eligible collateral requirements for cleared margin, per CFTC Rule 1.25, which governs the investment of customer money by FCMs without similar asset transfer restrictions.</span></span></i></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The GMAC recommends the Commission: (i) finalize the proposed rule amendment; (ii) encourage the U.S. Prudential Regulators to adopt a corresponding amendment to their non</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>‐</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>cleared margin rules, including allowing third country funds; and (iii) encourage European Union (EU) policy makers to remove the third country fund restriction for eligible collateral from their non</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>‐</span></span></i><i><span><span>cleared margin rules.</span></span></i></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The CFTC currently has a pending rulemaking proposal on MMFs as eligible collateral for non-cleared margin. The GMAC recommendation has provided a key perspective on cross-border harmonization of MMF treatment.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/9726/gmac_TIS_P42P45Streamlining110623/download"><i>TIS Recommendation 3 &ndash; Improve Trade Reporting for Market Oversight, Streamline Potential 40% Increase in CFTC Reportable Data Elements</i></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The Commission is currently amending its Part 43 and Part 45 swap data reporting requirements to potentially add nearly 50 additional reportable fields on top of the currently required 128 data elements that were just implemented in December 2022. The potential 40% increase in data reporting elements distracts from optimizing analysis and use of the recently expanded data set and creates further obstacles and uncertainty for meaningful global aggregation and analysis of trade repository data. Further, an ad hoc approach to additional data reporting elements unnecessarily increases costs.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The GMAC recommends several steps to improve data reporting elements which will (i) advance analytical tools to optimize use of the current, recently expanded, data set; and (ii) focus on impediments to data sharing, including the alignment of the validations and requirements for critical data elements (CDE) fields and global identifiers.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>This GMAC recommendation informed the CFTC&rsquo;s recent Part 43 and Part 45 rulemaking proposal, and was then submitted to the public comment file. The CFTC is working to finalize this proposal.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/9596/gmac_TIS_Recommendation_DataSharingAnalysis110623/download"><i>TIS Recommendation 4 &ndash; Improve Trade Reporting for Market Oversight and Improving Data Sharing and Systemic Risk Analysis</i></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>Regulators, including the CFTC, have implemented global trade reporting harmonization efforts to enable data amalgamation to facilitate regulatory data usage across jurisdictions. However, there are non</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>‐</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>data related impediments that could prevent data sharing, thus undermining the value of these significant projects.</span></span></i></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The GMAC recommends the Commission facilitate discussions with key regulators (market and prudential) on the desire to share data elements and agree upon the Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) needed to allow such activity, starting with U.S. and then prioritize other G20 regulators where there is significant overlap.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>There are several international, major trade reporting initiatives at the FSB and IOSCO, among others, to improve trade reporting for market oversight and improve data sharing and systemic risk analysis consistent with this GMAC recommendation. The CFTC is actively participating in these ongoing initiatives.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/10326/GMAC_T+1_Resources_030624/download"><i>TIS Recommendation 5 - Publication of Resource Document to Support Transition to T+1 Securities Settlement</i></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>As the United States prepares to transition to next-day trade settlement (T+1) for securities in May 2024, the Subcommittee crafted a resource document to support market participants. The document details products covered by the transition to T+1, timelines for transition in various markets, and the benefits to the transition. The document also highlights the implications T+1 has for various markets &ndash; particularly foreign exchange markets, and discusses its impacts on transaction processes for various products, including cross-border impacts. Further, it provides a list of resources to help firms prepare for the transition.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>This GMAC recommendation helped to prepare the U.S. securities markets, and other impacted asset classes and products, for a smooth T+1 securities settlement transition completed over the Memorial Day holiday weekend. It provided resources for aspects such as foreign exchange (FX) markets and cross-border transactions.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><i><span><span>Digital Asset Markets Subcommittee (DAMS)</span></span></i></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/10321/CFTC_GMAC_DAM_Classification_Approach_and_Taxonomy_for_Digital_Assets_030624/download"><i>DAMS Recommendation 1 - Adoption of an Approach for the Classification and Understanding of Digital Assets</i></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>A clear, consensus-driven approach to classifying assets and the functions they serve underpins robust markets and effective regulation. The evolving digital asset ecosystem has led many to develop proprietary taxonomies to classify digital assets and their related technology. In recognition of this progress, the Subcommittee has engaged digital asset stakeholders across the broader digital asset ecosystem to build a common approach for the classification and understanding of digital assets.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>This approach aims to set out consistent language for participants in the digital asset ecosystem to promote innovation, identify and address risk considerations, and enable effective regulatory understanding. With this objective in mind, the approach builds upon the considerable classification efforts of global prudential standard setters and regional authorities, including the Bank for International Settlements, the Financial Stability Board and others.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The GMAC recommends this approach be considered an initial basis for a consensus-driven, functional taxonomy. However, as the digital asset ecosystem continues to evolve, so too will the terminology used to classify it. The Subcommittee will reassess any future developments to provide further recommendations to this approach, based on the guidance of its members. The Subcommittee seeks to support effective rules and regulations for digital assets, and recommends continued collaboration between industry, standard-setting bodies, and the regulatory community.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The first-of-a-kind GMAC digital asset taxonomy&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span><span>framework provides valuable foundational guidelines to further advance the discussion and promote U.S. regulatory clarity, and was extensively vetted by stakeholders such as regulatory authorities, financial institutions, asset managers, market infrastructures, and service providers.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>New GMAC and Subcommittee Members</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>I also want to welcome a few new faces to the GMAC and our Subcommittees. We've added a few new experts to our ranks since we last met.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>On the GMAC, we&rsquo;ve added&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Chuck Mack, Head of Strategy for North American Markets at Nasdaq, and Derek Kleinbauer, President of Bloomberg SEF. On the Digital Asset Markets Subcommittee, we&rsquo;ve added Mo Shaikh, Co-Founder and CEO of Aptos Labs; Terrence Dempsey, Senior Vice President and Head of Product Strategy at Fidelity Digital Assets; Ian Grieves, Vice President for Product &amp; Strategy at Cboe</span></span></span><span><span>; and&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Chen Arad, Co-Founder &amp; Chief External Affairs Officer at Solidus Labs.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Welcome, and I look forward to your contributions to the GMAC.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Today&rsquo;s GMAC Meeting</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Today&rsquo;s meeting will continue to build on the significant progress we&rsquo;ve already made. We&rsquo;ll start with a presentation from the Global Market Structure Subcommittee on the impact the proposed U.S. implementation of Basel III endgame&rsquo;s bank capital requirements would have on end users who rely on cleared derivatives markets. Providing this timely presentation will be Kyle Glenn, Vice President for Government Relations at FIA, and Thane Twiggs, Chief Compliance Officer for Risk Management at Cargill.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>We&rsquo;ll then have a panel discussion on Swap Execution Facilities. Our esteemed panelists are:</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span><span>Thomas Pluta, President of Tradeweb;</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>Scott Fitzpatrick, CEO of Tradition SEF; and</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>Adam Lister, Interest Rate Swaps Electronic Trading Product Manager at Bloomberg</span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Tara Kruse will lead our Technical Issues Subcommittee&rsquo;s discussion on its proposed recommendation on Variation Margin Processes in Non-Centrally Cleared Markets. Tara is the Global Head of Infrastructure, Data, and Non-Cleared Margin at ISDA.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Following a brief break, we&rsquo;ll receive an update on global commodity markets from Derek Sammann, Senior Managing Director and Global Head of Commodities, Options &amp; International Markets at CME Group.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Finally, we&rsquo;ll receive a presentation on the CFTC&rsquo;s international engagement from Andrea Musalem, Associate Director of the Commission&rsquo;s Office of International Affairs. We&rsquo;ll close out today&rsquo;s meeting with updates from each of the Subcommittees on ongoing workstreams and future agenda items.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>I&rsquo;m very much looking forward to these timely presentations and the consideration of the latest round of recommendations. Once again, thanks to our speakers and all members for being here and making the GMAC such a success.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The GMAC and the CFTC&rsquo;s Mission</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Today highlights that the CFTC is first and foremost a market regulator, and I&rsquo;m pleased we&rsquo;re getting back to basics with very important presentations and discussion of market characteristics, trading activity, and market fundamentals driving both, as well as capital and margin requirements. I look forward to the insights that will be shared on ways to enhance liquidity in markets, which could be the basis for additional GMAC initiatives. This is the bread and butter of the CFTC&rsquo;s core mission to oversee derivatives markets and ensure they are well-functioning. This doesn&rsquo;t get the headlines, but it is absolutely our day job and I appreciate Chairman Behnam&rsquo;s focus on this. I especially thank the CFTC&rsquo;s Office of International Affairs for their presentation and international leadership. Thank you all.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<div> CDCC, SGC Notes, Canadian Dollar Offered Rate cessation, investment vehicle, money market instruments
<br />
Summary:<br />CDCC launches SGC Notes program to accommodate transition from CDOR and Bankers’ Acceptances, offer investment opportunities in Canadian money markets with strong investor protection. <div>
<p><span>The Canadian Derivatives Clearing Corporation (CDCC), Canada's national central clearing counterparty (CCP) for exchange-traded derivative products and repurchase agreements, today announced the launch of the new Secured General Collateral (SGC) Notes program.</span></p>
<p><span>SGC Notes are short-term discounted money market instruments developed by CDCC in collaboration with Canadian market participants and designed to meet the demand for the transition from Bankers&rsquo; Acceptances (BAs) as a result of the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR) cessation.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;​We are proud to bring this innovative​, customized ​​investment vehicle to market, designed to provide Canada's market participants with an effective funding solution and support the industry transition from CDOR and Bankers&rsquo; Acceptances,​"&nbsp;<strong>said George Kormas, President of CDCC</strong>.​ "​CDCC is grateful for the input of our valued stakeholders ​across Canada&rsquo;s money markets, including both sell and buy side participants​, in the launch of SGC Notes and we look forward to serving their needs as our markets continue to evolve into the future.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>SGC Notes provide an investment policy-friendly opportunity for Canadian money market institutional investors to roll their BA exposure into SGC Notes. SGC Notes are linked to the same highly-rated Canadian bank credit exposure as BAs, but are secured with a basket of high quality debt securities (SGC Securities) which are sold to a trust through repurchase agreements cleared through CDCC.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>SGC Notes represent an attractive investment option relative to available alternatives.</span></p>
<p><span>SGC Notes are designed to provide strong investor protection through active risk management by CDCC of the basket of SGC Securities securing the SGC Notes and to leverage TMX Group&rsquo;s infrastructure, including the recently announced&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.tmx.com%2Fnewsroom%2Fpress-releases%3Fid=1198/1/0102019002405f87-43999f98-e6ce-40fa-a3a9-d5090bd56623-000000/rvtVaflIpdY6crSZ4ofJY_MJ0o8=377" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>Canadian Collateral Management Service (CCMS)</span></a>, which allows for automated collateral movements.</span></p>
<p><span>For more information on the new SGC Notes, please visit&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.cdcc.ca%2Fen%2Fsgc-notes/1/0102019002405f87-43999f98-e6ce-40fa-a3a9-d5090bd56623-000000/0evjN4dvExAx65ubdu6vN8Dl25k=377" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>&nbsp;</span></a><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.cdcc.ca/en/sgc-notes" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.cdcc.ca/en/sgc-notes</a></span>&nbsp;to review the offering memorandum.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>SGC Notes will be issued by a special purpose vehicle formed as an Ontario trust (&ldquo;Trust&rdquo;), of which ComputerShare Trust Company of Canada is trustee and CDCC is promoter, administrative agent, custodian and paying agent.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The SGC Notes will be subscribed for by CIRO investment dealers and Canadian chartered banks that are eligible to clear repurchase transactions relating to SGC Securities through CDCC (the &ldquo;SGC Clearing Members&rdquo;). The SGC Clearing Members will purchase the SGC Notes, as principals, at a discount to face value and may offer the SGC Notes for sale to investors subject to prior sale, if, as and when issued by the Trust and accepted by the SGC Clearing Members on a private placement basis to investors which are &ldquo;accredited investors&rdquo; and &ldquo;permitted clients&rdquo; (other than individuals) as defined in securities legislation in reliance on exemptions from the prospectus requirements of applicable provincial securities laws. The resale of the SGC Notes will be restricted by applicable provincial securities laws.</span></p>
<p><span>The SGC Notes are obligations of the Trust and not obligations of or interests in CDCC, Computershare Trust Company of Canada, any member of the TMX Group, or any SGC Clearing Member. The SGC Notes will represent limited recourse obligations of the Trust. Only the SGC Securities (and other collateral listed in the offering memorandum describing the SBC Notes) will secure payment of the SGC Notes.</span></p>
<p><span>The SGC Notes have not been registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, or the &ldquo;U.S. Securities Act&rdquo; or under the securities laws of any state of the United States, and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to U.S. persons within the meaning of Regulation S under the U.S.&nbsp; Securities Act, or &ldquo;Regulation S&rdquo; unless the securities are registered under the U.S. Securities Act or an exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act is available.</span></p>

<div> Trade surveillance, financial risk solutions, Validus platform, legacy providers, global expansion<br />
Summary:<br />
Eventus' Validus platform sees 25% client base increase, global expansion, high renewal rates, and multiple award wins for trade surveillance excellence. <div>
<p>Eventus, a leading provider of comprehensive, at-scale trade surveillance and financial risk solutions, announced that its Validus platform continues to capture business from firms seeking to move away from legacy trade surveillance providers, with a 25% increase in its client base over the past year. The announcement comes on the heels of another award win for excellence in trade surveillance, further global expansion with the signing of its first South African client &ndash; one of Africa&rsquo;s largest diversified financial groups &ndash; and a continued high renewal rate for existing clients globally. The company now has clients on six continents.</p>
<p>Eventus CEO Travis Schwab said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve never been in a better position as a company. Our retention rates remain close to 100%, we are growing across asset classes and geographies, our platform continues to perform at the highest levels with new functionality rolling out consistently, and we are profitable. We are especially excited about some new clients that include three tier-1 banks all now actively using Validus to meet a range of compliance and regulatory goals. Our existing clients are routinely adding more areas of coverage and our Eventus Services offering to their contracts too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Companies keep turning to us, particularly if they&rsquo;ve had experience with legacy providers, because our sole focus is our clients and the delivery of best-in-class trade surveillance and financial risk solutions, such as algo monitoring. In an extraordinarily competitive landscape, we have what I would argue is more markets and regulatory expertise and a more responsive approach than any provider in the market, along with the unique ability for clients to fully customize the platform and work with our team on solving compliance challenges they are facing in real time. Our experience as market practitioners give us the ability to partner with each and every client &ndash; whether they are a start-up exchange, global trading firm, broker/dealer or tier 1 bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eventus Global Head of Regulatory Affairs Joe Schifano said: &ldquo;For many years, those of us who built surveillance programs for our firms were frustrated with the lack of flexibility in legacy trade surveillance systems. But now, it is even more critical to keep pace with technology as regulators are no longer satisfied with compliance programs that just &lsquo;follow the pack.&rsquo; At Eventus, we offer a &rsquo;buy-to-build&rsquo; solution that clients can tailor and easily scale specific to their risk assessment and data requirements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eventus also announced that it was just named Best Trade Surveillance Solution at the TradingTech Insight USA Awards 2024, based on votes from market participants and the publication&rsquo;s global audience. In March, the company won the same category in the 2024 RegTech insight Awards APAC for its work in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
<p>Schwab said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re honored to see recognition of our hard work and results through votes by so many market participants selecting Validus as Best Trade Surveillance Solution, reflecting our focus on our clients, expert service and constant enhancements to the platform.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Enhancements to the Validus platform this year include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reports and visualizations to help clients ensure accurate and complete data coverage.</li>
<li>Introduction of a first-of-its-kind cross-product spoofing functionality to detect this type of market manipulation in real time for clients engaged in multiple asset classes. This includes a new visualization methodology to review activity across products and new technology that facilitates cross-product review across all accounts and all activity.</li>
<li>New large trader reporter functionality, built for a designated clearing organization (DCO) client and now available to all users.</li>
<li>Enhanced behavioral analytics, including changes in trader profiles identifying potential red flags for rogue trading and account takeovers.</li>
<li>Expanded market data coverage.</li>
<li>Testing of the firm&rsquo;s next-generation platform that enables performance speeds and scale commensurate with growth in the markets and client data requirements.</li>
</ul>

<div> Partnership, Blue Carbon, Investments, Ocean Protection, Mangrove Conservation
<br />
XTCC, Lady Merle, and Logos Capital Group partner to create listed blue carbon investments supporting ocean protection and community benefits. Revolutionizing climate finance.
<br /><br />Summary:
XTCC, Lady Merle, and Logos Capital Group collaborate to create listed blue carbon investments, supporting ocean protection, community benefits, and revolutionizing climate finance. <div>
<ul>
<li><span>Collaboration with Lady Merle Liivand (the Eco Mermaid) and Logos Capital Group to generate liquidity in investments supporting vital ocean protection projects</span></li>
<li><span><em>Brings together the best thought leaders and deep expertise around Blue Carbon</em>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Stock market-listed blue carbon investments help bridge multi-trillion-dollar gap in climate finance</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>XTCC, the investment ecosystem specialising in high-integrity carbon based listed investments, celebrates World Ocean Day with the announcement of a partnership with Lady Merle, the Estonian swimming champion and ocean protection advocate acknowledged globally as the &lsquo;Eco Mermaid&rsquo;, and Silvio Pupo-Casco of Logos Capital Group, to scale</span></p>
<p><span>up investment opportunities and enable global access to this new asset class, providing support for projects including mangrove conservation and transparent fund distribution to adjacent communities.</span></p>
<p><span>Lady Merle and Silvio will work closely with XTCC to identify mangrove and other blue carbon projects that also directly benefit adjacent local communities. XTCC will mobilise Lady Merle&rsquo;s expertise in the science of blue carbon and Silvio&rsquo;s investment network and commitment to driving significant investment capital into more impactful asset classes in the creation of new Blue Carbon investments listed on global stock markets. XTCC creates a bridge between blue carbon projects and<br />the capital markets, enabling an asset class for the Beyond Net Zero world.</span><span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Blue carbon is carbon captured by the world's ocean and coastal ecosystems, including mangroves that can, through sequestration - taking carbon in - provide a natural way of reducing the impact of greenhouse gases on earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. Coastal systems such as mangroves sequester high amounts of carbon quickly and sustainably (over millions of years). In fact, mangroves are ten times more effective at sequestering carbon than any other type of forestry, with a multitude of associated benefits such as clean water, food security, and protection against extreme weather events.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Seth Elliot, XTCC CEO</span>&nbsp;said: &ldquo;To truly move beyond Net Zero, we must combat global warming via significant nature-based project investments in ocean protection. By introducing Blue Carbon based listed investments, we aim to stimulate interest and generate liquidity to support the funding of blue carbon projects, redefine trust in the carbon market, and stimulate climate investments crucial for saving the planet.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Lady Merle said:&nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;Our oceans are the lungs of the world, playing a crucial role in producing oxygen and absorbing carbon dioxide and waste. Thriving mangrove ecosystems not only sustain the natural world but also support and enrich the communities that live alongside. On the negative side, when these important coastal systems are damaged, they emit enormous amounts of carbon into the atmosphere, contributing to climate change. As such, it is essential to protect and conserve mangroves and other coastal habitats, for the benefit of the climate and as importantly, to protect the communities that depend on them to survive and thrive&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Silvio Pupo-Casco, Logos Capital Group said</strong>: "Investing in natural capital and purchasing high-integrity carbon credits can often be complex and opaque. Through our joint venture with XTCC, we aim to simplify and clarify this process, ensuring that investors know exactly what they are getting for their money. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies, we will restore trust in critical natural capital and ecosystem service investments, particularly in the realm of blue carbon." He continued, &ldquo;Our new blue carbon investment instrument is designed to exceed current market standards for transparency and reporting. By setting new benchmarks for accountability and integrity, we are committed to offering unparalleled clarity and reliability in the carbon credit markets. This next-generation investment vehicle is poised to revolutionize global capital markets, driving significant impact in blue finance."</span></p>

<div> Equity Hedge, Event-Driven, Cryptocurrency, Risk Parity, Performance Dispersion
Summary:
- Hedge funds gained in May, led by Equity Hedge and Event-Driven strategies.
- Cryptocurrency and Risk Parity indexes surged.
- Performance dispersion declined in May.
- Equity Hedge funds, driven by Energy and Technology exposures, led gains.
- Interest rate-sensitive strategies also advanced, while Macro strategies posted mixed performance. <div>
<p>Hedge funds gained in May as equities recovered the prior month&rsquo;s decline, and as inflationary pressures remained elevated, but investors positioned for interest rate reductions in 2H24. Led by directional Equity Hedge and Event-Driven strategies, the HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index advanced +1.3 percent in May, with additional positive contributions from Relative Value Arbitrage strategies offsetting a decline in Macro strategies. The HFRI Equity Hedge (Total) Index jumped +2.5 percent for the month, reversing the April decline and marking the fifth gain for this index in the trailing seven months, posting its strongest monthly return since February.</p>
<p>The HFR Cryptocurrency Index surged +13.6 percent in May, while the HFR Risk Parity Vol 15 Index jumped +3.0 percent for the month.</p>
<p>Performance dispersion declined in May, as the top decile of the HFRI FWC constituents advanced by an average of +7.6 percent, while the bottom decile fell by an average of -4.1 percent, representing a top/bottom dispersion of 11.7 percent for the month. By comparison, the top/bottom performance dispersion in April was 14.3 percent. In the trailing 12 months ending May 2024, the top decile of FWC constituents gained +42.9 percent, while the bottom decile declined -7.3 percent, representing a top/bottom dispersion of 50.2 percent. Approximately 70 percent of hedge funds produced positive performance in May.</p>
<p>Equity Hedge (EH) funds, which invest long and short across specialized sub-strategies, led gains in May, driven by advances in Energy and Technology exposures. The HFRI Equity Hedge (Total) Index gained +2.5 percent (estimated) for the month, improving the YTD 2024 return to +6.1 percent. EH sub-strategy gains were led by the HFRI EH: Sector-Energy Index, which surged an estimated +3.6 percent, while the HFRI EH: Sector-Technology Index added +3.2 percent. Other strong contributors in May were the HFRI EH: Multi-Strategy Index and the HFRI EH: Fundamental Value Index, each of which advanced +3.1 percent for the month. Through the first five months of the year, the HFRI EH: Quantitative Directional Index leads EH sub-strategy performance with a YTD return of +8.6 percent.</p>
<p>Event-Driven (ED) strategies, which often focus on out-of-favor, deep value equity exposures and speculation on M&amp;A situations, also advanced in May, driven by Multi-Strategy and Distressed exposures. The HFRI Event-Driven (Total) Index gained +1.6 percent for the month, led by the HFRI ED: Multi-Strategy Index, which jumped +2.35 percent, and the HFRI ED: Distressed Index, which added +1.7 percent for the month.</p>
<p>Fixed income-based, interest rate-sensitive strategies also advanced in May as investors positioned for interest rate cuts in 2H24 despite persistent inflation. The HFRI Relative Value (Total) Index added an estimated +0.6 percent for the month, increasing its YTD 2024 return to +3.3 percent. RVA performance was led by the HFRI RV: Asset Backed Index and HFRI RV: Convertible Arbitrage Index, each of which advanced +0.9 percent for the month.</p>
<p>Macro strategies posted mixed performance in May as interest rates and financial market volatility fell, and as investors positioned for interest rate cuts in 2H24. The HFRI Macro (Total) Index fell -0.65 percent in May, the<sup>&nbsp;</sup>first monthly decline since November 2023. Losses were driven by the HFRI Macro: Systematic Diversified Index, which declined -1.3 percent for the month but remains the leading area of sub-strategy performance over the first five months of the year, with a YTD return of +9.15 percent. Partially offsetting the May declines, the HFRI Macro: Active Trading Index jumped +2.7 percent for the month, bringing its YTD performance to +6.3 percent.</p>
<p>Liquid Alternative UCITS strategies posted gains in May, as the HFRX Global Index advanced +0.6 percent for the month, led by the HFRX Equity Hedge Index, which advanced +1.25 percent, and the HFRX Relative Value Index, which added +0.7 percent. The HFRX Market Directional Index also advanced in May, adding +1.7 percent for the month.</p>
<p>The HFRI Diversity Index advanced an estimated +1.8 percent in May, while the HFRI Women Index gained +1.9 percent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hedge funds posted strong gains in May, reversing April declines, with leadership from directional equity and credit strategies, as investors positioned for continued inflation, ECB and US Federal Reserve rate cuts, and an improving economic growth in 2H24. Uncorrelated Macro hedge funds, the leading strategy area of performance over the first four months of the year, posted its first monthly decline since November as financial market volatility fell in May,&rdquo; stated Kenneth J. Heinz, President of HFR. &ldquo;The primary risks for hedge funds and hedge fund positioning accelerated the shift from macroeconomic risks to geopolitical risks, with these comprising not only ongoing, active military conflicts but also potential for additional conflicts and risks associated with policy changes as a result of major political elections in the coming months. Hedge funds have effectively positioned portfolios in a tactical sense for these highly fluid and uncertain situations, including not only military threats, but possibilities for supply chain disruptions, outright trade embargoes or halts, and destabilizing dislocations and volatility associated with banking and broader financial market operation. Institutions interested in access to opportunities which may be created by this volatility, as well as portfolio protection from these risks, are likely to increase exposure to hedge funds which have demonstrated their strategy&rsquo;s robustness of navigating these building and evolving risks over recent months and years.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>NOTE: May 2024 index performance figures are estimated as of June 7, 2024</i></p>

<title>SEC Charges Three New Yorkers For Raising More Than $184 Million Through Pre-IPO Fraud Schemes - After Commission Shut Down Original Ploy, Defendants Started Another One</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> charged, fraud, unregistered, pre-IPO, SEC
Summary:
SEC charged individuals with fraud for selling unregistered pre-IPO shares, involving high-pressure sales tactics and undisclosed markups. U.S. Attorney's Office also filed charges. Ongoing investigation in the pre-IPO space. SEC prioritizes enforcement in the pre-IPO space, filing charges in various cases. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged three individuals with fraud for selling unregistered membership interests in LLCs that purported to invest in shares of pre-IPO companies, first on behalf of StraightPath Venture Partners LLC, the subject of the Commission&rsquo;s emergency&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-83">action</a>&nbsp;in May 2022, and, later, on behalf of Legend Venture Partners LLC, the subject of the Commission&rsquo;s emergency&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-119">action</a>&nbsp;in June 2023. Both&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr-25429">StraightPath</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr-25772">Legend</a>&nbsp;are now under court-ordered receiverships.</p>
<p>In this new action, the SEC alleges that New York residents Mario Gogliormella, Steven Lacaj, and Karim Ibrahim directed an unregistered sales force of more than 50 callers in boiler rooms to pressure investors into making investments without telling them that the shares had been substantially marked up&mdash;between approximately 19 and 105 percent on average above the prices that StraightPath or Legend had paid for the underlying shares. As a result of these tactics, the defendants and their sales force allegedly pocketed more than $45 million in fees from unsuspecting investors from 2019 to 2022.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We allege that the fraud in this case is like a Hollywood movie where the defendants ran boiler rooms using scripts they referred to as the &lsquo;Bible,&rsquo; engaged in high-pressure sales tactics, and employed outright falsehoods to defraud investors,&rdquo; said Sheldon L. Pollock, Associate Director of the New York Regional Office. &ldquo;After the SEC shut them down the first time, they simply rebranded their outfit, and today through our action we are seeking to ensure that they are held accountable for enticing and lying to investors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint charges the defendants with violating antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws. The complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, return of allegedly ill-gotten gains, and civil penalties. The SEC also charged Adam Ibrahim, Karim Ibrahim&rsquo;s brother, as a relief defendant.</p>
<p>The U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Southern District of New York today unsealed an indictment charging Gogliormella, Lacaj, and Karim Ibrahim with securities fraud, among other offenses, in connection with their work for StraightPath and Legend.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s ongoing investigation is being conducted by Joshua D. Tannen and Lee A. Greenwood of the Asset Management Unit and Sushila P. Rao, Suzanne M. Bettis, Megan Genet, Tiantong Wen, Douglas Smith, Kerri L. Palen, Patricia Schrage, Daniel Loss, Alistaire Bambach, and Steven G. Rawlings of the New York Regional Office. It is being supervised by Mr. Pollock. The litigation will be led by Ms. Rao, Mr. Tannen, and Ms. Bettis and supervised by Mr. Loss and Mr. Pollock.</p>
<p>The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Southern District of New York and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service.</p>

<p>The EACH Co-Chairs&nbsp;Julien Jardelot, Niels Brab and Tim Grange said: &lsquo;We are delighted to the trust European CCP and clearing houses are putting in us by renewing our mandate to represent the EACH community. We aim to increase the understating of how CCPs contribute to robust and more efficient capital markets for the benefit of businesses, investors and the economy as a whole. We welcome the efforts of different European jurisdictions to further diversify funding opportunities by strengthening capital markets and believe CCPs and clearing houses have a key role to play in supporting these efforts&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The EACH Secretary General Rafael Plata said: &lsquo;The next two years are likely crucial to plant the seeds of a new era of capital markets in Europe. Companies, investors and pensioners amongst other are likely to benefit from it. I look forward to continuing working with the capital markets ecosystem to make the dream of deeper and strong capital markets in Europe come true&rsquo;.</p>

<title>A New Class Of Trailblazers, Federal Reserve Governor Lisa D. Cook, At The Girls Global Academy 2024 Commencement Ceremony, Washington, D.C.</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/a-new-class-of-trailblazers-federal-reserve-governor-lisa-d-cook-at-the-girls/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/a-new-class-of-trailblazers-federal-reserve-governor-lisa-d-cook-at-the-girls/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Dr. O'Neal. It is an honor to be here to celebrate with you&mdash;the Girls Global Academy's first-ever graduating class. This is a momentous achievement and occasion. You are making history today! But, of course, you could not have done it alone. So let me start by acknowledging the teachers; administrators, staff, and board members of the Girls Global Academy; and the parents, grandparents, siblings, mentors, and friends who made today possible. Thank you and congratulations on a job well done.</p>
<p>And a very special congratulations to the Girls Global Academy Class of 2024! Soon you will embark on new journeys. I understand that many of you are going on to college in the fall, including one of you heading to my alma mater, Spelman College. (Be sure not to miss the 144th Founders Day celebration next year and the annual Spelman-Morehouse Christmas Carol concert in historic Sisters Chapel.) Others are off to start careers or to pursue vocational training. One of you will enter public service directly and become a member of the U.S. Air Force. That is a lot to be proud of and excited about. Whatever path you take next, I know the education and experience you gained here will guide you.</p>
<p>The Class of 2024 stands out. This is not only because you are the first, but also because you achieved so much all while overcoming extremely challenging circumstances by starting high school during the pandemic. Like you, I know what it is like to be the first to take a path, a path that was not always smooth and predictable. I will tell you more about that shortly.</p>
<p>Four years ago, all of you could have taken a more well-marked route. Instead, you had the courage to enroll at a brand new school during a global pandemic. You learned virtually during your first year. When you were able to attend your school in person for the first time, you did so with masks on, while social distancing. Forging new friendships is always challenging. It is even harder when you cannot sit next to a new classmate at the lunch table. But I know you worked hard to move your learning and your friendships beyond the screens and into real life. Now that those bonds have formed, I hope you hold on to them for many years to come, as I did with my classmates at a women's college.</p>
<p>As the inaugural class of the Girls Global Academy, your list of firsts is long and impressive. You formed the academy's first ever student government. You started a debate team and created cooking and DJ clubs, to name a few. You took the court and field as the first volleyball, basketball, softball, track, and cross-country teams. (I would have gone out for the softball and track teams. I was a catcher on my softball team in junior high and shot put was my event on the track team in high school.)</p>
<p>Everything was new, and probably a bit scary. Yet, you learned to become outspoken, you took on leadership roles, and you set an example for younger students. Through it all you grew, and you became the remarkable young women you are today.</p>
<p>With all those firsts, I was told that you sometimes call yourselves "the guinea pigs." I get that. However, I would like to offer a different moniker for this group: trailblazers. You bravely went where no one had gone before, and you accomplished great things through difficult challenges. To honor that, I want to tell you about a favorite trailblazer of mine and a girl who looked up to her.</p>
<p>The trailblazer I am thinking of is Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander. A little more than a century ago, she graduated from high school here in Washington, D.C., less than a mile away from your school. It was then called M Street High School. She went on to earn bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Pennsylvania. During her doctoral studies, she undertook research on the living standards of Black families that were migrating to Philadelphia during World War I. After completing that work, she became the second African American woman ever to earn a PhD and the first African American to earn a PhD in economics.</p>
<p>But in the 1920s, Dr. Alexander was actively denied entry into the economics profession on the basis of her race and sex. Some might have been crushed and deterred by the impediment. Not Dr. Alexander. Instead, she went on to blaze another trail. She became the first African American woman to earn a law degree from the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Alexander was also the first African American woman to pass the bar and practice law in the state of Pennsylvania. She continued to think and write about economic issues in her legal work and public service. She went on to be a top attorney for the city of Philadelphia and served the public in many other ways, including being asked by two U.S. presidents to serve on important committees.</p>
<p>Dr. Alexander was also the first national president of Delta Sigma Theta, a public service sorority. My mother helped to start a Delta Sigma Theta chapter at Georgia College and State University. That is how I first learned about Dr. Alexander. In fact, when I was in seventh grade, I entered my county social science fair with a project inspired by her work: identifying the major causes of unemployment among Black Americans. I did not realize it then, but that turned out to be my first foray into economic research, which became the cornerstone of my career.</p>
<p>It was helpful to have trailblazers to look up to, including Dr. Alexander, but also my aunts, uncles, parents, and other relatives and family friends who played important roles in the Civil Rights Movement. They instilled in me the confidence to blaze trails of my own. I was among the first African American students to desegregate one of the schools I attended in my hometown of Milledgeville, Georgia. Although some of the students and others in the community did not welcome us, I drew strength from the example set by my family and others in the Civil Rights Movement, and from their conviction in the hope and promise of a world that could and would continually improve.</p>
<p>While I had an interest in economics even before I entered high school, that profession was not the first path I choose. I started Spelman as a physics and philosophy major. It was not until after my undergraduate years, when I was literally on a trail&mdash;one climbing Mount Kilimanjaro&mdash;that I discovered economics was the path for me. I was hiking alongside a British economist. By the end of that journey, he had convinced me that studying economics would provide me the tools to address some big and important questions I had pondered for a long time&mdash;as far back as when Dr. Alexander inspired my submission to the county social science fair.</p>
<p>Following in her footsteps, I went on to earn my PhD in economics from the University of California, Berkeley. The path of an economist led me many places, including to Moscow to research banking in pre- and post-Soviet Russia and to the White House as an economist for President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers. In 2022, President Biden nominated me to serve on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. I am proud to say that I am the first African American woman and first woman of color to serve on the Board of Governors, a body that makes decisions affecting the entire economy and the well-being of every American.</p>
<p>I hope that my story, and Dr. Alexander's story, might inspire you to see that even when you encounter roadblocks, you can chart your own path and achieve great things. I know you can do that, because you established a strong foundation here at the Girls Global Academy, starting with the four pillars of sisterhood, scholarship, service, and safety.</p>
<p>I can see you have the spirit of sisterhood today as you celebrate all your achievements. You established a sisterhood as the first Girls Global Academy alumnae, and you also joined a broader sisterhood of strong, courageous, trailblazing women. You are scholars, earning your diploma and going on to college and onto various career paths. You worked in service to your community by each completing at least 50 service hours. The scholarship and service pillars show that you are already like Dr. Alexander, who highly valued education and used her education to improve the world. And you certainly learned the importance of safety as you started high school in the pandemic&mdash;and the importance of creating a safe environment of belonging where you can learn, be challenged, and grow, while comfortably being yourself. Holding these four pillars close will serve you well as you take the next step in your journeys.</p>
<p>As I conclude, I would like to thank you for allowing me to add another first&mdash;the first Girls Global Academy commencement speaker. I am deeply humbled by this honor. Once again, congratulations to the very first Girls Global Academy graduating class&mdash;the Class of 2024! We are all so proud of you and cannot wait to see what you will do.</p>

<title>NGX Launches New USSD To Enhance Capital Market Access</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ngx-launches-new-ussd-to-enhance-capital-market-access/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ngx-launches-new-ussd-to-enhance-capital-market-access/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Nigerian Exchange (NGX) Limited has urged investors to leverage on its new USSD platform for enhanced capital market access.</p>
<p>NGX stated this at its Investor Education Series, partnered with Meristem via a zoom meeting held on Thursday, June 6, 2024 with the theme, &lsquo;Unlocking Potential: Leveraging USSD For Enhanced Capital Market Access&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Speaking at the event, Head, Trading &amp; Products of NGX, Abimbola Babalola stated that the NGX USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) platform is a technology that allows mobile phone users to access a variety of services by dialing a short code (*5474#) on their phone keypad, saying that the NGX USSD platform is a new and innovative way for investors to access real-time stock market information and connect with a stockbroker.</p>
<p>According to him, the product is designed to boost financial inclusion and market participation in Nigeria by providing investors easy access to price information of listed companies and connecting them with Trading License Holders.</p>
<p>He further said that &ldquo;what we are doing at the exchange is to put investors at the driver&rsquo;s seat of their investment. Gone are those days when you buy securities and you go to sleep, or you have to start reading the newspaper or wait for news to know what is happening to the stocks. So, this time around, you have a device that you can use to monitor your stock at any time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Babalola added that investors' education is key, and this is what the products will address.</p>
<p>The Head, Investment Advisory at Meristem Stockbrokers Limited, Temitope Oludimu said that Meristem Securities has been in the industry for over two decades, growing her clients&rsquo; wealth and enhancing their financial wellbeing.</p>
<p>She noted that the Stockbrokers subsidiary of the Group provides easy access to online brokerage accounts allowing clients to monitor trades in real-time via MeriTrade and the first online stock trading platform in Nigeria commenced in 2014.</p>
<p>Oludimu added that &ldquo;MeriTrade allows users to buy and sell stocks online through the Nigerian Stock Exchange from the comfort of their home, office, car and even on the go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The platform defines stock broking in an entirely different language and creates a world class experience, bringing your broker (electronically) to the comfort of your home and office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The panel session speaking on the theme for the event emphasized the importance of investors' education in the capital market.</p>
<p>Afeez Ramoni, Head, Data and Digital Innovation, NGX stated that the public can now conveniently receive market information and commence account opening processes through their mobile phones by dialing *5474#. This marks a significant stride in NGX&rsquo;s commitment to democratizing access to investment opportunities and promoting retail investors participation through digital channels for accessing the capital market.</p>
<p>He anticipates that the USSD short code *5474# will enhance market accessibility and contribute significantly to the broader financial inclusion landscape in Nigeria.</p>
<p>Martha Ibrahim of NGX Group said that financial inclusion is really about inclusivity and creating access to financial services to investors.</p>
<p>She stated that this is really important for a vibrant capital market and also the country&rsquo;s economic development in general.</p>
<p>According to her, with the coming up of this initiative, integrating USSD with NGX, we also understand the importance of technology as a key financial enabler for financial inclusion. We are simplifying access to the stock markets and reducing barriers to entry. This would also promote a significant increase in the level of financial inclusion we have currently within the capital markets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By leveraging on this investor education and simplifying access to the markets, this validates that NGX is on the right step towards driving financial inclusion within the Nigerian capital markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Also, Oluwatobi Adesanya of Meristem added that &ldquo;we cannot overemphasize the need for financial literacy in the Nigerian capital market.&rdquo;</p>
