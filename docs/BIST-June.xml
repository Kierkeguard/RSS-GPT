<div> monitoring report, cross-zonal transmission capacities, EU electricity market, grid congestion, future-looking assessment<br>
Summary:<br>
ACER and JRC will present findings on 70% transmission capacity requirement, integration of EU electricity market, and future assessment of grid congestion. <br> <div>
<p>ACER and the Joint Research Centre (JRC) are organising a joint webinar to present and discuss the key findings from their&nbsp;2024 publications, focusing on electricity grid congestion and transmission capacities for cross-border electricity trade:</p>
<ul>
<li>ACER&rsquo;s yearly monitoring report on cross-zonal transmission capacities and the progress of Member States in reaching the minimum 70% requirement (to be published on 3 July 2024);</li>
<li><a href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsCVAYABVIBV0wIDwFSHVZbAFIdCggIAxpTAVZWVlADBw5QDgIdUAVbU1tTVVcdVAAAVx0GXwQAGldSVgMZAVZRAFBXVFBUXFJQRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" target="_blank">JRC&rsquo;s future-looking assessment on the evolution of congestion management in the current EU electricity market design</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">When?</span></p>
<p>Wednesday, 10 July 2024, 14:30 - 15:30 CET, online</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tackling barriers in the EU&rsquo;s transition to net-zero</span></p>
<p>A successfully integrated EU electricity market is crucial for the EU&rsquo;s ambitions of achieving net-zero emissions while maintaining its global competitiveness. How efficiently the electricity market design addresses grid congestion is key to this effort.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Realising the 70% transmission capacity requirement helps further integrate markets</span></p>
<p>EU rules mandate that grid operators ensure at least 70% of transmission capacity is available for electricity trade with neighbouring countries by the end of 2025. Why? Making the required 70% of capacity available for cross-zonal trade better integrates markets, enhances security of supply, reduces price volatility and increases the flexibility of the system. ACER monitors annually the availability of cross-zonal capacities in the EU and the progress of Member States in reaching the 70% requirement.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Future-proofing the European electricity market</span></p>
<p>The European Commission&rsquo;s JRC has developed a future-looking assessment of the volume and cost of addressing congestion in the electricity grid for the target years 2030 and 2040, based on different grid expansion scenarios.</p>

<br>
Summary:<br>CanDeal Markets set a new daily trading record of $67.8 billion, offering deep liquidity for Canadian debt securities and transitioning to T+1 settlement cycle. <div>
<p>CanDeal Markets Inc. (CanDeal Markets), a leading institutional electronic marketplace for Canadian debt and derivatives, has set a new daily trading record of $67.8 billion on June 3, 2024. This marks a new milestone for electronic dealing in Canadian dollar products for CanDeal&rsquo;s global community of more than 2,000 participants, inclusive of Canada&rsquo;s major financial institutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CanDeal marketplace, which offers trading across Government of Canada, Provincials, CMBs, Municipals, Corporate Bonds, Treasury Bills, Canadian Money Market, Repo and Interest Rate Swaps, is on track for a record year of trading activity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;CanDeal offers a deep liquidity pool for Canadian debt securities through its tight-knit community of buy-side firms and sell-side dealers,&rdquo; said Jamie Grant, President of CanDeal Markets. &ldquo;As the Canadian fixed income market continues to deepen its use of electronic trading, new protocols such as buy-side automated rules-bound trading and deferred spotting, which reduces tracking error, are introducing much greater efficiency.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On May 27, CanDeal Markets successfully transitioned all fixed income and derivatives trading activity to the T+1 settlement cycle, in accordance with the guidance set by the Canadian Capital Markets Association.

<title>DTCC’s FICC Launches CCLF Public Calculator To Support Expansion Of U.S. Treasury Clearing - In Anticipation Of The New SEC Requirements For Expanded U.S. Treasury Clearing, This New Tool Simulates Estimated CCLF Obligations Associated With FICC GSD Membership</title>

<div> DTCC, FICC, CCLF, liquidity obligations, transparency<br />
Summary:<br />
DTCC launches public-facing CCLF calculator for U.S. Treasury market participants to estimate liquidity obligations and understand GSD membership requirements. <div>
<p>DTCC, the premier post-trade market infrastructure for the global financial services industry, today announced the launch of FICC&rsquo;s interactive, public-facing&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.dtcc.com/managing-risk/stress-testing-and-liquidity-risk-management/ccfl-public-calculator" target="_blank">Capped Contingency Liquidity Facility (CCLF) Calculator</a></span>.</p>
<p>With the expansion of central clearing in U.S. Treasuries on the horizon and given the size of transactions in the U.S. Treasury market - now exceeding USD $7 trillion daily - CCLF is a critical risk management tool used for managing DTCC&rsquo;s Fixed Income Clearing Corporation&rsquo;s (FICC) liquidity risk arising from settlement activity. Market participants can input their current unique settlement activity into the calculator to estimate and understand the CCLF-related liquidity obligations that could arise from membership.</p>
<p>CCLF is a rules-based liquidity resource facility that would provide FICC with additional liquid financial resources to meet its cash settlement obligations in the event of a default of the largest GSD family of affiliated Netting Members. To anticipate this potential funding need, GSD Netting Members incorporate their individually determined CCLF obligation amounts into their own liquidity plans. While the CCLF obligation is a committed obligation for the Netting Members, FICC does not require pre-funding or deposits of the obligation amount. Instead, as an ongoing FICC membership requirement Netting Members provide up-front attestations regarding their ability to provide such CCLF amounts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By providing the public CCLF calculator, we continue to increase transparency into our financial risk management program, empowering potential members to understand their role and obligations as a FICC GSD member,&rdquo; Tim Hulse, Managing Director, Financial Risk &amp; Governance at DTCC. &ldquo;CCLF provides a critical backstop to address the financial impact of volatility and stress across repo markets while safeguarding the industry and individual members.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The new CCLF calculator, accessible on dtcc.com, requires a series of data points to be provided by users. Once entered on screen, the calculator processes the data points using the existing GSD CCLF engine logic, delivering an estimated individual CCLF obligation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;FICC recognizes that many firms are considering membership with GSD to comply with the final SEC rule on expanded clearing of U.S. Treasury activity,&rdquo; said Claire Lough, Executive Director, Financial Risk &amp; Governance at DTCC. &ldquo;This calculator will enable market participants to simulate their potential CCLF obligations to assist in understanding what is required of a GSD Netting Member.&rdquo;</p>
<p>FICC is the leading provider of trade comparison, netting and settlement for the Government Securities marketplace. As part of its commitment to the industry, DTCC continues to assess calculators, tools and enhanced access methods to best support the expansion of U.S. Treasury clearing activity.</p>

<div> MOU, TFEX, RAOT, rubber reference prices, Thailand
Summary:<br />TFEX and RAOT partner to establish standardized Rubber Reference Prices, benefiting the industry and enhancing transparency and confidence.<br /> <div>
<p class="BodyA">Thailand Futures Exchange PCL (TFEX) has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Rubber Authority of Thailand (RAOT) for collaboration to establish the standardized Rubber Reference Prices. These benchmarks will serve as references trading transactions for both domestic and international players and facilitate the development of related products.</p>
<p class="BodyA"><b>TFEX Managing Director Rinjai Chakornpipat </b>said that<b> </b>the initiative is aimed to develop a recognized Rubber Reference Prices for Thailand, which will benefit both the rubber and related industries.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BodyA">"TFEX and RAOT aim for the reference prices to be widely accepted and used in trading transactions domestically and internationally. TFEX will calculate and publish the reference prices. The methodology for established reference price will be published for general public to ensure transparency of the benchmark. TFEX and RAOT also have a plan to consult with the industry to explore the development of rubber reference prices that comply with the European Union Deforestation-Free Regulation (EUDR). Besides, TFEX will further explore to utilize these reference prices for Rubber Futures product development," said Rinjai.</p>
<p class="BodyA"><b>RAOT Governor Nakorn Tangavirapat</b> said that even though Thailand is the world's major rubber producer, the country had relied on international rubber market prices as reference for its export contracts. Development of its domestic reference prices will help reflect the costs of Thai rubber farmers and local producers. To address this issue, RAOT, the central agency overseeing the entire rubber industry including domestic and export markets, has partnered with TFEX to develop the reference price calculation methodology for trading Thai rubber with aims to ensure transparency and adhere to international standards. The established reference prices will be publicly published, enabling relevant stakeholders to use them as a basis for determining contract prices for rubber exports (FOB prices). This development is expected to enhance confidence among stakeholders in the rubber industry. Under the collaboration, RAOT will gather and provide data on trading volumes, product information for various types of rubber, and other necessary information from RAOT&rsquo;s central rubber markets in each province. TFEX will use such data to calculate reference prices. RAOT and TFEX will disseminate these reference prices.</p>
<p class="BodyA">"We firmly believe that this collaboration marks a significant step in establishing internationally accepted methodology to establish Thai rubber reference prices and will pave the way for Thailand to become a hub for the rubber product industry, ultimately benefiting rubber farmers and Thai rubber entrepreneurs by strengthening their livelihoods and ensuring career stability,&rdquo; added Nakorn.</p>
<p>The MOU signing ceremony was held on June 12, 2024. The rubber reference prices will be calculated and published twice daily as follows: the price for Ribbed Smoked Sheet Grade 3 (RSS3) will be released at 12:00 hrs. (planned to launch in July 2024), while the prices for concentrated latex and block rubber will be announced at 19:00 hrs. (planned to launch in September 2024). For information on the Rubber Reference Prices, please visit TFEX website (<a href="http://www.tfex.co.th/">www.TFEX.co.th</a>) and the RAOT website (www.raot.co.th).</p>

<title>Three Million 'Frankenstein' Identities Pose A Multi-Billion Pound Fraud Threat: LexisNexis Risk Solutions</title>

<div> fraud, synthetic identity, UK, businesses, credit checks
Summary:<br /><br />New research from LexisNexis Risk Solutions shows that synthetic identity fraud threatens UK businesses with potential losses of £4.2billion by 2027. Scammers are creating synthetic identities to bypass fraud defenses, leading to potential significant financial losses for organizations. Noreen Altaf, an Identity Fraud specialist at LexisNexis Risk Solutions, advises businesses to invest in tools capable of spotting synthetic identities and review existing portfolios for any synthetic identities that may have infiltrated before they result in financial losses. <div>
<p>The latest fraud threatening the UK could cost businesses at least &pound;4.2billion if appropriate steps are not taken, new research from&nbsp;LexisNexis Risk Solutions shows.</p>
<div class="PRN_ImbeddedAssetReference" id="DivAssetPlaceHolder1">
<p><img src="https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2436045/LexisNexis_Risk_Solutions.jpg" title="Hotspots showing the fast-growth of synthetic Frankenstein identities across the UK" /></p>
</div>
<p>A new study looked at over 72million consumer profiles and found 2.8million showing several signs of 'Frankenstein cloning', where fraudsters stitch real and made-up personal details together to create a 'new' synthetic identity to spoof credit checks and commit high-value fraud against banks and credit providers.</p>
<p>In the U.S. where synthetic fraud is already a major issue, businesses report an average $15k<sup>[1]</sup>&nbsp;loss to each confirmed synthetic fraud case. As a result, experts at LexisNexis Risk Solutions estimate that it could cost the UK economy around &pound;4.2billion by 2027, unless firms start properly screening now, for the threat.</p>
<p>Most organisations' existing fraud defences are ineffective against synthetic identities because they appear as normal, good customers until the fraud is committed. Once they 'bust out' with the funds, the lender is left to suffer the loss, as there's no 'real' person to pursue for the debt.</p>
<p>Noreen Altaf, Identity Fraud specialist at LexisNexis Risk Solutions, explains: "At first, a synthetic ID has little value to a fraudster, as it has no credit history, so they need to play the long game. Scammers nurture each false identity by building what appears to be a real credit profile over time, making the synthetic ID seem like a trustworthy customer &ndash; because of this the fraud threat is effectively invisible to firms' existing fraud defences, until it's too late.</p>
<p>"Once a fraudster thinks the synthetic ID has enough plausibility, they'll aim to max out available credit lines. This might be applying for a loan or credit card for thousands of pounds, taking a PCP contract for a new vehicle, or making a high-value purchase via a buy now pay later arrangement. The fraudster has no intention of repaying this, leaving organisations to foot the bill and chasing ghosts to recover the debt.</p>
<p>"There is still much businesses don't know about this fast-emerging threat, so it's difficult to predict the true potential cost of synthetic fraud to the UK. However, even a very conservative estimate of a &pound;1,500 loss per fraud attack amounts to &pound;4.2 billion in future credit write-offs for companies, with synthetic identities already hiding amongst their customer base &ndash; and it could be a lot higher."</p>
<p>The study found strong evidence of scammers up and down the country using 'synthetic farms' in rural locations and 'synthetic factories' in urban areas to build up the credit scores of new synthetic identities on an industrial scale, in readiness for fraud attacks.</p>
<p>In one example, rental cottages based on a farm in Chichester appeared to have 439 highly suspect identities 'living' there over the past seven years, only 22 of which showed any evidence of being real people. The identities were making hundreds of applications for credit, such as short-term and payday loans and some were also linked to a similar farm hundreds of miles away near Dundee, Scotland.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A heat map produced alongside the report shows similar activity is happening across the whole UK. Suspected synthetic farms can be seen in multiple locations across rural Wales and the Scottish Highlands.</p>
<p>Noreen continues: "A common characteristic of synthetic farms and factories is that they are properties where the mail can be easily intercepted by the fraudsters making credit applications. A farm, for example, might have a mailbox that's at the end of a track, while empty buildings or shared mailboxes in cities can be exploited in a similar way.</p>
<p>"Synthetic fraud has been around for a while, but with sophisticated fraud modelling, we can, for the first time, more accurately detect and put a figure on it.</p>
<p>"Businesses need to act fast to protect themselves by investing in tools capable of spotting synthetic identities at application or onboarding stage, before they become customers. Given the length of time fraudsters have already been creating and nurturing synthetic identities in the UK &ndash; as evidenced by our research &ndash; banks, lenders and credit providers, in particular, should take appropriate action to review their existing portfolios to ascertain the extent to which synthetic identities may have infiltrated their organisations over time, before those identities get a chance to cash out."</p>

<div> Blueprint, Climate risk platform, Financial authorities, Integration, Data

Summary:
- Project Viridis integrates regulatory and climate data
- Developed by BIS and MAS
- A platform to identify, monitor and manage climate risks
- Uses EDKP technology
- Demonstrates integration of regulatory and climate data<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<ul>
<li>Project Viridis explores how regulatory and climate data could be integrated to provide insights into climate-related financial risks.</li>
<li>The project&rsquo;s report outlines a blueprint for a climate risk platform that can be used to identify, monitor and manage climate risks in the financial system.</li>
<li>The platform uses technology architecture developed by the BIS Innovation Hub Singapore Centre and MAS, enhanced in collaboration with other financial authorities from around the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) have developed a blueprint for a platform that integrates regulatory and climate data to help financial authorities identify, monitor and manage climate risks in the financial system.</p>
<p>2&nbsp;<span> </span>Integrating climate risk analysis into financial stability surveillance is challenging due to the complex nature of climate change, notable data gaps and limited understanding of how to measure the associated risks. To help tackle this challenge, a blueprint of a climate risk platform has been developed at the BIS Innovation Hub Centre in Singapore through Project Viridis.</p>
<p>3&nbsp;<span> </span>The blueprint lays out the key features and metrics required for a climate risk platform. These incorporate data and information on financed emissions, physical risk exposure and forward-looking assessments under different climate scenarios.</p>
<p>4&nbsp;<span> </span>&ldquo;As the impact of climate change on the global financial landscape intensifies, the need for adaptive and forward-thinking strategies has never been more urgent. Project Viridis helps equip financial authorities with the insights needed to integrate emerging climate risks into their analysis &ndash; and thereby help promote global financial stability,&rdquo; said Maha El Dimachki, Head of the BIS Innovation Hub Singapore Centre.</p>
<p>5&nbsp;<span> </span>&ldquo;Project Viridis is an innovative, collaborative blueprint that leverages technology solutions to systematically track climate-related data and metrices, thereby augmenting regulators&rsquo; efforts in assessing physical and transition climate risk exposures of individual banks and the financial system. This project addresses a common need of global financial authorities, and we look forward to further collaboration to expand such toolkits,&rdquo; said Celine Sia, Assistant Managing Director (Economics &amp; Knowledge Management), MAS.</p>
<p>6&nbsp;<span> </span>Project Viridis demonstrates how regulatory data can be integrated with climate data, which are extracted from corporate disclosure documents using natural language processing techniques. This provides authorities with insights into climate-related financial risks, helping them form an initial view of financial institutions&rsquo; risk exposures, and to identify areas that may require deeper risk assessment.</p>
<p>7&nbsp;<span> </span>More information on the platform can be found in the Project Viridis final report published&nbsp;<a class="mas-link" href="https://www.bis.org/publ/othp85.htm" target="_blank"><span class="mas-link__text">here</span>&nbsp;<span class="mas-icon mas-glyphs-external--link">&nbsp;</span></a>.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p><span><span>Additional Information</span></span></p>
<p>Project Viridis was first announced during BIS Innovation Hub&rsquo;s workplan in January 2022. For more information, please refer to this&nbsp;<a class="mas-link" href="https://www.bis.org/press/p220125.htm" target="_blank"><span class="mas-link__text">link</span>&nbsp;<span class="mas-icon mas-glyphs-external--link">&nbsp;</span></a>. As its foundational architecture, the Viridis platform uses the Ellipse Data and Knowledge Platform (EDKP), which was developed by the BIS Innovation Hub Singapore Centre and MAS under&nbsp;<a class="mas-link" href="https://www.bis.org/about/bisih/topics/suptech_regtech/ellipse.htm" target="_blank"><span class="mas-link__text">Project Ellipse</span>&nbsp;<span class="mas-icon mas-glyphs-external--link"></span></a>. The EDKP enables the integration of structured and unstructured data from various sources, and is being collaboratively enhanced by more than 15 central banks and financial regulators around the world. More information on EDKP can be found&nbsp;<a class="mas-link" href="https://www.bis.org/innovation/bis_open_tech_ellipse.htm" target="_blank"><span class="mas-link__text">here</span>&nbsp;<span class="mas-icon mas-glyphs-external--link"></span></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<title>New Zealand Financial Markets Authority Files Civil Proceedings Against Booster Investment Management Ltd And Individual Directors And Senior Managers</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-files-civil-proceedings-against-booster/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-files-civil-proceedings-against-booster/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The FMA has filed civil proceedings against Booster Investment Management Limited (BIML), a wholly owned subsidiary of Booster Financial Services Limited. The proceedings allege breaches of the Financial Markets Conduct Act (FMCA) by BIML and the following directors and senior managers of BIML:&nbsp;Allan Yeo (director), Paul Foley (director), Brendon Doyle (former director), David Beattie (senior manager) and Nicholas Craven (senior manager).</p>
<p>The FMA proceedings allege that multiple breaches occurred through 2017-2022, arising from investments made by BIML into a related, limited partnership, the Booster Tahi Limited Partnership (Tahi), which in turn invested into a series of domestic wine businesses, later amalgamated into the Booster Wine Group (BWG).&nbsp;The investors referred to in this case are retail investors and the funds involved come from three Booster Schemes (the Booster KiwiSaver Scheme, Booster Super Scheme and Booster Investment Scheme, (the&nbsp;Schemes)).&nbsp;Booster has advised that as at 31 May 2024, 24 of the 61 retail funds Booster manages have exposure to BWG, including six KiwiSaver Funds. Those Funds&rsquo; exposure ranges from 0.77% to 3.83%.</p>
<p>The FMA alleges 75 causes of action that:</p>
<ul>
<li>BIML breached its duties and obligations as the manager of the Schemes when investing in the manner described above;</li>
<li>the individuals involved used their positions improperly as directors or senior managers, in circumstances where conflicts of interest and related party benefits were not properly managed, when making investments of Scheme funds to benefit Tahi and the BWG; and</li>
<li>failures to follow required processes meant that the relevant transactions were made in breach of the prohibition against related party transactions.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Relevant provisions of the FMCA</p>
<p>Managers&rsquo; Duties</p>
<p>The entity, BIML:</p>
<ul>
<li>section 143(1)(b)(i) - to act in best interests of scheme participants (six causes of action);</li>
<li>section 143(2) - to carry out the functions of a manager in accordance with the governing document (18 causes of action);</li>
<li>section 143(3) - to comply with the same duties and liabilities as those imposed on a trustee (one cause of action); and</li>
<li>section 144 - to exercise any powers, or perform any duties, with the care, diligence and skill that a prudent person engaged in that profession would exercise (14 causes of action).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Individuals:</p>
<ul>
<li>sections 145(1)(b) - duty to not make an improper use of their position to gain an advantage for another (17 causes of action); and</li>
<li>section 533(1)(c) - being knowingly concerned in a breach of s 143 (for Mr Yeo and Mr Doyle only) (one cause of action).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Related party transactions</p>
<ul>
<li>section 173(1) - general prohibition on transactions giving a related party benefit (18 causes of action).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The basis for the FMA filing a case for these alleged breaches is broadly as follows:</p>
<p>As the Manager of these schemes, BIML is responsible for selecting and managing the investment portfolios of Scheme funds in accordance with its governing documents (including the trust deed, Product Disclosure Statement and Statement of Investment Policy and Objectives). BIML&rsquo;s Investment Committee (BIML IC) is delegated to make specific investment decisions within the framework of those governing documents, and in accordance with BIML&rsquo;s Investment Charter.</p>
<p>The FMA alleges the relevant Tahi investments were made without any consideration by the BIML Investment Committee:</p>
<ul>
<li>where the specific circumstances of an investment suggest that it was not in the best interests of Scheme participants. These circumstances include the concerns of BWG's lenders (that were known to BIML), the purpose of advances, and the underperformance of the BWG;</li>
<li>where the specific investment was not made in accordance with Tahi's investment criteria (which BIML was obliged to monitor);</li>
<li>the size and timing of particular requests for funding, and the timeframe for responses; and where there were material changes in the underlying business or the broader circumstances of that underlying business, without any reassessment of the appropriateness of the ongoing investment.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Margot Gatland, FMA Head of Enforcement, said: &ldquo;The FMA considers the alleged breaches to be serious, and that civil proceedings are the proportionate response. The allegations are centred around important governance provisions of the FMCA, including fiduciary duties of managers and related party transactions. The Court&rsquo;s determination will provide guidance to the market about the application of these core FMCA investor protection provisions, that managers and directors are required to comply with when making investment decisions on behalf of others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The FMA will be seeking declarations of contravention, pecuniary penalties to be paid to the Crown, and an inquiry into damages. As the case is now before the courts, the FMA cannot comment further on these matters.</p>
<p>FMA&rsquo;s approach to supervision during a litigation process</p>
<p>The FMA's regulatory delivery team has increased engagement with BIML to ensure it is satisfied with aspects of BIML&rsquo;s governance and operations, with a focus on its direct investment activities. Booster is cooperating with the FMA&rsquo;s supervisory team. This work will continue in parallel with the proceedings and is focused on current and future compliance and investor outcomes.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Each contravention has a maximum penalty of $600,000 for the entity, and $200,000 for an individual.</p>
<p>A court directed inquiry into damages would determine, if agreed to by the court, what harm or loss any investors have suffered as a result of the alleged breaches.</p>

<div> SEC, PCAOB, Erica Y. Williams, Chairperson, appointment<br />
Summary:<br />SEC appoints Erica Y. Williams as PCAOB Chairperson for a second term, overseeing public company audits and standards. Williams has extensive SEC and legal experience. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the appointment of Erica Y. Williams to a second term as Chairperson of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) beginning on Oct. 25, 2024, and running through Oct. 24, 2029.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank Erica for her leadership and am pleased that she will continue to serve as Chairperson of the PCAOB,&rdquo; said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. &ldquo;I also thank the PCAOB staff and the Board for their diligent work to ensure that public company financial disclosures can be trusted by investors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>SEC Chief Accountant Paul Munter added, &ldquo;I look forward to continuing to work with Chairperson Williams to further the PCAOB&rsquo;s long-overdue plan to modernize standards and improve audit quality to promote investor protection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>"I am honored to have Chair Gensler and the Commission's confidence and grateful for the opportunity to continue working alongside my fellow Board Members and the talented and dedicated PCAOB staff to protect investors," said Chair Williams. "I'm proud of our work together and eager to continue executing our mission on behalf of investors who depend on U.S. capital markets to build their American dream."</p>
<p>Prior to joining the PCAOB in January 2022, Erica Y. Williams was a litigation partner with Kirkland &amp; Ellis LLP.

<title>SEC Charges Founder Of AI Hiring Startup Joonko With Fraud</title>

<div> charged, fraud, artificial intelligence, SEC, investor <br />
<br />
Ilit Raz, CEO of Joonko, charged by SEC for defrauding investors of $21M with false statements about company's clients, revenue, and AI capabilities. Criminal charges also filed. <br />
Summary: <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Ilit Raz, CEO and founder of the now-shuttered artificial intelligence recruitment startup Joonko, with defrauding investors of at least $21 million by making false and misleading statements about the quantity and quality of Joonko&rsquo;s customers, the number of candidates on its platform, and the company&rsquo;s revenue.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Joonko claimed to use artificial intelligence to help clients find diverse and underrepresented candidates to fulfill their diversity, equity, and inclusion hiring goals. To raise money for Joonko, the complaint alleges that Raz falsely told investors that Joonko had more than 100 customers, including Fortune 500 companies, and provided investors with fabricated testimonials from several companies expressing their appreciation for Joonko and praising its effectiveness. Raz also allegedly lied to investors that Joonko had earned more than $1 million in revenue and was working with more than 100,000 active job candidates. When an investor grew suspicious of Raz&rsquo;s claims, Raz allegedly provided the investor with falsified bank statements and forged contracts in an effort to conceal the fraud. According to the complaint, the scheme unraveled in mid-2023 when the investor confronted Raz, who admitted to forging bank statements and contracts and lying about Joonko&rsquo;s revenue and number of customers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We allege that Raz engaged in an old school fraud using new school buzzwords like &lsquo;artificial intelligence&rsquo; and &lsquo;automation,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;As more and more people seek out AI-related investment opportunities, we will continue to police the markets against AI-washing and the type of misconduct alleged in today&rsquo;s complaint. But at the same time, it is critical for investors to beware of companies exploiting the fanfare around artificial intelligence to raise funds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges Raz with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and seeks a permanent injunction, civil money penalties, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and an officer-and-director bar against Raz.</p>
<p>In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Raz.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Alicia Guo, Ariel Atlas, Neil Hendelman, and Lindsay S. Moilanen and was supervised by Sheldon L. Pollock of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Guo and Ms. Atlas, and supervised by Daniel Loss and Mr. Pollock. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Southern District of New York and the FBI.</p>

<div> SEC, capital markets, securities laws, agency, international dialogue <br />
Summary:<br />
SEC Chair welcomes Class of 2024 to International Institute. Discusses capital markets, securities laws, and SEC's role. Emphasizes international cooperation. <div>
<p>Thank you, YJ, for that kind introduction.</p>
<p>As is customary, I&rsquo;d like to note that my views are my own as Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and I am not speaking on behalf of my fellow Commissioners or the staff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to welcome you&mdash;the nearly 120 members of the &ldquo;Class of 2024&rdquo; attending the SEC&rsquo;s International Institute on Securities Market Growth and Development.</p>
<p>Traveling from approximately 70 different countries and territories, and spending the next week and a half here, is a big commitment on your part.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re investing in your own human capital, taking time out of your busy lives, and learning about our securities markets, U.S. securities laws, and the SEC.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re also investing in your nation&rsquo;s capital by learning about how to promote your capital markets to the best they can be.</p>
<p>This is the 30<span>th</span>&nbsp;International Institute. It&rsquo;s also the 90<span>th</span>&nbsp;anniversary of this agency&rsquo;s formation. One of the SEC&rsquo;s founding principles is what President Roosevelt called &ldquo;complete and truthful disclosure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the spirit of disclosure, I will share that the SEC has a direct interest in sharing our expertise and experience with each of you.</p>
<p>First, robust regulatory frameworks across the globe limits opportunities for fraudsters to harm U.S. investors when investing overseas. It also limits opportunities for regulatory arbitrage.</p>
<p>Second, meeting the highest standards for international cooperation will ensure that you have the legal authority and tools to assist us on regulatory, enforcement, and supervisory matters, when needed.</p>
<h2>History of the Institute</h2>
<p>This program has its roots in post-World War II. President Truman envisioned a coordinated U.S. effort to assist its allies around the world and help them develop their own market-based economies.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-iismgd-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Then, just months before the Berlin Wall collapsed in 1989, SEC Chair Richard Breeden created the Office of International Affairs.</p>
<p>He crafted a global strategy to assist other countries in developing their capital markets, which began this very program. It&rsquo;s a great example of how this agency has continually responded to the unique challenges of the times.</p>
<p>Let me now turn to say a bit about our capital markets, our securities laws, and who we are as an agency.</p>
<h2>Capital markets</h2>
<p>First, the U.S. has the deepest, most liquid capital markets in the world. At over $110 trillion, we&rsquo;re over 40 percent of the world&rsquo;s capital markets, though we&rsquo;re only roughly 24 percent of the world&rsquo;s economy.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-iismgd-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Second, the U.S. capital markets benefit from significant engagement from everyday investors. Over half of American households, representing more than 115 million individual investors, own registered funds.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-iismgd-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>About 58 percent of U.S. households own stocks, up from 52 percent in 2016.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-iismgd-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p>Third, the U.S. has long benefitted from robust competition between nonbanks and banks. In fact, each of the registered funds and private funds sectors surpasses the size of the banking sector. Further, U.S. debt capital markets facilitate 75 percent of debt financing of non-financial corporations. In Europe, the U.K., and Asia, only 12-29 percent is raised in capital markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-iismgd-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p>Today, registered investment advisers advise 57 million clients with respect to $129 trillion in assets. Roughly speaking, that breaks down to advising on more than $32 trillion in registered funds, $30 trillion in private funds, and nearly $50 trillion in separately managed accounts.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-iismgd-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p>Let me put this in context. The entire U.S. banking system is $23 trillion.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-iismgd-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;Thus, the capital markets are nearly five times the size of our banking sector. Each of these sectors, in and of themselves, are larger than our banking sector.</p>
<p>Fourth, we also have robust competition between both public and private markets. Our public markets have approximately 7,400 actively reporting issuers, of which more than 4,000 companies listed on U.S. exchanges.</p>
<p>With the privileges of dollar and capital markets dominance also comes real responsibilities and challenges. Given how integrated our capital markets are into the world&rsquo;s capital markets, events in our capital markets can flow into others&mdash;and, events in yours can flow into ours.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen this time and again. For instance, in the 2008 mortgage crisis, we exported instability to the rest of the world, which then had further reverberations back into the United States.</p>
<p>In terms of challenges, foremost of course is that nothing stands still. The economies, rule of law, and capital markets of other countries will continue to evolve and compete for leadership.</p>
<p>Technology and business models continue to change. Further, nation states, including the United States, can be prone to policy mistakes.</p>
<h2>Our securities laws</h2>
<p>Our securities laws play a crucial role behind our success. After the 1929 market crash, President Roosevelt signed the first of the federal securities laws in 1933. He followed a year later with the passage of the Securities Exchange Act&mdash;making June 6, 1934, our birthday at the SEC.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-iismgd-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p>Roosevelt went on to work with Congress to enact five more securities laws, ending with the Investment Company Act and Investment Advisers Act of 1940.</p>
<p>Taken together, they formed the foundation of our capital markets. These laws were about protecting the investing public by ensuring they had what Roosevelt called, &ldquo;complete and truthful disclosure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC was created to ensure that the markets worked free of fraud and manipulation&mdash;and that investment advisers carried their duties to the clients they advised.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our laws have been updated over the years in response to changes in technology, markets, business models, and, from time to time, inevitable turmoil in the markets.</p>
<p>At its core, the SEC has a three-part mission: protect investors; maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and facilitate capital formation.</p>
<h2>Who we are as an agency</h2>
<p>That brings me back to who we, the SEC, are as an agency and as a Commission.</p>
<p>Our responsibility is vast. We oversee approximately 40,000 entities&mdash;including more than 13,000 registered funds, more than 15,400 investment advisers, more than 3,400 broker-dealers, 24 national securities exchanges, 103 alternative trading systems, 10 credit rating agencies, 33 self-regulatory organizations, and six active registered clearing agencies, among other entities.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re led by a five-member Commission appointed by the President&mdash;which, by law, requires that no more than three Commissioners can be from his or her party.</p>
<p>The SEC has nearly 5,000 staff here in Washington and in regional offices across the nation. Many may think of us as the largest group of securities lawyers in the world, with over 2,000 lawyers at the agency&mdash;but we do a lot more. Our work is organized across 6 main divisions and 25 offices.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-iismgd-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<p>The Divisions of Enforcement and Examinations account for about half of the SEC&rsquo;s staff. Without examination of compliance with and enforcement of our rules and laws, we can&rsquo;t instill the trust necessary for our markets to thrive.</p>
<p>Last year, we filed 784 enforcement actions and conducted approximately 3,000 examinations.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-iismgd-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;Stamping out fraud, manipulation, and abuse lowers risk in the system. It protects investors and reduces the cost of capital. The whole economy benefits from that.</p>
<p>Think about a football match without referees. It would quickly break down&mdash;it would start to look like rugby, and get worse from there.</p>
<p>Next, we have three programmatic divisions.</p>
<p>The Division of Corporation Finance oversees the disclosures of public companies so that investors can make informed investment decisions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Division of Investment Management oversees the funds and advisers that steward nest eggs for millions of American investors.</p>
<p>The Division of Trading and Markets serves on the front line for maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets. Market monitoring and supervision are essential parts of the Division&rsquo;s activity&mdash;especially during times of market stress.</p>
<p>Intertwined in everything we do is the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, which supports the Commission in every role, whether it&rsquo;s enforcement or examinations, monitoring the markets, or rulemaking.</p>
<p>As I said, we also have 25 other offices that contribute to our mission every day.</p>
<h2>Closing</h2>
<p>Finance knows no geographical boundaries. With a tap of a smart phone, money and risk can move across the globe in less than a second.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what makes it so important to foster international dialogue and coordination regarding global capital markets.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also why, with appropriate safeguards around confidentiality, that we&rsquo;ve come to collaborate on information sharing around our examination and enforcement efforts.</p>
<p>In the coming days, you&rsquo;ll hear from SEC staff about securities regulation, including building strong disclosure, examination, and enforcement programs.</p>
<p>They also will share lessons learned on oversight, creating an effective secondary market for securities, capital formation, and international cooperation.</p>
<p>Finally, they will cover new and emerging issues in data analytics, fintech, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that you all play an important role in our international capital markets. You were hand-selected by your agencies to represent your nations.</p>
<p>I encourage you to invest in the human capital in this room. Look around&mdash;there are likely future finance ministers and world leaders amongst you. Some of the alumni of this Institute have gone on to become Chairs of securities regulators and Ministers of Finance. Some have taken on leadership roles at the highest levels of their governments.</p>
<p>Finally, beyond all the technical skills and networking you take home with you, I hope you also remember the words of President Roosevelt&rsquo;s advisor, Felix Frankfurter, who would go on to be an Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p>90 years ago, when Roosevelt was first setting up the SEC, Frankfurter wrote: &ldquo;You need administrators who have stamina and do not weary of the fight, who are moved neither by blandishments nor fears, who in a word, unite public zeal with unusual capacity.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-iismgd-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></p>
<p>I hope we can all answer Frankfurter&rsquo;s call. Thank you.</p>

<title>Cboe Announces Expanded Collaboration With FTSE Russell To Drive Innovation In Digital Asset Derivatives</title>

<div> collaboration, derivatives, digital assets, FTSE Russell, Cboe
<br />
Cboe and FTSE Russell are collaborating to develop new derivatives products for digital assets, beginning with options tied to the FTSE Bitcoin and Ethereum indices. They aim to provide trusted, transparent, and regulated trading options in response to growing investor demand for crypto exposure. Cboe is expanding its digital assets business, consolidating its US futures products onto one exchange and introducing new products to complement existing initiatives. The planned cash-settled index options on the FTSE Bitcoin and Ethereum indices will provide a more comprehensive product suite and foster greater liquidity and hedging opportunities in the digital asset markets. 
Summary: <div>
<p>Cboe Global Markets, Inc. (Cboe: CBOE), the world's leading derivatives and securities exchange network, today announced it is expanding its collaboration with FTSE Russell, a leading global index provider, to drive product innovation in the digital assets space. This new initiative builds on Cboe and FTSE Russell's longstanding relationship and will leverage their combined expertise to develop new derivatives products, potentially beginning with cash-settled index options tied to the FTSE&nbsp;<span>Bitcoin</span>&nbsp;Index and the FTSE&nbsp;<span>Ethereum</span>&nbsp;Index.</p>
<div class="dombanner"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The collaboration underscores the companies' shared commitment to growing the digital assets space and expanding investor access to the asset class. Cboe's plans to list cash-settled index options on FTSE's indices, subject to regulatory approvals, would help meet growing investor demand for exchange-traded derivatives to gain and manage&nbsp;<span>crypto</span>&nbsp;exposures in a trusted, transparent and U.S.-regulated trading environment.</p>
<p>"For many years, Cboe and FTSE Russell have worked together to offer index options based on FTSE Russell indices, which have grown into some of the world's most actively traded products," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Catherine Clay</span>, Global Head of Derivatives at Cboe. "Our expanded relationship today mirrors that successful model of collaboration, combining Cboe's unrivalled derivatives expertise with FTSE's world-class indexing capabilities to potentially bring new solutions to the digital assets space. Derivatives has long been an area where Cboe excels, and now we are strategically expanding our expertise into the digital assets space. As these two asset classes converge, we look forward to driving continued innovation and our relationship with FTSE Russell will be key to this strategy."</p>
<p>The FTSE&nbsp;<span>Bitcoin</span>&nbsp;Index and FTSE&nbsp;<span>Ethereum</span>&nbsp;Index are part of the FTSE Digital Asset Indices Series, which is developed in partnership with Digital Asset Research (DAR). These indices are designed to capture the performance of&nbsp;<span>bitcoin</span>&nbsp;and ether, as determined by the FTSE DAR Reference Price, and provide institutional-quality, liquidity-screened exposure to the digital asset market.</p>
<p>Talking about the expanded collaboration,&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Fiona Bassett</span>, CEO of FTSE Russell, said: "We are delighted to continue working alongside Cboe Global Markets, realizing our mutual commitment to enable new asset innovation in financial markets. Our indices are used by some of the largest&nbsp;<span>crypto</span>&nbsp;asset managers in the world for their best-in-class data and processes built to manage regulatory and trading risk &ndash; critical differentiators for the data in this asset class."</p>
<p><b>Cboe's Broader Digital Assets Franchise</b></p>
<p>Cboe's expanded collaboration with FTSE Russell follows the recent realignment of its digital assets business &ndash; a move that will consolidate all Cboe U.S. futures products, including digital asset futures, onto one exchange, subject to regulatory review, powered by Cboe's broader global derivatives franchise and technology platform.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the collaboration is expected to introduce new products that will complement Cboe's existing digital assets initiatives. These currently include the listing and trading of cash-settled&nbsp;<span>bitcoin</span>&nbsp;and ether margin futures, along with spot&nbsp;<span>bitcoin</span>&nbsp;ETFs, where Cboe BZX Equities Exchange lists six out of the 11 ETFs listed domestically. Additionally, Cboe submitted five of the eight recently SEC-approved rule filings to list ETFs tied to the price of ether.</p>
<p>"Our plans to develop&nbsp;<span>bitcoin</span>&nbsp;and ether index options come at an exciting time as more investors of all types enter the&nbsp;<span>crypto</span>&nbsp;markets and are increasingly seeking exchange-listed derivatives to manage their&nbsp;<span>crypto</span>&nbsp;exposures," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Rob Hocking</span>, Head of Product Innovation at Cboe. "Many of our customers are already trading Cboe-listed digital asset products, whether margin futures or ETFs, tied to&nbsp;<span>bitcoin</span>&nbsp;and ether. The launch of cash-settled index options will be additive &ndash; resulting in a more comprehensive product suite and helping to foster greater liquidity and hedging opportunities in these markets. We believe that derivatives will drive the next phase of the digital asset market's maturation, and we're excited about the potential benefits that cash-settled index options can bring to the space."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cboe intends to share more details about its plans for cash-settled index options on the FTSE&nbsp;<span>Bitcoin</span>&nbsp;Index and the FTSE&nbsp;<span>Ethereum</span>&nbsp;Index potentially later this year.</p>

<title>DTCC And Cboe Clear Europe To Introduce New Clearing Workflow For OTC Cash Equities Trades And Deliver Enhanced Efficiencies To The Industry</title>

<div> DTCC, Cboe Clear Europe, post-trade workflow, OTC cash equities, settlement efficiencies
Summary:
DTCC and Cboe Clear Europe collaborate to enhance post-trade workflow for OTC cash equities, increasing settlement efficiencies and reducing risks. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>DTCC, the premier post-trade market infrastructure for the global financial services industry, today announced it is working with Cboe Clear Europe to deliver an enhanced post-trade workflow for over-the-counter (OTC) cash equities trades to help increase settlement efficiencies across UK and European markets.</p>
<p>DTCC, the leading post-trade market infrastructure, will collaborate with Cboe Clear Europe, the largest and most-connected pan-European cash equities CCP, to increase post-trade efficiencies while providing clients with the benefits of an established risk management counterparty. The service will bring OTC cash equities trades into Cboe Clear Europe&rsquo;s cleared environment, which can then be netted against on-exchange transactions for settlement purposes, delivering potentially significant efficiencies.</p>
<p>As part of this initiative, DTCC and Cboe Clear Europe will develop a proof of concept that links DTCC CTM's tri-party trade matching workflow with Cboe Clear Europe. This connection will allow Prime Brokers to receive a golden copy of transaction details when a match is achieved between a Hedge Fund and Executing Broker via DTCC&rsquo;s CTM service. Once the Prime Broker enters into this tri-party match, CTM automatically sends those matched trades to the CCP, providing netting and clearing benefits to mutual clients.</p>
<p>The new workflow will help reduce operational and settlement risk, as well as post-trade friction as additional markets consider and prepare for accelerated settlement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are pleased to be working with Cboe Clear Europe on this important initiative to bring greater post-trade efficiencies to the industry as the global markets look to accelerate to a T+1 settlement cycle. Cboe Clear Europe&rsquo;s extensive venue coverage combined with CTM&rsquo;s large client base will deliver increased operational efficiency and netting opportunities across European trading venues,&rdquo; said Val Wotton, Managing Director and General Manager, DTCC Institutional Trade Processing. &ldquo;DTCC remains committed to bringing greater post-trade automation to increase efficiencies for global financial markets as they work toward implementing accelerated settlement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are excited to be the first CCP to connect to DTCC&rsquo;s CTM tri-party matching workflow,&rdquo; said Vikesh Patel, President, Cboe Clear Europe. &ldquo;This joint solution enables us to bring greater efficiencies to our clients, helping to optimise their current post-trade workflows and operational processes as the global financial markets look to accelerate settlement cycles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The benefits of this initiative include reductions in post-trade processing time, risks associated with OTC transactions and settlement costs between Executing Brokers and Prime Brokers. It is anticipated that the joint solution will also help facilitate a reduction of capital requirements when moving from OTC to CCP settlement as well as lower trade fails and defaults.</p>
<p>CTM is DTCC Institutional Trade Processing&rsquo;s (ITP&rsquo;s) central matching service for cross-border and domestic transactions across multiple asset classes, including OTC and on exchange cash equity transactions. Today, there are 6,000+ clients in more than 80 countries using CTM to streamline workflows.</p>
<p>Cboe Clear Europe is a pan-European Central Counterparty, the most connected CCP in Europe - offering clearing services to 46 trading venues. Cboe Clear Europe is approved to clear cash equities, depositary receipts, ETFs and equity derivatives (index futures and options and equity options) contracts.</p>
<p>The first effort in this initiative to link DTCC&rsquo;s CTM to Cboe Clear Europe&rsquo;s CCP is, subject to the satisfactory completion of regulatory procedures, projected to go live in Q2 2025.</p>

<title>The IFRS Foundation Monitoring Board Welcomes The Progress Of Standard-Setting Activities And Underscores The Importance Of The Oversight By The IFRS Foundation Trustees</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Trustees, IFRS Foundation, Monitoring Board, IASB, ISSB <br />
Summary: The IFRS Foundation Monitoring Board discussed sustainability standards, oversight of IASB and ISSB, and the development of new accounting standards. Effective governance and funding were also emphasized. <br /> <div>
<p>During last week&rsquo;s meeting of the IFRS Foundation Monitoring Board in Singapore, the Monitoring Board discussed the activities of the Trustees of the IFRS Foundation, including their oversight responsibilities in respect of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB). The meeting was joined by the members of the Trustees of the IFRS Foundation under the leadership of Erkki Liikanen, Chair of the Trustees, as well as Andreas Barckow, Chair of the IASB, and Emmanuel Faber, Chair of the ISSB.</p>
<p>Among other activities, the Monitoring Board welcomed the finalization of the&nbsp;<em>Inaugural Jurisdictional Guide for the adoption or other use of ISSB Standards</em>&nbsp;in May 2024. The Monitoring Board members shared their views on different ways to adopt, apply or make use of sustainability-related disclosures. They also acknowledged the usefulness of consistency, comparability and interoperability of sustainability-related information for the benefit of investors and the ISSB&rsquo;s capacity-building efforts as jurisdictions consider incorporation of climate-related and other disclosures in their corporate reporting regimes. In this context, effective functioning of a multi-location model<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;would be essential for close engagement with stakeholders in various regions in the ISSB&rsquo;s effort to promote the implementation of IFRS S1 and S2 around the globe.</p>
<p>The Monitoring Board noted the importance of rigorous due process in the development of high-quality IFRS Accounting Standards and the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards and that the Monitoring Board will continue to collaborate with the Trustees to ensure both sets of Standards are developed under robust governance, due process and oversight while ensuring independence in their individual standard setting activities. In this context, the Monitoring Board took particular note of the finalization of the two new IFRS Accounting Standards, IFRS 18&nbsp;<em>Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements</em>&nbsp;and IFRS 19&nbsp;<em>Subsidiaries without Public Accountability: Disclosures</em>&nbsp;by the IASB and the recent decision by the ISSB to commence research projects related to biodiversity, ecosystems and ecosystem services as well as human capital.</p>
<p>As for the broad strategies of the IFRS Foundation, the Monitoring Board reaffirmed that stable and diversified funding should be achieved in a transparent manner in support of both Standard Setting Boards&rsquo; activities. The Monitoring Board also noted the importance of connectivity between the two Boards under the &ldquo;Two Boards under One Foundation&rdquo; model.</p>
<p>Takashi Nagaoka, Chairman of the IFRS Monitoring Board and Deputy Commissioner for International Affairs of Japan Financial Services Agency said:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I am pleased to co-host a discussion between the IFRS Foundation Trustees and the Monitoring Board members at an important juncture where the ISSB finalized its &ldquo;Inaugural Jurisdictional Guide for the adoption or other use of ISSB Standards,&rdquo; providing much-awaited support to jurisdictional approaches, and the IASB released two new accounting standards, IFRS 18 and 19, which is the first such output of new accounting standards in over six years. The IFRS Foundation Trustees and the Monitoring Board members are aligned in support of good governance of the Foundation to promote sustainability-related disclosures and continuing development of high-quality financial reporting standards to serve the capital markets globally.&rdquo;</em></p>

<title>World Federation Of Exchanges: Demystifying Tokenisation: Dispelling Myths, Explaining The Muted Traction, And Setting Out The Starting Point For Regulation</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/world-federation-of-exchanges-demystifying-tokenisation-dispelling-myths-expl/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/world-federation-of-exchanges-demystifying-tokenisation-dispelling-myths-expl/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Tokenisation, traditional assets, benefits, limitations, regulatory certainty
<br />
Tokenisation is a modern version of traditional finance with benefits such as fractional ownership and enhanced liquidity, but it has limitations and regulatory uncertainty.
<br /><br />Summary: 
Tokenisation offers new opportunities but faces limitations in technology, infrastructure, costs, and regulatory uncertainty. <div>
<p>As the European Commission today gathers stakeholders in Brussels to discuss the further tokenisation of assets, the WFE (the global industry association for exchanges and clearing houses) has published a paper, &ldquo;Demystifying Tokenisation: Embracing the Future&rdquo;, that provides a reality check: we shouldn&rsquo;t curtail the further development of tokenisation, nor should we run blindly towards it.<br /><br />Rather than a radical departure from the norm, tokenised traditional assets should be viewed as nothing more than a modernised and innovative iteration of traditional finance, providing new opportunities for investors and market participants. This is one of the many ways in which exchanges continue to invest serious effort and money in innovation.<br /><br />Tokenisation has many benefits that could make it a natural next step for financial markets. Fractional ownership, allowing multiple investors to own a share of an asset thereby lowering the capital requirement for individuals to invest in high-value assets; enhanced liquidity, which arises from fractionalisation enabling access to investments that may have been out of reach for many; and enhanced trust could all lead to greater financial inclusion, diversification and ultimately economic growth.&nbsp;<br /><br />Some of the supposed benefits are overexaggerated or frankly don&rsquo;t exist at all. Continuous 24/7 trading &ndash; if truly needed &ndash; can be achieved without tokenisation. Disintermediated models face conflicts of interest and instantaneous settlement in tokenised trading may have unpredictable timing, affecting market liquidity and trading costs, especially if assets and funding need to be blocked prior to execution.<br /><br />With over 15 years passed since the Bitcoin white paper, tokenisation has not &ldquo;taken off&rdquo; in traditional markets and there are several reasons why:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DLT has limitations</strong>, particularly in high transaction environments, as the technology is currently not fast enough to execute and settle all the trades running through a highly active exchange in any given moment. There are also other limitations such as storage problems caused by the distributed ledger.</li>
<li>The nature of different DLT creations means that there is a&nbsp;<strong>fragmented infrastructure&nbsp;</strong>with tokenised assets managed on different blockchains which are not interoperable. Financial institutions would have to build connections with each platform, leading to significant operational costs and challenges, meaning there are only marginal efficiency gains in certain markets, particularly those that are already liquid.</li>
<li>There are&nbsp;<strong>significant sunk costs</strong>&nbsp;involved in implementing DLT. It is a capital-intensive investment to move to the new technology and build the relevant infrastructure. These costs would be felt across the market, from infrastructure providers to market participants and end users. Even then, there may not be sufficient demand if customers do not have the correct infrastructure or capital to invest.</li>
<li>The lack of&nbsp;<strong>regulatory certainty</strong>, which is improving thanks to the efforts of regulators and industry, persists. Most jurisdictions&rsquo; bodies of law do not reflect the creation of tokenised assets, leaving firms apprehensive. Anything that is, in effect, a financial instrument, should be treated in the same way, regardless of whether it is tokenised.</li>
<li>The lack of adoption further inhibits tokenisation because, without widespread use, there are&nbsp;<strong>no network effects</strong>&nbsp;and there is little value to firms and exchanges to update their technology stacks to incorporate tokenised assets.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tokenisation should be seen as a creative and modern version of traditional finance that offers new possibilities to investors and market players. However, current limitations mean that it won&rsquo;t be right for every type of asset.<br /><br /><strong>James Auliffe, Manager, Regulatory Affairs at the WFE commented,</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;The fundamentals of tokenisation and the infrastructures these assets trade on need to be better understood. Regulation in this area should reflect that tokenisation is a natural evolution in the financial industry, rather than a drastic break from the norm. Its usage is suitable in particular environments and for particular assets, but in these cases, market participants can reap great benefits.&rdquo;<br /><br />The full paper can be read&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://world-exchanges.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=48ddcbc11eb58f141a51219ea&amp;id=10c6fc2baf&amp;e=979576350c" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

The scope of the change impacts the entire bank&rsquo;s customer base, including individual and business customers served by its Corporate, Affluent, International and Private Banking divisions.</p>
<p><b>Michalis Louis, Chief Executive Officer, Eurobank Cyprus, commented:</b>&nbsp;&ldquo;The go-live with Temenos is a major milestone that allows us to transform the bank at a high level. This was a complex and challenging project, but it was expertly delivered by our internal teams and Temenos working closely together. The new Temenos platform gives us business&nbsp;agility&nbsp;to achieve our goals and opens the roadmap for further expansion, enhancements and growing the Bank&rsquo;s position as a market leader through the latest technology. We look forward to building on this success for customers in Cyprus and across the Eurobank Group&rdquo;.</p>
<p><b>Mark Yamin-Ali, Managing Director - Europe, Temenos, said:</b>&nbsp;&ldquo;I wish to congratulate Eurobank Cyprus for its vision and execution in transforming the bank for the modern digital age. Eurobank has always been a pioneer, and the move to Temenos including a full breadth of banking capabilities from digital and core banking to payments on an agile, open platform will enable the bank to continue to drive innovation, deliver an outstanding customer experience across all segments and grow sustainably. Temenos has enjoyed a long and successful partnership with Eurobank Group, and we are delighted to support the bank and its future success in Cyprus.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Eurobank Cyprus is now well positioned to advance its long-term business strategy of expanding its banking services in addition to ESG compliant banking and advancing sustainability through paperless and efficient banking operations. The Bank has also recently received four prestigious awards by Euromoney Magazine for Best International Private Bank in Cyprus as well as Best for Digital Solutions, Best for Sustainability and Best for High-Net-Worth Clients. These awards are a testament to the Bank&rsquo;s effective use of technology.</p>
<p>Focused on innovation and sustainability, Eurobank Group designs and implements initiatives using cutting-edge technology and following ESG rules.</p>

<div> monitoring, regional banks, securities investment, risk management, financial institutions
Summary: The FSA monitors regional banks' securities investment, targeting high-risk banks. It seeks to improve risk management and governance in financial institutions. <div>
<p class="indent mb0">The Financial Services Agency (FSA), from the perspective of maintaining the stability of the financial system in Japan, conducts intensive monitoring of regional banks' securities investment, targeting those with large risk-taking in securities investment.</p>
<p class="indent mt0">The report summarizes key points and observed cases during the monitoring process.</p>
<p class="indent">It is intended not only for the targeted financial institutions but also as a reference for risk management by other financial institutions (primarily those institutions with substantial risk exposure to securities investment).</p>
<p class="indent">The FSA will continue to encourage financial institutions&rsquo; enhancement of their securities investment management and risk management systems and demonstration of effective risk governance through monitoring focused on such issues in the future. We expect financial institutions to put effort into further improving their risk management practices.</p>

<title>New Zealand Financial Markets Authority Opens Consultation On Proposed Standard Conditions For Derivatives Issuers</title>

<div> Feedback, Derivative Issuer Licences, Leverage, Suitability, Monitoring

Summary:
The FMA seeks feedback on potential changes to Derivative Issuer licences, particularly regarding leverage and investor suitability. Changes aim to align with international norms.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW191560321 BCX8">The Financial Markets Authority (FMA) &ndash; Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko &ndash; is seeking feedback on potential changes to the standard conditions imposed on Derivative Issuer (DI) licences. The changes relate to leverage and the suitability of investors for derivative trading. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW191560321 BCX8">The proposed changes have been identified in the FMA&rsquo;s 2020 Derivatives Issuer Sector Risk Assessment (SRA) and subsequent monitoring of the sector. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Proposed leverage standard condition</span></p>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW191560321 BCX8">Investing with leverage amplifies the risk by enabling an investor to have much greater exposure to an increase and decrease in value. Currently, there is no limit to the amount of leverage a licensed DI can offer to retail investors in New Zealand. For example, while some licensed DIs limit contracts for difference (CFDs) leverage to 30:1, others offer up to 500:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW191560321 BCX8">The higher the level of leverage, the greater the financial impact felt from price volatility. For example, if a trade is leveraged 10:1, an investor with $1,000 in their account can control a position in an underlying asset valued at $10,000. When a position is leveraged 500:1, that same investor with $1,000 can control a $500,000 position. Leverage can enable efficient asset allocation, but highly leveraged derivatives mean retail investors may experience much higher losses. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW191560321 BCX8">The proposed standard condition is similar to those in the UK, Europe and Australia and varies depending on the underlying asset class of the derivative. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Changes to suitability standard condition&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW191560321 BCX8">The SRA and subsequent monitoring indicated some licensed DIs were not always taking sufficient steps to determine suitability for the investor. Monitoring also found that some of the suitability assessments were poorly designed or ineffective. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW191560321 BCX8">Licensed DIs offer a wide range of derivatives with varying degrees of risk. While some are straightforward, others, like binary options or cryptocurrency CFDs, can be opaque or volatile and are therefore riskier.</span></p>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW191560321 BCX8">The FMA considers it both appropriate and necessary to revise the suitability standard condition to ensure that DIs ask retail investors for relevant information needed to assess whether the derivative is suitable.</span></p>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW191560321 BCX8">The FMA has revised the suitability condition to require that DIs must determine whether the retail investor understands the derivative before investing.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW191560321 BCX8">Director of Markets, Investors and Reporting, John Horner said: &ldquo;The proposed changes are about ensuring retail investors fully understand the nature and extent of the risk around derivatives and to align protection measures with international norms.&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW191560321 BCX8">The consultation period runs until 7 August.&nbsp;</span></p>

<div> Securities and Exchange Commission, 90th anniversary, Securities Exchange Act of 1934, market trust, economic welfare
Summary:
SEC celebrates 90th anniversary, highlighting the importance of Securities Exchange Act of 1934, market trust, and economic welfare for everyday Americans. <div>
<p>Good afternoon. As is customary, I&rsquo;d like to note that my views are my own as Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and I am not speaking on behalf of my fellow Chairs or the staff.</p>
<p>I want to welcome the public and thank you for tuning in as we celebrate the 90<span>th</span>&nbsp;anniversary of a milestone in American history.</p>
<p>In the depths of the Great Depression, President Roosevelt worked with Congress to enact the Securities Exchange Act of 1934&mdash;creating the SEC and making June 6 our official birthday.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-90thsec-060624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>It's just one of a handful of the original securities laws. But taken together, those laws and this agency put our markets on a path in which investors and issuers alike can have trust in the markets.</p>
<p>These time-tested laws have played an important part in boosting the economic welfare of everyday Americans.</p>
<p>For anyone who doubts the significance of these laws and regulations, think about the schemes and frauds throughout the 1920s that contributed to the Great Depression.</p>
<p>For the sports fans, imagine what would happen to teams, athletes, and fans without fair competition.</p>
<p>The SEC remains a steward of trust, efficiency, and competition within our markets. While the U.S. is roughly 24 percent of the world&rsquo;s economy, it represents over 40 percent of the world&rsquo;s capital markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-90thsec-060624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s part of why the U.S. dollar is the world&rsquo;s leading currency.</p>
<p>I want to close with two letters FDR received before he signed our founding document.</p>
<p>On April 12, 1934, Richard Whitney, then-President of the New York Stock Exchange, wrote to Roosevelt that he was &ldquo;sincerely disturbed as to what may happen if unsound legislation is enacted.&rdquo; He went on to write about Sam Rayburn&rsquo;s modified bill, saying, &ldquo;I am confident that its enactment would be a disaster.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-90thsec-060624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>A few months later, FDR received a letter from Felix Frankfurter, his adviser who later would become a Supreme Court justice. Frankfurter wrote regarding the &ldquo;effective administration&rdquo; the SEC would need to succeed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need administrators,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;who have stamina and do not weary of the fight, who are moved neither by blandishments nor fears, who in a word, unite public zeal with unusual capacity.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-90thsec-060624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p>90 years later, thousands of SEC staff and over 100 Commissioners and Chairs have answered Frankfurter&rsquo;s call. I thank them for their service. I thank them for their rectitude. Contrary to Whitney&rsquo;s belief, the SEC has made it work for investors, issuers, and the over $110 trillion markets we oversee today.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<div> Meeting, Global Markets Advisory Committee, GMAC, recommendations, Subcommittee
Summary:
- Thanking attendees for participation
- Update on status of GMAC recommendations
- Welcome new members
- Overview of today's agenda
- Recognition of impactful work of GMAC
- Highlighting importance of GMAC's work <div>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Good morning. It&rsquo;s great to convene another Global Markets Advisory Committee (GMAC) meeting in New York. I want to start by thanking everyone for taking the time to travel here&mdash;from all across the United States, and as far away as London, Frankfurt, Tokyo and more&mdash;to share your expertise with the GMAC. I know that a lot of time and work goes into preparing for these meetings, so I also want to thank the GMAC members and Subcommittee members for their service, and our presenters for joining us today. The GMAC&rsquo;s recommendations have real impact and add value to not only the Commission, but also to the international policy dialogue. I especially want to recognize the GMAC&rsquo;s leadership team for your continued stewardship of the GMAC, and all the Subcommittee workstream leads for their tireless efforts. We have a truly impressive group of leaders to examine the issues.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Of course, I want to acknowledge and thank my team: Harry Jung, the GMAC Designated Federal Officer, and Nicholas Elliot, the GMAC Alternate Designated Federal Officer, as well as Meghan Tente and Taylor Foy. And, as always, many thanks to all the CFTC staff in both the New York office and our DC headquarters who made the GMAC&rsquo;s meeting today possible.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>I will provide a brief update on the status of each of the GMAC&rsquo;s 11 recommendations to date and potential next steps. I will also recognize the new members of the GMAC and its Subcommittees, and then provide an overview of today&rsquo;s agenda and speakers.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The GMAC Continues to Deliver</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The GMAC continues to support the growth of liquid and efficient markets and make great progress developing thoughtful recommendations and insightful work product to aid the CFTC, both U.S. and non-U.S. authorities, and indeed, all stakeholders in global markets and financial services.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The GMAC was first created in 1998 to handle the issues associated with globalization and access to markets. These issues remain critically important given the interconnected market environment, everchanging geopolitical dynamics, and emerging and innovative products and tools. Accordingly, global collaboration and coordination amongst authorities is critical to promoting regulatory cohesion and financial stability, and mitigating market fragmentation and systemic risk. That is why the GMAC&rsquo;s mandate includes assessing and informing international standards.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Since it was relaunched, the GMAC has worked to ensure that global markets are well-functioning, promote market integrity and resilience, facilitate compliance, and foster innovation and growth. As the GMAC&rsquo;s sponsor, I&rsquo;m honored to help provide a public venue for preeminent industry experts and regulators to discuss and develop pragmatic solutions to global challenges. I hope we have built a union of minds brought together for a common purpose.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Status of GMAC Recommendations and Next Steps</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>First, I want to commend the GMAC for kicking off last year with a comprehensive stock-take of the most significant current and emerging issues in global markets and the financial system. This global stock-take informed the development of the GMAC&rsquo;s work program and included input from policymakers, dealers, asset managers, liquidity providers, exchanges, trading facilities, clearinghouses, technology service providers, and end users.&nbsp;</span>I particularly note that the GMAC&rsquo;s work is based on data and observations from the markets that will support better policy outcomes.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>In less than a year, the GMAC has adopted 11 recommendations to date on a variety of issues, including U.S. Treasury market liquidity, well-functioning repo and funding markets, exchange volatility controls, T+1 securities settlement, improved collateral management, central counterparty (CCP) default simulation, streamlining trade reporting data to monitor systemic risk, and a foundational digital asset taxonomy to facilitate alignment in regulation across jurisdictions.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>These recommendations have provided data-driven and transparent resources for the CFTC and our counterparts around the world. Just last week, I was honored to present the GMAC&rsquo;s recommendations at the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) 49<span>th</span>&nbsp;Annual Meeting, and I note Chairman Behnam serves as IOSCO Vice Chair. The CFTC has long been a leader in various international fora. The degree of interest in the GMAC&rsquo;s work speaks for itself.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><i><span><span>Global Market Structure Subcommittee (GMSS)</span></span></i></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/9606/GMAC_NewBlockCap110623/download"><i>GMSS Recommendation 1 &ndash; New Block and Cap Sizes</i></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>Appropriately calibrated block and cap sizes are vital to the proper functioning of derivatives markets, including price discovery and transparency. However, the CFTC&rsquo;s new post</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>‐</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>initial block and cap sizes that will require compliance starting July 1, 2024, may negatively affect market liquidity and could significantly raise trading and hedging costs for buy</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>‐</span></span></i><i><span><span>side market participants and end users such as pension and other retirement plans.</span></span></i></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The GMAC recommends extending the compliance date for the post</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>‐</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>initial block and cap sizes for all asset classes to at least December 4, 2024. The GMAC further recommends that, during the extension period, the Commission engages with market participants in discussions and analysis to ensure the post</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>‐</span></span></i><i><span><span>initial block and cap sizes are appropriately tailored, including with respect to current market and macroeconomic conditions.</span></span></i></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The CFTC recently issued a letter that will allow for further study including implications of decreased liquidity and access to markets. I believe that the GMAC&rsquo;s presentations and recommendations were key, especially the market data and observations. I appreciate the support of Commissioner Mersinger, and Chairman Behnam&rsquo;s pragmatic approach and consideration of this issue.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/9731/gmac_Rule1_25d2_110623/download"><i>GMSS Recommendation 2 &ndash; Proposal to Add CCPs as Permitted Counterparties</i></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>Further alignment of SEC and CFTC regulations would support critical risk management functions that will promote well-functioning repo and funding markets. While CFTC rules impose customer protection requirements and permit a futures commission merchant (FCM) or derivatives clearing organization (DCO) to utilize repos to manage customer funds, an SEC-registered clearing agency is not a permitted counterparty under Rule 1.25(d)(2).</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The GMAC recommends that the Commission allow a CCP that meets the definition of a &ldquo;covered clearing agency&rdquo; under SEC Rule 17-Ad-22(a)(5) to be designated a &ldquo;permitted counterparty&rdquo; pursuant to CFTC Rule 1.25(d)(2).</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>I&rsquo;m pleased to note that I have discussed this recommendation with Chairman Behnam, and it will be considered for CFTC rulemaking given that this recommendation will facilitate implementation of the SEC&rsquo;s Treasury clearing mandate.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/9591/gmac_FICC_CME110623/download"><i>GMSS Recommendation 3 &ndash; FICC-CME Customer Position Cross-Margining Structure</i></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>For two decades, the CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have approved cross-margining for Treasury securities transactions and Treasury futures, promoting the efficiency and well-functioning of the U.S. Treasury markets&mdash;the backbone of the global financial system.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The GMAC recommends the Commission make the benefits of cross-margining available to a broader range of sophisticated customers, including those customers that will be subject to the new SEC Treasury clearing requirements, as well as to all customers that voluntarily elect to clear Treasury transactions and will post margin.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>This GMAC recommendation is being actively considered as part of the implementation of the SEC&rsquo;s Treasury clearing mandate. I thank FICC and CME&rsquo;s leadership on this issue. Both are members of the GMAC&rsquo;s Global Market Structure Subcommittee and led this work.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/9736/gmac_FIAExecutiveSummary110623/download"><i>GMSS Recommendation 4 &ndash; Endorsement of Futures Industry Association (FIA) Volatility Controls Mechanism Paper</i></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The efficient management of financial market volatility is paramount. During recent crises in markets, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as in commodity markets, the Futures Industry Association (FIA) has noted the pivotal role volatility control mechanisms have played in preserving market integrity. Consequently, FIA engaged with global derivatives exchanges and market participants to explore the most effective ways to mitigate disruptions while ensuring transparent price discovery.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The GMAC recommends the Commission use the best practices as a tool for understanding exchange market risk controls and when engaging with global regulators and international standard setters.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>This GMAC recommendation has been a beneficial resource to ensuring market integrity during periods of high market volatility, market stress, or other disruptions through effective application of exchange market risk controls and other volatility control mechanisms and sharing best practices across jurisdictions.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/10331/CFTC_GMAC_GM_Structure_Subcommittee_Recommendation-UST_ETF_as_UMR_Collateral/download"><i>GMSS Recommendation 5 - Inclusion of U.S. Treasury ETFs as Eligible Initial Margin Collateral</i></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The use of exchange traded funds (ETFs) that invest in U.S. Treasury bonds has dramatically increased in recent years. While standalone U.S. Treasury bonds can be used as initial margin (IM) collateral for uncleared swaps, ETFs that invest in them are not similarly eligible as collateral, despite being more diversified which can mitigate idiosyncratic risk.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>During many historic volatile trading sessions, certain UST ETFs have acted globally as &ldquo;shock absorbers,&rdquo; providing real-time prices and liquidity. Most notably, during the bond market volatility in 2020, volatility increased in U.S. Treasury bonds as dealers&rsquo; balance sheets were constrained. During this time, many UST ETFs traded at tighter bid-ask spreads than their portfolio of underlying bonds. For example, dislocations in U.S. Treasuries caused the bid/ask spreads of &ldquo;off-the-run&rdquo; bonds with a maturity of 20+ years to widen to almost 20 times that of the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT).</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The inclusion of U.S. Treasury ETFs as eligible IM collateral under the CFTC Margin Rules for Covered Swap Entities would enhance the robustness and resilience of the collateral pipeline. This enhancement, driven by factors such as diversification, liquidity, efficiency, and market stability, could prove beneficial for end-users seeking a wider range of eligible IM, CSEs and the broader financial markets. Allowing UST ETFs as IM collateral could not only help safeguard CSEs from counterparty default, but also help reduce the overall risk in the financial system and limit the potential for contagion arising from uncleared swaps.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The GMAC recommends the CFTC expand the universe of liquid assets that can be posted as uncleared margin, specifically to include U.S. Treasury ETFs.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The CFTC has been considering various aspects of margin and eligible collateral requirements. This GMAC recommendation and associated market data and observations are timely given recent developments in Treasury markets, and have contributed to an informed analysis of appropriate collateral management practices.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><i><span><span>Technical Issues Subcommittee (TIS)</span></span></i></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/9576/gmac_TechnicalSubcommitteeRecommendationsDefault110623/download"><i>TISS Recommendation 1 - Global Default Simulation</i></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>In November 2023, CCP Global conducted a global default simulation across CCPs. Global regulator support of the exercise was critical to its success. The default simulation was arranged in consultation and with input from regulators. It is critical the CFTC continue its support and valuable input, alongside its role in convening regulators and market participants.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The GMAC recommends the CFTC consider inclusion of lessons learned and best practices arising from such simulations into its capacity building programs with, especially, some emerging market regulatory homologues.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The CFTC, through the work of the Office of International Affairs, actively provides technical assistance to many other jurisdictions in the development of effective derivatives markets. CCP resilience, recovery, and resolution has been a top financial stability priority, and the GMAC recommendation has supported ongoing efforts to identify and mitigate systemic risk.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/9721/gmac_TechnicalSubcommitteeRecommendationsMMF110623/download"><i>TIS Recommendation 2 &ndash; MMFs as Eligible Collateral</i></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The CFTC&rsquo;s proposed rule amendment to remove the asset transfer restriction from money market funds (MMFs) used as eligible collateral for non</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>‐</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>cleared margin will harmonize the parameters for MMF use with the UK and resolve one of the impediments to the use of MMFs between the U.S. and European Union (EU). The proposed rule will also allow the CFTC to self</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>‐</span></span></i><i><span><span>align MMFs with its eligible collateral requirements for cleared margin, per CFTC Rule 1.25, which governs the investment of customer money by FCMs without similar asset transfer restrictions.</span></span></i></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The GMAC recommends the Commission: (i) finalize the proposed rule amendment; (ii) encourage the U.S. Prudential Regulators to adopt a corresponding amendment to their non</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>‐</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>cleared margin rules, including allowing third country funds; and (iii) encourage European Union (EU) policy makers to remove the third country fund restriction for eligible collateral from their non</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>‐</span></span></i><i><span><span>cleared margin rules.</span></span></i></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The CFTC currently has a pending rulemaking proposal on MMFs as eligible collateral for non-cleared margin. The GMAC recommendation has provided a key perspective on cross-border harmonization of MMF treatment.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/9726/gmac_TIS_P42P45Streamlining110623/download"><i>TIS Recommendation 3 &ndash; Improve Trade Reporting for Market Oversight, Streamline Potential 40% Increase in CFTC Reportable Data Elements</i></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The Commission is currently amending its Part 43 and Part 45 swap data reporting requirements to potentially add nearly 50 additional reportable fields on top of the currently required 128 data elements that were just implemented in December 2022. The potential 40% increase in data reporting elements distracts from optimizing analysis and use of the recently expanded data set and creates further obstacles and uncertainty for meaningful global aggregation and analysis of trade repository data. Further, an ad hoc approach to additional data reporting elements unnecessarily increases costs.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The GMAC recommends several steps to improve data reporting elements which will (i) advance analytical tools to optimize use of the current, recently expanded, data set; and (ii) focus on impediments to data sharing, including the alignment of the validations and requirements for critical data elements (CDE) fields and global identifiers.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>This GMAC recommendation informed the CFTC&rsquo;s recent Part 43 and Part 45 rulemaking proposal, and was then submitted to the public comment file. The CFTC is working to finalize this proposal.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/9596/gmac_TIS_Recommendation_DataSharingAnalysis110623/download"><i>TIS Recommendation 4 &ndash; Improve Trade Reporting for Market Oversight and Improving Data Sharing and Systemic Risk Analysis</i></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>Regulators, including the CFTC, have implemented global trade reporting harmonization efforts to enable data amalgamation to facilitate regulatory data usage across jurisdictions. However, there are non</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>‐</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>data related impediments that could prevent data sharing, thus undermining the value of these significant projects.</span></span></i></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The GMAC recommends the Commission facilitate discussions with key regulators (market and prudential) on the desire to share data elements and agree upon the Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) needed to allow such activity, starting with U.S. and then prioritize other G20 regulators where there is significant overlap.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>There are several international, major trade reporting initiatives at the FSB and IOSCO, among others, to improve trade reporting for market oversight and improve data sharing and systemic risk analysis consistent with this GMAC recommendation. The CFTC is actively participating in these ongoing initiatives.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/10326/GMAC_T+1_Resources_030624/download"><i>TIS Recommendation 5 - Publication of Resource Document to Support Transition to T+1 Securities Settlement</i></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>As the United States prepares to transition to next-day trade settlement (T+1) for securities in May 2024, the Subcommittee crafted a resource document to support market participants. The document details products covered by the transition to T+1, timelines for transition in various markets, and the benefits to the transition. The document also highlights the implications T+1 has for various markets &ndash; particularly foreign exchange markets, and discusses its impacts on transaction processes for various products, including cross-border impacts. Further, it provides a list of resources to help firms prepare for the transition.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>This GMAC recommendation helped to prepare the U.S. securities markets, and other impacted asset classes and products, for a smooth T+1 securities settlement transition completed over the Memorial Day holiday weekend. It provided resources for aspects such as foreign exchange (FX) markets and cross-border transactions.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><i><span><span>Digital Asset Markets Subcommittee (DAMS)</span></span></i></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/10321/CFTC_GMAC_DAM_Classification_Approach_and_Taxonomy_for_Digital_Assets_030624/download"><i>DAMS Recommendation 1 - Adoption of an Approach for the Classification and Understanding of Digital Assets</i></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>A clear, consensus-driven approach to classifying assets and the functions they serve underpins robust markets and effective regulation. The evolving digital asset ecosystem has led many to develop proprietary taxonomies to classify digital assets and their related technology. In recognition of this progress, the Subcommittee has engaged digital asset stakeholders across the broader digital asset ecosystem to build a common approach for the classification and understanding of digital assets.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>This approach aims to set out consistent language for participants in the digital asset ecosystem to promote innovation, identify and address risk considerations, and enable effective regulatory understanding. With this objective in mind, the approach builds upon the considerable classification efforts of global prudential standard setters and regional authorities, including the Bank for International Settlements, the Financial Stability Board and others.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The GMAC recommends this approach be considered an initial basis for a consensus-driven, functional taxonomy. However, as the digital asset ecosystem continues to evolve, so too will the terminology used to classify it. The Subcommittee will reassess any future developments to provide further recommendations to this approach, based on the guidance of its members. The Subcommittee seeks to support effective rules and regulations for digital assets, and recommends continued collaboration between industry, standard-setting bodies, and the regulatory community.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The first-of-a-kind GMAC digital asset taxonomy&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span><span>framework provides valuable foundational guidelines to further advance the discussion and promote U.S. regulatory clarity, and was extensively vetted by stakeholders such as regulatory authorities, financial institutions, asset managers, market infrastructures, and service providers.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>New GMAC and Subcommittee Members</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>I also want to welcome a few new faces to the GMAC and our Subcommittees. We've added a few new experts to our ranks since we last met.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>On the GMAC, we&rsquo;ve added&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Chuck Mack, Head of Strategy for North American Markets at Nasdaq, and Derek Kleinbauer, President of Bloomberg SEF. On the Digital Asset Markets Subcommittee, we&rsquo;ve added Mo Shaikh, Co-Founder and CEO of Aptos Labs; Terrence Dempsey, Senior Vice President and Head of Product Strategy at Fidelity Digital Assets; Ian Grieves, Vice President for Product &amp; Strategy at Cboe</span></span></span><span><span>; and&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Chen Arad, Co-Founder &amp; Chief External Affairs Officer at Solidus Labs.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Welcome, and I look forward to your contributions to the GMAC.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Today&rsquo;s GMAC Meeting</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Today&rsquo;s meeting will continue to build on the significant progress we&rsquo;ve already made. We&rsquo;ll start with a presentation from the Global Market Structure Subcommittee on the impact the proposed U.S. implementation of Basel III endgame&rsquo;s bank capital requirements would have on end users who rely on cleared derivatives markets. Providing this timely presentation will be Kyle Glenn, Vice President for Government Relations at FIA, and Thane Twiggs, Chief Compliance Officer for Risk Management at Cargill.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>We&rsquo;ll then have a panel discussion on Swap Execution Facilities. Our esteemed panelists are:</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span><span>Thomas Pluta, President of Tradeweb;</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>Scott Fitzpatrick, CEO of Tradition SEF; and</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>Adam Lister, Interest Rate Swaps Electronic Trading Product Manager at Bloomberg</span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Tara Kruse will lead our Technical Issues Subcommittee&rsquo;s discussion on its proposed recommendation on Variation Margin Processes in Non-Centrally Cleared Markets. Tara is the Global Head of Infrastructure, Data, and Non-Cleared Margin at ISDA.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Following a brief break, we&rsquo;ll receive an update on global commodity markets from Derek Sammann, Senior Managing Director and Global Head of Commodities, Options &amp; International Markets at CME Group.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Finally, we&rsquo;ll receive a presentation on the CFTC&rsquo;s international engagement from Andrea Musalem, Associate Director of the Commission&rsquo;s Office of International Affairs. We&rsquo;ll close out today&rsquo;s meeting with updates from each of the Subcommittees on ongoing workstreams and future agenda items.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>I&rsquo;m very much looking forward to these timely presentations and the consideration of the latest round of recommendations. Once again, thanks to our speakers and all members for being here and making the GMAC such a success.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The GMAC and the CFTC&rsquo;s Mission</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Today highlights that the CFTC is first and foremost a market regulator, and I&rsquo;m pleased we&rsquo;re getting back to basics with very important presentations and discussion of market characteristics, trading activity, and market fundamentals driving both, as well as capital and margin requirements. I look forward to the insights that will be shared on ways to enhance liquidity in markets, which could be the basis for additional GMAC initiatives. This is the bread and butter of the CFTC&rsquo;s core mission to oversee derivatives markets and ensure they are well-functioning. This doesn&rsquo;t get the headlines, but it is absolutely our day job and I appreciate Chairman Behnam&rsquo;s focus on this. I especially thank the CFTC&rsquo;s Office of International Affairs for their presentation and international leadership. Thank you all.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<div> CDCC, SGC Notes, Canadian Dollar Offered Rate cessation, investment vehicle, money market instruments
<br />
Summary:<br />CDCC launches SGC Notes program to accommodate transition from CDOR and Bankers’ Acceptances, offer investment opportunities in Canadian money markets with strong investor protection. <div>
<p><span>The Canadian Derivatives Clearing Corporation (CDCC), Canada's national central clearing counterparty (CCP) for exchange-traded derivative products and repurchase agreements, today announced the launch of the new Secured General Collateral (SGC) Notes program.</span></p>
<p><span>SGC Notes are short-term discounted money market instruments developed by CDCC in collaboration with Canadian market participants and designed to meet the demand for the transition from Bankers&rsquo; Acceptances (BAs) as a result of the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR) cessation.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;​We are proud to bring this innovative​, customized ​​investment vehicle to market, designed to provide Canada's market participants with an effective funding solution and support the industry transition from CDOR and Bankers&rsquo; Acceptances,​"&nbsp;<strong>said George Kormas, President of CDCC</strong>.​ "​CDCC is grateful for the input of our valued stakeholders ​across Canada&rsquo;s money markets, including both sell and buy side participants​, in the launch of SGC Notes and we look forward to serving their needs as our markets continue to evolve into the future.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>SGC Notes provide an investment policy-friendly opportunity for Canadian money market institutional investors to roll their BA exposure into SGC Notes. SGC Notes are linked to the same highly-rated Canadian bank credit exposure as BAs, but are secured with a basket of high quality debt securities (SGC Securities) which are sold to a trust through repurchase agreements cleared through CDCC.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>SGC Notes represent an attractive investment option relative to available alternatives.</span></p>
<p><span>SGC Notes are designed to provide strong investor protection through active risk management by CDCC of the basket of SGC Securities securing the SGC Notes and to leverage TMX Group&rsquo;s infrastructure, including the recently announced&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.tmx.com%2Fnewsroom%2Fpress-releases%3Fid=1198/1/0102019002405f87-43999f98-e6ce-40fa-a3a9-d5090bd56623-000000/rvtVaflIpdY6crSZ4ofJY_MJ0o8=377" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>Canadian Collateral Management Service (CCMS)</span></a>, which allows for automated collateral movements.</span></p>
<p><span>For more information on the new SGC Notes, please visit&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.cdcc.ca%2Fen%2Fsgc-notes/1/0102019002405f87-43999f98-e6ce-40fa-a3a9-d5090bd56623-000000/0evjN4dvExAx65ubdu6vN8Dl25k=377" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>&nbsp;</span></a><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.cdcc.ca/en/sgc-notes" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.cdcc.ca/en/sgc-notes</a></span>&nbsp;to review the offering memorandum.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>SGC Notes will be issued by a special purpose vehicle formed as an Ontario trust (&ldquo;Trust&rdquo;), of which ComputerShare Trust Company of Canada is trustee and CDCC is promoter, administrative agent, custodian and paying agent.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The SGC Notes will be subscribed for by CIRO investment dealers and Canadian chartered banks that are eligible to clear repurchase transactions relating to SGC Securities through CDCC (the &ldquo;SGC Clearing Members&rdquo;). The SGC Clearing Members will purchase the SGC Notes, as principals, at a discount to face value and may offer the SGC Notes for sale to investors subject to prior sale, if, as and when issued by the Trust and accepted by the SGC Clearing Members on a private placement basis to investors which are &ldquo;accredited investors&rdquo; and &ldquo;permitted clients&rdquo; (other than individuals) as defined in securities legislation in reliance on exemptions from the prospectus requirements of applicable provincial securities laws. The resale of the SGC Notes will be restricted by applicable provincial securities laws.</span></p>
<p><span>The SGC Notes are obligations of the Trust and not obligations of or interests in CDCC, Computershare Trust Company of Canada, any member of the TMX Group, or any SGC Clearing Member. The SGC Notes will represent limited recourse obligations of the Trust. Only the SGC Securities (and other collateral listed in the offering memorandum describing the SBC Notes) will secure payment of the SGC Notes.</span></p>
<p><span>The SGC Notes have not been registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, or the &ldquo;U.S. Securities Act&rdquo; or under the securities laws of any state of the United States, and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to U.S. persons within the meaning of Regulation S under the U.S.&nbsp; Securities Act, or &ldquo;Regulation S&rdquo; unless the securities are registered under the U.S. Securities Act or an exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act is available.</span></p>

<div> Trade surveillance, financial risk solutions, Validus platform, legacy providers, global expansion<br />
Summary:<br />
Eventus' Validus platform sees 25% client base increase, global expansion, high renewal rates, and multiple award wins for trade surveillance excellence. <div>
<p>Eventus, a leading provider of comprehensive, at-scale trade surveillance and financial risk solutions, announced that its Validus platform continues to capture business from firms seeking to move away from legacy trade surveillance providers, with a 25% increase in its client base over the past year. The announcement comes on the heels of another award win for excellence in trade surveillance, further global expansion with the signing of its first South African client &ndash; one of Africa&rsquo;s largest diversified financial groups &ndash; and a continued high renewal rate for existing clients globally. The company now has clients on six continents.</p>
<p>Eventus CEO Travis Schwab said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve never been in a better position as a company. Our retention rates remain close to 100%, we are growing across asset classes and geographies, our platform continues to perform at the highest levels with new functionality rolling out consistently, and we are profitable. We are especially excited about some new clients that include three tier-1 banks all now actively using Validus to meet a range of compliance and regulatory goals. Our existing clients are routinely adding more areas of coverage and our Eventus Services offering to their contracts too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Companies keep turning to us, particularly if they&rsquo;ve had experience with legacy providers, because our sole focus is our clients and the delivery of best-in-class trade surveillance and financial risk solutions, such as algo monitoring. In an extraordinarily competitive landscape, we have what I would argue is more markets and regulatory expertise and a more responsive approach than any provider in the market, along with the unique ability for clients to fully customize the platform and work with our team on solving compliance challenges they are facing in real time. Our experience as market practitioners give us the ability to partner with each and every client &ndash; whether they are a start-up exchange, global trading firm, broker/dealer or tier 1 bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eventus Global Head of Regulatory Affairs Joe Schifano said: &ldquo;For many years, those of us who built surveillance programs for our firms were frustrated with the lack of flexibility in legacy trade surveillance systems. But now, it is even more critical to keep pace with technology as regulators are no longer satisfied with compliance programs that just &lsquo;follow the pack.&rsquo; At Eventus, we offer a &rsquo;buy-to-build&rsquo; solution that clients can tailor and easily scale specific to their risk assessment and data requirements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eventus also announced that it was just named Best Trade Surveillance Solution at the TradingTech Insight USA Awards 2024, based on votes from market participants and the publication&rsquo;s global audience. In March, the company won the same category in the 2024 RegTech insight Awards APAC for its work in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
<p>Schwab said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re honored to see recognition of our hard work and results through votes by so many market participants selecting Validus as Best Trade Surveillance Solution, reflecting our focus on our clients, expert service and constant enhancements to the platform.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Enhancements to the Validus platform this year include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reports and visualizations to help clients ensure accurate and complete data coverage.</li>
<li>Introduction of a first-of-its-kind cross-product spoofing functionality to detect this type of market manipulation in real time for clients engaged in multiple asset classes. This includes a new visualization methodology to review activity across products and new technology that facilitates cross-product review across all accounts and all activity.</li>
<li>New large trader reporter functionality, built for a designated clearing organization (DCO) client and now available to all users.</li>
<li>Enhanced behavioral analytics, including changes in trader profiles identifying potential red flags for rogue trading and account takeovers.</li>
<li>Expanded market data coverage.</li>
<li>Testing of the firm&rsquo;s next-generation platform that enables performance speeds and scale commensurate with growth in the markets and client data requirements.</li>
</ul>

<div> Partnership, Blue Carbon, Investments, Ocean Protection, Mangrove Conservation
<br />
XTCC, Lady Merle, and Logos Capital Group partner to create listed blue carbon investments supporting ocean protection and community benefits. Revolutionizing climate finance.
<br /><br />Summary:
XTCC, Lady Merle, and Logos Capital Group collaborate to create listed blue carbon investments, supporting ocean protection, community benefits, and revolutionizing climate finance. <div>
<ul>
<li><span>Collaboration with Lady Merle Liivand (the Eco Mermaid) and Logos Capital Group to generate liquidity in investments supporting vital ocean protection projects</span></li>
<li><span><em>Brings together the best thought leaders and deep expertise around Blue Carbon</em>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Stock market-listed blue carbon investments help bridge multi-trillion-dollar gap in climate finance</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>XTCC, the investment ecosystem specialising in high-integrity carbon based listed investments, celebrates World Ocean Day with the announcement of a partnership with Lady Merle, the Estonian swimming champion and ocean protection advocate acknowledged globally as the &lsquo;Eco Mermaid&rsquo;, and Silvio Pupo-Casco of Logos Capital Group, to scale</span></p>
<p><span>up investment opportunities and enable global access to this new asset class, providing support for projects including mangrove conservation and transparent fund distribution to adjacent communities.</span></p>
<p><span>Lady Merle and Silvio will work closely with XTCC to identify mangrove and other blue carbon projects that also directly benefit adjacent local communities. XTCC will mobilise Lady Merle&rsquo;s expertise in the science of blue carbon and Silvio&rsquo;s investment network and commitment to driving significant investment capital into more impactful asset classes in the creation of new Blue Carbon investments listed on global stock markets. XTCC creates a bridge between blue carbon projects and<br />the capital markets, enabling an asset class for the Beyond Net Zero world.</span><span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Blue carbon is carbon captured by the world's ocean and coastal ecosystems, including mangroves that can, through sequestration - taking carbon in - provide a natural way of reducing the impact of greenhouse gases on earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. Coastal systems such as mangroves sequester high amounts of carbon quickly and sustainably (over millions of years). In fact, mangroves are ten times more effective at sequestering carbon than any other type of forestry, with a multitude of associated benefits such as clean water, food security, and protection against extreme weather events.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Seth Elliot, XTCC CEO</span>&nbsp;said: &ldquo;To truly move beyond Net Zero, we must combat global warming via significant nature-based project investments in ocean protection. By introducing Blue Carbon based listed investments, we aim to stimulate interest and generate liquidity to support the funding of blue carbon projects, redefine trust in the carbon market, and stimulate climate investments crucial for saving the planet.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Lady Merle said:&nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;Our oceans are the lungs of the world, playing a crucial role in producing oxygen and absorbing carbon dioxide and waste. Thriving mangrove ecosystems not only sustain the natural world but also support and enrich the communities that live alongside. On the negative side, when these important coastal systems are damaged, they emit enormous amounts of carbon into the atmosphere, contributing to climate change. As such, it is essential to protect and conserve mangroves and other coastal habitats, for the benefit of the climate and as importantly, to protect the communities that depend on them to survive and thrive&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Silvio Pupo-Casco, Logos Capital Group said</strong>: "Investing in natural capital and purchasing high-integrity carbon credits can often be complex and opaque. Through our joint venture with XTCC, we aim to simplify and clarify this process, ensuring that investors know exactly what they are getting for their money. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies, we will restore trust in critical natural capital and ecosystem service investments, particularly in the realm of blue carbon." He continued, &ldquo;Our new blue carbon investment instrument is designed to exceed current market standards for transparency and reporting. By setting new benchmarks for accountability and integrity, we are committed to offering unparalleled clarity and reliability in the carbon credit markets. This next-generation investment vehicle is poised to revolutionize global capital markets, driving significant impact in blue finance."</span></p>

<div> Equity Hedge, Event-Driven, Cryptocurrency, Risk Parity, Performance Dispersion
Summary:
- Hedge funds gained in May, led by Equity Hedge and Event-Driven strategies.
- Cryptocurrency and Risk Parity indexes surged.
- Performance dispersion declined in May.
- Equity Hedge funds, driven by Energy and Technology exposures, led gains.
- Interest rate-sensitive strategies also advanced, while Macro strategies posted mixed performance. <div>
<p>Hedge funds gained in May as equities recovered the prior month&rsquo;s decline, and as inflationary pressures remained elevated, but investors positioned for interest rate reductions in 2H24. Led by directional Equity Hedge and Event-Driven strategies, the HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index advanced +1.3 percent in May, with additional positive contributions from Relative Value Arbitrage strategies offsetting a decline in Macro strategies. The HFRI Equity Hedge (Total) Index jumped +2.5 percent for the month, reversing the April decline and marking the fifth gain for this index in the trailing seven months, posting its strongest monthly return since February.</p>
<p>The HFR Cryptocurrency Index surged +13.6 percent in May, while the HFR Risk Parity Vol 15 Index jumped +3.0 percent for the month.</p>
<p>Performance dispersion declined in May, as the top decile of the HFRI FWC constituents advanced by an average of +7.6 percent, while the bottom decile fell by an average of -4.1 percent, representing a top/bottom dispersion of 11.7 percent for the month. By comparison, the top/bottom performance dispersion in April was 14.3 percent. In the trailing 12 months ending May 2024, the top decile of FWC constituents gained +42.9 percent, while the bottom decile declined -7.3 percent, representing a top/bottom dispersion of 50.2 percent. Approximately 70 percent of hedge funds produced positive performance in May.</p>
<p>Equity Hedge (EH) funds, which invest long and short across specialized sub-strategies, led gains in May, driven by advances in Energy and Technology exposures. The HFRI Equity Hedge (Total) Index gained +2.5 percent (estimated) for the month, improving the YTD 2024 return to +6.1 percent. EH sub-strategy gains were led by the HFRI EH: Sector-Energy Index, which surged an estimated +3.6 percent, while the HFRI EH: Sector-Technology Index added +3.2 percent. Other strong contributors in May were the HFRI EH: Multi-Strategy Index and the HFRI EH: Fundamental Value Index, each of which advanced +3.1 percent for the month. Through the first five months of the year, the HFRI EH: Quantitative Directional Index leads EH sub-strategy performance with a YTD return of +8.6 percent.</p>
<p>Event-Driven (ED) strategies, which often focus on out-of-favor, deep value equity exposures and speculation on M&amp;A situations, also advanced in May, driven by Multi-Strategy and Distressed exposures. The HFRI Event-Driven (Total) Index gained +1.6 percent for the month, led by the HFRI ED: Multi-Strategy Index, which jumped +2.35 percent, and the HFRI ED: Distressed Index, which added +1.7 percent for the month.</p>
<p>Fixed income-based, interest rate-sensitive strategies also advanced in May as investors positioned for interest rate cuts in 2H24 despite persistent inflation. The HFRI Relative Value (Total) Index added an estimated +0.6 percent for the month, increasing its YTD 2024 return to +3.3 percent. RVA performance was led by the HFRI RV: Asset Backed Index and HFRI RV: Convertible Arbitrage Index, each of which advanced +0.9 percent for the month.</p>
<p>Macro strategies posted mixed performance in May as interest rates and financial market volatility fell, and as investors positioned for interest rate cuts in 2H24. The HFRI Macro (Total) Index fell -0.65 percent in May, the<sup>&nbsp;</sup>first monthly decline since November 2023. Losses were driven by the HFRI Macro: Systematic Diversified Index, which declined -1.3 percent for the month but remains the leading area of sub-strategy performance over the first five months of the year, with a YTD return of +9.15 percent. Partially offsetting the May declines, the HFRI Macro: Active Trading Index jumped +2.7 percent for the month, bringing its YTD performance to +6.3 percent.</p>
<p>Liquid Alternative UCITS strategies posted gains in May, as the HFRX Global Index advanced +0.6 percent for the month, led by the HFRX Equity Hedge Index, which advanced +1.25 percent, and the HFRX Relative Value Index, which added +0.7 percent. The HFRX Market Directional Index also advanced in May, adding +1.7 percent for the month.</p>
<p>The HFRI Diversity Index advanced an estimated +1.8 percent in May, while the HFRI Women Index gained +1.9 percent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hedge funds posted strong gains in May, reversing April declines, with leadership from directional equity and credit strategies, as investors positioned for continued inflation, ECB and US Federal Reserve rate cuts, and an improving economic growth in 2H24. Uncorrelated Macro hedge funds, the leading strategy area of performance over the first four months of the year, posted its first monthly decline since November as financial market volatility fell in May,&rdquo; stated Kenneth J. Heinz, President of HFR. &ldquo;The primary risks for hedge funds and hedge fund positioning accelerated the shift from macroeconomic risks to geopolitical risks, with these comprising not only ongoing, active military conflicts but also potential for additional conflicts and risks associated with policy changes as a result of major political elections in the coming months. Hedge funds have effectively positioned portfolios in a tactical sense for these highly fluid and uncertain situations, including not only military threats, but possibilities for supply chain disruptions, outright trade embargoes or halts, and destabilizing dislocations and volatility associated with banking and broader financial market operation. Institutions interested in access to opportunities which may be created by this volatility, as well as portfolio protection from these risks, are likely to increase exposure to hedge funds which have demonstrated their strategy&rsquo;s robustness of navigating these building and evolving risks over recent months and years.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>NOTE: May 2024 index performance figures are estimated as of June 7, 2024</i></p>

<title>SEC Charges Three New Yorkers For Raising More Than $184 Million Through Pre-IPO Fraud Schemes - After Commission Shut Down Original Ploy, Defendants Started Another One</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> charged, fraud, unregistered, pre-IPO, SEC
Summary:
SEC charged individuals with fraud for selling unregistered pre-IPO shares, involving high-pressure sales tactics and undisclosed markups. U.S. Attorney's Office also filed charges. Ongoing investigation in the pre-IPO space. SEC prioritizes enforcement in the pre-IPO space, filing charges in various cases. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged three individuals with fraud for selling unregistered membership interests in LLCs that purported to invest in shares of pre-IPO companies, first on behalf of StraightPath Venture Partners LLC, the subject of the Commission&rsquo;s emergency&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-83">action</a>&nbsp;in May 2022, and, later, on behalf of Legend Venture Partners LLC, the subject of the Commission&rsquo;s emergency&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-119">action</a>&nbsp;in June 2023. Both&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr-25429">StraightPath</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr-25772">Legend</a>&nbsp;are now under court-ordered receiverships.</p>
<p>In this new action, the SEC alleges that New York residents Mario Gogliormella, Steven Lacaj, and Karim Ibrahim directed an unregistered sales force of more than 50 callers in boiler rooms to pressure investors into making investments without telling them that the shares had been substantially marked up&mdash;between approximately 19 and 105 percent on average above the prices that StraightPath or Legend had paid for the underlying shares. As a result of these tactics, the defendants and their sales force allegedly pocketed more than $45 million in fees from unsuspecting investors from 2019 to 2022.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We allege that the fraud in this case is like a Hollywood movie where the defendants ran boiler rooms using scripts they referred to as the &lsquo;Bible,&rsquo; engaged in high-pressure sales tactics, and employed outright falsehoods to defraud investors,&rdquo; said Sheldon L. Pollock, Associate Director of the New York Regional Office. &ldquo;After the SEC shut them down the first time, they simply rebranded their outfit, and today through our action we are seeking to ensure that they are held accountable for enticing and lying to investors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint charges the defendants with violating antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws. The complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, return of allegedly ill-gotten gains, and civil penalties. The SEC also charged Adam Ibrahim, Karim Ibrahim&rsquo;s brother, as a relief defendant.</p>
<p>The U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Southern District of New York today unsealed an indictment charging Gogliormella, Lacaj, and Karim Ibrahim with securities fraud, among other offenses, in connection with their work for StraightPath and Legend.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s ongoing investigation is being conducted by Joshua D. Tannen and Lee A. Greenwood of the Asset Management Unit and Sushila P. Rao, Suzanne M. Bettis, Megan Genet, Tiantong Wen, Douglas Smith, Kerri L. Palen, Patricia Schrage, Daniel Loss, Alistaire Bambach, and Steven G. Rawlings of the New York Regional Office. It is being supervised by Mr. Pollock. The litigation will be led by Ms. Rao, Mr. Tannen, and Ms. Bettis and supervised by Mr. Loss and Mr. Pollock.</p>
<p>The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Southern District of New York and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service.</p>

<p>The EACH Co-Chairs&nbsp;Julien Jardelot, Niels Brab and Tim Grange said: &lsquo;We are delighted to the trust European CCP and clearing houses are putting in us by renewing our mandate to represent the EACH community. We aim to increase the understating of how CCPs contribute to robust and more efficient capital markets for the benefit of businesses, investors and the economy as a whole. We welcome the efforts of different European jurisdictions to further diversify funding opportunities by strengthening capital markets and believe CCPs and clearing houses have a key role to play in supporting these efforts&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The EACH Secretary General Rafael Plata said: &lsquo;The next two years are likely crucial to plant the seeds of a new era of capital markets in Europe. Companies, investors and pensioners amongst other are likely to benefit from it. I look forward to continuing working with the capital markets ecosystem to make the dream of deeper and strong capital markets in Europe come true&rsquo;.</p>

<title>A New Class Of Trailblazers, Federal Reserve Governor Lisa D. Cook, At The Girls Global Academy 2024 Commencement Ceremony, Washington, D.C.</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/a-new-class-of-trailblazers-federal-reserve-governor-lisa-d-cook-at-the-girls/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/a-new-class-of-trailblazers-federal-reserve-governor-lisa-d-cook-at-the-girls/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Dr. O'Neal. It is an honor to be here to celebrate with you&mdash;the Girls Global Academy's first-ever graduating class. This is a momentous achievement and occasion. You are making history today! But, of course, you could not have done it alone. So let me start by acknowledging the teachers; administrators, staff, and board members of the Girls Global Academy; and the parents, grandparents, siblings, mentors, and friends who made today possible. Thank you and congratulations on a job well done.</p>
<p>And a very special congratulations to the Girls Global Academy Class of 2024! Soon you will embark on new journeys. I understand that many of you are going on to college in the fall, including one of you heading to my alma mater, Spelman College. (Be sure not to miss the 144th Founders Day celebration next year and the annual Spelman-Morehouse Christmas Carol concert in historic Sisters Chapel.) Others are off to start careers or to pursue vocational training. One of you will enter public service directly and become a member of the U.S. Air Force. That is a lot to be proud of and excited about. Whatever path you take next, I know the education and experience you gained here will guide you.</p>
<p>The Class of 2024 stands out. This is not only because you are the first, but also because you achieved so much all while overcoming extremely challenging circumstances by starting high school during the pandemic. Like you, I know what it is like to be the first to take a path, a path that was not always smooth and predictable. I will tell you more about that shortly.</p>
<p>Four years ago, all of you could have taken a more well-marked route. Instead, you had the courage to enroll at a brand new school during a global pandemic. You learned virtually during your first year. When you were able to attend your school in person for the first time, you did so with masks on, while social distancing. Forging new friendships is always challenging. It is even harder when you cannot sit next to a new classmate at the lunch table. But I know you worked hard to move your learning and your friendships beyond the screens and into real life. Now that those bonds have formed, I hope you hold on to them for many years to come, as I did with my classmates at a women's college.</p>
<p>As the inaugural class of the Girls Global Academy, your list of firsts is long and impressive. You formed the academy's first ever student government. You started a debate team and created cooking and DJ clubs, to name a few. You took the court and field as the first volleyball, basketball, softball, track, and cross-country teams. (I would have gone out for the softball and track teams. I was a catcher on my softball team in junior high and shot put was my event on the track team in high school.)</p>
<p>Everything was new, and probably a bit scary. Yet, you learned to become outspoken, you took on leadership roles, and you set an example for younger students. Through it all you grew, and you became the remarkable young women you are today.</p>
<p>With all those firsts, I was told that you sometimes call yourselves "the guinea pigs." I get that. However, I would like to offer a different moniker for this group: trailblazers. You bravely went where no one had gone before, and you accomplished great things through difficult challenges. To honor that, I want to tell you about a favorite trailblazer of mine and a girl who looked up to her.</p>
<p>The trailblazer I am thinking of is Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander. A little more than a century ago, she graduated from high school here in Washington, D.C., less than a mile away from your school. It was then called M Street High School. She went on to earn bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Pennsylvania. During her doctoral studies, she undertook research on the living standards of Black families that were migrating to Philadelphia during World War I. After completing that work, she became the second African American woman ever to earn a PhD and the first African American to earn a PhD in economics.</p>
<p>But in the 1920s, Dr. Alexander was actively denied entry into the economics profession on the basis of her race and sex. Some might have been crushed and deterred by the impediment. Not Dr. Alexander. Instead, she went on to blaze another trail. She became the first African American woman to earn a law degree from the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Alexander was also the first African American woman to pass the bar and practice law in the state of Pennsylvania. She continued to think and write about economic issues in her legal work and public service. She went on to be a top attorney for the city of Philadelphia and served the public in many other ways, including being asked by two U.S. presidents to serve on important committees.</p>
<p>Dr. Alexander was also the first national president of Delta Sigma Theta, a public service sorority. My mother helped to start a Delta Sigma Theta chapter at Georgia College and State University. That is how I first learned about Dr. Alexander. In fact, when I was in seventh grade, I entered my county social science fair with a project inspired by her work: identifying the major causes of unemployment among Black Americans. I did not realize it then, but that turned out to be my first foray into economic research, which became the cornerstone of my career.</p>
<p>It was helpful to have trailblazers to look up to, including Dr. Alexander, but also my aunts, uncles, parents, and other relatives and family friends who played important roles in the Civil Rights Movement. They instilled in me the confidence to blaze trails of my own. I was among the first African American students to desegregate one of the schools I attended in my hometown of Milledgeville, Georgia. Although some of the students and others in the community did not welcome us, I drew strength from the example set by my family and others in the Civil Rights Movement, and from their conviction in the hope and promise of a world that could and would continually improve.</p>
<p>While I had an interest in economics even before I entered high school, that profession was not the first path I choose. I started Spelman as a physics and philosophy major. It was not until after my undergraduate years, when I was literally on a trail&mdash;one climbing Mount Kilimanjaro&mdash;that I discovered economics was the path for me. I was hiking alongside a British economist. By the end of that journey, he had convinced me that studying economics would provide me the tools to address some big and important questions I had pondered for a long time&mdash;as far back as when Dr. Alexander inspired my submission to the county social science fair.</p>
<p>Following in her footsteps, I went on to earn my PhD in economics from the University of California, Berkeley. The path of an economist led me many places, including to Moscow to research banking in pre- and post-Soviet Russia and to the White House as an economist for President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers. In 2022, President Biden nominated me to serve on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. I am proud to say that I am the first African American woman and first woman of color to serve on the Board of Governors, a body that makes decisions affecting the entire economy and the well-being of every American.</p>
<p>I hope that my story, and Dr. Alexander's story, might inspire you to see that even when you encounter roadblocks, you can chart your own path and achieve great things. I know you can do that, because you established a strong foundation here at the Girls Global Academy, starting with the four pillars of sisterhood, scholarship, service, and safety.</p>
<p>I can see you have the spirit of sisterhood today as you celebrate all your achievements. You established a sisterhood as the first Girls Global Academy alumnae, and you also joined a broader sisterhood of strong, courageous, trailblazing women. You are scholars, earning your diploma and going on to college and onto various career paths. You worked in service to your community by each completing at least 50 service hours. The scholarship and service pillars show that you are already like Dr. Alexander, who highly valued education and used her education to improve the world. And you certainly learned the importance of safety as you started high school in the pandemic&mdash;and the importance of creating a safe environment of belonging where you can learn, be challenged, and grow, while comfortably being yourself. Holding these four pillars close will serve you well as you take the next step in your journeys.</p>
<p>As I conclude, I would like to thank you for allowing me to add another first&mdash;the first Girls Global Academy commencement speaker. I am deeply humbled by this honor. Once again, congratulations to the very first Girls Global Academy graduating class&mdash;the Class of 2024! We are all so proud of you and cannot wait to see what you will do.</p>

<title>NGX Launches New USSD To Enhance Capital Market Access</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ngx-launches-new-ussd-to-enhance-capital-market-access/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ngx-launches-new-ussd-to-enhance-capital-market-access/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Nigerian Exchange (NGX) Limited has urged investors to leverage on its new USSD platform for enhanced capital market access.</p>
<p>NGX stated this at its Investor Education Series, partnered with Meristem via a zoom meeting held on Thursday, June 6, 2024 with the theme, &lsquo;Unlocking Potential: Leveraging USSD For Enhanced Capital Market Access&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Speaking at the event, Head, Trading &amp; Products of NGX, Abimbola Babalola stated that the NGX USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) platform is a technology that allows mobile phone users to access a variety of services by dialing a short code (*5474#) on their phone keypad, saying that the NGX USSD platform is a new and innovative way for investors to access real-time stock market information and connect with a stockbroker.</p>
<p>According to him, the product is designed to boost financial inclusion and market participation in Nigeria by providing investors easy access to price information of listed companies and connecting them with Trading License Holders.</p>
<p>He further said that &ldquo;what we are doing at the exchange is to put investors at the driver&rsquo;s seat of their investment. Gone are those days when you buy securities and you go to sleep, or you have to start reading the newspaper or wait for news to know what is happening to the stocks. So, this time around, you have a device that you can use to monitor your stock at any time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Babalola added that investors' education is key, and this is what the products will address.</p>
<p>The Head, Investment Advisory at Meristem Stockbrokers Limited, Temitope Oludimu said that Meristem Securities has been in the industry for over two decades, growing her clients&rsquo; wealth and enhancing their financial wellbeing.</p>
<p>She noted that the Stockbrokers subsidiary of the Group provides easy access to online brokerage accounts allowing clients to monitor trades in real-time via MeriTrade and the first online stock trading platform in Nigeria commenced in 2014.</p>
<p>Oludimu added that &ldquo;MeriTrade allows users to buy and sell stocks online through the Nigerian Stock Exchange from the comfort of their home, office, car and even on the go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The platform defines stock broking in an entirely different language and creates a world class experience, bringing your broker (electronically) to the comfort of your home and office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The panel session speaking on the theme for the event emphasized the importance of investors' education in the capital market.</p>
<p>Afeez Ramoni, Head, Data and Digital Innovation, NGX stated that the public can now conveniently receive market information and commence account opening processes through their mobile phones by dialing *5474#. This marks a significant stride in NGX&rsquo;s commitment to democratizing access to investment opportunities and promoting retail investors participation through digital channels for accessing the capital market.</p>
<p>He anticipates that the USSD short code *5474# will enhance market accessibility and contribute significantly to the broader financial inclusion landscape in Nigeria.</p>
<p>Martha Ibrahim of NGX Group said that financial inclusion is really about inclusivity and creating access to financial services to investors.</p>
<p>She stated that this is really important for a vibrant capital market and also the country&rsquo;s economic development in general.</p>
<p>According to her, with the coming up of this initiative, integrating USSD with NGX, we also understand the importance of technology as a key financial enabler for financial inclusion. We are simplifying access to the stock markets and reducing barriers to entry. This would also promote a significant increase in the level of financial inclusion we have currently within the capital markets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By leveraging on this investor education and simplifying access to the markets, this validates that NGX is on the right step towards driving financial inclusion within the Nigerian capital markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Also, Oluwatobi Adesanya of Meristem added that &ldquo;we cannot overemphasize the need for financial literacy in the Nigerian capital market.&rdquo;</p>
