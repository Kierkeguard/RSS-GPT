<div> open source, regulatory reporting, collaboration, financial institutions, industry-wide collaboration
Summary:
REGnosys contributes language for regulatory reporting to FINOS, enabling industry-wide collaboration. Rune supports ISDA's DRR and CDM, with support from financial institutions and DTCC. <div>
<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://regnosys.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">REGnosys</a>, the collaboration platform for regulatory reporting, has successfully contributed the language underpinning its digital regulatory reporting solution to the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.finos.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Fintech Open Source Foundation (FINOS)</a>, the financial services umbrella of the Linux Foundation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The language &ndash; formerly known as the Rosetta DSL (Domain-Specific Language) and renamed the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://github.com/finos/rune-dsl" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Rune DSL</a>&nbsp;&ndash; is now available under the FINOS open source governance, enabling members to contribute, test and share regulatory logic in a system- and technology-agnostic way. The language integrates seamlessly with REGnosys&rsquo;s award-winning data-modelling platform, Rosetta, which is also made available under a&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://ui.rosetta-technology.io/login" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">free version</a>&nbsp;to the community. This contribution further advances REGnosys&rsquo;s mission to build the future of data and reporting for financial markets through industry-wide collaboration &ndash; a goal that aligns with FINOS&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.finos.org/open-regtech" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Open RegTech</a>&nbsp;initiative.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rune&nbsp;has been deployed for production implementations of regulatory reporting under ISDA&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.isda.org/2023/04/04/drr-infohub" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Digital Regulatory Reporting</a>&nbsp;(DRR) programme. The ISDA DRR leverages another FINOS project, the​​​<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.finos.org/common-domain-model" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Common Domain Model (CDM)</a>​, to express global trade reporting rules as open-access, unambiguous, machine-executable code using the Rune language.&nbsp;The CDM &ndash; an open-source data standard for financial products, trades and lifecycle events developed by the FINOS community &ndash; is also supported in Rune.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Several financial institutions and market infrastructure firms have championed these Rune-powered collaboration projects as critical for operational efficiency and resilience. In November 2022, BNP Paribas&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.isda.org/2022/11/02/isda-and-bnp-paribas-successfully-test-digital-regulatory-reporting-for-cftc-rules" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a>&nbsp;that it had successfully implemented ISDA&rsquo;s DRR for trade reporting under the US CFTC Rewrite. Global financial institutions including J.P. Morgan Chase and Standard Chartered are also​<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.isda.org/2023/04/04/drr-infohub/#implement" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">supporting</a>​its ongoing development. In April this year, DTCC and REGnosys&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.dtcc.com/news/2024/april/10/dtcc-collaborates-with-regnosys-to-support-isda-digital-regulatory-reporting" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a>&nbsp;their collaboration to support ISDA&rsquo;s DRR. REGnosys connected its Rosetta platform to DTCC&rsquo;s Global Trade Repository, the industry leader in trade reporting, to enable the reliable testing of trade reporting submissions generated using the ISDA DRR in support of evolving trade reporting requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Leo Labeis, Founder and CEO at REGnosys, said:&nbsp;</b>&ldquo;From the outset, our vision has been to create a regulatory reporting solution that is built for the industry and by the industry. In a year of sea change within global regulatory reporting, with six major&nbsp;jurisdictions&nbsp;updating their trade reporting rules, the contribution of Rune to FINOS reinforces our&nbsp;commitment to community-driven compliance through modern, open-source initiatives.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Thomas Louis, GM CDO and Head of Regulatory &amp; Surveillance technology platform at BNP Paribas said:</b>&nbsp;&ldquo;BNP Paribas has been at the forefront of the development of CDM and its application to ISDA&rsquo;s DRR for several years, and welcomes the step taken by REGnosys to open source a critical supporting component of these projects. Having a language to co-develop regulatory code between market participants allows us to build compliance assurance at industry level.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Eleanor Kelly, Global Head of Markets Regulatory Change and Control at J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co, stated</b>: &ldquo;Ensuring we adhere to the highest standard of data quality and control in our regulatory reporting is of critical importance for J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. Being able to express all of our data requirements&rsquo; best practice into code and through industry consensus is a very effective way to achieve operational excellence and we recognise the benefits that open-source technology such as that contributed by REGnosys and FINOS offers to facilitate this.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Syed Ali,&nbsp;Managing Director of Repository &amp; Derivatives Services (RDS)</b><b>&nbsp;</b><b>at DTCC, stated</b>: &ldquo;DTCC remains committed to helping the industry achieve complete, accurate and timely derivatives trade regulatory reporting. By leveraging open-source, standardised and machine-readable logic, with capabilities that evolve as regulatory requirements evolve, firms are better placed to achieve compliance. We are pleased to be working with REGnosys and FINOS as we collectively champion operational efficiency and data accuracy in the derivatives trade reporting space.&rdquo;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Scott O&rsquo;Malia, Chief Executive of ISDA, said:</b>&nbsp;&ldquo;The ISDA DRR allows firms to implement new reporting requirements cost-effectively and accurately, reducing the risk of regulatory penalties for misreported data. We support all efforts to facilitate adoption of the ISDA DRR and CDM, so welcome the contribution of Rune as open source on FINOS.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Jane Gavronsky, Chief Operating Officer</b>&nbsp;<b>at FINOS, said:&nbsp;</b>&ldquo;We are excited to welcome Rune to the FINOS portfolio of open source and open standards projects. Regulatory reporting is one of the biggest challenges facing financial institutions today and FINOS's Open RegTech initiative brings the industry together to mutualize the creation of innovative solutions in an area ripe for open source disruption. Based on Rune's success, we look forward to its continued potential to enable the industry goal of more efficient compliance.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<title>ICE To Launch Treasury Clearing Service To Increase Transparency And Enhance Resilience In The U.S. Treasury Market</title>

<div> clearing, ICE, U.S. Treasury securities, SEC, market

ICE to launch clearing service for U.S. Treasury securities and repurchasing agreements. Leveraging expertise, separate from CDS clearing.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE: ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today announced it will leverage its proven track record and expertise in central clearing and the fixed income market to launch a clearing service for all U.S. Treasury securities and repurchasing agreements. This follows the recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-247" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">announcement</a>&nbsp;by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) mandating for the expansion of U.S. Treasury securities clearing to enhance resilience in the market.</p>
<p>ICE operates many of the largest clearing houses globally and brings decades of experience in clearing products ranging from interest rates, energy, agricultural and equity derivative futures and options, as well as credit derivatives.</p>
<p>The new Treasury clearing service will leverage ICE&rsquo;s existing clearing house, ICE Clear Credit, which is the leading global clearing house for credit default swaps (CDS). The Treasury clearing service will be established as a distinct offering from the current CDS clearing service, and will have a separate rulebook, membership, risk management framework, financial and liquidity resources, and risk committee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over the last fifteen years, ICE Clear Credit has become the leading global clearing house for credit derivatives, and we believe it is strategically positioned to offer Treasury clearing services that will promote competition and help facilitate the SEC&rsquo;s policy objective of bringing increased transparency and standardized risk management to the Treasury securities market,&rdquo; said Stan Ivanov, President of ICE Clear Credit. &ldquo;The rich experience we&rsquo;ve developed creating and operating ICE Clear Credit and the work we&rsquo;ve done to ensure its compliance with all U.S. and foreign regulatory regimes has created a fertile environment for adding Treasury clearing to our suite of credit clearing services.&rdquo;</p>
<p>ICE Clear Credit was founded during the financial crisis in 2009 to bring confidence and stability to the CDS market. Since then, it has become the leading global clearing house for credit derivatives, including Single Name and Index CDS instruments, and options on index CDS. ICE Clear Credit offers clearing for more than 650 Single Name and Index CDS instruments referencing corporate and sovereign debt, and has reduced counterparty risk exposure by clearing approximately $200 trillion in two-sided notional amount, with open interest of over $1.75 trillion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The history of ICE Clear Credit and the way the team at ICE identified a market need that could benefit from modernization is the core of who we are as a company,&rdquo; said Chris Edmonds, President of ICE&rsquo;s Fixed Income and Data Services. &ldquo;As we look to add Treasury clearing to the breadth of services we offer for fixed income markets, we will leverage the successful playbook we developed in the past to offer an industry-trusted clearing solution along with the front-, middle- and back-office workflows our customers rely on to manage their daily business operations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As an SEC-registered Securities Clearing Agency, ICE Clear Credit has years of experience navigating and complying with complex regulatory requirements. Additionally, ICE Clear Credit is designated as a systemically important financial market utility (SIFMU) by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, and deemed a qualified central counterparty (QCCP) under U.S. bank capital rules.</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Takes Action Against Three Individuals From SVS Securities For Mistreatment Of Pension Funds</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: FCA, SVS Securities Plc, ban, fine, reckless behavior<br />
<br />
Summary: The FCA banned and fined three individuals for reckless behavior in managing SVS Securities Plc, resulting in customer losses and breach of rules.<br /> <div>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffcc99;">Demetrios Hadjigeorgiou and David Stephen have referred their Decision Notices to the Upper Tribunal where they will each present their respective cases. Any findings in these individuals&rsquo; Decision Notices and the descriptions of those findings in this press release are therefore provisional and reflect the FCA&rsquo;s belief as to what occurred and how it considers their behaviour is to be characterised.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffcc99;">Kulvir Virk has not referred the FCA&rsquo;s decision to the Upper Tribunal and his Final Notice has not been the subject of any judicial finding. To the extent that Kulvir Virk&rsquo;s Final Notice contains criticisms of Demetrios Hadjigeorgiou and David Stephen, they have received Decision Notices which set these out. They dispute many of the facts and any characterisation of their actions in Kulvir Virk&rsquo;s Final Notice and have referred their Decision Notices to the Upper Tribunal for determination. The Tribunal's decision in respect of the individuals' references will be made public on its website.</span></p>
<p>The FCA has decided to ban and fine 3 individuals who were involved in running SVS Securities Plc (SVS), a discretionary fund manager.</p>
<p>SVS managed investments held on behalf of its customers. Under FCA rules, the firm was required to act in the best interests of its customers and not let conflicts of interests interfere with its obligations to them.</p>
<p>Kulvir Virk, the former CEO and majority shareholder, recklessly caused SVS to use a complex business model intended to maximise the flow of customer funds into high-risk illiquid bonds. These bonds were operated by directors of SVS and a close business associate of Mr Virk. The model involved inducements to SVS and unauthorised introducers with undisclosed commissions of up to 12% of the customers&rsquo; investments. The model created systematic conflicts of interests and inappropriately prioritised income to SVS over the best interests of customers.</p>
<p>879 customers paid in a total of &pound;69.1m. Bonds into which they were invested by SVS have since defaulted, with customers unlikely to receive more than a fraction of their investment back.</p>
<p>In the FCA&rsquo;s view, as Head of Compliance, David Stephen failed to fulfil his responsibilities to ensure SVS was following the rules. Demetrios Hadjigeorgiou, SVS&rsquo;s former finance director then CEO, also failed to fulfil his responsibilities to manage conflicts of interest and ensure proper due diligence was carried out.</p>
<p>The FCA has found that the 3 individuals acted recklessly in deciding to mark-down customers&rsquo; valuations when they disinvested from fixed income assets, with the result that SVS kept 10% of customer funds. This allowed them to generate &pound;359,800 in income for SVS at the expense of its customers.</p>
<p>The FCA has decided to fine Mr Virk, &pound;215,500; Mr Hadjigeorgiou, &pound;84,600; and Mr Stephen, &pound;52,100. The FCA has banned Mr Virk from working in financial services, and decided to ban Mr Hadjigeorgiou and Mr Stephen from holding senior management roles.</p>
<p><span>Therese Chambers, Joint Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight, said</span>:</p>
<p>'These three individuals and SVS were a central part of a tangled web which concealed the fact that customers&rsquo; pension money was being invested into high-risk bonds. Customers were entitled to trust that SVS would act in their best interests, but it repeatedly prioritised income for itself and its associates.</p>
<p>'The actions of those in charge threatened the ability of their customers to enjoy a secure and comfortable retirement. This kind of behaviour has life-changing consequences for consumers.'</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Central Bank of Italy, International Journal of Central Banking, conference, monetary policy, academic research
Summary: Central Bank of Italy hosts International Journal of Central Banking conference on post-pandemic monetary policy with academic research and distinguished scholars. <div>
<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-md-8">
<p>Thank you, Stefano, and thank you to the Central Bank of Italy (CBI) for hosting this year's conference.</p>
<p>When it is in the news, central banking often looks like the work of individual policymakers handing down their decisions. In fact, it is a team effort of many people working together, and that is also the case for editing the&nbsp;<em>International Journal of Central Banking</em>&nbsp;(IJCB) and planning this conference. I have a long list of people to thank who did the lion's share of that work during the year that I have served as managing editor. But for those who may not know it, let me first review the history of the journal and then discuss what this conference will address.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2004, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the European Central Bank, and the Group of Ten central banks agreed to support the development of a new publication focused on the theory and practice of central banking. We didn't launch this journal because there was a shortage of research on central banking or of journals eager to publish it. Far from it. Central bankers themselves continue to publish peer-reviewed research in leading journals, not to mention many working papers published by central banks and other outlets. This work was prevalent, but there was a sense that there lacked a place for scholarly research that focused exclusively on central banking and could serve as a forum for the community of central bankers around the world. The creation of the International Journal of Central Banking filled this deficit.</p>
<p>The primary objectives of the IJCB are to widely disseminate the best policy-relevant and applied research on central banking and to promote communication among researchers inside and outside central banks. We do this with publication of the journal, which will now be coming out six times a year, and with the added attention of this conference, which presents research on timely policy topics. The journal has attracted distinguished managing editors, including my colleagues from the Federal Reserve and my immediate predecessor, Luc Laeven from the European Central Bank. We have the strong support now of nearly 55 sponsoring institutions, including the Central Bank of Italy and also the host of last year's conference, the Central Bank of Ireland.</p>
<p>In 2023, we chose the theme for this year's conference based on events very much on the minds of central bankers: "The Transmission of Monetary Policy in the Post-Pandemic World." Many things changed both during COVID and after. First, there was an unprecedented fiscal and monetary policy response to the pandemic. Second, structural changes have occurred, including supply chain issues and shifts in the organization of work. Finally, economies have been grappling with elevated inflation. This economic environment has raised several policy questions that the papers presented here attempt to answer. These are questions that policymakers, including those here today, must grapple with, even when the answers are far from apparent. Academic research provides insights into these questions and possible answers, ways to analyze the data, and the foundations for testing theories with economic models.</p>
<p>The papers presented here today and tomorrow are ideal examples of the kind of work that can help policymakers do their jobs better, and can facilitate the sharing of knowledge around the world. We have sessions on how firms' balance sheets, households' savings and borrowing decisions, as well as supply chains, influence monetary policy transmission. We also will look into financial market impacts and labor market considerations of the current policy environment.</p>
<p>Before we get to those presentations, and what I hope will be vigorous discussions, let me recognize several people who made this event possible. Here at the CBI, Stefano and Enrico Sette helped organize this conference. Enrico is a co-editor of the IJCB. Let me mention the other co-editors: Ana Babus, Diana Bonfim, Huberto Ennis, Carlos Garriga, Refet G&uuml;rkaynak, &Ograve;scar Jord&agrave;, Robin Lumsdaine, Fernanda Nechio, and Steven Ongena. This conference and the day-to-day smooth running of the journal couldn't be accomplished without the editorial team at the BIS and the Board of Governors. A special thank you goes to Kommaly Dias and Jessica Flagg from my staff. And, finally, a big thank you to my adviser Jane Ihrig, who does so much for me and who worked to oversee the process at the IJCB this past year.</p>
<p>And with that, I will step away from the microphone and put the spotlight where it should be, on the scholars presenting their work today. Thank you, and I believe [Enrico] has a few words to get us started.</p>

<p>Leveraging Mosaic&rsquo;s cutting edge AI and machine learning technology, Smart Markets has been developed by Mosaic&rsquo;s expert data scientists in response to the demand from institutions such as banks, central banks, debt management offices (DMOs), corporate treasurers and buy-side trading firms and hedge funds for increasingly sophisticated datadriven insights.</p>
<p>Demand for market data from financial institutions is booming with the market growing&nbsp;12.4% in 2023 to a record $42.0 billion.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Data quality and the ability to interpret big data has become increasingly critical. Smart Markets answers this call by bringing together raw data from market sources such as Euroclear, which is then enriched, normalised and automatically analysed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The result for FICC market participants is access to a highly intuitive, multi-asset service that unlocks new depths of understanding in the markets and products that are important to them. This enables them to enhance their trading models, build informed market strategies, strengthen their investment and research intelligence and improve post-trade analysis and reporting.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Robert Balch, Head of Fixed Income EMEA at SMBC Nikko Capital Markets said: </b>&ldquo;Smart Markets provides the building blocks for widespread understanding of market intelligence and liquidity, driving improvements in our ability to service clients in a hyper-personalised way. As a client of Mosaic&rsquo;s credit analytics service, we have been a willing participant in this trial and welcome Mosaic&rsquo;s effort to bring much needed transparency to the market.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Philippe Laurensy, Global Head Product Expansion and Strategy</b> <b>at Euroclear SA, said: </b>&ldquo;By harnessing the scale and depth of Euroclear&rsquo;s post trade ecosystem, which in 2022 settled the equivalent of EUR 992 trillion in securities transactions, Smart Markets is able to provide trading firms with a true picture of fixed income activity including government and corporate bond markets. As a financial market infrastructure with a track record of providing high quality settlement services to the world&rsquo;s leading financial institutions, we are well positioned to drive innovation in the industry and to improve efficiency in the market as a whole.&rdquo;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities, MSMS, MUBK, FSA, administrative action <br />
Summary:<br /> 
FSA took administrative actions against MUMSS, MSMS, and MUBK for violations, including sharing non-public client information and unfair trading. Requests for improvement and reports were also made. <div>
<p class="indent">Today, the Financial Services Agency (hereinafter "FSA") took administrative actions against Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co., Ltd. (Chiyoda City, Tokyo; corporate number: 4010001129098; hereinafter &ldquo;MUMSS&rdquo;), Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities Co., Ltd. (Chiyoda City, Tokyo; corporate number: 2011001046046; hereinafter &ldquo;MSMS&rdquo;), and MUFG Bank, Ltd. (Chiyoda City, Tokyo; corporate number: 5010001008846; hereinafter &ldquo;MUBK&rdquo;), as described in I. below. In addition, the FSA asked to submit reports as described in II. below to MUBK and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. (Chiyoda City, Tokyo; corporate number: 4010001073486; hereinafter &ldquo;MUFG&rdquo;).</p>
<h2>I. Administrative action against MUMSS, MSMS and MUBK</h2>
<h3><strong><span>1. Reasons for the administrative action</span></strong></h3>
<div>
<p class="indent">As a result of conducting an on-site inspection of MUMSS, MSMS and MUBK, the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission (hereinafter "SESC") made a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsa.go.jp/sesc/english/news/reco/20240614-2.html" target="_blank">recommendation<span class="icon-blank"><img alt="open new window" src="https://www.fsa.go.jp/images/common/icon_newwin.gif" /></span></a>&nbsp;for taking an administrative action on June 14, 2024, based on the findings of the following violations of laws and regulations, etc.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="indent">The Financial Instruments and Exchange Act (hereinafter &ldquo;FIEA&rdquo;) prohibits a Financial Instruments Business Operator from providing and/or receiving non-public client information among financial firms within the group, without the consent of clients. Nevertheless, the above three firms repeatedly shared non-public client information, knowing that their clients asked not to share their information with other firms within the group, and some of the information contained material information that would impact investment decisions. These findings led to the conclusion that the three firms had deficiencies in internal control environment for the management of information. (The SESC also found that one employee of MUBK had engaged in unfair trading in violation of the FIEA due to these deficiencies.)</p>
<p class="indent">Furthermore, the FIEA prohibits a Financial Instruments Business Operator from soliciting the financial instruments transaction contract by using non-public information without the consent of their clients. The SESC found, however, that a board member of MUMSS had received confidential information of their clients from an executive officer of MUBK, and MUMSS, together with MSMS, used the information for solicitation of offer to sell financial instruments to their clients.</p>
<p class="indent">Lastly, the FIEA prohibits a bank from conducting Securities-Related Business (underwriting business). Nevertheless, MUBK repeatedly negotiated for the underwriting shares on behalf of MUMSS. Among such cases, it was found that MUBK had engaged in a tie-in negotiation, asking for more underwriting shares of MUMSS as a condition of MUBK&rsquo;s loan agreement.</p>
</div>
<h3><span>2. Content of the orders</span></h3>
<h4><span>2-1. MUMSS</span></h4>

<div> extend, comment period, proposal, Fedwire Funds Service, National Settlement Service
Summary:
The Federal Reserve Board extends the comment period for its proposal to expand the operating days of Fedwire Funds Service and NSS. The proposal aims to operate these services every day of the year, with the same operating hours. The proposal does not include changes to the Fedwire Securities Service or the FedNow Service. <div>
<p>The Federal Reserve Board on Friday announced that it will extend until September 6, 2024, the comment period on its proposal to expand the operating days of the Federal Reserve Banks' two large-value payments services, Fedwire<span>&reg;</span>&nbsp;Funds Service and the National Settlement Service (NSS), to include weekends and holidays. The Board extended the comment period to allow the public more time to analyze the proposal and prepare their comments. Comments on the proposal were originally due by July 8, 2024.</p>
<p>Currently, both the Fedwire Funds Service and the NSS operate Monday through Friday, excluding holidays. Under the proposal, both services would operate every day of the year. The operating hours each day would remain the same, with the Fedwire Funds Service open 22 hours per day, and NSS open 21.5 hours per day.</p>
<p>The Fedwire Funds Service is a wholesale payment service that allows service participants to send and receive individual electronic funds transfers up to $10 billion. The NSS is a settlement service for participants in private-sector clearing arrangements, such as check clearinghouses, a private-sector automated clearinghouse network, and securities settlement systems. The proposal does not include changes to the Fedwire Securities Service or the Federal Reserve's new retail service for instant payments, the FedNow<span>&reg;</span>&nbsp;Service.</p>

<title>Acting US Comptroller Of The Currency Issues Statement On FDIC Industrial Loan Company Application</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael J. Hsu issued the following statement at yesterday&rsquo;s Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) board meeting regarding the application from Thrivent Financial for federal deposit insurance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I support the deposit insurance application for a proposed industrial bank to be owned by Thrivent Financial for Lutherans (Thrivent Financial). Thrivent Financial, a $113 billion company, and its subsidiaries offer nationwide financial and investment advice, trust services, and investment and insurance products. In addition, Thrivent Financial proposes to merge Thrivent Financial Credit Union, a $832 million federally chartered credit union, into the proposed industrial bank.</em></p>
<p><em>The proposed industrial bank and combined entity would broaden Thrivent Financial&rsquo;s reach within the general population and attract new clients beyond the credit union&rsquo;s restricted field of membership and capital growth limitations. Merging the credit union into the industrial bank would establish the bank&rsquo;s foundation, providing infrastructure, comprehensive product and service offerings, established risk and compliance practices, and experienced personnel. Pursuant to a master servicing agreement, the bank would leverage certain resources available through its affiliates&rsquo; existing infrastructure.</em></p>
<p><em>The proposed bank would look a lot like a community bank. The organizers have developed a comprehensive and diverse business plan outlining an operating strategy that is supported by reasonable financial projections. The bank would be sufficiently capitalized, and Thrivent Financial would execute a capital and liquidity management agreement to serve as a source of financial strength to the Bank. In the event of financial stress or failure at its parent, the bank would retain franchise value mitigating risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund. For these reasons and considering the statutory factors, I support the deposit insurance application submitted by Thrivent Financial. I also support the merger application filed to merge Thrivent Financial Credit Union into the industrial bank.</em></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael J. Hsu issued the following statement at yesterday's Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) board meeting regarding the creation of the Office of Professional Conduct and the Office of Equal Employment Opportunity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I strongly support the creation of the Office of Professional Conduct (OPC) and the Office of Equal Employment Opportunity (OEEO).</em></p>
<p><em>The employees of the FDIC need and deserve a safe and inclusive workplace. For far too long, however, the fear of retaliation and a confusing, ineffective complaints process have prevented that. Such fear and confusion led to underreporting, a lack of accountability, and space for wrongdoers to perpetuate the old boys&rsquo; club.</em></p>
<p><em>As the Cleary Report notes, fixing this requires cultural and structural transformation. Replacing the agency&rsquo;s broken internal processes with the OPC and OEEO is a critical step in that transformation.</em></p>
<p><em>The OPC would serve as a single point of entry to intake, investigate with the support from third parties, report, determine discipline, and represent the FDIC in any challenges to that discipline regarding complaints of harassment and other interpersonal misconduct or complaints of retaliation for reporting such harassment or misconduct. The OEEO would manage the agency&rsquo;s Equal Employment Opportunity Program and serve as a single point of entry to intake, investigate with the support from third parties, process, and report about complaints of discrimination. Each office would be led by a Director, who would be a new Officer of the FDIC. The offices and their Directors would report directly to the Board of Directors to ensure accountability and mitigate the risk of retaliation by supervisors. The investigations conducted by the OPC and OEEO would be supported by third-party investigators to ensure independence and expertise.</em></p>
<p><em>The creation of these offices is an important step in protecting the employees of the FDIC and earning back their trust. I strongly support this action.</em></p>

<title>US Federal Agencies Announce Results Of Resolution Plan Review For Largest And Most Complex Banks</title>

<div> submissions, weakness, resolution, deficiency, feedback
Summary:<br />FDIC and Federal Reserve identified weaknesses in resolution plans from four major banks, outlining required remedial actions and areas for development. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Federal Reserve Board today announced that, following their joint review of the July 2023 resolution plan submissions of the eight largest and most complex banks, they identified a weakness in the plans from Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan Chase. The agencies did not identify any weaknesses in the plans from the other banks.</p>
<p>Resolution plans, also known as living wills, must describe a bank's strategy for orderly resolution in bankruptcy in the event of its material financial distress or failure. The agencies have jointly determined that each weakness identified in the 2023 plans from Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan Chase is a "shortcoming." A shortcoming is a weakness that raises questions about the feasibility of the plan.</p>
<p>The agencies jointly identified a weakness in the 2023 plan submitted by Citigroup, but reached different conclusions on its severity. The FDIC determined that the Citigroup plan is not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and considers the weakness to be a "deficiency." A deficiency is a weakness that could undermine the feasibility of the plan. The Board concluded that the weakness is only a shortcoming. Under the resolution planning rule of the agencies, when one agency finds a shortcoming in a resolution plan and the other agency finds a deficiency, the plan is deemed to have a shortcoming. As a result, Citigroup's 2023 plan is considered to have a shortcoming. The agencies also previously identified a shortcoming in Citigroup's 2021 plan related to data quality and data management, and that shortcoming remains outstanding.</p>
<p>The agencies provided feedback letters to each of the eight banks that identify areas for continued development of banks' resolution strategies and capabilities. For the four banks with an identified shortcoming, the letters describe the specific weaknesses resulting in the shortcoming and the remedial actions required by the agencies. The shortcomings are to be addressed in the next resolution plans due by July 1, 2025. The feedback letters also specify that each bank, in its 2025 resolution plan submission, should address the topics of contingency planning and obtaining foreign government actions necessary to execute the resolution strategy.</p>

<div> Implementing Technical Standards, Basel III, Pillar 3, Disclosure, CRR 3<br />
<br />Summary: The EBA published draft ITS on public disclosures by institutions to implement changes in the Pillar 3 disclosure framework. Requirements align with Basel III. <div>
<ul>
<li><em>Today&rsquo;s publication of draft implementing technical standards is a key milestone in the implementation of the latest Basel III disclosure reforms laid down in the new Banking Package.</em></li>
<li><em>The new ITS implement the CRR 3 disclosure requirements on output floor, credit risk, market risk, CVA risk, operational risk and a transitional disclosure on exposures to crypto-assets.</em></li>
<li><em>The alignment of the disclosure requirements with the Basel III framework and its integration with supervisory reporting will promote comparability and consistency of the information.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today a final draft implementing technical standards (ITS) on public disclosures by institutions that implement the changes in the Pillar 3 disclosure framework introduced by the amending Regulation (EU) 2024/1623 (CRR 3). These ITS will ensure that market participants have sufficient comparable information to assess the risk profiles of institutions and understand compliance with CRR 3 requirements, further promoting market discipline.</span></p>
<p>The amending Regulation (EU) 2024/1623 (&lsquo;CRR 3&rsquo;) introduced new and amended disclosure requirements stemming from the latest Basel III Pillar 3 reforms, and a mandate for the EBA to develop IT solutions, including templates and instructions, for the disclosure requirements laid down in the banking regulation. The new ITS implement the CRR 3 prudential disclosures by including new requirements on output floor, credit risk, market risk, CVA risk, operational risk and a transitional disclosure on exposures to crypto-assets. In addition, they aim to provide institutions with a comprehensive integrated set of uniform disclosure formats while promoting market discipline.</p>
<p>These ITS constitute the first Pillar 3 deliverable included in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-12/9dc534e8-8a3d-438f-88e3-bc86e623d99e/EBA%20Roadmap%20on%20strengthening%20the%20prudential%20framework_1.pdf">EBA Roadmap on strengthening the prudential framework</a>&nbsp;published in December 2023. Later in 2024, the EBA will complement these ITS with the CRR 3 disclosure requirements that are not directly linked to Basel III implementation, in particular&nbsp; &nbsp;the extension of the disclosure requirements on ESG risks to all institutions in accordance with the proportionality principle, and new disclosure requirements on shadow banking.</p>
<p>Following the mandate for the EBA to develop IT solutions, these ITS are designed to repeal the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/637, with a view to make the technical standards more user-friendly for institutions. The IT solutions according to which disclosures have to be provided, including templates and instructions, can be found on the EBA website.</p>
<p>When developing these ITS, the EBA has sought alignment and integration between the disclosure and reporting frameworks, to facilitate institutions' compliance with both requirements, and an updated mapping tool between the revised disclosure templates and the reporting templates is expected to be published at the beginning of July, together with the new ITS on supervisory reporting for the CRR 3 implementation&nbsp; published for consultation, together with these ITS, in December 2024. The EBA will later publish a technical package, including DPM, validation rules and taxonomy, that shall be used by large and other institutions to submit this information to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/risk-and-data-analysis/reporting-frameworks/reporting-framework-41">EBA Pillar 3 data hub</a>.</p>
<h4>Legal basis and background</h4>
<p>Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (&lsquo;the CRR&rsquo;) as amended by Regulation (EU) 2024/1623 (&lsquo;CRR 3&rsquo;) mandates the EBA, in articles 434a, to develop draft implementing technical standards to specify uniform disclosure formats, and IT solutions, including instructions, for disclosure requirements under Titles II and III of the CRR.</p>
<p>The CRR 3 implements the latest Basel 3 reforms, which strengthen the EU institutions&rsquo; prudential framework, including also the related new and amended disclosure requirements for institutions.</p>
<p>Following article 434a(1), new draft implementing technical standards have been developed that implement the CRR 3 changes to the Pillar 3 disclosure framework and replace the Commission Implementing Regulations (EU) 2021/637. The new ITS caters for possible developments related to the FRTB capital framework.&nbsp;</p>

<title>Bank Of England - Asset Purchase Facility: Gilt Sales – Market Notice 21 June 2024</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/bank-of-england-asset-purchase-facility-gilt-sales-market-notice-21-june-20/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/bank-of-england-asset-purchase-facility-gilt-sales-market-notice-21-june-20/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Schedule, gilts, Asset Purchase Facility, sales, monetary policy<br />
Summary: The Bank of England will reduce the stock of gilts by £100 billion from October 2023 to September 2024 through quarterly auctions.<br /> <div>
<p><span>This Market Notice sets out the schedule for sales in Q3 2024 of gilts held in the Asset Purchase Facility (APF) for monetary policy purposes.</span></p>
<p>At its September 2023 meeting, the MPC voted to reduce the stock of gilts held in the APF for monetary policy purposes by &pound;100 billion over the period from October 2023 to September 2024, to a total of &pound;658 billion.</p>
<p>The Bank set out in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/market-notices/2022/september/apf-gilt-sales-market-notice-1-september-2022">consolidated APF gilt sales Market Notice</a>&nbsp;published on 1 September 2022 that it would publish a quarterly schedule for the sales of gilts held in the APF for monetary policy purposes. The details and schedule for the Q3 2024 sales of such gilts are set out in this Market Notice, which covers the period from 1 July 2024 to the week commencing 30 September 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As set out in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/market-notices/2023/december/apf-gilt-sales-market-notice-15-december-2023">15 December 2023 Market Notice</a>, the Bank will set a schedule of auctions in order to continue to reduce the APF as evenly as possible across maturity sectors, measured in initial proceeds terms. These sectors are defined as gilts with a residual maturity of between: 3-7 years (short), 7-20 years (medium) and over 20 years (long).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Accordingly, in Q3 2024, the Bank will sell short maturity sector bonds across four auctions of &pound;800 million, medium maturity sector bonds across four auctions of &pound;725 million, and long maturity sector bonds across two auctions of &pound;650 million. Further details are outlined in the table below.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As this is the final quarter of the period over which the MPC&rsquo;s &pound;100 billion target set in September 2023 applies, it may be necessary for the Bank to make some adjustment to the sizes of the final three auctions. If any adjustment is required, the Bank will provide the market with advance notice in a similar way to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/market-notices/2023/september/apf-gilt-sales-market-notice-1-sept-2023">Market Notice of 1 September 2023</a>.</p>
<p>Other than as amended in this Market Notice, the detailed operational parameters and participation requirements set out previously will apply to these gilt sales.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Bank will continue to monitor the impact of its gilt sales programme on market conditions, and reserves the right to amend its schedule, including the gilts to be sold and the size of its auctions, or any other aspect of its approach at its sole discretion.</p>
<p>The Bank intends to communicate any future sales schedules for 2024 Q4 or beyond following the MPC&rsquo;s annual review of the reduction in the stock of purchased gilts over the next twelve-month period, which is expected to be announced alongside the MPC meeting on 19 September 2024.&nbsp;</p>

<title>ICE First Look: Mortgage Performance Remains Strong As Delinquencies, Foreclosures Continue To Improve In May</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="bw-subheadline-wrapper">
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li>The national delinquency rate fell 6 basis points (bps) year over year to 3.04% in May; still the second lowest point on record, behind 2.92% in March 2023</li>
<li>A fifth consecutive monthly improvement in serious delinquencies (those loans 90+ days past due, but not yet in active foreclosure) reset what had already been a more than 18-year low</li>
<li>The number of mortgage-holders who&rsquo;ve missed a single payment dropped by -19K, while 60-day delinquencies edged up slightly (+4K) from April</li>
<li>While inflow of borrowers newly 30 days late dropped to a one-year low, those rolling to later stages of delinquency edged higher from April and fewer delinquent loans cured to current status</li>
<li>Foreclosure starts were down -6.5% from April, keeping active foreclosure inventory at the lowest level since pandemic-era moratoria were lifted in January 2022</li>
<li>The total number of mortgage-holders currently in active foreclosure remains 32% below (-92K) pre-pandemic levels</li>
<li>Though up slightly for the month, foreclosure sales (completions) in May were down -7.2% year over year and remain well below pre-pandemic norms</li>
<li>A seasonal rise in home sales and slightly improved refi volumes pushed prepayments to their highest level since September 2022, even as rate-related headwinds persist</li>
</ul>

<div> Henan Province, LuxSE, HNCA, green bond, sustainable aviation industry
Summary:<br /><br />Henan Province's HNCA listed its first international green bond at LuxSE, marking a milestone in sustainable aviation finance and Luxembourg-China cooperation. <div>
<p><b>During a special Ring the Bell ceremony held at the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (LuxSE) today, in the presence of the Governor of the Henan Province, LuxSE and Henan Civil Aviation Development &amp; Investment Co. Ltd (HNCA), celebrated the listing of the Chinese aviation group&rsquo;s first international green bond.</b></p>
<p>As part of an official visit by a high-level delegation from the Chinese province of Henan and its aviation industry to Luxembourg this week, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (LuxSE) and Henan Civil Aviation Development &amp; Investment Co. Ltd (HNCA) took part in a special Ring the Bell ceremony to mark HNCA&rsquo;s debut in international capital markets with a RMB 200 million green bond aimed at transitioning towards a more sustainable aviation industry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The aviation industry can and must play an important role in creating a more low-carbon future. As a leader in the field of sustainable finance, we are delighted to welcome HNCA to the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and Luxembourg Green Exchange with this important green bond. This issuance underpins HNCA&rsquo;s commitment to creating a more sustainable aviation industry, and we look forward to supporting its efforts in the future as we continue to help finance the decarbonisation of the transportation industry,&rdquo; said Julie Becker, CEO of LuxSE.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h4><b>Leading the way in sustainable aviation</b></h4>
<p>HNCA&rsquo;s inaugural green bond also marks its debut in international capital markets, making it the first Chinese entity to issue a green bond focusing on sustainable aviation fuel among other key sustainable projects.</p>
<p>Projects to be financing through this RMB 200 million bond include the research, production and manufacturing of sustainable aviation fuel, Cargolux&rsquo;s Sustainable&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 11px;">Aviation Fuel Programme, and the construction of a green building project that will become the Group&rsquo;s Aviation Training Centre.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;This bond issuance marks an important moment in HNCA&rsquo;s continuous efforts to strengthen its cooperation with the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the Grand-Duchy as a whole. We look forward to further collaborating to mobilise international capital to support the development of a more sustainable aviation industry and the development of the Henan Province,&rdquo; said Zhang Mingchao, Party Secretary and Chairman of HNCA.</p>
<h4><b>Building on Luxembourg-China cooperation</b></h4>
<p>In 2014, HNCA completed the purchase of a 35% stake in Luxembourg&rsquo;s flag carrier cargo airline, Cargolux. Since then, HNCA has continued to work closely with key actors in Luxembourg to further connect the Grand-Duchy with mainland China - a move that today has expanded into sustainable finance for the aviation sector through the listing of its inaugural green bond at LuxSE.</p>
<p>The Ring the Bell ceremony was organised in the context of an official visit by a high-level delegation from the Henan Province to Luxembourg, which included the Second Zhengzhou-Luxembourg Air Silk Road International Cooperation Forum at LuxExpo on 20 June, in which Vice Premier of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China Ding Xuexiang, Deputy Prime Minister of Luxembourg Xavier Bettel and LuxSE&rsquo;s CEO Julie Becker were in attendance.</p>

<p><span><span>The UK startups witnessed the announcement of a total of 497 venture capital (VC) deals during the first five months of 2024, while the disclosed funding value of these deals stood at $6.8 billion. This represents a 1.6% year-on-year (YoY) growth in VC funding value during January-May 2024, despite the deal volume registering a YoY decline of 17.3%, according to&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.b00YhNV2Nr0-2BaZn7eVNAdXV19MDZH7kb0yQVOf6WtC8eObQvQmU18OGm4LpUDS-2BPfi9e_awSuR00uK8EZood8su7v4ItMFr0d7S5MNR1CcvAHRb7u8JiSB5Axp3o6-2Brp7TTn9jFAQeaiwuDUNp6ED3yPnAlc8P6BYb9FHuDe9ygxt5VZvNiU-2BtRuLsvHWqjkM9T7CX-2B7kPeWKKqFZQNxapGYpgTV-2Bsgmxu0s3ioUP5Fc2lIzEHGdYkxmDdOIDh-2FqGTjHp63KmmgJgetkOJCoygBeAcU0sFWT2B0q8FaQwQhqOdm9KBL4U33q-2BBWSHEFA3fqCK-2BqsIxzF0GE49Ww0pFQtbuh5MBp8OOu9FHbXwIqxc6cQ5PBcM87zaY4lofZP23H8ixTK8gfsFJ5PAaozpU9W6zkNC8T2mydJiFxwJ0lqig0j9RsvbdKM3dkhWjefPRy-2BF" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">GlobalData</span></span></span></a><span><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">,</span></span>&nbsp;a leading data and analytics company.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong>Aurojyoti Bose, Lead Analyst at GlobalData, comments:&nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;The decline experienced in deal volume in the UK during January-May 2024 was in line with the global trend, wherein top markets such as the US and China also witnessed a fall in the number of deals. Meanwhile, the improvement in terms of value recorded during the first five months of 2024 could be attributed to the announcement of two billion-dollar deals (valued more than or equal to $1 billion) in May.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><img alt="GlobalData_UK_VC_Fun_Jan-May23vs24" src="https://mondovisione.com/_assets/images/GlobalData_UK_VC_Fun_Jan-Ma.jpg" title="GlobalData_UK_VC_Fun_Jan-May23vs24" /><br /></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Some of the notable VC funding deals announced in the UK during January-May 2024 included around $1 billion worth of funding secured by Wayve, $1 billion capital raising by Abound, $431 million worth of funding raised by Monzo, $112 million capital raising by Exohood Labs, $110 million funding secured by Skyports, and $110 million capital raising by Build A Rocket Boy, among others.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Bose adds:&nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;The UK stands as the top European market for VC funding activity and was also among the top five markets globally both in terms of VC deals volume and value during January-May 2024.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The UK accounted for a 7.2% share of the total number of VC deals announced globally during the first five months of 2024, while its share of the corresponding disclosed funding value stood at 6.5%.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note: Historic data may change in case some deals get added to previous months because of a delay in disclosure of information in the public domain</span></span></p>

<title>US Acting Comptroller Of The Currency Issues Statement On FDIC Resolution Plan Rule</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> regulator, resolution planning, FDIC, final rule, insured depository institution <br />
Summary: Acting Comptroller of the Currency supports the final rule to modify the IDI resolution plan rule, requiring detailed plans for resolution submissions. <div>
<p>Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael J. Hsu issued the following statement at today&rsquo;s Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) board meeting regarding the final rule on insured depository institution (IDI) resolution planning.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>As a long-time regulator of large financial institutions, I know first-hand the consequences of complacency when it comes to resolvability. Those consequences can include not just disorderly failure and the need for extraordinary government action, but also a broader loss of trust in banks and their regulators. It is on us to remain vigilant to safeguard that trust.</em></p>
<p><em>I support the final rule to modify the current insured depository institution (IDI) resolution plan rule, codified at 12 CFR 360.10, including requirements for the content, timing, and evaluation of resolution submissions, to support the FDIC&rsquo;s readiness in the event of material distress and failure of a covered IDI (CIDI).</em></p>
<p><em>The FDIC published a notice of proposed rulemaking in September 2023 to modify the current IDI resolution plan rule. I appreciate the thoughtful comments, all of which were carefully analyzed and considered. While this final rule retains key elements from the proposal, it is improved by several modifications taken from commenters. The final rule requires CIDIs with at least $100 billion in total assets, or Group A CIDIs, to develop and submit detailed plans demonstrating how they could be resolved in an orderly and timely manner in the event of receivership. These plans must include an identified strategy that would provide timely access to insured deposits, maximize value from the sale or disposition of assets, minimize any losses realized by creditors in resolution, and address potential risk of adverse effects on US economic conditions or financial stability.</em></p>
<p><em>CIDIs with at least $50 billion but less than $100 billion in total assets, or Group B CIDIs, are required to submit more limited informational filings that will support the development of strategic options for resolution of the CIDI by the FDIC. To implement these requirements, I support termination of the existing moratorium on submission of resolution filings by Group B CIDIs.</em></p>
<p><em>Importantly, the final rule requires that CIDIs be able to demonstrate the capabilities necessary to ensure that franchise components, such as asset portfolios or lines of business, are marketable in resolution. Submissions must describe capabilities to establish a virtual data room in a timely manner to market such franchise components. Such capabilities would improve not only the likelihood of orderly resolution, but also the chances of recovery when banks are in stress.</em></p>
<p><em>For these reasons, I support the final rulemaking to revise the IDI resolution plan rule. I especially want to thank the staff for their dedication and hard work on this matter.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<title>Selective Disclosure Of Information Regarding Cybersecurity Incidents, Erik Gerding, Director, SEC Division Of Corporation Finance, June 20, 2024</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: cybersecurity, regulation, disclosure, materiality, Commission<br />
Summary:<br />
The Division of Corporation Finance clarifies that the rules on cybersecurity incident disclosure do not restrict private sharing of information. Regulation FD still applies, but there are exceptions. The selective disclosure rules are not a significant obstacle to sharing information about material cybersecurity incidents. Despite some companies' hesitance, sharing information about a material cybersecurity incident is generally not prohibited by the Commission's rules.<br /> <div>
<p><a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gerding-cybersecurity-incidents-06202024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn*" name="_ftnref*">[*]</a>Last year, the Commission adopted rules requiring public companies to disclose material cybersecurity incidents under Item 1.05 of Form 8-K.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gerding-cybersecurity-incidents-06202024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp; Since then, staff in the Division of Corporation Finance have heard assertions that those rules may preclude a company from sharing additional information about a material cybersecurity incident with others, including their commercial counterparties.&nbsp; Apparently, some companies are under the impression that if they experience a material cybersecurity incident, the Commission&rsquo;s new rules prohibit them from discussing that incident beyond what was included in the Item 1.05 Form 8-K disclosing the incident.&nbsp; That is not the case.</p>
<p>Item 1.05 of Form 8-K requires a company that experiences a cybersecurity incident that it determines to be material to describe the material aspects of the nature, scope, and timing of the incident, as well as the incident&rsquo;s material impact or reasonably likely material impact on the company, including its financial condition and results of operations.&nbsp; Nothing in Item 1.05 prohibits a company from privately discussing a material cybersecurity incident with other parties or from providing information about the incident to such parties beyond what was included in an Item 1.05 Form 8-K.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gerding-cybersecurity-incidents-06202024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp; Those parties may include commercial counterparties, such as vendors and customers, as well as other companies that may be impacted by, or at risk from, the same incident or threat actor.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gerding-cybersecurity-incidents-06202024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp; I recognize that sharing information about a material cybersecurity incident with those parties may assist with remediation, mitigation, or risk avoidance efforts and may facilitate those parties&rsquo; compliance with their own incident disclosure and reporting obligations, if required under the Commission&rsquo;s rules or other regulatory regimes.</p>
<p>I also recognize that companies could conceivably have concerns that privately disclosing additional information regarding a material cybersecurity incident beyond what was included in an Item 1.05 Form 8-K could implicate the Commission&rsquo;s rules regarding selective disclosures that are set forth in Regulation FD. &nbsp;It is important to reiterate the scope of Regulation FD.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gerding-cybersecurity-incidents-06202024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp; As is well-known, Regulation FD requires public disclosure of any material nonpublic information that has been selectively disclosed to securities market professionals or shareholders, as specified in the regulation.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gerding-cybersecurity-incidents-06202024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp; Depending on the information disclosed, and the persons to whom that information is disclosed, discussions regarding a cybersecurity incident may implicate Regulation FD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That said, nothing in Item 1.05 alters Regulation FD or makes it apply any differently to communications regarding cybersecurity incidents. &nbsp;There are several ways that a public company can privately share information regarding a material cybersecurity incident beyond what was disclosed in its Item 1.05 Form 8-K without implicating Regulation FD.&nbsp; For example, the information that is being privately shared about the incident may be immaterial, or the parties with whom the information is being shared may not be one of the types of persons covered by Regulation FD.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gerding-cybersecurity-incidents-06202024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp; Further, even if the information being shared is material nonpublic information and the parties with whom the information is being shared are the types of persons covered by Regulation FD, an exclusion from the application of Regulation FD may apply.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gerding-cybersecurity-incidents-06202024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp; For example, if the information is being shared with a person who owes a duty of trust or confidence to the issuer (such as an attorney, investment banker, or accountant)<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gerding-cybersecurity-incidents-06202024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;or if the person with whom the information being shared expressly agrees to maintain the disclosed information in confidence (<i>e.g.</i>, if they enter into a confidentiality agreement with the issuer),<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gerding-cybersecurity-incidents-06202024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;then public disclosure of that privately-shared information will not be required under Regulation FD.</p>
<p>While some companies may have a general reticence to privately share information regarding a material cybersecurity incident, as discussed earlier, the Commission&rsquo;s rules generally do not prohibit the sharing of such information.&nbsp; The selective disclosure rules in Regulation FD were adopted over 20 years ago.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gerding-cybersecurity-incidents-06202024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, public companies and their attorneys should be well-versed in navigating those rules, and, if the scope and requirements of those rules are heeded, they should not pose an undue impediment to the mutually beneficial sharing of information regarding material cybersecurity incidents.</p>

<title>US Treasury Releases Report On Macroeconomic And Foreign Exchange Policies Of Major Trading Partners Of The United States</title>

<div> Treasury Report, Major Trading Partners, Currency Manipulation, Biden Administration, Monitoring List <br />
Summary: The U.S. Treasury's report found no currency manipulation but identified seven economies for close monitoring, including China for lack of transparency. <br /> <div>
<p>The U.S. Department of the Treasury delivered its semiannual Report to Congress on Macroeconomic and Foreign Exchange Policies of Major Trading Partners of the United States.&nbsp; In this Report, Treasury reviewed and assessed the policies of major U.S. trading partners, comprising about 78 percent of U.S. foreign trade in goods and services, during the four quarters through December 2023.</p>
<p>In accordance with the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, the Report analyzed the practices of the United States&rsquo; major trading partners and concludes that no major U.S. trading partner manipulated the rate of exchange between its currency and the U.S. dollar for purposes of preventing effective balance of payments adjustments or gaining unfair competitive advantage in international trade during the four quarters through December 2023.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this Report, Treasury found that no major trading partner met all three criteria for enhanced analysis under the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 during the four quarters ending December 2023.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Biden Administration strongly opposes attempts by the United States&rsquo; trading partners to artificially manipulate currency values to gain unfair advantage over American workers.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Treasury continues to promote policies that support stronger and more balanced global growth that benefits American workers, including through close engagement with major trading partners on currency-related issues,&rdquo; Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen said today.</p>
<p>Seven economies are on Treasury&rsquo;s &ldquo;Monitoring List&rdquo; of major trading partners that merit close attention to their currency practices and macroeconomic policies:&nbsp;China, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, Vietnam, and Germany.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Report also reiterated Treasury&rsquo;s call for increased transparency from China.&nbsp; China&rsquo;s failure to publish foreign exchange intervention and broader lack of transparency around key features of its exchange rate policy make China an outlier among major economies and warrant Treasury&rsquo;s close monitoring.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s Report is submitted to Congress pursuant to Section 3005 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, 22 U.S.C. &sect; 5305, and Section 701 of the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015, 19 U.S.C. &sect; 4421.&nbsp;</p>

<title>Federal Reserve: Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey On Dealer Financing Terms</title>

<div> survey, credit, financing, derivatives, dealers
Summary: The SCOOS is a quarterly survey on credit availability and terms in securities financing and OTC derivatives markets, generally completed by dealer firms. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>The Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms (SCOOS) is a quarterly survey providing information about the availability and terms of credit in securities financing and over-the counter (OTC) derivatives markets. The SCOOS is modeled after the long-established Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices, which provides qualitative information about changes in supply and demand for loans to households and businesses at commercial banks. The SCOOS collects qualitative information on credit terms and conditions in securities financing and OTC derivatives markets, which are important conduits for leverage in the financial system. The survey panel for the SCOOS began by including 20 dealers and over time has been expanded. These firms account for almost all of the dealer activity in dollar-denominated securities financing and OTC derivatives markets. The survey is directed to senior credit officers responsible for maintaining a consolidated perspective on the management of credit risks. The HTML links below include the full report; the PDF links include the summary only.</p>

<title>Canadian Securities Regulators Announce Multilateral Initiative To Support Capital-Raising By Extending The Role Of Exempt Market Dealers</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Securities regulators, Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Alberta<br />
Exempt market dealers, prospectus offerings, capital-raising, Canadian small businesses, securities regulations<br /><br />Summary:<br />The Ontario Securities Commission and other regulators are allowing exempt market dealers to participate in prospectus offerings to support capital-raising for small businesses. <div>
<p>The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC), the Autorit&eacute; des march&eacute;s financiers (AMF), the B.C. Securities Commission (BCSC), Financial and Consumer Affairs Authority of Saskatchewan (FCAA), the Alberta Securities Commission (ASC) and the Nova Scotia Securities Commission (NSSC) today announced an initiative intended to support capital-raising by early-stage businesses by allowing exempt market dealers (EMDs) to participate as selling group members in prospectus offerings.</p>
<p>EMDs play an important role in assisting start-ups and small- to medium-sized businesses raise capital by distributing those businesses&rsquo; securities under prospectus requirement exemptions. However, as the businesses grow and seek financing through prospectus offerings, EMDs are unable to participate in those prospectus offerings due to restrictions on their permitted activities.</p>
<p>The time-limited exemption announced today enables EMDs to maintain their relationships with those issuers and opens more capital-raising opportunities for Canadian small businesses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fostering the right conditions to enable businesses to thrive is crucial to our collective economic success. The measures announced today show how securities regulators are supporting the growth and prosperity of our capital markets,&rdquo; said Grant Vingoe, CEO of the OSC.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are pleased that Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Alberta and Nova Scotia are working together to put these measures in place and are finding ways to harmonize regulation in support of Canadian businesses,&rdquo; said Stan Magidson, CSA Chair and Chair and CEO of the ASC.</p>
<p>Enabling EMDs to participate as selling group members provides another route for raising capital for growing businesses within these provinces. Investment dealers will remain involved in these offerings, including by acting as underwriter and signing the underwriter certificate to the prospectus.</p>
<p>The measures announced today follow work carried out by the OSC in response to the Ontario Capital Markets Modernization Taskforce 2021 report, as well as work undertaken by the other jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The securities regulatory authority in New Brunswick anticipates publishing a similar local blanket order in the upcoming weeks.</p>
<p>The CSA, the council of securities regulators of Canada&rsquo;s provinces and territories, coordinates and harmonizes regulation for the Canadian capital markets.</p>

<title>The EBA Publishes Final Standards For Assessing The Materiality Of Extensions And Changes To New Market Risk Internal Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published its final draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) on the conditions for assessing the materiality of model extensions and changes, as well as changes to the subset of modellable risk factors, applicable under the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB) rules. With the submission of these final draft RTS to the European Commission, the EBA completes its</span>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/10180/2844544/ab272ad0-f256-4d70-9563-376e1d772feb/EBA%20roadmap%20for%20the%20new%20market%20and%20counterparty%20credit%20risk%20approaches.pdf" title="EBA roadmap for the new market and counterparty credit risk approaches.pdf"><span>roadmap on market and counterparty credit risk approaches</span></a><span>&nbsp;published on 27 June 2019.</span></p>
<p>In line with the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR), the final draft RTS differentiate between material extensions and changes under the internal models approach (IMA), to be approved by competent authorities (CA), and non-material extensions and changes, to be notified to CAs four weeks in advance. This last category is further divided into two sub-categories: extensions and changes notified with additional information, and extensions and changes with basic information.</p>
<p>For the categorisation of extensions and changes to the relevant categories and sub-categories, the final draft RTS set out a combination of qualitative and quantitative conditions. In particular, the quantitative conditions aim at assessing the effect of the extension or change on the IMA own funds requirements and on the relevant components of the FRTB IMA (Expected Shortfall, Stress Scenario Risk Measure and Default Risk Charge), before and after the planned extension or change. The final draft RTS also include guiding principles that institutions should follow in the categorisation process, provisions on the implementation of extensions and changes and documentation requirements.</p>
<h4>Legal basis and background</h4>
<p>These draft RTS have been developed according to Article 325az(8)(a) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (Capital Requirements Regulation - CRR), which mandates the EBA to specify the conditions for assessing the materiality of extensions and changes to the use of alternative internal models and changes to the subset of the modellable risk factors.</p>
<p>The CRR allows institutions to calculate their own funds requirements for market risk using the alternative IMA, provided that permission from CAs is granted. According to the CRR, material changes to the use of the IMA, the extension of the use of the IMA and material changes to the institution's choice of the subset of the modellable risk factors require separate permission from competent authorities. All other extensions and changes to the use of the IMA require notification to the competent authorities.</p>

<title>Finansinspektionen: Major Banks Need To Rectify Deficiencies In The Payments Infrastructure</title>

<div> Bank Girot, deficiencies, payments infrastructure, FI, anti-money laundering regulations
<br />
FI orders Swedish banks to rectify deficiencies in payments infrastructure by December 2026, contacting authorities in Denmark and Finland. Limitations in Bank Girot system need to be resolved.
<br /><br />Summary: FI is ordering Swedish banks to rectify payment infrastructure deficiencies and has informed authorities in Denmark and Finland about the limitations in the Bank Girot system. <div>
<p><span>FI is ordering Handelsbanken, SEB and Swedbank to rectify deficiencies in the payments infrastructure no later than December 2026. FI has also contacted the supervisory authorities in Denmark and Finland and informed them of the need to take corresponding measures for Danske Bank and Nordea.</span></p>
<div class="editor-content">
<p>All banks and payment services providers that perform electronic transfers within the EU must ensure that certain information about the payer and the payee is included with the transfers. Bank Girot is not specifically included in these requirements but plays a central role in the Swedish payment chain and is the only operations that has authorisation to conduct clearing of payments. This means that a large portion of the payments made within the country, for example invoices, salary deposits, and transfers between bank accounts, are compiled and controlled within the Bank Girot system.</p>
<p>However, the Bank Girot system has some limitations that entail that participating banks cannot meet the requirements in the anti-money laundering regulations on the transfer of information. Participants in the Bank Girot system are thus lacking the conditions to fully comply with the anti-money laundering regulations. Therefore, Bank Girot's Swedish owner banks, Handelsbanken, SEB and Swedbank, are ordered to take the measures necessary to ensure that the statutory information is included with transfers in Sweden.</p>
<p>"We have been monitoring for a long time how the owner banks are working on this matter and how they are planning to rectify the problem. We are now choosing to proceed with a strict time frame. We expect these deficiencies to be resolved," says FI Executive Director Malin Alpen.</p>
<p>FI would like to emphasise that the limitations in the Bank Girot system affect all Bank Girot and Data Clearing participants. However, FI is targeting the Bank Girot owners since they have the opportunity in practice to ensure that the deficiencies are rectified.</p>
<p>In terms of the foreign owner banks Danske Bank and Nordea, FI does not have the same legal basis for intervention. However, FI has contacted the relevant supervisory authorities in Denmark and Finland and informed them about the deficiencies in Bank Girot, and FI will follow up on this matter in the future.</p>

<title>“Shortening The Settlement Cycle: Benefitting Everyday Investors” Prepared Remarks Before The Accelerated Settlement In The U.K. Conference, SEC Chair Gary Gensler, Washington D.C., June 20, 2024</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/shortening-the-settlement-cycle-benefitting-everyday-investors-prepared-remar/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Securities and Exchange Commission, T+1, settlement cycle, market structure, clearinghouse
<br />
Summary: Shortening the settlement cycle to T+1 benefits investors, reduces risk, requires global coordination, may necessitate business model shifts, and could prompt further discussions in other markets. <div>
<p>Good afternoon. Thank you, Charlie, for the kind introduction. As is customary, I&rsquo;d like to note that my views are my own as Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and I am not speaking on behalf of my fellow Commissioners or the staff.</p>
<p>Last month, the U.S. smoothly shortened the settlement cycle for equities, corporate bonds, and municipal securities to one day after the transaction date (T+1). This step better unifies the U.S. market structure, where Treasuries, options, and mutual funds already largely settle in one day.</p>
<p>For everyday investors, this means you now can sell your stock on a Monday and get your cash on a Tuesday. This makes a real difference&mdash;you don&rsquo;t have to wait until Wednesday. With 58 percent of American households holding stocks,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-accelerated-settlement-uk-conference-062024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;this is significant. This step also helped better unify the U.S. market structure, where Treasuries, options, and mutual funds already largely settle in one day.</p>
<p>Canada, Mexico, Argentina, and Jamaica successfully joined us in the move.</p>
<h3>Importance of Shortening the Cycle</h3>
<p>Time is money. Time is risk.</p>
<p>Thus, shortening the market plumbing of clearance and settlement saves money. It lowers risk. It increases efficiency, boosts liquidity, and promotes resiliency of the markets.</p>
<p>As I said, for everyday investors who sell their stock on a Monday, they will get their money on Tuesday.</p>
<p>For institutional investors, it will free up liquidity that might otherwise be trapped for two days.</p>
<p>Cutting the clearance and settlement cycle in half also reduces the amount of margin, or collateral, that must be placed with the clearinghouse. The way the math works it&rsquo;s likely to average 29 percent savings over time. First indications reported by the clearinghouse show a savings of 25 percent, or more than $3 billion, resulting from the move to T+1.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-accelerated-settlement-uk-conference-062024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Shortening the matching parts of clearing (the time to ensure that all parties agree to the trade details) also lowers operational as well as counterparty risk. The sooner the parties have allocated, confirmed, and affirmed the trade information for their transaction, the lower the likelihood of a settlement failing since the parties have more time to identify and resolve any potential errors. The Bank of International Settlements (BIS) first recommended T+0 affirmations 22 years ago.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-accelerated-settlement-uk-conference-062024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;A decade later, CPMI-IOSCO reaffirmed this in their&nbsp;<em>Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures</em>.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-accelerated-settlement-uk-conference-062024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p>Shortening the cycle also means reducing the credit, market, and liquidity risks of the clearinghouse.</p>
<p>Lowering risks for market participants and clearinghouses, alike, reduces the likelihood that any one entity&rsquo;s failure spreads risk to the financial system, making the system safer for everyone.</p>
<h3>U.S. Memorial Day Transition</h3>
<p>Many Americans were celebrating the unofficial start of summer over Memorial Day weekend as the U.K. was enjoying a spring bank holiday. Another important thing was happening. We were transitioning to T+1. Further, trades relating to initial public offerings were shortened from T+4 to T+2.</p>
<p>Following that weekend, brokers also were required to have policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure completion of allocations, confirmations, and affirmations as soon as technologically practical. This is based on the new SEC rule<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-accelerated-settlement-uk-conference-062024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;and in line with what BIS first recommended 22 years ago.</p>
<p>In addition, registered advisers are required to keep certain time-stamped records of allocations sent or received, confirmations received, and affirmations sent or received.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clearing agencies also are required to have policies and procedures to facilitate the straight-through processing of securities transactions, automating the entire trade process from execution to clearing and settling.</p>
<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
<p>As you consider your own transition to T+1 in the U.K., I want to share some key takeaways from our experience.</p>
<p><em>It&rsquo;s a Team Sport</em></p>
<p>First, transitioning to T+1 is a team sport. Thousands of market participants&mdash;from the clearinghouse, depositories, custodian banks, broker dealers, investment advisers, self-regulatory organizations, stock exchanges, service providers, and industry groups&mdash;worked, along with SEC staff, to make the transition happen smoothly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not only a team sport, it&rsquo;s a global sport. By the way, speaking of global sports, good luck to England today in the Eurocup match.</p>
<p>The SEC staff engaged with market participants and regulatory counterparts around the world.</p>
<p>I want to thank everyone who had a role in making this smooth transition possible. Given the experience of moving from T+3 to T+2, we anticipated fail rates might go up following the transition to T+1. The data shows, though, that fail rates stayed relatively flat. For instance, the first day of T+1 settlement the fail rates went down modestly from May&rsquo;s average.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-accelerated-settlement-uk-conference-062024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p><em>Importance of T+0 Allocations, Confirmations, and Affirmations</em></p>
<p>Second, I&rsquo;d note how important it was that we included that allocations, confirmations, and affirmations must be completed as soon as technologically practicable, but at least on T+0. When we proposed the rule in February 2022, only 68 percent of transactions were being affirmed &nbsp;on trade date.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-accelerated-settlement-uk-conference-062024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;By January 2024, this had increased slightly to 73 percent.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-accelerated-settlement-uk-conference-062024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;The clearinghouse publicly set a goal as part of the transition to move that up to at least 90 percent.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-accelerated-settlement-uk-conference-062024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;Given our rule as well as market participants&rsquo; efforts, by May 29, the day after the transition, the T+0 affirmation rate was up to approximately 95 percent at 9 p.m. ET, which is Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation&rsquo;s (DTCC&rsquo;s) new deadline.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-accelerated-settlement-uk-conference-062024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p><em>Importance of Setting a Firm Implementation Date</em></p>
<p>Third, I&rsquo;d note how important it is just to set a date and, if possible, stick to it. It helps to organize everybody&rsquo;s planning and implementation. No doubt, there will be some market participants who raise concerns with meeting whatever date you select. We benefited, though, from having an announced implementation date as well as a well-thought-out timeline and schedule.</p>
<p>The process from final rule adoption<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-accelerated-settlement-uk-conference-062024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;to smooth implementation of T+1 in the U.S. was 15 months. The process from proposing the rule in February 2022 to implementation was 27 months. The transition happened smoothly within this time based upon all the efforts of market participants, the clearinghouse, and fellow regulators. In Canada it was 17 months from proposal to implementation.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-accelerated-settlement-uk-conference-062024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;In Mexico, it was just 10 months from when it was proposed in July 2023.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-accelerated-settlement-uk-conference-062024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>&nbsp;Argentina and Jamaica adopted their plans to transition but two weeks and one week respectively before implementation.</p>
<p>In the U.K., you will have to decide what policy and timing is right for you. I don&rsquo;t suspect you will follow the timing of Argentina or Jamaica. I&rsquo;d note, though, that if one looks at the 27 months it took the U.S. from proposal to implementation, your implementation might be June 2026. That&rsquo;s 27 months from when you finalized your March 2024 &ldquo;Accelerated Settlement Taskforce Report.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-accelerated-settlement-uk-conference-062024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></p>
<p><em>Some Business Models May Need to Shift</em></p>
<p>Fourth, though the transition to T+1 overall brings benefits to investors and the markets, it does come with transition costs as well as the need for various market participants to change business models.</p>
<p>For instance, international investors may need to shift their operations to cover their foreign currency risks on T+0 rather than possibly waiting for T+1. We saw a number of international investors actually moving some of their staff to the U.S. to accommodate the shift. We also found that time zones do matter, though you have the advantage that the U.S. already has gone to T+1.</p>
<p>Further, as it relates to mutual funds, including exchange-traded funds (ETFs), some market participants raised concerns about the potential mismatch between the timing of the redemption of such funds versus the settlement cycle of the underlying portfolio.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d note it&rsquo;s not the first time we&rsquo;ve had mismatches between the settlement cycle for funds and their underlying portfolios. In the United States, we&rsquo;ve long had transactions in mutual funds generally settle in one day. In the U.K., you&rsquo;ve also lived with such mismatches as the U.K. Gilt markets settle in one day.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-accelerated-settlement-uk-conference-062024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>&nbsp;Mutual funds and ETFs have used a variety of tools to address settlement time mismatches between fund shares and portfolio investments, including cash reserves, lines of credit, and interfund lending facilities.</p>
<p>A nice benefit of going to T+1 is in the area of corporate actions, in that ex-dividend dates and record dates now are aligned on the same day.</p>
<p><em>We Already Live in a World Where Settlement Cycles Are Not Aligned</em></p>
<p>Lastly, you undoubtedly will hear from market participants about settlement cycles not being aligned with other jurisdictions. The history of settlement cycles shows, however, that we have long experience with differences in settlement cycles both within jurisdictions as well as across jurisdictions. This history shows that market participants have found ways to handle this. For any market that shortens the settlement cycle, though, the benefits are real. Time is money, time is risk.</p>
<p>A bit of history might surprise some in the audience, but the U.S. stock market settled at T+1 well into the 1920s. It was only with increasing volumes that the market plumbing was lengthened to a business week after a transaction (T+5). We first shortened the cycle to T+3 in 1995,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-accelerated-settlement-uk-conference-062024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>&nbsp;followed by shortening it to T+2 in 2017.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-accelerated-settlement-uk-conference-062024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a></p>
<p>Ten years ago, you shortened to T+2 three years prior to us. In 2014, the European Commission required equity markets in 29 member countries (including the U.K. pre-Brexit) to move to T+2 settlement, joining Germany, Bulgaria, and Slovenia, which were already settling T+2.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-accelerated-settlement-uk-conference-062024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a></p>
<p>Israel moved to T+1 in 2012 for Tel Aviv Exchange&rsquo;s clearinghouse member brokers&rsquo; equity trades. Broker-to-broker trades in corporate and government bonds also settle T+1.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-accelerated-settlement-uk-conference-062024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a>&nbsp;India completed moving its equity markets to T+1 in January 2023.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-accelerated-settlement-uk-conference-062024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a>&nbsp;Its sovereign debt has been T+1 since 2017.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-accelerated-settlement-uk-conference-062024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a>&nbsp;In Japan, equities settle at T+2,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-accelerated-settlement-uk-conference-062024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a>&nbsp;while government bonds settle at T+1.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-accelerated-settlement-uk-conference-062024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a>&nbsp;China actually has moved to same-day securities delivery (within four hours after market close) for its A-shares securities,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-accelerated-settlement-uk-conference-062024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a>&nbsp;though their related payments move in the banking system the next morning. In Hong Kong, settlement is T+2.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-accelerated-settlement-uk-conference-062024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a></p>
<h3>Looking Forward</h3>
<p>Looking forward, I want to raise three areas for further policy discussions.</p>
<p>First, as I look forward, I want to mention the Commission&rsquo;s rules to facilitate additional central clearing for the U.S. Treasury market, which will be phased in over two years.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-accelerated-settlement-uk-conference-062024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a>&nbsp;The final rules make changes to enhance customer clearing and broaden the scope of which transactions clearinghouse members must clear. These rules will help to make the Treasury market more efficient, competitive, and resilient.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In just nine months, in March 2025, the separation of house and customer margin must be completed, ensuring that clearinghouses facilitate indirect participants as well. Starting at the end of 2025, certain cash transactions will have to be cleared. Starting in June 2026, certain repurchase agreement (repo) and reverse repo transactions must be cleared.</p>
<p>Second, looking forward, I think it&rsquo;s appropriate for regulators and market participants around the globe to start to consider the possibility of shortening the settlement cycle for currency trading. Currency markets worldwide currently settle T+2. Particularly if Europe and the U.K. were to join the major markets of North America and Asia in moving to T+1, we should start to engage now in conversations, along with central banks, about the possibility of shortening the currency trading settlement cycle.</p>
<p>Third, some markets already have moved to settlement cycles on the day of the transaction. This includes parts of U.S. money markets, parts of the Chinese equity markets, and most recently India has proposed doing so in some equity markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-accelerated-settlement-uk-conference-062024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a>&nbsp;Thus, looking forward, it raises the question as to whether further shortening beyond T+1 may be appropriate.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Let me conclude by once again saying why I think shortening the settlement cycle is so important. It helps everyday investors get their money sooner when they sell a security. It helps clearinghouse members lower their margin and free up liquidity. It helps the clearinghouse lower risk. Though it might just seem like the plumbing, it really does help the financial system and everyone who participates in it.</p>
<p>It took a team effort for a smooth transition in the U.S. as well as for our neighbors in the Americas. We look forward to continuing to work with you as you move toward giving everyday investors in the U.K. similar benefits.</p>

<div> ETFs, Bitcoin, Ethereum, SEC, ASX
Summary:
SEC is close to approving spot ether ETFs, ASX approved first Bitcoin spot ETF, Europe unlikely to follow due to diversification rules. Regulators must consider potential risks. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>Dr. Alpay Soyt&uuml;rk, Chief Regulatory Officer of Spectrum Markets, the pan-European trading venue, issued the following comment in response to the news that the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) has approved the listing of its first spot Bitcoin ETF.</p>
<p><i>&lsquo;&rsquo;Following the authorisation of ETFs on bitcoin, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has also given the green light for ETFs on ethereum. Actually, the SEC approved 19b-4 filings for eight spot ether ETFs, but the agency has not yet greenlighted the S-1 (registration statement) filings, which must be completed and declared effective before the spot ether ETFs can launch.</i></p>
<p><i>More clarity on the latest developments in the approval procedure has been provided by Gary Gensler, SEC chairman, during his testimony before the U.S. Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services. Pressed by questions raised by senators, Gensler stated that the final greenlight to spot ether ETFs could come as soon as this summer. However, the proceedings needed for the greenlight are duties to be managed by the issuers, not by SEC&rsquo; staff.&nbsp;</i></p>
<p><i>In the meantime, ASX (Australian Securities Exchange), which accounts for around 80% of the country&rsquo;s equities trading, has approved its first bitcoin spot ETF. This represents the third in Australia, following the two already available on rival exchange Cboe, and such a decision could influence other regulators to make similar decisions, contributing to the growth and maturation of the global cryptocurrency market.</i></p>
<p><i>Although these news testify the evolution and wider acceptance of crypto assets, it is unlikely we are going to see something similar in Europe soon. The reason lies behind the UCITS Directive, which contains diversification rules for the inclusion of indices as ETF underlyings, and virtually none of them allow for a disproportionate concentration risk on individual securities.&nbsp;</i></p>
<p><i>This also calls for a reconsideration of how the protection provided by authorization from a securities regulator should be evaluated. We do not intend to criticize the whole Bitcoin or Ethereum projects, but rather to question whether authorizing investment funds in individual securities is a sensible measure.</i></p>
<p><i>Of course, the ETFs now authorized offer the opportunity to gain exposure to bitcoin or ethereum without having to hold the crypto assets directly. But firstly, there have been alternatives in this country before, such as securitised derivatives on BTC or ETH. Secondly, the ETF authorisation paves the way for large institutional institutions to become heavily involved in distribution, as the fierce fee competition among large US asset managers has already shown in the recent past. If this results in private investors with a rather conservative risk profile and investment objectives that do not correspond to this type of security becoming more involved and being unable to adequately compensate for strong downturns, securities regulators will be caught in the crossfire.&nbsp;&lsquo;&rsquo;</i></p>

<div> Nasdaq, Cinclus Pharma, IPO, eGERD, pharmaceutical<br />
Summary:<br />
Nasdaq announces trading of Cinclus Pharma on Stockholm market. Cinclus develops drug for eGERD, optimistic about future as listed company. <div>
<p>Nasda<span><span>q (Nasdaq: NDAQ) announces that trading in the shares of Cinclus Pharma Holding AB (ticker name: CINPHA) will commence today on the Nasdaq Stockholm Main Market. Cinclus Pharma is a Mid Cap company within the Health Care sector. Cinclus Pharma is the 15<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;</span></span>company to be admitted to trading on Nasdaq&rsquo;s Nordic and Baltic markets* in 2024.</p>
<p>Cinclus Pharma is a clinical stage pharmaceutical company focused on the development of the drug candidate linaprazan glurate, a proprietary &ldquo;prodrug&rdquo; of the molecule linaprazan, originally developed by AstraZeneca.

<p>&ldquo;We are very excited about this important step in Cinclus Pharma&rsquo;s development. By becoming the product that can offer 24-hour acid control and healing for the most severely ill patients with eGERD, we have the potential to drive a paradigm shift in the treatment of gastric acid-related diseases.

We have received very positive feedback from investors, making us feel incredibly excited about our future as a listed company,&rdquo; said Christer Ahlberg, CEO of Cinclus Pharma.&nbsp;</p>

<title>ACER Consults On The Introduction Of Voluntary Templates For Power Purchase Agreements In The EU Energy Market</title>

<div> consultation, Power Purchase Agreement, renewable energy, ACER, stakeholders
Summary:<br />ACER seeks input on PPA templates in the EU energy market. PPAs are contracts between energy producers and buyers supporting renewable energy adoption. If needed, ACER will develop PPA templates. <div>
<p>Today, ACER opens a public consultation (running from 20 June until 18 July 2024, 17:00 CET) to gather stakeholders&rsquo; views on the benefits and drawbacks of introducing voluntary templates for Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) contracts in the EU energy market.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are Power Purchase Agreements?</span></p>
<p>Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) are contractual arrangements between electricity producers (frequently renewable energy generators) and buyers. By providing renewable electricity at mutually agreed rates, these contracts foster stability for both parties and promote the adoption of renewable energy sources (RES).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why the need for a consultation?</span></p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtVU1QIA1VSW0wIAAZSHVZdAAAdU1tUBRoBVQUEBFJWUwEFV1QdVlFaUQkHV1EdBgsMVB0GAFJUGldRAAIZUAIEDgAGVQRVBVsDRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" target="_blank">EU Electricity Market Design Reform</a>&nbsp;mandates ACER to assess the need for PPAs templates by taking into account the requirements of the different counterparties. For this reason, ACER is running a public consultation to gather inputs from stakeholders and ensure an informed and inclusive decision-making process.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the next steps?</span></p>
<p>ACER will consider the feedback received in the consultation and the conclusions reached by the&nbsp;<a href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsBAlJQWQJXW0wLBwFSHVYODA4dUwkHVBpQAAMAUAIEVFMFUggdVlFaUQkHV1EdBgsMVB0GAFJUGldRAAIZUAIEDgAGVQRVBVsDRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" target="_blank">consultative expert group</a>&nbsp;established in May 2024.</p>
<p>If the assessment (expected in Autumn 2024) highlights the need to develop templates for PPA contracts, ACER, together with all Nominated Electricity Market Operators (NEMOs), will start the process in Winter 2024.</p>

Summary:<br />
Two suspects arrested for running illegal cryptoasset exchange, FCA and police involved, over £1 billion in unregistered cryptoassets, suspects interviewed and released on bail, ongoing investigation.<br /> <div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA, working with the Metropolitan Police Service, has conducted an operation to arrest 2 individuals, aged 38 and 44, suspected of running an illegal cryptoasset exchange.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p><span>More than &pound;1 billion of unregistered cryptoassets are believed to have been bought and sold through this business.</span></p>
<p><span>The FCA inspected the offices associated with the suspects and the police seized several digital devices during searches of 2 residential London properties.</span></p>
<p><span>Both suspects were interviewed under caution by the FCA and released on bail. The FCA&rsquo;s investigation into the case is ongoing.</span></p>
<p><span>Cryptoasset exchange providers must be registered with the FCA and comply with the UK money laundering regulations in order to operate legally in the UK.</span></p>
<p><span>Therese Chambers, Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight at the FCA, said:</span></p>
<p><span>'The FCA has an important role to play in keeping dirty money out of the UK financial system. These arrests show we will do everything in our power to stop crypto firms from operating illegally in the UK.'</span></p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<ol>
<li>Since 10 January 2021, cryptoasset businesses providing certain cryptoasset services in the UK must be registered with the FCA under the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017 (MLRs).</li>
<li>Cryptoasset businesses need to be registered with the FCA under the MLRs, and comply with the requirements of the regulations, if they intend to provide certain cryptoasset services by way of business, and in the UK.</li>
<li>Under the MLRs the FCA can impose directions on cryptoasset businesses which can prohibit them from operating. It is a criminal offence to breach a direction imposed under the MLRs.</li>
<li>The FCA regularly warns consumers that cryptoassets are unregulated and high-risk, which means people are very unlikely to have any protection if things go wrong.</li>
<li>The FCA publishes a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/consumers/warning-list-unauthorised-firms" title="FCA Warning List of unauthorised firms">list of businesses</a>&nbsp;that it suspects are operating without our registration.</li>

<div> Experiment, FCA, trading apps, digital engagement practices, push notifications<br />
<br />Summary: FCA's experiment found that digital engagement practices in trading apps increase trading frequency and risk-taking. Push notifications and prize draws had the largest impact. It also found that the impact is larger on some subgroups, including those with low financial literacy, women, and younger participants. The FCA continues to educate consumers and has warned trading apps to review game-like design features. <div>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>In an online experiment with over 9,000 consumers, the FCA found that digital engagement practices (DEPs) used by trading apps, such as push notifications and prize draws, can increase trading frequency and risk taking.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>In an FCA first, the regulator built an experimental trading app platform to test the effect of different DEPs on trading behaviour. It also found evidence that DEPs can have a larger impact on some subgroups, including those with low financial literacy, women and younger participants (18-34).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under the FCA&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/consumer-duty" title="Consumer Duty">Consumer Duty</a>, trading apps must ensure services are designed and tested so they meet consumers' needs and enable them to make effective, timely and properly informed investment decisions, including for those with characteristics of vulnerability.</p>
<p>The FCA warned stock trading apps to review game-like design features in 2022 ahead of the Consumer Duty&rsquo;s implementation. &nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Sheldon Mills, Executive Director of Consumers and Competition at the FCA, said</span>:</p>
<p>'Trading apps have the potential to transform retail investments, but some in-app features might be pushing consumers towards more frequent or riskier trading, which isn&rsquo;t right for everyone.</p>
<p>'With usage and popularity of trading apps growing, we&rsquo;ll be keeping them under review to make sure customers can make investment decisions that suit their needs.'</p>
<p>The FCA continues to educate consumers about making better investment decisions and understanding the opportunities and risks, through its InvestSmart campaign. It has also brought charges against &lsquo;finfluencers&rsquo; promoting financial products on social media.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/research-notes/research-note-digital-engagement-practices-trading-apps-experiment" title="Research Note: Digital engagement practices: a trading apps experiment ">FCA&rsquo;s research on digital engagement practices</a>.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Key findings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Push notifications and points &amp; prize draw increased the number of trades made, by 11% and 12% respectively.</li>
<li>Push notifications and points &amp; prize draw increased the proportion of trades that were in risky investments by 8% and 6% respectively.</li>
<li>Those with low financial literacy increased their trading by more than those with high financial literacy in the presence of flashing prices and trader leaderboards.</li>
<li>Women increased their trading frequency by more than men when push notifications and points &amp; prize draw were introduced.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Younger participants (18-34) increased their end-of-trading portfolio riskiness by more than older participants (35+) across all DEPs (except flashing prices). &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the research, low financial literacy was defined as giving 1 or fewer correct answers in response to the '<a class="ext" href="https://gflec.org/education/questions-that-indicate-financial-literacy/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Big Three' financial literacy<span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>, which ask about the effect of compound interest and inflation as well as the importance of investment diversification. &nbsp;</li>

<title>GDF, ANNA, And DTI Foundation Announce Partnership To Support The Development Of Standards And Best Practices In The Digital Asset Industry</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> partnership, global members association, digital assets, standardization, transparency
Summary:<br />Global Digital Finance (GDF) partners with ANNA and DTI Foundation to promote standardization and transparency in the digital asset sector. This partnership supports the adoption of market standards and identification data, integrating digital assets into traditional finance systems. <div>
<p><span>Global Digital Finance (GDF), the global members association and platform for open innovation in digital assets in financial services, announces a partnership with&nbsp;the Association of National Numbering Agencies (ANNA), a global member association seeking to foster standardization within the financial industry, and the Digital Token Identifier (DTI) Foundation whose combined mandate is to increase transparency in the digital asset space by creating a core reference data set based on open data principles and made available as a public good.&nbsp;</span></p>
<div class="dombanner"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>As the digital asset sector grows, it is crucial that standardized identification data is&nbsp;available that seamlessly blends digital asset standards with conventional financial&nbsp;systems.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Partnering with ANNA and DTIF is true to GDF&rsquo;s mission of promoting and underpinning the greater adoption of market standards for the use of crypto and digital assets, and GDF looks forward to continued engagement with both organizations to better advocate and accelerate the adoption of best practices for digital assets.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Background</strong>:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In 2021, a joint ANNA-DTIF Task Force was established to ensure a complementary relationship between the International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) and Digital Token Identifier (DTI) ISO standards. This alliance supports a growing digital asset sector with complementary identifiers that foster market transparency and interoperability. In 2023, the Task Force has progressed to introduce new innovative ISINs assigned by ANNA which are recognized by a new XT ISIN prefix. These are based on DTIs for digital assets that are not themselves financial instruments.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The ISO DTI standard for digital token identification continues to be adopted by crypto&nbsp;and digital asset market infrastructure and service providers and regulators. The&nbsp;European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) is anticipated to embed DTIs as the&nbsp;crypto-asset identifier under MiCA transparency reporting, order book, offering and&nbsp;record-keeping requirements. The ISO ISIN standard is already required by ESMA for&nbsp;reporting for MiFID II regulated financial instruments which would include tokenized&nbsp;securities.</span></p>
<p><span>As the world&rsquo;s largest open innovation platform supporting the development of best practices for the digital asset industry, GDF is delighted to strategically partner with ANNA and DTI Foundation to help drive awareness and adoption of market standards that help build stronger,&nbsp;</span><span>transparent, and more efficient bridges between traditional finance and the digital asset ecosystem.</span></p>
<p><span>Madeleine Boys, GDF Head of Programmes and Innovation says, &ldquo;Standards are key to unlocking efficiencies and driving transparency in financial markets.&nbsp;For regulators, global identification standards help bring consistency and transparency into new DLT markets. For market participants, this standard supports better effective risk management and has been commended by industry as a strong foundation for better interlinking digital finance and traditional finance.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>Commenting on the partnership, Stephan Dreyer, Managing Director at ANNA says, &ldquo;Since launch last year, the ANNA/DTI Foundation partnership has significantly progressed the introduction of new International Identification Securities Numbers (ISIN) to identify crypto assets to support industry transparency and interoperability. We are now delighted to be working with Global Digital Finance (GDF) to facilitate greater integration within wider industry communities."</span></p>
<p><span>Denis Dounaev, DTIF Product Owner adds, &ldquo;This partnership marks a significant milestone in our mission to increase transparency and standardization within the digital asset space. By aligning our efforts with ANNA and GDF, we are ensuring that digital assets are seamlessly integrated into the traditional financial system while also fostering greater trust and adoption of digital assets globally.&rdquo;</span></p>

<div> Gender Equality, Worldline, UK, Workplace, Business Strategy
<br />
Worldline IT Services UK listed in The Times Top 50 Employers for Gender Equality 2024, commitment to addressing gender inequalities, inclusive workplace culture.
<br /><br />Summary:
Worldline IT Services UK listed in The Times Top 50 Employers for Gender Equality 2024. Commitment to inclusive workplace culture, addressing gender inequalities. <div>
<p><span>Worldline [Euronext: WLN], a global leader in payment services, announces that its UK entity, Worldline IT Services UK Limited has been listed as one of The Times Top 50 Employers for Gender Equality 2024, for its commitment to addressing gender inequalities in the workplace.</span></p>
<p>The Times Top 50 Employers for Gender Equality is the UK&rsquo;s most highly profiled and well-established list of employers taking action and making gender equality part of their business strategy at all levels. While progress has been made to reduce inequalities in the workplace, gender inequalities are still prevalent in UK workplaces today, especially in times of economic disruption.</p>
<p>Business in the Community (BITC) has been running The Times Top 50 for 14 years, as part of its Gender Equality work, which focuses on equality for all genders and those who do not identify as a gender. The organisations featured in the list have taken a proactive approach to stamp out inequalities in their workplaces by creating action plans to address disparities ranging from pay to progression.</p>
<p>Applicants were assessed on the work they do to remove gender inequalities in the workplace, from flexible working to family friendly policies to pay, reward, and progression at work.</p>
<p>This is the third year in a row that Worldline UK has achieved this prestigious accolade.</p>
<p>Worldline is committed to making sure every colleague feels included and accepted. In 2020, Worldline IT Services UK Limited established its thriving Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Networks, each with Executive Sponsors. At Group level, Worldline UNITE, run by volunteers, is also open to all. UNITE aims to contribute to creating an inclusive culture, raising issues and sharing ideas. It &nbsp;provides information about Worldline&rsquo;s strategy, policy and developments. Employees across the UK have embraced these networks, with numerous events and webinars organised over the last four years to give people opportunities to learn more, engage and connect.</p>
<p>Worldline&rsquo;s priority is to ensure that employees feel empowered and are encouraged to perform at their best in a diverse, inclusive and inspiring workplace. Worldline has developed a comprehensive action plan to anchor fairness and transparency in its employees&rsquo; journey to better attract, retain, empower and develop women in the company, supported by its Trust 2025 CSR program.</p>
<blockquote><span>Johnny Astbury, CEO of Worldline IT Services UK Limited</span>&nbsp;said: &ldquo;<i>We&rsquo;re really humbled to receive a place on The Times Top 50 Employers for Gender Equality for the third year running. At the heart of our strategy we focus on our people and our planet. Embracing uniqueness and valuing all genders is a way of being, woven into everything we do. This public recognition highlights our pursuit of creating an environment in the workplace that truly is one of inclusion and diversity</i>.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;</blockquote>
<blockquote><span>Charlotte Woodworth, Gender Equality Director at Business in the Community,&nbsp;</span>said: &ldquo;<i>Being named as a Times Top 50 employer for gender equality demonstrates Worldline&rsquo;s commitment to driving a more equitable, inclusive world. But while the employers who made the list are doing great work prioritising gender equality, there is still more work to do. From addressing pay disparities to better supporting those with caring responsibilities, many employees, women among them, still face barriers to finding employment and progressing in their careers. It is every employer&rsquo;s responsibility to play their part in reducing and removing gender inequalities from the workplace, and research shows this isn&rsquo;t just the right thing to do, it also makes business sense.</i>&rdquo;</blockquote>

<div> Helvetia Pilot, tokenized securities, SIX Digital Exchange, wholesale central bank digital currency, Project Helvetia III <br />
Summary:<br />
The Swiss National Bank continues the Helvetia Pilot with tokenized securities settlement, expanding to include more financial institutions and transactions. This digital transformation enhances financial market efficiency and security. <div>
<p><span>Today, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) announced the continuation of the Helvetia Pilot focusing on tokenized securities settlement on SIX Digital Exchange (SDX) in Swiss franc digital central bank money for financial market participants (known as wholesale central bank digital currency &ndash; wCBDC). This comes after successfully demonstrating the efficient and safe settlement of tokenized assets in wCBDC during Project Helvetia III, which will run until the end of June this year. The next stage of the pilot aims at expanding the scope with the intention to gradually include additional financial institutions and to serve a broader range of financial market transactions.</span></p>
<div class="dombanner"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The continuation of the Helvetia Pilot marks a significant milestone, paving the way for wider adoption of the tokenized ecosystem. It allows financial market participants to continue settling tokenized securities transaction on SDX in central bank money and to explore the added value of tokenization and integrated settlement.</p>
<p>"This represents a major step forward in the financial industry's digital transformation,&rdquo; said Jos Dijsselhof, CEO, SIX. &ldquo;Pioneering the use of wholesale central bank digital currency goes beyond enhancing the efficiency and security of financial transactions, it is the groundwork for the future of finance. This project underscores our commitment to innovation and cements Switzerland&rsquo;s position at the forefront of digital asset adoption in capital markets."</p>
<p>David Newns, Head of SIX Digital Exchange, added: "Robust and scalable financial market infrastructure requires that wholesale transactions be settled in central bank money, the safest form of money. To fully utilize blockchain's potential, both the tokenized investment and the settlement asset must be on the same chain. Project Helvetia III demonstrated that SDX can meet these requirements. The participation of leading financial institutions and the issuance of seven digital bonds to date, totalling more than CHF 750 million, settled in wCBDC, highlights market confidence in our digital asset infrastructure. SDX continues to advance digital financial markets, with the continued Helvetia Pilot allowing more participants to adopt digital assets with on-chain wCBDC settlement.&rdquo;</p>

<div> ETF, ASX, Bitcoin, Australia, cryptocurrency <br />
Summary:<br />ASX admits its first spot Bitcoin ETF, responding to increased demand, backed by US master fund, providing regulated access for Australian investors. <div>
<p>ASX today announces the admission of its first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), marking a significant milestone in the Australian financial market and cryptocurrency industry.</p>
<div class="dombanner"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The admission of the VanEck Bitcoin ETF (ASX:VBTC) comes as crypto assets, such as Bitcoin and Ether, increasingly move into the investment mainstream, supported by increased regulatory guidance around the product category and growing consumer demand.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Andrew Campion, GM of Investment Products &amp; Strategy</b> said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re really pleased to admit the ASX&rsquo;s first Bitcoin ETF, responding to increased customer demand for access to cryptocurrency assets, and providing access to more investment options for Australians.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At ASX, a key part of our role is to ensure that investors can have confidence in trading securities and have certainty in the structure of their holdings. To achieve this, we&rsquo;ve been working on bringing a crypto asset ETF to market for a number of years, including establishing a new category of permissible underlying assets for ETFs in August 2022 which includes Bitcoin and Ether.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;While it has been possible to trade Bitcoin via crypto exchanges, trading units with exposure to Bitcoin via an ETF on an exchange like ASX means you&rsquo;re able to buy and sell those units through a traditional brokerage account, simplifying the process and opening the opportunity to more Australians.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>VBTC will be backed by a Bitcoin holding via a US domiciled master fund, ensuring that each unit of the ETF corresponds to a specific amount of Bitcoin. This structure aims to give investors exposure to the price of Bitcoin, providing investors with a robust and transparent reflection of the crypto asset's value.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the demand for digital assets continues to grow, we are proud to offer a regulated avenue for Australian investors to access the crypto asset market,&rdquo; Mr Campion said.</p>

<title>ISDA Responds To FSB Consultation On Liquidity Preparedness For Margin And Collateral Calls</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-responds-to-fsb-consultation-on-liquidity-preparedness-for-margin-and-colla/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-responds-to-fsb-consultation-on-liquidity-preparedness-for-margin-and-colla/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>On June 18, ISDA submitted a response to the Financial Stability Board&rsquo;s (FSB)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P170424.pdf">consultation on liquidity preparedness for margin and collateral calls</a>.</p>
<p>The response notes that the recommendations are generally sensible and seek to incorporate a proportionate and risk-based approach. It also highlights a number of considerations relevant to the non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI) sector&rsquo;s liquidity preparedness for margin and collateral calls.</p>
<p>First, due to the diverse nature of the NBFI sector, and the fact that many NBFIs and other non-bank market participants are already subject to financial and/or market regulation within their home jurisdictions, excessively prescriptive regulatory recommendations could, for a number of reasons, be inappropriate for all such firms across all geographies and market sectors.</p>
<p>Second, increased transparency in central counterparty margining practices, which has been addressed as part of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d568.pdf">consultation on transparency and responsiveness of initial margin in centrally cleared markets</a>&nbsp;from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures and the International Organization of Securities Commissions, is a critically important aspect of liquidity preparedness and will help NBFIs and other market participants to better prepare for potential margin calls in centrally cleared markets.</p>
<p>Third, liquidity preparedness by NBFIs is dependent in part on banks&rsquo; balance-sheet capacity and the ability of banks to perform their intermediation function in core funding and lending markets. With that in mind, regulators should weigh how any restrictions on that capacity will affect the liquidity preparedness of NBFIs and other market participants.</p>
<p>Fourth, to further help with liquidity preparedness, ISDA encourages the FSB, standard-setting bodies and authorities to consider ways to support extending the range of collateral that can be used to meet margin requirements. Building flexibility into collateral arrangements through wider collateral eligibility would also reduce the reliance on other sources of liquidity.</p>
<p>Fifth, ISDA agrees that financial institutions such as clearing members and intermediaries in bilateral transactions should perform robust due diligence on all their counterparties. However, intermediaries should not be the conduit for oversight of their counterparties.</p>
<p>Sixth, ISDA draws attention to ongoing industry efforts to further automate and standardize collateral management, where appropriate, through various mechanisms including but not limited to ISDA&rsquo;s collateral management suggested operational practices and the Common Domain Model.</p>
<p>Seventh, a number of key terms used in the consultation report may be interpreted ambiguously as they will likely mean different things to different types of NBFIs, standard-setting bodies and regulators. Inappropriate and ambiguous application of such terms could lead to an inconsistent regulatory framework, which could create competitive imbalances, regulatory arbitrage and inappropriately over-insure against liquidity risk, trapping too much cash or other highly liquid collateral, thus rendering it unavailable for investment in the real economy.</p>
<p>Finally, key data about derivatives activity and exposures is currently available to regulators in all major jurisdictions, due to mandated derivatives reporting requirements, via derivatives trade repositories that have been established over the past decade. ISDA support the FSB&rsquo;s recommendation in its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P060923-2.pdf">report on the financial stability implications of leverage</a>&nbsp;to make &ldquo;more intensive use of existing data, such as those available in trade repositories&rdquo; and urges regulators to optimize their use of the data they currently receive before they consider imposing additional requirements.</p>

<div> Innovate Finance, CISI, Certificate in Ethical AI, partnership, fintech
Summary:<br /><br />Innovate Finance partners with CISI to offer members Certificate in Ethical AI, supporting ethical and responsible AI use in financial services. <div>
<p>The UK&rsquo;s industry body for the fintech community, Innovate Finance, has confirmed it will be distributing the<b><i> </i></b><a href="https://www.cisi.org/cisiweb2/cisi-website/study-with-us/professional-assessments/Certificate-in-Ethical-Artificial-Intelligence"><b>CISI&rsquo;s Certificate in Ethical Artificial Intelligence (AI)</b></a><b><i> </i></b>to its membership.</p>
<p>This new partnership means that the CISI&rsquo;s Certificate in Ethical AI will be added to the Innovate Finance elearning programme and made available to all Innovate Finance members.</p>
<p>Educational charity and professional body the CISI has a global membership of over 53,000 based in over 100 countries. The Institute offers qualifications and lifelong elearning opportunities for those working or aspiring to work in the capital markets, financial planning and wealth management professions.</p>
<p>The CISI launched its Certificate in Ethical Artificial Intelligence (AI) in November 2023 as part of its campaign to champion ethics and transparency in the use of AI. The certificate was introduced as part of an ethical AI initiative by the City of London Lord Mayor Michael Mainelli, Chartered FCSI(Hon), with key input from the Lord Mayor&rsquo;s steering group for this project.</p>
<p>Since its launch, 3,000 professionals, 7 financial services regulators and 4 central banks in 50 countries have registered for the CISI Certificate in Ethical Artificial Intelligence (AI).</p>
<p>Machine Learning/AI is listed as a priority future skill for the UK financial services sector by the Financial Services Skills Commission (FSSC) in&nbsp;<a href="https://financialservicesskills.org/news/demand-for-data-ai-and-tech-skills-increases-across-financial-services-future-skills-report-2024/#:~:text=24%20April%202024-,Demand%20for%20data%2C%20AI%20and%20tech%20skills%20increases%20across,services%20%2D%20Future%20Skills%20Report%202024.&amp;text=Demand%20for%20technology%20and%20data,Services%20Skills%20Commission%20(FSSC).">its recent report</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Janine Hirt" src="https://mondovisione.com/_assets/images/Janine-Hirt.jpg" title="Janine Hirt" /></p>
<p>Janine Hirt, above, CEO of Innovate Finance said: &ldquo;We are delighted to be partnering with CISI to&nbsp; offer our members the CISI Certificate in Ethical Artificial Intelligence. Our world-leading UK fintech sector has always led the way in harnessing new technology to improve the financial services industry for consumers across the country. This course will provide our members with an in-depth understanding of the fundamental ethical and management issues in the deployment of artificial intelligence, helping to ensure we utilise this technology in a safe and responsible way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tanveer Bhatti, group head of Model Risk Management at Revolut said: &ldquo;At Revolut, understanding AI ethics is vital for ensuring the safety and trust of our customers who use our banking app. We've subscribed our senior leaders to the CISI and Innovate Finance AI certificate, allowing them to upskill and reinforcing our commitment to responsible AI use and customer protection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tracy Vegro OBE, CISI CEO said<b>: </b>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great privilege to be working alongside our partners Innovate Finance and to support them with their vision to boost the understanding of ethics in AI for their members. This is the first of many future digital skills and financial literacy projects we will be collaborating on with Innovate Finance. Innovation and integrity need to go hand in hand and AI systems rely on large amounts of data, which raises privacy concerns. Without ethical guidelines and regulations in place, the misuse or mishandling of data can result in harm to individuals or groups.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want to support the fintech and professional services practitioner community to understand that AI systems need to be transparent, accountable and inclusive. As AI becomes more advanced and widespread, there are growing concerns about issues such as bias, transparency, accountability, safety, and employment trends. If people do not believe that AI is being developed and used in a responsible and ethical manner, they hesitate to use or interact with beneficial technologies. This course will help Innovate Finance members understand the issues and opportunities posed by AI in financial services."</p>
<p>The certificate will become available to Innovate Finance members on 1 July 2024.</p>

<title>ICE Midland WTI (HOU) Hits Record Open Interest As Market Participants Expand Positions In ICE HOU</title>

<div> ICE, Midland WTI, open interest, futures contract, Houston<br />
Summary:<br />
ICE's HOU crude futures contract hit record open interest. Customers benefit from margin offsets and flexibility in delivery locations and dates. <div>
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE: ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today announced that its ICE Midland WTI (ICE:HOU) crude futures contract hit record open interest of 158,208 contracts on June 13, 2024, after market participants last week added over 100,000 lots of HOU to their books.</p>
<p>ICE HOU has grown from average daily volume (ADV) of 1,794 in 2022, to ADV of 6,695 contracts in 2023, to record ADV of 27,560 during the month of May 2024.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Customers are moving positions to ICE HOU as the contract offers them greater optionality,&rdquo; said Jeff Barbuto, Global Head of Oil Markets at ICE. &ldquo;The Houston market has changed fundamentally since price reporting agencies started assessing Midland WTI in Houston roughly 15 years ago. Since then, production shipped to Houston has surged, infrastructure has expanded to multiple times its previous capacity, the U.S. export ban was lifted, all contributing to the U.S. exporting on average 4.2 million barrels per day, with the majority of that being Midland WTI.&rdquo;</p>
<p>ICE HOU pricing reflects current fundamentals in Houston, delivering physical crude into two of the biggest crude oil systems on the U.S. Gulf Coast, the ONEOK Magellan East Houston (MEH) and Enterprise Crude Houston (ECHO) terminals. Both are connected to Platts-approved water terminals to deliver Midland WTI into Brent. HOU is the only exchange-guaranteed source of ratably deliverable Midland WTI, with the quality spec of HOU matching the Platts spec for Midland WTI.</p>
<p>Over 12 million barrels of crude are being delivered against HOU futures each month. This includes EFPs (Exchange for Physicals), which allows customers the flexibility to deliver barrels to other locations, as well as flexible delivery dates. Meanwhile, ICE HOU time spreads, as well as spreads with Brent and WTI Cushing (Domestic Sweet), help customers mitigate price risk between locations and grades.</p>
<p>Customers can benefit from margin offsets as high as 98% when clearing HOU alongside other oil positions cleared at ICE. Offsets are available across a range of over 800 oil contracts, including ICE Brent, ICE Gasoil, ICE WTI (Cushing), ICE Dubai (Platts), and ICE Murban, as well as NY Harbor RBOB Gasoline and Heating Oil.</p>
<p>Across ICE&rsquo;s global oil complex, open interest stands at 14.4 million contracts, up 24% y/y. Alongside record highs in Midland WTI, ICE&rsquo;s WTI (Cushing) futures contract hit record open interest of 793,288 contracts on June 10, 2024. Oil is one part of ICE&rsquo;s extensive global commodity markets where OI stands at 62 million contracts, up 26% y/y. Meanwhile, ICE&rsquo;s total futures and options hit record open interest of 98.4 million contracts on June 13, 2024.</p>

<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) publishes today the package of technical standards and guidelines under MiCAR on the topics of reporting, liquidity stress testing and supervisory colleges. This package completes the delivery of EBA technical standards under MiCAR. The package of EBA regulatory products comprises:</span></p>
<div class="dombanner"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><ol>
<li>
<p><span>Final draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) on the use of asset-referenced tokens (ARTs) and electronic money tokens (EMTs) denominated in a non-EU currency as a means of exchange.</span>&nbsp;The draft RTS specify the methodology to be applied by issuers of ARTs and of EMTs denominated in a non-EU currency for estimating the number and value of transactions associated to uses of these tokens &ldquo;as a means of exchange&rdquo;, for the purpose of the reporting under MiCAR. The drat RTS aim at contributing to the objective of MiCAR of monitoring and preventing risks that the wide use of ARTs and of EMTs denominated in a non-EU currency as a means of exchange may have on monetary policy transmission and monetary sovereignty within the EU.</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<div><ol start="2">
<li>
<p><span>Final draft Implementing Technical Standards (ITS) on the reporting obligations of issuers of ARTs and EMTs denominated in a non-EU currency, and of crypto-asset service providers (CASPs).</span>&nbsp;The final draft ITS provide specific templates and related instructions for the issuers of ARTs and of EMTs denominated in a non-EU currency to comply with their reporting obligations. These reporting templates will assist the significance assessment of the tokens; provide information on whether the threshold defined in Article 23 of MiCAR has been met, therefore restricting the issuance of a token; and being the only reporting obligation set out in MiCAR for the issuer, serves general supervisory reporting purposes as well. The draft ITS also provide templates and related instructions that CASPs must provide to issuers of ARTs and of EMTs denominated in a non-EU currency.

<p>Finansinspektionen has investigated whether Nasdaq Stockholm, in conjunction with four major company events in 2021 and 2022, met its obligations to maintain effective arrangements, systems and procedures in its trade monitoring and to report suspected insider dealing to the authority pursuant to Article 16(1) of the EU Market Abuse Regulation (MAR) and Chapter 13, section 7 of the Securities Market Act.</p>
<p>Finansinspektionen also investigated whether Nasdaq Stockholm, on two occasions in 2022 and 2023, initiated trading in financial instruments on Nasdaq Stockholm's regulated market in violation of Chapter 13, section 3 of the Securities Market Act since Finansinspektionen had not approved and registered prospectuses for the instruments.</p>
<p>The investigations show that, in conjunction with the four company events, there have been deficiencies in how Nasdaq Stockholm has conducted its trading monitoring, which should prevent, identify and report insider dealing. The investigations also show that Nasdaq Stockholm on two occasions initiated trading in financial instruments in violation of the regulatory framework. Nasdaq Stockholm has hereby disregarded its obligations pursuant to Article 16(1) of MAR and Chapter 13, section 3 of the Securities Market Act.</p>
<p>Finansinspektionen makes the assessment that the violations have been of such a nature that there are grounds on which to intervene against Nasdaq Stockholm. However, the violations are not so serious that there are grounds on which to withdraw the stock exchange's authorisation or issue the stock exchange a warning. Finansinspektionen is therefore issuing Nasdaq Stockholm a remark and an administrative fine of SEK 100 million.</p>

<title>Hong Kong Securities And Futures Commission’s 35th Year And Beyond: Guiding Hong Kong’s Capital Markets With Mission And Vision</title>

<div> Initiatives, Resilience, Growth, Market Integrity, Global Collaboration
<br />
The SFC's Annual Report showcases initiatives to promote market growth, uphold integrity, and enhance global collaboration for Hong Kong's capital markets.
<br /><br />Summary:
The Annual Report highlights initiatives, market resilience, global collaboration, and market integrity. It also emphasizes advancing Hong Kong's super-connector role. <div>
<p>The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) marks its 35-year history as the guardian of Hong Kong&rsquo;s capital markets with today&rsquo;s publication of its&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.sfc.hk/-/media/EN/files/COM/Annual-Report/2023-24/SFC-Annual-Report-2023-24_EN.pdf?rev=36fededb4a204061b4a6b3a836c6c80e" target="_blank">Annual Report 2023-24</a></em>.</p>
<p>The Annual Report highlights various initiatives to promote the resilience and sustainable growth of Hong Kong&rsquo;s capital markets to cement its position as an international financial centre. It also lays out the SFC&rsquo;s roadmap to prepare the capital markets for future opportunities as well as challenges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SFC&rsquo;s Chairman Mr Tim Lui said: &ldquo;The achievements we made and valuable experience gained over the years will stand us in good stead to steer Hong Kong&rsquo;s capital markets. To this end, we remain steadfast in our commitment to ensuring market integrity and resilience in the face of emerging trends and new challenges at the local, regional and global levels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SFC&rsquo;s Chief Executive Officer Ms Julia Leung said: &ldquo;To remain a world-class regulator and lead Hong Kong&rsquo;s capital markets to new heights in decades to come, the SFC must strengthen its dual role as protector and enabler, by staying agile and vigilant as well as harnessing new opportunities from sustainability and new technologies, without compromising investor protection.&rdquo;<span></span></p>
<p>Advancing Hong Kong&rsquo;s super-connector role has remained one of the SFC&rsquo;s top initiatives. With the recent measures announced by the China Securities Regulatory Commission to support the city&rsquo;s market developments, the SFC is making efforts with all parties to launch these measures, in order to deepen Mainland-Hong Kong mutual market access. It is also striving to connect with new markets to diversify the sources of the city&rsquo;s capital and listings. Senior management&rsquo;s first official visit to the Middle East earlier in June has paved the way for further regional market collaboration.</p>
<p>The flagship Stock Connect scheme, which celebrates its 10th anniversary, has recorded a 20-fold advance in average daily trading since 2014. ETF Connect has also spurred overall ETF market turnover since its mid-2022 launch, boosting ETFs&rsquo; share to 14% of Main Board turnover in the first quarter of 2024 from 5% in 2021. Through its debut year, Swap Connect, which strengthens the city&rsquo;s role as an offshore risk management hub, has seen its overseas participants more than double and average daily turnover quadruple.</p>
<p>To lead financial market transformation via technology and scale up the Web3 ecosystem in Hong Kong, the SFC has authorised the city&rsquo;s first tokenised retail gold product, as well as Asia&rsquo;s first batch of virtual asset (VA) spot ETFs for retail access. These ETFs have a total market capitalisation of more than US$300 million with orderly trading and decent daily turnover since their launch. The SFC has made sure investors are protected through wide-ranging safeguards to foster a resilient VA ecosystem.</p>
<p>Tremendous enforcement efforts have also been made to uphold market integrity. Following the SFC&rsquo;s investigation, individuals involved in a highly sophisticated market manipulation case were convicted in a landmark High Court jury trial in May. The criminal prosecution marks the first time that an offence under the Securities and Futures Ordinance has been tried at the Court of First Instance. Separately, a case against two suspected core members of a large-scale ramp and dump syndicate was transferred to the District Court following the SFC&rsquo;s investigation. This marks the first ramp and dump criminal prosecution at the District Court.<span></span></p>
<p>Internationally, the SFC actively participates in global standard-setting work through the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO). In May, Ms Leung began her two-year tenure as Chair of the IOSCO Asia-Pacific Regional Committee to help ensure the Asian voice is heard globally. As a champion of sustainable finance, the SFC is working closely with the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong on taking a proportionate local approach to implement the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards, to help the city become an early adopter of global standards and ride on transition finance opportunities. To lead by example and encourage transparent disclosure of carbon footprint by Hong Kong&rsquo;s corporates, the SFC also discloses its Scope 1-3 emissions for the first time in this annual report.</p>
<p>For the SFC&rsquo;s key operational data for the financial year of 2023-24, please refer to the Appendix of this press release.</p>
<p>The Annual Report, together with&nbsp;<a href="https://d3nv6maja2jqhl.cloudfront.net/SFC_ENG_V4_140624.mp4" target="_blank">a video message</a>, is now available on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sfc.hk/en/Published-resources/Corporate-publications/Annual-reports" target="_blank">SFC website</a>, as well as its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/sfchkofficial/" target="_blank">Facebook</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/2495159/admin/feed/posts/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sfc.hk/en/WeChat" target="_blank">WeChat</a>&nbsp;pages.</p>

<title>Private Economy: Advancing To A New Stage | Preview Of The Theme Weeks For The 2023 Briefings On Performance Of Shenzhen Stock Exchange-Listed Companies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Private economy is the driving force behind the Chinese path to modernization, and listed private-owned enterprises (POEs) are an important foundation for the high-quality development of the capital market. The report to the 20th CPC National Congress emphasized the need to optimize the development environment for private enterprises and promote the growth of the private economy. During this year's Two Sessions, General Secretary Xi Jinping once again stressed the importance of the policy of "two unswervinglys", namely unswervingly consolidating and developing the public sector and unswervingly encouraging, supporting and guiding the development of the non-public sector. This aims to stimulate the intrinsic motivation and innovative vitality of various types of market entities.<span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE) earnestly implements the decisions and arrangements of the&nbsp;CPC&nbsp;Central Committee and the State Council to promote the development and growth of the private economy. We continue to implement the requirements of the CSRC's "Three-Year Action Plan to Promote the Improvement of the Quality of Listed Companies (2022-2025)". To support the high-quality development of SZSE-listed POEs, we have formulated a "Work Plan to Support POEs in Focusing on Core Businesses and Ensuring Stable Development".&nbsp;It&nbsp;actively guides private enterprises to focus on their core businesses and develop steadily, thereby fully boosting confidence in the development of the private economy, and laying a solid foundation for capital market reform and development.</p>
<p>Currently, SZSE has gathered over 2,100 listed POEs, accounting for over 70% of SZSE-listed companies. Their total market value is approximately 20 trillion yuan, accounting for 68% of the total market value of SZSE-listed companies. Moreover, on the ChiNext board, POEs account for over 80% of the total, and under the registration-based IPO system, more than 90% of the newly listed companies are POEs. High-quality listed POEs have become a distinctive feature and important pillar of the SZSE market. Empowered by the capital market, SZSE-listed POEs have shown strong resilience and vitality, with stable and improving performance trends. In 2023,&nbsp;the&nbsp;SZSE-listed POEs achieved a total operating revenue of 9.56 trillion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 6.63%. 1,485 POEs achieved profitability, with a net profit of 449.8 billion yuan. Furthermore, a number of innovative "leaders" and industrial "pioneers" emerged&nbsp;and&nbsp;more than 10 POEs&nbsp;achieved&nbsp;a market value of over 100 billion yuan.</p>
<p>On May 16, SZSE will host a collective&nbsp;briefing on performance themed&nbsp;"Private Economy: Advancing to&nbsp;a&nbsp;New Stage" in the listing hall. We will invite companies including Tri_Ring Group, Lingyi iTech, Delton Technology, Newland,&nbsp;and&nbsp;CNGR to participate, and communicate with investors through a combination of online and offline channels. SZSE will provide online interactive Q&amp;A services, online text and image communication, and synchronous video broadcasting through the Easy IR platform.</p>
<p>During the theme week, a number of listed POEs such as TGOOD, Tengyuan Cobalt, Kehua Data, Mingyang Electric will also hold online&nbsp;briefings&nbsp;(the specific information is subject to company notices). At the&nbsp;briefing, each company's core members including the Chairman, General Manager, Finance Director, Board Secretary, and Independent Directors will analyze the company's performance, answer investors' questions, listen to investors' suggestions, and help investors gain a deeper understanding of the company's situation. We look forward to all investors' continued attention and active participation.&nbsp;</p>

<title>DEAC &amp; DLC Data Centers Strengthen Position In Northern Europe With New Brand Delska</title>

<div> merger, Delska, data center, network expertise, infrastructure expansion
<br />
DEAC and DLC merge to form Delska, offering IT solutions, green energy, new data center construction, and comprehensive services.
<br /><br />Summary: Delska formed from DEAC and DLC merger, offering IT solutions, green energy, new data center construction, and comprehensive services. <div>
<p><b>DEAC</b><b>&nbsp;and Data Logistics Center (DLC) celebrate 25 years of data center and network expertise by merging into a joint brand, Delska. This strategic merger will benefit businesses, offering sophisticated solutions for reliable operations of IT infrastructure and networks across multiple locations.</b></p>
<div dir="ltr" id="dvprnejpgf62aleft"><img align="middle" alt="DEAC and DLC merged into a new brand Delska." id="prnejpgf62aleft" src="https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2441990/DEAC_and_DLC.jpg" title="DEAC and DLC merged into a new brand Delska." /></div>
<p>Both companies have been part of the Baltic Rezo group, owned by Swiss Quaero European Infrastructure Fund II and managed by Quaero Capital since 2020, accelerating development and infrastructure expansion. The legal entities will stay the same.</p>
<p>Andris Gailitis, DEAC and DLC CEO, comments: "We are embarking on an exciting rebranding journey, which involves closer cooperation between companies and an expanded services portfolio to meet IT challenges of our customers from over 40 countries. The heart of the new brand is customers and personal approach to their business. Our strength lies in custom solutions for specific business and industry needs."</p>
<p>Delska's values are openness, flexibility, and reliability. Both companies still emphasize security, quality, and sustainability by using green energy and Neste MY diesel from HVO for backup power generators.</p>
<p>AI boom, increased demand for large-scale data processing, edge and high-power computing have accelerated the construction of data centers. To keep up with the lack of power capacities in major European hubs, a new 10 MW data center in Latvia is under construction. It will be one of the region's most sustainable, with LEED and Tier III certifications, scheduled for launch in 2025. Flexible options of up to 100kW per rack and 1000 racks are available for pre-booking, and the construction project can be adapted by expanding up to 50 MW.</p>
<p>Delska's growth plans include building a new data center in Lithuania, and additional players joining the group soon to build a strong regional data center and network ecosystem. Several owned data centers in Riga and Vilnius and points of presence in Frankfurt, Amsterdam, and Stockholm ensure customers' business continuity with disaster recovery solutions.</p>
<p>Delska offers a comprehensive range of IT services &ndash; cloud, dedicated servers, security, network solutions, and managed services. "In addition to currently available virtual machine deployment on our self-service platform, built for SMBs, developers, and startups, this year we will implement instant bare metal service to simplify IT people's lives even further," emphasis A. Gailitis.</p>

<div> FCA, review, treatment, PEPs, financial services<br />
Summary:<br />
FCA launched a review of PEP treatment, delayed publication due to election, compliance with anti-money laundering legislation, separate from bank account closure data request. <div>
<p>Last year, the FCA launched a review of the treatment of domestic Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) by financial services firms.</p>
<p>We had been on track to publish the findings from this review in line with the end of June deadline set in the Financial Services and Markets Act 2023.</p>
<p>However, we do not think it is appropriate to publish the review during the pre-election period. We will now publish it in July once Parliament has returned.</p>

<title>Financial Advice In A Changing World - Opening Remarks By ASIC Commissioner Alan Kirkland At The Professional Planner Licensee Summit, 18 June 2024</title>

<div> Enforcement, Retirement outcomes, Reportable situations, IDR framework, Experienced provider pathway
<br />
ASIC's priorities include enforcement, regulation and support for good retirement outcomes. They focus on reportable situations, IDR, and experienced provider pathway.
<br /><br />Summary: 
ASIC's priorities include enforcement to address misconduct, regulation for retirement outcomes, and support for reforms such as the experienced provider pathway. <div>
<h2>KEY POINTS</h2>
<ul>
<li>ASIC Commissioner Alan Kirkland addressed financial advice licensees at the Professional Planner Licensee Summit about ASIC&rsquo;s priorities and current work in the area of financial advice.</li>
<li>As millions of Australians head towards retirement age, the number of people who need trusted financial advice is growing. ASIC will continue to have strong focus on supporting good retirement incomes for these Australians.</li>
<li>ASIC supports the Government&rsquo;s objective of improving access to high quality and affordable advice to Australians through the Delivering Better Financial Outcomes, and will consider providing regulatory guidance once the reforms are passed by Parliament.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd like to begin by acknowledging the Traditional Owners of the land on which we meet today, the Dharug and Gundungurra people, and paying my respects to Elders past and present.</p>
<p>I am really pleased to be here in this exciting post-lunch slot to discuss ASIC&rsquo;s priorities and current work in relation to financial advice.</p>
<p>I thought I&rsquo;d cover three key areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our focus and our priorities in enforcement.</li>
<li>Our progress in bedding down some new reforms, including in relation to reportable situations and internal dispute resolution.</li>
<li>Our broader work in supporting good retirement outcomes for Australians.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before I joined CHOICE as CEO around 12 years ago in my last role, I had little to do with debates about financial advice regulation.</p>
<p>As I was going for the role, the FoFA [Future of Financial Advice] reforms had recently been settled, after many months &ndash; if not years &ndash; of debate and inquiries through Parliament. But I remember saying in one of my job interviews that, I suspect that the debate about advice regulation isn't over.</p>
<p>That was a bit of a throwaway line at the time &ndash; but I didn&rsquo;t realise at the time how prescient that observation might be.</p>
<p>In the 12 years since then, we&rsquo;ve seen:</p>
<ul>
<li>the debate about repealing the FoFA reforms</li>
<li>the Life Insurance Framework reforms of 2018</li>
<li>the establishment of FASEA and implementation of the Professional Standards Reforms</li>
<li>the Financial Services Royal Commission and the wave of reform, both broadly across financial services and specific financial advice that came out of it</li>
<li>the disbanding of FASEA</li>
<li>the Quality of Advice Review</li>
<li>and now, the Delivering Better Financial Outcomes [DBFO] process that is underway now in response to the Quality of Advice recommendations.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of change in 12 years, almost all of it subject to heavily contested debate.</p>
<p>And maybe we shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised about that.</p>
<p>Access to good advice &ndash; safe advice &ndash; is important to people who need it. While not every Australian will want or need financial advice, when they do, they need to be able to receive advice that they can trust.</p>
<p>Also the number of people who need advice is growing. Three million Australians will become eligible to start drawing upon their superannuation in the next decade &ndash; on top of the six million who are already at or above superannuation preservation age<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/financial-advice-in-a-changing-world/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span>[1]</span></a>. And as the superannuation system continues to mature, more of those people will be retiring with larger balances.</p>
<p>That reinforces the importance of ensuring that protection for consumers of financial advice is appropriate &ndash; because in the worst cases, when financial advice goes wrong, people can lose their entire retirement savings, and that can be devastating for the individuals involved.</p>
<p>And from my work on these issues over time, nothing brings that point home more clearly than having talked to people in that situation &ndash; people at or around retirement, who suddenly found themselves with no retirement savings, having thought that they had set themselves up for maybe not a super comfortable retirement, but one that would be adequate, and then instead discovering that they're probably going to be dependent on the age pension, with poor advice having played a significant role in that. That&rsquo;s the risk we&rsquo;re always trying to protect against.</p>
<h2>The industry today</h2>
<p>I reflected on the last decade or so of reform &ndash; where does that leave the industry today?</p>
<p>I think there are some signs of stabilisation.</p>
<p>As discussed this morning, while there has been a significant contraction in the number of advisers since the introduction of the professional standards reforms in particular, there are some signs that this trend may be easing.</p>
<p>There were exactly 15,663 advisers registered with ASIC as at 1 March 2024, and while this is around 9,000 less than the long-term average prior to 2019, it represents a decline of only 36 since 30 June 2023 &ndash; so there's some signs that trend may be stabilising.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also got the experienced provider pathway coming online and new financial advisers undertaking their professional year, so I think these numbers will be interesting to watch over the next few years.</p>
<p>But at the same time, it seems like there might be more structural reform on the way.</p>
<p>While the detail of the Delivering Better Financial Outcomes proposal to introduce a new class of adviser is still being worked through, it is likely to lead to a significant expansion in the number of firms that offer some kind of advice and the number of people involved in providing it.</p>
<p>Super funds will play an even bigger role in the provision of advice &ndash; and as is the case currently, this will likely involve a range of insourced and outsourced models. And of course, there is growing speculation that some of the major banks may make some kind of return to wealth management.</p>
<p>In the context of all that, ASIC is taking a close interest in the DBFO reforms, as is the case with any reform to laws that we administer. We support the Government&rsquo;s objective of improving access to high quality and affordable advice to Australians.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t make government policy decisions or design regulatory reform, despite what you might sometimes read in Professional Planner. That is a job for the Government, guided by Treasury advice. But we do work with Treasury of course through the process, as do a range of industry bodies, bringing to the task our many years of insight and experience in overseeing and regulating the financial advice industry.</p>
<p>And once these reforms have passed through the Parliament, we&rsquo;ll be considering where there&rsquo;s a case for regulatory guidance to provide greater certainty around the way in which we interpret and apply the law.</p>
<h2>ASIC&rsquo;s focus</h2>
<p>With that context of further reform on the way, I thought it might be useful to talk about ASIC&rsquo;s priorities, in terms of enforcement and regulation.</p>
<p>While you know us as the financial services regulator, and you see the detailed work we do in relation to financial advice, we are also Australia&rsquo;s corporate, markets, and consumer credit regulator.</p>
<p>We've got one of the broadest remits of financial services or corporate regulators in the world. We have got finite resources, and that means that we need to prioritise what we focus on and how we use those resources.</p>
<p>In doing so, we aim to focus on the most serious threats and harms we see in the system as a whole &ndash; to ensure we are directing our resources to where they are needed most.</p>
<p>Setting priorities and understanding those threats and harms is quite a detailed process. It involves analysing the multiple sources of data available to us, talking to our peer regulators internationally, talking to industry bodies, looking at the reports of misconduct that come to us and also talking to our advisory panels, which include a number of industry representatives.</p>
<p>Retirement outcomes is one of our strategic priorities for the current financial year and while priorities for 2024&ndash;25 will be announced early in the new financial year, I can confidently say there will continue to be a strong focus on supporting good retirement incomes for Australians.</p>
<h3>Enforcement</h3>
<p>Alongside these strategic priorities, we also set annual enforcement priorities. These typically cover the calendar year, with the 2024 priorities having been announced at the ASIC Forum in November last year.</p>
<p>Of interest to this audience, the current enforcement priorities include:</p>
<ul>
<li>misconduct resulting in the systemic erosion of superannuation balances</li>
<li>compliance with the reportable situations regime, and</li>
<li>our enduring priority of systemic compliance failures by large financial institutions resulting in widespread consumer harm.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In pursuing these priorities, we are incredibly active. As our Chair [Joe Longo] frequently says, we are in court rooms around the country almost every day of the legal year, often in many court rooms on the same day, pursuing cases against individuals and firms, small and large.</p>
<p>The laws we administer carry a broad range of potential criminal, civil and administrative consequences &ndash; from issuing public warnings through to terms of imprisonment. We use this broad toolkit in a calibrated and proportionate manner to address misconduct.</p>
<p>So far this financial year, we have removed, restricted, or banned 49 people or companies from providing financial services across a range of sectors (figures to May 29, 2024) &ndash; the equivalent of almost one every week.</p>
<p>The circumstances in each case vary &ndash; including insolvency, dishonest conduct, providing advice that&rsquo;s not in the best interests of clients, or providing inappropriate advice &ndash; but each case fundamentally represents a threat to trust in our financial services system.</p>
<p>We take a risk-based approach to our enforcement activities. We&rsquo;re always looking to target our legal efforts to the matters that can have the broadest reach or send the most powerful deterrence message.</p>
<p>That obviously sometimes involves action against larger firms, where misconduct may often lead to larger scale harm to consumers. You&rsquo;ll see that demonstrated in several recent actions against:</p>
<ul>
<li>'licensee for hire' firm Lanterne Fund Services<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/financial-advice-in-a-changing-world/#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><span>[2]</span></a>&nbsp;for breaching its AFS licence obligations (although I would say Lanterne was large in the number of authorised reps operating under its banner but ultimately only had one full-time employee, so not sure if we should classify as small or large &ndash; large certainly in terms of its impact on consumers)</li>
<li>RM Capital<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/financial-advice-in-a-changing-world/#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><span>[3]</span></a>&nbsp;for failing to ensure its authorised representative, SMSF Club, did not accept conflicted remuneration, and</li>
<li>Mercer Financial Advice<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/financial-advice-in-a-changing-world/#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><span>[4]</span></a>, for failing in its fee disclosure obligations and charging fees to customers it was not entitled to charge.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes, this involves actions against smaller firms or individual advisers &ndash; for instance, our actions against David Valvo,<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/financial-advice-in-a-changing-world/#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"><span>[5]</span></a>&nbsp;Brett Gordon<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/financial-advice-in-a-changing-world/#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"><span>[6]</span></a>&nbsp;or Mark Cooper.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/financial-advice-in-a-changing-world/#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"><span>[7]</span></a>&nbsp;In fact, half of the companies and individuals we have removed, restricted, or banned this financial year had an estimated business revenue of less than $1 million.</p>
<p>I make this point because there&rsquo;s often a suggestion which I think was reflected in some of the discussion this morning that we don&rsquo;t take action to address this conduct by individuals or smaller firms. This data demonstrates that we can and do take action against a broad range of firms and, where appropriate, against individuals involved in the management or governance of firms involved in misconduct.</p>
<h3>Reform</h3>
<h4>Reportable situations regime</h4>
<p>One of the enforcement priorities that I mentioned a moment ago was compliance with the reportable situations regime.</p>
<p>This regime was a key recommendation of the Financial Services Royal Commission. It was intended to be a key source of regulatory intelligence for ASIC to feed into the decision making around where we apply our resources, so it is really important to us that it operates effectively.</p>
<p>The regime has now been in effect for almost three years &ndash; but the proportion of licensees that have submitted a report is very low,<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/financial-advice-in-a-changing-world/#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"><span>[8]</span></a>&nbsp;which suggests some still may not be complying with their obligations.</p>
<p>There has been little improvement on this since our first report on this in 2022,<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/financial-advice-in-a-changing-world/#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9"><span>[9]</span></a>&nbsp;which is one of the reasons we have made it an enforcement priority for 2024.</p>
<p>Our surveillance on this remains active and ongoing but we have spent the past two years warning licensees to lift their game &ndash; and my message today is that we&rsquo;re not going to spend the next two years doing the same.</p>
<p>Where we find evidence of non-compliance, we will take the appropriate action &ndash; including enforcement action, where necessary.</p>
<h4>IDR framework</h4>
<p>Another key new source of data to inform our work is in relation to internal dispute resolution [IDR] data &ndash; although I would acknowledge that the IDR reporting regime is much newer.</p>
<p>Smaller financial firms were required to submit their IDR reports to ASIC for the first time this year.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/financial-advice-in-a-changing-world/#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"><span>[10]</span></a></p>
<p>This means on 1 January, all in-scope financial firms &ndash; around 8,700 in total &ndash; were due to report Internal Dispute Resolution data to ASIC.</p>
<p>This provides us &ndash; for the first time &ndash; with a picture of how the full spectrum of Australian financial firms are dealing with consumer and small business complaints under their internal dispute resolution procedures &ndash; the good, the bad, and everything in between.</p>
<p>We intend to use it to inform our work &ndash; but consistent with the recommendations of the Ramsay Review, which proposed these reforms, we also intend to publish some of that data.</p>
<p>Now that all financial firms have commenced reporting, we expect to publish some observations from the initial data collections later this year, as well as providing feedback to industry, to improve the quality and consistency of reporting.</p>
<p>Over time, you should expect the breadth and depth of data that we publish to increase, so we encourage you to be doing what you can now to make sure that your data is accurate and comprehensive.</p>
<h4>Experienced provider pathway</h4>
<p>The other key reform that I want to briefly touch on is the experienced provider pathway.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s important in the context of some of the big structural reforms I noted earlier, because it is obviously a mechanism to retain experienced advisers in the industry.</p>
<p>We have recently issued new guidance to support advisers and licensees to access the pathway.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/financial-advice-in-a-changing-world/#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11"><span>[11]</span></a></p>
<p>We have also updated our IT systems, so from 1 July, licensees can begin lodging notifications where they have received a written declaration from an adviser who is relying on the pathway. I hope that that is a relatively simple process but as always, our team is happy to answer any questions you may have as you engage this process.</p>
<h3>Regulation</h3>
<p>Before pausing, I thought it might be helpful to touch on a few aspects of our recent regulatory work that have attracted a lot of attention and interest.</p>
<h4>Choice super report</h4>
<p>The first is our work on choice super products &ndash; articulated in&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-779-superannuation-and-choice-products-what-focus-is-there-on-performance/" title="REP 779 Superannuation and choice products: What focus is there on performance?">Report 779</a>&nbsp;<em>Superannuation choice products: What focus is there on performance?</em>&nbsp;released in February.</p>
<p>As I noted earlier, ensuring good retirement outcomes is a strategic priority this year &ndash; and one that will continue into next year.</p>
<p>While good retirement outcomes aren&rsquo;t all about financial advice, obviously advice has a big role to play &ndash; and Report 779 shows that there&rsquo;s still more work to do.</p>
<p>So, in this report, we examined the practices of advisers, licensees and superannuation trustees in situations where choice products had persistently underperformed against the benchmarks disclosed in their product disclosure statements (PDS).</p>
<p>I just want to emphasise that point &ndash; this was about the benchmarks set in the product&rsquo;s product disclosure statements and it was about persistent underperformance, not over one or two years.</p>
<p>We found in some cases, clients were not told their investment options were persistently underperforming and that there may have been better alternatives available.</p>
<p>To be really clear, it is not our view that underperformance over a period should automatically result in a recommendation to switch products. That&rsquo;s not feasible &ndash; and it&rsquo;s not always going to be in the best interest of clients.</p>
<p>But persistent underperformance should be identified and considered &ndash; and we were looking for evidence that was happening. For licensees, that means having processes in place to detect and deal with persistent underperformance in a timely way.</p>
<p>That can include ensuring that licensees&rsquo; advisers are detecting and addressing underperforming options held by their clients, and that licensees treat performance as a primary criterion when approving products for use by advisers or managing approved product lists.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s quite a lot in this report tailored to licensees &ndash; we did take a look at all the distinct players in that system &ndash; so if you haven&rsquo;t already looked at this report, I encourage you to do so &ndash; it&rsquo;s available on the ASIC website.</p>
<h4>Trustee oversight of fee deductions</h4>
<p>We also recently looked at the role of superannuation trustees in monitoring fee deductions for financial advice. Given the attention this report has attracted, I thought I would provide a bit of context.</p>
<p>Obviously one of the key lessons from the Financial Services Royal Commission was about how inappropriate fee deduction with inadequate oversight can eat away at members&rsquo; balances. On the flip side, some of our recent work has shown how vigilance by trustees can protect members from unscrupulous operators, particularly with regard to superannuation-switching cold-calling practices.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we are focusing on trustees and calling on them to improve their oversight practices &ndash; calling on them to take a risk-based approach to protecting their members&rsquo; interests.</p>
<p>To be really clear &ndash; we are not asking trustees to check every piece of advice &ndash; that would not be practical. Nor is it what the current law or what the proposed changes to the law require. We could not have been clearer on that point. But we are asking trustees to consider what controls and assurances they need to put in place to enable them to comply with the law.</p>
<p>To illustrate the point, during our year-long surveillance on this issue, almost $1 billion in fees were deducted from almost half a million member accounts - but trustees only reported around 1,500 checks of advice documents.</p>
<p>Three of the 10 trustees we looked at failed to check any advice documents on a risk or random basis &ndash; and that shows there is a way to go to strengthen member protections.</p>
<p>The reforms to section 99FA, the laws applying to advice fee deductions, are still working their way through the Parliament and are being considered by a current inquiry. While that is underway, we are happy to continue to make our view on the impact of those reforms clear and when they have passed, we will consider providing more formal regulatory guidance.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, I suspect the process of reform for how financial advice is regulated will never be completely done &ndash; for the simple fact that financial advisers live and work in an ever-changing world.</p>
<p>The Government and ASIC are always going to be laser-focused on ensuring the policy settings and regulations are right for the many people who trust their advisers, and for the financial advisers you authorise to help them.</p>
<p>To that end, licensees play a critical role in the system, so ASIC welcomes the opportunity to engage in forums like this one.</p>
<p>Thank you to Conexus for the invitation to speak with you today &ndash; I look forward to taking some questions.</p>

<div> Climate-related Disclosures, FMA, XRB, climate statements, CRD regime<br />
Summary: The FMA and XRB have created guides to help understand the new climate-related disclosures regime, including legislative requirements and evaluating climate statements. <div>
<p>The Financial Markets Authority (FMA) &ndash; Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko &ndash; and the External Reporting Board &ndash; Te Kāwai Ārahi Pūrongo Mōwaho (XRB) &ndash; have jointly produced a set of guides designed to help people understand the Climate-related Disclosures (CRD) regime and the information being provided in climate statements which are now starting to be published by climate reporting entities.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;&ldquo;What You Need to Know&rdquo;&nbsp;guide provides an overview of the CRD regime for people such as primary users (existing and potential investors, lenders, and other creditors) of climate statements, journalists and other intermediaries who use or communicate climate-related information.</p>
<p>It includes information on:</p>
<ul>
<li>the purpose of disclosing climate-related information&nbsp;</li>
<li>key legislative requirements&nbsp;</li>
<li>key considerations and context about the information in climate statements&nbsp;</li>
<li>the roles of the FMA, XRB and relevant government agencies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Navigating Climate Statements&rdquo; guide is a more detailed explanation of the information disclosed in climate statements. Given that climate statements are a new type of disclosure, this guide highlights the importance of topics such as uncertainty, comparability and context when evaluating and judging the information they contain.</p>
<p>XRB Chief Executive, April Mackenzie, said: &ldquo;We aim for these joint XRB/FMA guides to support the market in getting value from the information contained within climate statements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>FMA Head of Auditing, Financial Reporting and CRD, Jacco Moison, said: &ldquo;With reporting now underway and the first climate statements being published, we want to help inform the public of the purpose of the regime.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fma.govt.nz/library/guidance-library/crd-what-you-need-to-know/" title="link to Guidance page">View the CRD - What you need to know guidance page</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.xrb.govt.nz/dmsdocument/5123/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Link to XRB website">Download the Navigating Climate Statements guide from the XRB</a></p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>The Financial Sector (Climate-related Disclosures and Other Matters) Amendment Act 2021 introduced a requirement for &lsquo;large&rsquo; entities such as listed issuers, registered banks, licensed insurers, credit unions, building societies and managers of registered managed investment schemes (other than restricted schemes) (MIS managers) to publish annual climate statements in accordance with Climate Standards issued by the XRB.</p>
<p>The purpose of the CRD regime is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Encourage entities to routinely consider the short-, medium-, and long-term risks and opportunities that climate change presents for the activities of the entity or the entity&rsquo;s group;</li>
<li>Enable entities to show how they are considering those risks and opportunities; and</li>
<li>Enable investors and other stakeholders to assess the merits of how entities are considering those risks and opportunities.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Climate Standards state the ultimate aim is to support the allocation of capital towards activities that are consistent with a transition to a low-emissions, climate-resilient future.</p>
<p>The FMA is responsible for monitoring and enforcement of the CRD regime. It will monitor whether climate statements comply with the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 and the XRB&rsquo;s Climate Standards.</p>
<p>Annual climate statements must comply with Aotearoa New Zealand Climate Standards (Climate Standards) issued by the XRB. The XRB&nbsp;also prepares guidance to support Climate Reporting Entities (CRE&rsquo;s) required to prepare climate-related disclosures in accordance with the Climate Standards.&nbsp;</p>

<div> Financial Stability Board, Regional Consultative Group, Americas, meeting, discussion
Summary:<br />FSB RCG Americas met to discuss deposit insurance, resolution frameworks, macrofinancial risks, and FSB's work program for 2024. Initiatives on crypto-assets and outsourcing risks were addressed. <div>
<p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) Regional Consultative Group (RCG) for the Americas met on 17 and 18 June in the British Virgin Islands.</p>
<p>On the first day, members participated in a roundtable discussion with representatives from the International Association of Deposit Insurers to discuss the role of deposit insurance and resolution frameworks in maintaining depositor confidence. Members look forward to the FSB&rsquo;s resolution work following up on lessons learned from the March 2023 banking turmoil.</p>
<p>Discussions on the second day began with an appraisal of recent developments and macrofinancial risks and vulnerabilities, including tight financing conditions against the backdrop of high public and private sector debt levels. Members exchanged views on links between the sovereign and banking sectors and discussed whether such interconnections could pose risks to financial stability.</p>
<p>Members also received an update on the FSB&rsquo;s work programme for 2024 and discussed ways they could contribute to the FSB&rsquo;s work programme to bring in additional perspectives from the region.</p>
<p>One initiative the RCG Americas has taken forward relates to the FSB&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2023/07/fsb-global-regulatory-framework-for-crypto-asset-activities/">global framework for crypto-asset activities</a>. In May 2023, members agreed to review developments and the current state of regulations within the region. Members discussed this stocktake and ways to ensure effective, flexible, and coordinated implementation of the comprehensive policy response for crypto-assets and global stablecoin arrangements. Given the particularly acute risk of regulatory arbitrage in the crypto space, broad global implementation is crucial.</p>
<p>Members shared their experiences of the oversight and management of financial institutions&rsquo; risks from outsourcing of critical services to third parties considering the FSB&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2023/12/final-report-on-enhancing-third-party-risk-management-and-oversight-a-toolkit-for-financial-institutions-and-financial-authorities/">toolkit for financial authorities and financial institutions for enhancing their third-party risk management and oversight</a>, which was published in December 2023.</p>
<h2><span class="Heading2Char">Background</span></h2>
<p>The FSB RCG for the Americas is co-chaired by Kenneth Baker, Managing Director and CEO, British Virgin Islands Financial Services Commission, and Tiff Macklem, Governor of the Bank of Canada. Tiff Macklem was represented at the meeting by Carolyn Rogers, Senior Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada. Membership includes financial authorities from Argentina, Bahamas, Barbados, Bermuda, Bolivia, Brazil, British Virgin Islands, Canada, Cayman Islands, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Trinidad and Tobago, the United States of America and Uruguay.</p>
<p>The FSB has six Regional Consultative Groups, established under the FSB Charter, to bring together financial authorities from FSB member and non-member countries to exchange views on vulnerabilities affecting financial systems and on initiatives to promote financial stability.<a class="footnote-ref" href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/06/fsb-americas-group-discusses-risks-associated-with-the-sovereign-bank-nexus-and-crypto-asset-arrangements/#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1">1</a>&nbsp;Typically, each Regional Consultative Group meets twice each year.</p>
<p>The FSB coordinates at the international level the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies and develops and promotes the implementation of effective regulatory, supervisory, and other financial sector policies in the interest of financial stability. It brings together national authorities responsible for financial stability in 24 countries and jurisdictions, international financial institutions, sector-specific international groupings of regulators and supervisors, and committees of central bank experts. The FSB also conducts outreach with approximately 70 other jurisdictions through its six Regional Consultative Groups.</p>
<p>The FSB is chaired by Klaas Knot, President of De Nederlandsche Bank. The FSB Secretariat is located in Basel, Switzerland and hosted by the Bank for International Settlements.</p>

<title>SIFMA: Incentive Compensation Document Invalid, Even More Prescriptive Than Prior Version</title>

<div> proposal, issuance, compensation, regulatory agencies, financial institutions
Summary:
The recent issuance of a proposal for incentive compensation practices lacks legal effect, exceeds authority, ignores industry comments, lacks research, and is inflexible.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>A recent issuance from the OCC, FDIC, NCUA and FHFA attempting to resuscitate a long-stalled proposal on incentive compensation practices under section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act&nbsp;<span>does not include the full set of financial regulatory agencies required to propose such a rule and therefore has no legal effect</span>, the American Bankers Association, Bank Policy Institute, Financial Services Forum and SIFMA wrote in a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sifma.org/resources/submissions/incentive-based-compensation-arrangements/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">joint letter</a>.</p>
<p>Moreover, the document largely mirrors the 2016 proposal and, like that proposal, exceeds the agencies&rsquo; limited legal authority under Section 956.&nbsp; Section 956 permits the agencies to prohibit incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage two types of &ldquo;inappropriate&rdquo; risks, but the 2016 proposal is largely styled as a rule that would affirmatively require all covered financial institutions to incorporate specific, universal requirements into their compensation arrangements.</p>
<p><span>Doubling down:&nbsp;</span>The recent issuance ignores industry comments on the 2016 proposal that highlighted the agencies&rsquo; limited authority under Section 956, and describes compensation restrictions under consideration that would be even more prescriptive than those in the 2016 proposal.</p>
<p><span>Lack of research:&nbsp;</span>While compensation practices in the financial services industry have evolved considerably over the past eight years, the proposal contains no analysis of that experience.</p>
<p><span>Inflexible:&nbsp;</span>Moreover, this document, like the 2016 proposal, would establish a rigid approach to compensation that deprives banks of the flexibility needed to ensure compensation practices are sensitive to the institution&rsquo;s particular risk profile.</p>

<title>SEC Charges R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Co. With Cybersecurity-Related Controls Violations</title>

<div> global provider, business communication, cybersecurity incidents, SEC, settlement <br />
Summary:<br /> 
SEC fines R.R. Donnelley & Sons over $2.1 million for cybersecurity disclosure and control failures. RRD cooperated and agreed to adopt new cybersecurity technology and controls. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Company (RRD), a global provider of business communication and marketing services, agreed to pay over $2.1 million to settle disclosure and internal control failure charges relating to cybersecurity incidents and alerts in late 2021.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Commission instituted this enforcement action because RRD&rsquo;s controls for elevating cybersecurity incidents to its management and protecting company assets from cyberattacks were insufficient,&rdquo; said Jorge G. Tenreiro, Acting Chief of the Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit. &ldquo;RRD did, however, cooperate with our investigation in a meaningful way, and that is reflected in the terms of this settlement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s order, data integrity and confidentiality were critically important to RRD&rsquo;s business. Because client data was stored on RRD&rsquo;s network, its information security personnel and the third-party service provider RRD hired were responsible for monitoring the network&rsquo;s security. However, according to the order, RRD failed to design effective disclosure controls and procedures to report relevant cybersecurity information to management with the responsibility for making disclosure decisions, and failed to carefully assess and respond to alerts of unusual activity in a timely manner. The order further finds that RRD failed to devise and maintain a system of cybersecurity-related internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that access to RRD&rsquo;s assets &ndash; its information technology systems and networks &ndash; was permitted only with management&rsquo;s authorization.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order found that RRD violated Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Exchange Act Rule 13a-15a. Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, RRD agreed to cease and desist from committing violations of these provisions and to pay a $2,125,000 civil penalty. As described in the order, RRD cooperated throughout the investigation, including by reporting the cybersecurity incident to staff prior to filing a disclosure of the incident, by providing meaningful cooperation that helped expedite the staff&rsquo;s investigation, and by voluntarily adopting new cybersecurity technology and controls.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Arsen Ablaev of the Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit and Christine S. Bautista of the Chicago Regional Office, with assistance from Kathleen Sweeney and Christopher Carpenter, and was supervised by Amy Flaherty Hartman and Mr. Tenreiro of the Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit.</p>

<div> Cybersecurity, Internal accounting controls, R.R. Donnelley & Sons, Commission, Administrative controls<br />
Summary: The Commission's broad interpretation of internal accounting controls in the RRD cyberattack case blurs the distinction between administrative and accounting controls. It expands the reach of Section 13(b)(2)(B)(iii) and undermines the proper limits of its requirements.<br /> <div>
<p>As we have noted before, the Commission in recent years has taken to treating Exchange Act Section 13(b)(2)(B)&rsquo;s internal accounting controls provision as a Swiss Army Statute to compel issuers to adopt policies and procedures the Commission believes prudent.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-uyeda-statement-rr-donnelley-061824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;Identifying a link between the Commission&rsquo;s preferred policies and procedures and accounting controls seems a collateral concern, if it is a concern at all. In today&rsquo;s settled administrative proceeding against R.R. Donnelly &amp; Sons, Co. (&ldquo;RRD&rdquo;),<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-uyeda-statement-rr-donnelley-061824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;the Commission finds and uses a novel attachment on its multi-use tool&mdash;&ldquo;a system of cybersecurity-related internal accounting controls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Understanding the particulars of RRD&rsquo;s alleged violation of Section 13(b)(2)(B) requires careful parsing of the Order Instituting Proceedings. RRD was the victim of a cyberattack. For a period of approximately four weeks in 2021, a &ldquo;threat actor was able to utilize deceptive hacking techniques to install encryption software on certain RRD computers (mostly virtual machines) and exfiltrated 70 Gigabytes of data, including data belonging to 29 of RRD&rsquo;s 22,000 clients, some of which contained personal identification and financial information.&rdquo; On December 23, &ldquo;a company with shared access to RRD&rsquo;s network alerted RRD&rsquo;s Chief Information Security Officer [&ldquo;CISO&rdquo;] about potential anomalous internet activity emanating from RRD&rsquo;s network,&rdquo; and RRD &ldquo;began actively responding to the attack.&rdquo; Importantly, RRD&rsquo;s investigation into the incident &ldquo;uncovered no evidence that the threat actor accessed RRD&rsquo;s financial systems and corporate financial and accounting data.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Order notes that RRD did have an &ldquo;internal intrusion detection system&rdquo; that, as early as November 29, &ldquo;began issuing alerts . . . about certain malware in the RRD network&rdquo; that were &ldquo;visible&rdquo; to both RRD and its third-party managed security services provider (&ldquo;MSSP&rdquo;). The MSSP sent three of the alerts to RRD personnel who reviewed them, &ldquo;but, in partial reliance on its MSSP, did not take the infected instances off the network and [RRD] failed to conduct its own investigation of the activity, or otherwise take steps to prevent further compromise, before December 23, 2021.&rdquo; The MSSP also failed to escalate to RRD at least 20 other alerts related to the same activity. Although RRD&rsquo;s controls detected possible intrusions, according to the Order, the internal accounting controls nonetheless were deficient because &ldquo;RRD&rsquo;s cybersecurity alert review and incident response policies and procedures failed to adequately establish a prioritization scheme and to provide clear guidance to internal and external personnel on procedures for responding to incidents.&rdquo; This lack of an adequate &ldquo;prioritization scheme&rdquo; and &ldquo;clear guidance . . . for responding to incidents&rdquo; meant that &ldquo;RRD&rsquo;s external and internal security personnel failed to adequately review these alerts [generated by the intrusion detection system]&rdquo; and that RRD in consequence failed to &ldquo;take adequate investigative and remedial measures&rdquo; until after the CISO was alerted by an outside company. The delayed response created by RRD&rsquo;s inadequate policies and procedures &ldquo;was exploited by hackers&rdquo; who accessed RRD&rsquo;s computer systems and exfiltrated client data. From these findings, the Order concludes that RRD violated Section 13(b)(2)(B)(iii)&rsquo;s requirement that it &ldquo;devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that . . . (iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management&rsquo;s general or specific authorization.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-uyeda-statement-rr-donnelley-061824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>The Order states that the &ldquo;assets&rdquo; that were accessed were RRD&rsquo;s &ldquo;information technology systems and networks,&rdquo; which does not fit the category of assets captured by Section 13(b)(2)(B). The computer systems, while an RRD asset in a broad sense, are not an asset of the type covered by Section 13(b)(2)(B)&rsquo;s internal accounting controls provisions. To explain why requires some discussion of the source and function of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act&rsquo;s internal accounting controls provision.</p>
<p>Section 13(b)(2)(B) originates with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (&ldquo;AICPA&rdquo;) Statement on Auditing Standards No. 1 (&ldquo;SAS&rdquo;).<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-uyeda-statement-rr-donnelley-061824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;The SAS explains that, in the context of internal accounting controls, the &ldquo;safeguarding of assets refers only to protection against loss arising from intentional and unintentional errors in processing transactions and handling the related assets.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-uyeda-statement-rr-donnelley-061824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;The specific objectives codified in Section 13(b)(2)(B) come from a section of the auditing standards that were adopted to clarify what internal accounting controls that safeguard assets means &ldquo;in relation to the functions involved in the flow of transactions.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-uyeda-statement-rr-donnelley-061824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;To that end, the SAS explained that transactions &ldquo;include exchanges of assets or services&rdquo; and &ldquo;[t]he primary functions involved in the flow of transactions and related assets include the authorization, execution, and recording of transactions and the accountability for resulting assets.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-uyeda-statement-rr-donnelley-061824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;Authorization for transactions, in turn, &ldquo;refers to management&rsquo;s decision to exchange, transfer, or use assets for specified purposes under specified conditions,&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-uyeda-statement-rr-donnelley-061824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;and the related &ldquo;accountability function follows assets from the time of their acquisition in one transaction until their disposition or use in another.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-uyeda-statement-rr-donnelley-061824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<p>After setting out the functions involved and the meaning of the terms used, the SAS then defines two distinct, chronological categories of controls: administrative controls and accounting controls. Administrative controls precede accounting controls and include &ldquo;the plan of organization and the procedures and records that are concerned with the decision processes leading to management&rsquo;s authorization of transactions.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-uyeda-statement-rr-donnelley-061824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;Accounting controls, in contrast, focus on the transactions themselves and &ldquo;are concerned with the safeguarding of assets and the reliability of financial records.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-uyeda-statement-rr-donnelley-061824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;To that end, the SAS sets out four objectives for effective internal accounting controls: &ldquo;to provide reasonable assurances that:</p>
<ol>
<li><i>Transactions</i>&nbsp;are executed in accordance with management&rsquo;s general or specific authorization.</li>
<li><i>Transactions</i>&nbsp;are recorded as necessary (1) to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles or any other criteria applicable to such statements and (2)&nbsp;<i>to maintain accountability for assets</i>.</li>
<li><i>Access to assets</i>&nbsp;is permitted only in accordance with management&rsquo;s authorization.</li>
<li>The recorded&nbsp;<i>accountability for assets</i>&nbsp;is compared with the&nbsp;<i>existing assets</i>&nbsp;at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-uyeda-statement-rr-donnelley-061824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></li>
</ol>
<p>The SAS&rsquo;s focus on creating and maintaining an accurate accounting for the use and disposition of assets in transactions makes clear that the objective of permitting &ldquo;access to assets . . . only in accordance with management&rsquo;s authorization&rdquo; is concerned not with all corporate assets, but rather with assets of a particular character&mdash;those that are the subject of corporate transactions.</p>
<p>The asset at issue in the Order&mdash;RRD&rsquo;s computer systems&mdash;does not have that essential characteristic. While RRD&rsquo;s computer systems constitute an asset in the sense of being corporate property, computer systems are not the subject of corporate transactions. At most, computer systems process transactions in corporate assets, but the internal accounting controls are concerned with the use and disposition of the corporate assets themselves. The controls associated with the means of processing transactions in corporate assets are more appropriately categorized as administrative controls involving management&rsquo;s decisions prior to authorizing transactions.</p>
<p>The Commission&rsquo;s 2018 report related to the intersection of cybersecurity and internal accounting controls is consistent with this essential distinction between categories of administrative controls and internal accounting controls.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-uyeda-statement-rr-donnelley-061824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>&nbsp;For example, one of the schemes involved &ldquo;using spoofed email domains and addresses&rdquo; to entice &ldquo;the companies&rsquo; finance personnel&nbsp;<i>to cause large wire transfers to foreign bank accounts</i>&nbsp;controlled by the perpetrators.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-uyeda-statement-rr-donnelley-061824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>&nbsp;In another scheme, &ldquo;[a]fter hacking the existing vendors&rsquo; email accounts, the perpetrators inserted [an] illegitimate request for payments (and payment processing details) into electronic communications&rdquo; and sent the issuer &ldquo;doctored invoices [that] reflected the new, fraudulent account information.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-uyeda-statement-rr-donnelley-061824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>&nbsp;As a result, the issuer &ldquo;<i>made payments on outstanding invoices to foreign accounts</i>&nbsp;controlled by the impersonator rather than the accounts of the real vendors.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-uyeda-statement-rr-donnelley-061824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>&nbsp;The common thread in the schemes is that they involved access to corporate cash. The internal accounting controls were deficient not because the payment processing systems were the means to execute transactions disposing of corporate assets; the internal accounting controls were deficient because outside actors were able to access the corporate cash through fraudulent transactions. In other words, the payment processing systems implicitly were understood to be distinct from the cash itself, and the internal accounting controls were those controls directly related to the transactions that ended in the disbursement of cash.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-uyeda-statement-rr-donnelley-061824?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a></p>
<p>The Commission&rsquo;s order faulting RRD&rsquo;s internal accounting controls breaks new ground with its expansive interpretation of what constitutes an asset under Section 13(b)(2)(B)(iii). By treating RRD&rsquo;s computer systems as an asset subject to the internal accounting controls provision, the Commission&rsquo;s Order ignores the distinction between internal accounting controls and broader administrative controls. This distinction, however, is essential to understanding and upholding the proper limits of Section 13(b)(2)(B)&rsquo;s requirements.</p>
<p>Eliding the distinction between administrative controls and accounting controls has utility for the Commission. As this proceeding illustrates, a broad interpretation of Section 13(b)(2)(B) to cover computer systems gives the Commission a hook to regulate public companies&rsquo; cybersecurity practices. Any departure from what the Commission deems to be appropriate cybersecurity policies could be deemed an internal accounting controls violation. The Commission&rsquo;s assurances in connection with the recent cyber-disclosure rulemaking ring untrue if the Commission plans to dictate public company cybersecurity practices indirectly using its ever-flexible Section 13(b)(2)(B) tool. Also concerning is the Commission&rsquo;s decision to stretch the law to punish a company that was the victim of a cyberattack. While an enforcement action may be warranted in some circumstances, distorting a statutory provision to form the basis for such an action inappropriately amplifies a company&rsquo;s harm from a cyberattack.</p>

<div> Treasury International Capital, TIC data, April 2024, foreign acquisitions, U.S. securities<br />
Summary:<br />
TIC data for April 2024 shows a net inflow of $66.2 billion in foreign acquisitions of U.S. securities, with net purchases by private and official institutions. Overall net purchases of long-term securities estimated at $123.1 billion. Foreign holdings of U.S. Treasury bills decreased by $10.0 billion, and banks' own net dollar-denominated liabilities to foreign residents decreased by $55.9 billion. <div>
<p>The U.S. Department of the Treasury today released Treasury International Capital (TIC) data for April 2024.&nbsp; The next release, which will report on data for May 2024, is scheduled for July 18, 2024.</p>
<p>The sum total in April of all net foreign acquisitions of long-term securities, short-term U.S. securities, and banking flows was a net TIC inflow of $66.2 billion. &nbsp;Of this, net foreign private inflows were $44.2 billion, and net foreign official inflows were $22.0 billion.</p>
<p>Foreign residents increased their holdings of long-term U.S. securities in April; their net purchases were $159.4 billion.&nbsp; Net purchases by private foreign investors were $127.5 billion, while net purchases by foreign official institutions were $31.9 billion.</p>
<p>U.S. residents increased their holdings of long-term foreign securities, with net purchases of $36.3 billion.</p>
<p>After including adjustments, such as estimated foreign portfolio acquisitions of U.S. stocks through stock swaps, overall net foreign purchases of long-term securities are estimated to have been $123.1 billion in April.</p>
<p>Foreign residents decreased their holdings of U.S. Treasury bills by $10.0 billion.&nbsp; Foreign resident holdings of all dollar-denominated short-term U.S. securities and other custody liabilities decreased by $1.0 billion.</p>
<p>Banks&rsquo; own net dollar-denominated liabilities to foreign residents&nbsp;decreased&nbsp;by $55.9 billion.</p>
<p>Complete data are available on the Treasury website at:</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3>ABOUT TIC DATA</h3>
<p>The monthly data on holdings of long-term securities, as well as the monthly table on Major Foreign Holders of Treasury Securities, reflect foreign holdings of U.S. securities collected primarily on the basis of custodial data.&nbsp; These data help provide a window into foreign ownership of U.S. securities, but they cannot attribute holdings of U.S. securities with complete accuracy.&nbsp; For example, if a U.S. Treasury security purchased by a foreign resident is held in a custodial account in a third country, the true ownership of the security will not be reflected in the data.&nbsp; The custodial data will also not properly attribute U.S. Treasury securities managed by foreign private portfolio managers who invest on behalf of residents of other countries.&nbsp; In addition, foreign countries may hold dollars and other U.S. assets that are not captured in the TIC data.&nbsp; For these reasons, it is difficult to draw precise conclusions from TIC data about changes in the foreign holdings of U.S. financial assets by individual countries.</p>

<title>Some Reasons For Optimism About Inflation, Federal Reserve Governor Adriana D. Kugler, At The Peterson Institute For International Economics, Washington, D.C.</title>

<div> inflation, monetary policy, economic outlook, productivity growth, labor market<br />
Summary: Inflation remains high but shows signs of improvement. Wage growth moderates, and labor market supply grows. Emerging technologies and entrepreneurship contribute to potential productivity growth. The current monetary policy stance appears restrictive but is expected to ease later this year. <div>
<p>Thank you for your introduction, Adam, and thank you for the invitation to speak here today. It is great to come to Peterson to discuss the economic outlook and monetary policy, which is my topic this afternoon.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240618a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a></p>
<p>As I stand here today, inflation remains too high, but I am encouraged by the overall progress and trajectory. Recent data on the economy and inflation also give me cautious optimism that we are on track and making continued headway toward the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) inflation goal of 2 percent. That progress may have paused in the first three months of the year, but information since then on economic activity, the labor market, and inflation points to renewed progress.</p>
<p>Over the last year through April, personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation was 2.7 percent, down from 7.1 percent at its peak in 2022. Core PCE inflation&mdash;which excludes the volatile food and energy categories&mdash;was 2.8 percent through April, down from its peak of 5.6 percent. Based on consumer and producer price inflation for May released last week, I estimate that 12-month PCE inflation in May was a bit lower than in April. I was encouraged by some of the details of the recent reports, particularly the continued improvement in market-based services inflation, which is based on observation of actual market prices rather than imputed values. That's important because market-based prices are likely to be a better indication of the overall trend for core services inflation than nonmarket prices.</p>
<p>Housing services inflation, meanwhile, continues to be persistent. Market rents for new tenant leases have already cooled significantly, but further progress in overall housing services inflation will rely on the ongoing pass-through of the previous market rents deceleration to the rents of existing tenants with expiring leases.</p>
<p>So inflation is still too high, and further progress is likely to be gradual. However, there are several reasons why I remain optimistic that improving supply and cooling demand will support continued disinflation.</p>
<p>The first reason I am optimistic about further progress on inflation has to do with declining price increases and even declining prices as consumers become more price sensitive. I think of this from several, related angles&mdash;I will mention a few.</p>
<p>As I have discussed in previous speeches, reduced frequency of price adjustments helps moderate prices. And the frequency with which firms adjust prices, which accelerated to less than every five months in early 2022, moved closer to every seven months as of the end of 2023.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240618a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;Price adjustment frequency picked up some early this year, along with the temporary firming of inflation, but the general trend has been consistent with ongoing disinflation.</p>
<p>An additional basis for price-setting optimism is the fact that longer-run inflation expectations have remained well anchored. Research by the Richmond Fed has found that price-setting decisions by firms are related to their own expectations about the path of overall inflation, so anchored inflation expectations among firms are likely to result in price setting consistent with those lower price expectations.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240618a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a></p>
<p>In addition, there may still be room for markups of prices over labor costs to continue falling. While markups are famously difficult to measure, rough, simple estimates of markups of prices over labor costs have fallen back from high levels but still remain above their pre-pandemic trend, especially in the goods sector.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240618a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;A return of markups to this trend could help ongoing progress toward 2 percent inflation.</p>
<p>A final factor for optimism about positive price-setting developments is the range of anecdotes from firms themselves. The most recent edition of the Fed's Beige Book suggests firms are increasingly attentive to consumers pushing back against additional price increases and that these businesses expect to increase prices only moderately in the near term. Beyond the Beige Book, I have gleaned from recent earnings reports by publicly traded companies that lower-income consumers are pulling back from their purchasing and that firms are responding by moderating price increases or, in some cases, actually cutting prices. What I have heard in my own conversations with business contacts is that consumers are "trading down" to lower-cost products and that firms are responding with more discounting. And some large retailers have publicly spoken about cutting prices in the face of resistant consumers. These various indicators&mdash;markups, price adjustment frequency, inflation expectations, and anecdotes from a range of sources&mdash;suggest that, on balance, price-setting behavior is likely to continue to move closer to consistency with the FOMC's inflation target.</p>
<p>A second reason for my optimism about continued disinflation is slower growth in the costs faced by businesses. Among those, nominal wages are a big part of total costs in the services sector. Nominal wage growth has continued to trend down, consistent with a labor market where supply and demand are coming into better balance. Of course, as a general matter, I want to see Americans experiencing strong wage growth, but for that wage growth to be sustainable, it must be consistent with our inflation target. Notably, as inflation has come down, real wages have been rising and now exceed pre-pandemic levels, which means that the purchasing power of workers has also been increasing. But at the same time, we have seen slowing growth in nominal labor costs. For example, the 12-month increase in average hourly earnings has been running just above 4 percent over the past couple of months after peaking at around 6 percent in 2022 and falling more or less steadily since then. The latest readings compare with an average of around 3 percent a year before the pandemic, when inflation was running below our 2 percent goal. Wage moderation is especially evident in some service sectors for which labor is a large share of costs. If this moderation in wage growth continues, it will soon be at levels consistent with price stability. And I note that the market-based services inflation measure I mentioned earlier tends to move closely with wage growth.</p>
<p>Other developments in labor markets also point toward continued resilience, but there are signs of gradual cooling and continued wage moderation. Gains in payrolls averaged 218,000 over the past two months, which is a solid pace. But most other indicators point to a slow but steady easing of the labor market, supported by cooling demand for hiring as well as strong supply.</p>
<p>In terms of demand, both the job openings rate and the hiring rate have come down from their highs of late 2021 and early 2022. The job opening rate is not far above its pre-pandemic range, and the hiring rate is below pre-pandemic. Surveys of business hiring intentions likewise suggest cooler demand for workers. On the supply side, we have seen notable growth in labor supply over the past year. Labor force participation among prime-age women, in particular, reached another all-time record in May. And the strong inflows of immigrants I have discussed in previous speeches have continued this year, which points to continued labor supply growth as recent immigrants gradually make their way into the labor market.</p>
<p>With cooling demand and solid supply, measures of labor market tightness have continued to ease. The unemployment rate has been gradually rising and reached 4 percent in May, still very low in historical terms and the 30th straight month at 4 percent or lower. Another indicator of labor market tightness, the ratio of job vacancies to the number of people counted as looking for work, crossed an important threshold in April. After rising as high as 2 vacancies for each person seeking a job during the pandemic, that ratio fell to 1.2, which was the level before the pandemic. Another indicator of labor market tightness, the rate of people voluntarily quitting their jobs, is actually below the pre-pandemic level. The average duration for job vacancies is down, and it is becoming easier for employers to fill jobs. We policymakers like to make our judgments based on a preponderance of the data, and a preponderance of the labor market data indicates that labor market supply and demand are coming into better balance.</p>
<p>A third reason for my optimism about achieving 2 percent inflation is that I am also cautiously optimistic about productivity growth, which is a source of supply expansion that is likely to put downward pressure on inflation without slower economic growth. One factor is the remarkable rise in the rate of new business creation, which started early in the pandemic and has continued, more or less, even through last month.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240618a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;Economic research finds that while many new and young firms struggle to survive, a small subset of new firms are highly productive and grow rapidly, eventually making significant contributions to aggregate productivity.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240618a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;And the pandemic-era business creation surge has been particularly strong in high-tech sectors, such as computer systems design and research and development services.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240618a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;Some recent history favors a payoff to productivity growth from this surge in entrepreneurship. Before the jump in productivity growth in the late 1990s through the early 2000s, there was a similar wave of strong business entries in high-tech industries.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240618a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a>&nbsp;I suspect that most of the productivity benefits of the recent entry surge are still ahead of us.</p>
<p>Another basis for productivity optimism is the prospect for widespread implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in its various forms. To be sure, there is tremendous uncertainty around the future path of AI and its effects on the economy, and we must all think carefully about how it may affect workers and the kinds of tasks they perform. But AI technology has the potential to make workers and firms more productive&mdash;effectively boosting aggregate supply. Of course, many technologies can take a long time to show through to aggregate productivity. The spread of electrification more than a century ago required complementary assets like power lines and appliances to be created and installed. But I suspect that AI may diffuse more quickly, in part because many of the complementary assets needed for the initial spread of AI&mdash;such as computers, networks, and the like&mdash;are already in place, even while there is still an enormous amount of additional hardware buildout still ahead of us. And survey data from the Census Bureau suggest that firms in many sectors are already employing AI.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240618a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;Only time will tell, of course, but the prospect of higher productivity growth raises the possibility that inflation can fall without a significant slowdown in economic activity and employment.</p>
<p>My fourth and final reason for optimism on inflation is that I believe the current stance of monetary policy is sufficiently restrictive to help cool the economy and bring inflation back toward 2 percent without a sharp contraction in economic activity or a significant deterioration of the labor market. Interest rates remain elevated relative to a year ago, and certainly relative to two or three years ago, and are restricting economic activity. Of course, some aspects of financial conditions, such as house prices and, especially, stock prices, remain robust; and credit is still generally available, though high interest rates make borrowing expensive. These factors likely have some distributional implications: Higher-income people with large stock portfolios may not feel that conditions are so restrictive, while lower earners who need to borrow to buy a house or a car do not need to be told that finances are tight.</p>
<p>But the overall restrictiveness of financial conditions is apparent in interest rate&ndash;sensitive sectors. For example, the level of residential investment in the first quarter&mdash;though showing some modest improvement relative to last year's pace&mdash;was still roughly 15 percent below its peak in 2021. Business investment in equipment contracted a bit in 2023 and showed only tepid growth in the first quarter of this year. And while consumption growth has been resilient over the past couple of years, fueled in part by excess savings accumulated during the pandemic and solid real wages that now exceed pre-pandemic levels, it slowed noticeably in the first quarter, especially for spending on goods. Indeed, high interest rates have left a mark on consumer assessments of buying conditions for motor vehicles and other large durable goods, which often have to be financed.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240618a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a></p>
<p>The effects of restrictive financial conditions are also evident in labor markets. As I discussed earlier, the labor market has cooled gradually, and, looking ahead, I expect some cooling of economic activity to continue. But I am watching closely for any signs of labor market deterioration that may take hold, as the FOMC also pays attention to the other side of our mandate.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding my optimism about the economic outlook, I am mindful of a number of risks to both sides of the dual mandate. On the inflation side, the resurgence of import prices at the beginning of the year is concerning, even if import prices came down some last month, and could anticipate greater pressure on goods prices in the coming months. Goods prices have been a key source of disinflation over the past year or so, as supply chains have healed. While supply chains appear to have been fairly resilient to a series of shocks since the end of last year&mdash;including attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and low water levels in the Panama Canal&mdash;geopolitical developments in Ukraine and the Middle East still could lead to a sharp rise in global energy and food prices and disrupt global supply chains. Another risk I am focused on is that a further cooling of the U.S. economy could lead to a sharp deterioration in labor market conditions. Output growth appears to have slowed in the first half of this year, and while consumer spending still grew in the first quarter, the May retail sales report we received this morning may be another signal that the long-expected deceleration in consumer spending may finally be upon us. After a considerable decline in job vacancies, firms facing decreasing demand might increasingly resort to laying off workers. Lastly, I also see risks to the global economy that could spill back to the U.S. economy. While growth in some countries&mdash;notably in Europe&mdash;appears to be picking up from a soft patch last year, that pickup remains tentative. And the latest data from China suggest that economic momentum there has slowed considerably amid a continuing real estate crisis.</p>
<p>Let me now turn to the implications of my economic outlook for monetary policy. While I remain cautiously optimistic that inflation is coming down, it is still too high, and it is moving down only slowly. I believe that policy has more work to do, which is why I supported the FOMC's decision last week to keep the federal funds rate in a range of 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent. We need to see more progress toward 2 percent inflation before I will have confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward that objective. For the reasons I have outlined today, I believe economic conditions are moving in the right direction. If the economy evolves as I am expecting, it will likely become appropriate to begin easing policy sometime later this year. But, as always, my judgment will be guided by the data.</p>
<p>Let me conclude by acknowledging that the surge in inflation over the past few years means that prices are now significantly higher than they were just a few years ago, even as the rate of price increases has slowed dramatically since mid-2022. While I am heartened by data showing that nominal wages are now growing at a faster rate than prices, I know many Americans are still struggling with high costs. I also know that many Americans are facing high borrowing costs. That's why I will be watching the data carefully in the months ahead to ensure that we are on track to achieve both sides of our dual mandate.</p>

With regard to overall measures of inflation expectations, anchored longer-run inflation expectations are apparent in the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, where 5-to-10-year-ahead expectations remain close to values seen a decade ago; in the Survey of Professional Forecasters, where 10-year inflation expectations are close to pre-pandemic norms; and in other sources.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn4"></a>4. For example, the ratio of the producer price index (PPI) for final demand goods to the employment cost index for private goods industries rose roughly 20 percent from the end of 2020 to the middle of 2022. In services, this ratio rose roughly 5 percent. The ratios for both sectors have come down from their peak levels but were still above their end-2020 levels as of the first quarter of this year&mdash;and they had been on downward trends before the pandemic. Similar analysis using PCE prices instead of PPI yields a qualitatively similar result for goods industries, though, in services, the PCE price-to-wage ratio has been roughly flat.&nbsp;</p>

<div> economic cycle, credit risk, market risk, operational risk, compliance risk
<br />
The OCC's report highlights increasing credit risk, market pressure on net interest margins, elevated operational risk due to cyber threats, and compliance challenges.
<br /><br />Summary: The OCC's report addresses increasing credit and market risk, as well as elevated operational and compliance risk, emphasizing the need for firmwide resilience efforts. <div>
<p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) today reported the key issues facing the federal banking system in its&nbsp;<em>Semiannual Risk Perspective for Spring 2024</em>.</p>
<p>The OCC reported that the overall condition of the federal banking system remains sound. However, the maturing economic cycle may cause consumer headwinds. It is important for banks to continue identifying material risks and their interconnected impacts. Continuous risk management improvement remains appropriate as this allows banks to guard against complacency.</p>
<p>The OCC highlighted credit, market, operational, and compliance risks, as the key risk themes in the report. Highlights from the report include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Credit risk is increasing. Commercial real estate sectors, primarily the office sector and some multifamily property types, are experiencing stress due to a higher rate environment and structural changes. Office and multifamily loans, particularly those with interest-only terms, set to refinance over the next three years pose additional risk. Sticky inflation and elevated interest rates may increase consumer financial stress in some households and weigh on overall consumption growth.</li>
<li>From a market risk perspective, net interest margins (NIMs) are under pressure due to strong deposit competition. Trends observed, however, indicate that pressure on funding costs and NIMs may be nearing a peak. The future direction, timing, and extent of rate movements and uncharted depositor behavior present risk management challenges. Wholesale funding usage continued to grow albeit at a slower pace going into 2024. Investment portfolio depreciation improved but unrealized losses remain elevated as banks continue to increase asset liquidity and interest rates remain elevated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Operational risk is elevated. The financial industry is responding to an evolving and increasingly complex operating environment. Cyber threats continue as malicious actors target the financial services industry and their key service providers with ransomware and other attacks. Increasing digitalization, new and innovative product and service adoption, and third-party use increase bank operating environment complexity creating both opportunities and risks. Continued check and wire transfer fraud and increased payment fraud incidents both underscore the importance of fraud risk management.</li>
<li>Banks are operating in a dynamic banking environment because of changing customer needs and preferences related to products, services, and delivery channels. Risks are compounded if products and services, including changes, are not delivered or implemented in a fair and equitable manner. It remains important for banks to maintain a compliance risk management framework that is commensurate with their risk profiles and capable of growing and evolving as their risk profiles change. Fraud continues to be significant risk for banks. Effective processes to prevent, identify and file suspicious activity reports on fraudulent activity in a timely manner remain important to protect both banks and consumers. As banks work to process checks and other payments in a safe, fair, and efficient manner, check and wire fraud, and P2P transaction scams have become more prevalent. The OCC continues to assess banks&rsquo; Community Reinvestment Act performance under the 1995/2021 regulatory framework.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The report highlights the necessity of firmwide resilience efforts as risks may be interconnected and events could simultaneously affect multiple risk categories. It is crucial that banks establish an appropriate risk culture that identifies potential risk, particularly before times of stress. Each stress event may vary (e.g., operational, liquidity, credit, compliance, and other) and resiliency implications need to be proactively considered. Prudent planning from a firmwide perspective can enhance a bank&rsquo;s ability to maintain operations, remain financially sound, and service customers in times of stress.</p>
<p>The report covers risks facing national banks, federal savings associations, and federal branches and agencies based on data as of December 31, 2023, unless otherwise indicated. The report presents information in four main areas: the special topic, operating environment, bank performance, and trends in key risks. The report focuses on issues that pose threats to those financial institutions regulated by the OCC and is intended as a resource to the industry, examiners, and the public.</p>

<div> SEC, securities regulation, capital markets, government intervention, market integrity<br />
Summary:<br />
SEC emphasizes the importance of capital markets, advocates for minimal government intervention, and highlights the significance of individual liberty and freedom.<br /> <div>
<p>Welcome to the final day of the SEC&rsquo;s 30<span>th</span>&nbsp;International Institute for Securities Market Growth and Development. Based on my perusal of the agenda, your curriculum has been interesting and exhausting. I am honored to spend a few minutes with such a remarkable gathering of people who share my passion for securities regulation. Before I begin, I will give you a disclaimer, which you might have heard many times before: My views are my own views as a Commissioner and not necessarily those of the SEC or my fellow Commissioners.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, we celebrated the SEC&rsquo;s 90<span>th</span>&nbsp;birthday. Nine decades of regulating the securities markets has taught us many lessons, and I hope that our staff has shared those lessons with you over the last week. These discussions were likely focused and technical, so I want to take a step back and think more broadly about securities regulation and why it matters so much.</p>
<p>A country&rsquo;s capital markets, by feeding the rest of the economy, can form the basis for its prosperity. These markets drive financing toward the people that need it to build or expand businesses and enable investors to share in the success of these businesses. If capital markets are working properly, a person need not be rich or have wealthy friends and relatives, to get the capital she needs to turn a brilliant idea into a successful business. The more people participate as investors and users of capital, the more effective the markets are at getting capital into the hands of people who can use it best. Widespread participation in the capital markets helps not only the investors and entrepreneurs themselves and the communities in which they live and work, but the broader economy. Well-functioning capital markets ensure that people can make the most of their talents. They also give investors an opportunity to invest in other people&rsquo;s talents.</p>
<p>The wonder of capital markets is heightened when one realizes that they are organic. Societies, when left to their own devices, create capital markets. Capital markets do not require much government intervention, let alone government orchestration. They are the quintessential market&mdash;very responsive to price signals, which in turn reflect what people want and how much they want it. Regulators need only establish and enforce a basic set of market integrity rules. The markets&mdash;through the voluntary interactions of participants&mdash;will do the rest. Regulators, even when seated on a central perch that allows them to observe what every market participant is doing, cannot replicate the ability of uncoordinated market participants to adjust rapidly and effectively to new marketplace dynamics.</p>
<p>In our nine decades of existence, US capital markets have grown in size and stature. These markets serve not only domestic investors and companies, but their global counterparts. The integrity of the markets is the key to their success. There is, of course, no guarantee that you will make money as an investor or get access to capital on the terms you want. But you can trust that the financial statements, issuer disclosures, and the financial professionals you encounter are accountable if they lie to you. The SEC has played an important role in setting the ground rules for our successful capital markets, but generally has avoided micro-managing them.</p>
<p>One classic government failure is to seek to influence capital flows in the &ldquo;right&rdquo; direction. Whether trying to shift capital toward politically favored companies or industries that are perceived to be particularly deserving, government decisions are dangerously distortive. These kinds of interventions damage the capital markets&rsquo; ability to serve the economy&rsquo;s most pressing needs by substituting the preferences of government officials for the preferences of the rest of the population. A handful of government decision-makers is simply no match for the multitude of decision-makers, each with access to a unique reserve of knowledge, that drives capital flows in a competitive free market. Less really is better for a capital markets regulator: facilitate the provision of material information to investors, police the markets for fraud and manipulative behavior, and set some basic investor protection rules for market intermediaries.</p>
<p>We regulators want to intervene. Often the inclination to intervene stems from good intentions. We want to protect people from bad actors and bad decisions and we want to neaten up messy markets. A contractual tweak here, a product prohibition there . . . we look for ways to &ldquo;make markets better.&rdquo; We, of course, must regulate the markets in the manner that our elected governments have chosen. When we have discretion, however, we should use restraint. If two market participants voluntarily agree on a transaction or relationship, we ought to be careful about stepping in between them to alter the terms of the arrangement or prohibit it altogether. We should have a good reason for inserting ourselves into markets: a clearly identified market failure that we have determined will not resolve on its own and can be solved by government intervention without causing something worse to happen. If we really take each element of that analysis seriously, government interventions will be rare and sometimes may take the form of eliminating the regulatory instigator of the market failure.</p>
<p>As important as capital markets are, a prerequisite for their effectiveness is the liberty of the people they serve. When people are free to make decisions for themselves and their families, markets work effectively to provide them with what they need. The dignity of each individual, as reflected in the right to make choices for herself and her family, is core to every aspect of a free society, including its capital markets. In that spirit, for those of you who are staying in DC tomorrow, join with us in celebrating Juneteenth, our country&rsquo;s second independence day. We will commemorate the day in 1865 on which 250,000 Americans in Texas finally were emancipated from slavery, thus ending that abhorrent practice in the United States and underscoring the inalienable right of all people to be free.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-30th-international-institute-061824#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Thank you and enjoy your final day of the Institute.</p>

<title>Ontario Securities Commission’s Investor Advisory Panel Releases 2023 Annual Report</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ontario-securities-commissions-investor-advisory-panel-releases-2023-annual-rep/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Investor Advisory Panel (the IAP) today released its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/sites/default/files/2024-06/iap_20240618-annual-rpt.pdf">2023 Annual Report<span>&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;summarizing its activities, submissions, consultations, and meetings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2023, the IAP focused on the importance of securities regulation continuing to prioritize investor protection in a way that effectively keeps pace with a rapidly shifting environment for retail investors.</p>
<p>The IAP looked at risks and opportunities for retail investors from the increasing digitalization of financial services, such as reliance on social media influencers for investing advice, the use of digital engagement practices by trading platforms, and the use of artificial intelligence (AI) by fraudsters including deepfakes. The IAP also considered the rapid expansion of alternative assets available to retail investors, such as crypto assets and privately placed alternative assets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The IAP reflects with great pride on our work in 2023 and looks forward in the year ahead to continuing to encourage the OSC to prioritize investor protection as the cornerstone of its multi-pronged mandate,&rdquo; said IAP Chair Ilana Singer. &ldquo;We remain committed to bringing forward issues and perspectives that will advance investor protection in Ontario, improve investor outcomes and enhance the investor experience.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The IAP&rsquo;s advice has focused on approaches to protect investors that are responsive to the increasing digitalization of financial services and that are informed by similar trends in other sectors and jurisdictions (domestically and internationally) and regulators&rsquo; responses to them. In particular, the IAP reiterated its strong support for what it considers to be key opportunities to enhance investor protection, including:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>evaluating the types of advice that could benefit do-it-yourself investors given the steady increase in the number of investors who trade on Order-Execution-Only platforms;</li>
<li>conducting a compliance review of finfluencers to determine whether measures are needed to regulate their conduct;</li>
<li>assessing the effect of the Client Focused Reforms on investors and measuring whether they are attaining their desired outcomes;</li>
<li>continuing to strengthen oversight of crypto trading platforms and focusing future efforts on addressing investors&rsquo; ease of access to alternative assets which are speculative and high-risk and strengthening oversight of those who provide such access;</li>
<li>bolstering consumer awareness of fraud risks and continuing to collaborate with peer regulators and agencies to address the evolving fraud landscape and impact on vulnerable investors; and</li>
<li>ensuring that any uses of the Designated Fund be seen to directly benefit investors and be assessed through an investor protection lens.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<title>Accountability In Executive Pay: Let’s Not Wait Until The Next Financial Crisis, SEC Commissioner Jaime Lizárraga, Washington D.C., June 17, 2024</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good afternoon. It is great to be with all of you here today. &nbsp;I appreciate the opportunity to be a part of this event and would like to extend my sincere thanks to Americans for Financial Reform for the invitation. I am fortunate to have a long history of working with AFR and the other sponsors of today&rsquo;s event: Public Citizen, Institute for Policy Studies, AFL-CIO, AFSCME, and the Committee for Better Banks, spanning my time as a staffer for Chairman Barney Frank on the Financial Services Committee, and later in Speaker Pelosi&rsquo;s office &ndash; and especially during the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
<p>Today, in my current role as a Commissioner at the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission, I&rsquo;d like to offer my personal thoughts on an important provision of the Dodd-Frank Act that unfortunately, remains unfinished business.</p>
<p>Section 956 of that landmark legislation requires federal financial regulators, including the SEC, to promulgate a joint rulemaking prohibiting any type of incentive-based compensation arrangement that encourages inappropriate risks by a covered financial institution. This includes compensation structures that (1) provide officers, directors, and employees with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits, or (2) could lead to material financial losses.</p>
<p>One of the criticisms we sometimes hear is that our rulemakings represent a solution in search of a problem. That is anything but the case with this rule. It has been well documented that in the lead up to the financial crisis, pay structures often encouraged big bets that maximized short-term profits but ignored bigger longer-term risks that threatened to take down our entire financial system. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And when the financial crisis hit, working families paid the price, with trillions of dollars of losses in hard-earned wealth in just a few short years.&nbsp; In fact, between 2007 and 2011, one fourth of American families lost at least 75 percent of their wealth, and more than half of all families lost at least 25 percent of their wealth. Unemployment peaked at 10 percent, and home values dropped by an average of 20 percent. Families&rsquo; hard-earned nest eggs, their kids&rsquo; college savings, and their rainy-day fund for medical and other emergencies disappeared almost overnight. Millions experienced home foreclosures and taxpayers funded massive bailouts.</p>
<p>Former SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro told the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission that: &ldquo;Many major financial institutions created asymmetric compensation packages that paid employees enormous sums for short-term success, even if these same decisions result in significant long-term losses or failure for investors and taxpayers.&rdquo;<a name="_Hlk169211594"></a></p>
<p>The bipartisan Senate subcommittee investigating the origins of the financial crisis found that lenders created compensation incentives that valued speed and volume over quality when it came to originating loans.</p>
<p>As an illustration of just how broken the system had become, even the former chief risk officer for home loans at the now defunct lender Washington Mutual had a 2007 performance evaluation that placed the growth of home loans as her number one performance goal for the year, a goal that included specific sales targets.</p>
<p>And in April 2009, the predecessor to the Financial Stability Board released its Principles for Sound Compensation Practices, which noted that &ldquo;Multiple surveys find that over 80 percent of market participants believe that compensation practices played a role in promoting the accumulation of risks that led to the current crisis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although fifteen years have elapsed since these events, the lessons they offer do not recede with the passage of time. If they do, history shows that we will be doomed to see a repeat of the same problems again.</p>
<p>Now some have argued that, even if there was a need for this rule at one point, it&rsquo;s no longer needed today.</p>
<p>But this is not how Congressional&nbsp;<i>mandates&nbsp;</i>work. Of 330 rulemaking provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act, only 148 were mandatory. And of those, only 22 had a deadline of less than a year after enactment. Section 956 was one of them.</p>
<p>And just because the SEC has implemented other mandatory Dodd-Frank rulemakings over the years, including reforms to make compensation committees more independent, allowing shareholders to have their voice heard through say-on-pay votes, clawing back erroneously awarded compensation, and requiring companies to tell shareholders about the relationship between pay and performance, that doesn&rsquo;t mean we don&rsquo;t need this one.</p>
<p>Different rules have different functions. Some are about transparency and disclosure, others about good governance hygiene, or holding bad actors accountable. And while supervising financial institutions and conducting exams are essential, it helps to have clear bright line rules, and not just principles-based concepts.</p>
<p>Section 956 is about ensuring sound compensation practices that ensure there is sensitivity to downside risks. It will benefit investors and contribute to the financial stability of our very interconnected system. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And to dispel some myths about what this provision isn&rsquo;t about: it isn&rsquo;t about naming-and-shaming executives or going after small community institutions. It&rsquo;s not about the government trying to set executive pay, and it&rsquo;s not about rank-and-file employees.</p>
<p>Finally, the regional banking crisis our country experienced last year, with the failures of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank, again illustrates why this rule is so essential.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve Board&rsquo;s April 2023 report examining the factors that contributed to SVB&rsquo;s failure found that its compensation packages for senior management were tied to short-term earnings and did not include any risk metrics, which may have contributed to an excessive focus on growth and short-term profitability at the expense of effective risk management. We&rsquo;ve seen this movie before and I commend our banking regulators and the Treasury Department for moving swiftly to contain the damage and avoid a wider crisis of confidence throughout the sector.</p>
<p>With over thirteen years past the mandatory deadline set by Congress, this rulemaking is long overdue but encouraging to see on our agency&rsquo;s short-term agenda. This is a joint rulemaking with a number of our sister agencies so it will take a lot of cooperation and coordination, but I am hopeful we can get there.</p>
<p>One of the three pillars of the SEC&rsquo;s mission is to protect investors, and implementing this rule will do just that. It will also contribute to reducing the excessive risk-taking that could prevent, or reduce the adverse impact of, a future financial crisis. Thank you again for the opportunity to share a few thoughts with you today. I look forward to learning from each of the panelists and from the ensuing discussion.</p>

<title>ESAs Propose Improvements To The Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: ESAs, Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation, green transition, consumer protection, greenwashing<br />
Summary: 
The ESAs published an assessment of the SFDR, recommending clear product categories, a sustainability indicator, improved disclosures, and consumer testing. They also offer support to the European Commission.<br /> <div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The three European Supervisory Authorities (EBA, EIOPA and ESMA &ndash; ESAs) today published a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-06/JC_2024_06_Joint_ESAs_Opinion_on_SFDR.pdf">joint Opinion</a>&nbsp;on the assessment of the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR). The ESAs call for a coherent sustainable finance framework that caters for both the green transition and enhanced consumer protection, taking into account the lessons learned from the functioning of the SFDR.</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The ESAs focus on ways to introduce simple and clear categories for financial products. The simplifications consist of two voluntary product categories, &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo; and &ldquo;transition&rdquo;, that financial market participants should use to ensure consumers understand the purpose of the products. The rules for the categories should have a clear objective and criteria to reduce greenwashing risks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ESAs recommend that the European Commission consider the introduction of a sustainability indicator that would grade financial products such as investment funds, life insurance and pension products.</p>
<p>In addition, the Opinion also covers the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>appropriate disclosures for products outside the two categories to reduce greenwashing,</li>
<li>improvements to the definition of sustainable investments,</li>
<li>simplification to the way disclosures are presented to investors,</li>
<li>other technical suggestions including on which products should fall under the scope of SFDR and on how to improve disclosures regarding the negative impact of investments on people and the environment, and</li>
<li>the need for&nbsp;consumer testing before putting forward any policy proposals to review the SFDR, such as to introduce a categorisation system and/or an indicator.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span>Background</span></h4>
<p>The ESAs deliver this Opinion on their own initiative. The Opinion is published in the context of a comprehensive review of the SFDR framework by the European Commission, which includes the SFDR regulation and&nbsp;<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2022/1288/oj">Delegated Regulation</a>. Going forward, the ESAs are ready to support the European Commission in future policy considerations on any review of the SFDR framework.</p>

<div> SET, Thailand, sustainability, net-zero, ESG<br />
<br />Summary:<br />SET Sustainability Forum promotes Thai businesses' readiness for net-zero transition and resilience, featuring global climate finance experts and practical guidelines. <div>
<p>Embracing the urgency for sustainable and inclusive transition, the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) plays a pivotal role in propelling the Thai private sector towards net zero goals. Today, SET ESG Academy successfully hosted the SET Sustainability Forum 2/2024: Scaling up Synergies and Solutions for Net-Zero.&nbsp;This influential gathering brought together government agencies, business leaders, and capital market stakeholders from both local and international spheres to exchange insights and collaborate on advancing the Thai business sector across the entire supply chain.</p>
<p>The forum focused on empowering Thai businesses&rsquo; readiness to navigate uncertainties, foster robust growth, accelerate their science-based journey towards achieving net zero targets, and pursue long-run resilience. By aligning the quality of ESG data with international standards, the SET Sustainability Forum aims to unleash the potential of the Thai business sector and secure a prominent presence on the global stage, enabling the environment to compete on a global scale.</p>
<p>Highlighting the importance of robust corporate governance and resilience,&nbsp;<b>SET Senior Executive Vice President Soraphol Tulayasathien&nbsp;</b>emphasized the need to withstand volatility, be ready against incoming uncertainties, and seize future opportunities. Together with various sectors, SET is committed to preparing Thai businesses for the transition by uplifting ESG data toward global standards, increasing business integrity, and rebuilding&nbsp;trust. This collaborative effort reinforces global investor confidence and aligns with SET's determination to shape the future as approaching its 50th anniversary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The forum kicked off with valuable insights from global climate finance experts,&nbsp;<b>James Grabert</b>,&nbsp;<b>Director of the Mitigation Division at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)</b>, together with a regional expert on Article six to support the implementation under the Paris Agreement from the&nbsp;<b>UNFCCC/IGES Asia-Pacific Regional Collaboration Centre, Jens Radschinski</b>. Both shared their perspectives on the global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions crisis and presented science-based solutions to address the problem, such as carbon market and carbon credits. These agreed solutions can accelerate concrete climate actions toward Net-Zero, as well as deliver positive impacts across economic, social, and environmental aspects. The next discussions centered actions taken by&nbsp;the government and capital market regulatory agencies as an ecosystem to support Thai corporations in reducing corporate emissions in line with international practices.&nbsp;<b>The Second half started by the keynot</b><b>e,</b><b>&nbsp;Thai Bond Market Association President Somjin Sornpaisarn</b>&nbsp;highlighted ways to facilitate businesses' access to finance or international funding sources through capital market, and ended the event by portraying the adoption of financial mechanisms to ensure a sustainable transition and resilience throughout the supply chain, against future crises.</p>

<br />
Our industry faces political shifts, but is experiencing growth, competition, and technological advancements. There are opportunities for CMU development in the EU.
<br /><br />Summary: Derivatives industry faces political shifts, but is experiencing growth, competition, and technological advancements. Opportunities for CMU development in the EU. <div>
<p>Welcome to the International Derivatives Expo or what we affectionately call IDX. If you can believe it, this is our 16th year of hosting this fantastic conference!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />IDX brings together the entirety of the global derivatives markets to discuss developments and challenges facing this industry, with a special focus on Europe. It's also wonderful to be here in London, one of the greatest cities in the world!&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />As we gather here at IDX, we are going through an incredibly uncertain time. 2024 will see half the world heading to the polls in what is set to be a historic election year.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Two weeks ago, the EU elections saw the conservatives and centre-right groups gain ground, leading French President Macron to call for a snap election later this summer. Here in the UK, the Labour party is expected to sweep into power when elections are held on 4 July. And we have that boring election in the US where Americans will elect an unpopular President in November, no matter who is elected.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />These political shifts will undoubtedly increase volatility and uncertainty in global affairs and markets. With the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, as well as growing western tensions with China and Iran, it is likely that markets will reflect this uncertainty for the foreseeable future.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />But despite these constant negative headlines, there are many reasons to be optimistic about our industry. Today I want to talk about some of these good news stories that are happening right now in our markets.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Keep on Growing&nbsp;</strong><br />Take volumes and growth. Last year the number of futures and options traded on exchanges worldwide hit a record level of 137 billion contracts.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Last year&rsquo;s trading volume was 64% higher than the year before, and more than double the total number of contracts that traded in 2021. Our markets today trade more contracts in one month than our industry did in an entire year 20 years ago!&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />We may not like the heightened political tensions right now, but our markets were built for this moment. During these times of volatility, our products help investors and institutions manage risk and reduce the economic fallout from this turmoil.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />All around the world &ndash; whether in London, Paris, New York, Chicago, Singapore or developing regions like India, Brazil, and Dubai &ndash; our story is one of global growth.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />One traditional asset class that is thriving is energy. Two years ago, Europe was reeling from supply shocks brought on by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Energy prices surged to record highs.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Fast forward to today and energy markets have adjusted. Europeans have found new sources of supply, invested in renewable energy, and become more energy efficient. As a result, energy prices have come down.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />This was not because of price controls or government regulation. It was because our markets sent powerful pricing signals that changed behavior.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Today Europeans use 20% less natural gas than they did in 2021. And for the first time in 2023, electricity generated from renewables overtook electricity derived from fossil fuels in the EU. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Pricing signals from our markets helped drive this change in supply and demand for the better. Now that&rsquo;s powerful and worth bragging about.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Ain't No Mountain High Enough</strong><br />A second reason to be optimistic about our industry is heightened competition. I don&rsquo;t know about you, but this feels like the most competitive environment our industry has experienced in a couple of decades.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />We have existing and startup exchanges challenging each other with novel ideas and new models. We have transformative technologies that could revolutionize how markets work. And we have innovative products that promise to drive growth well into the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Here in Europe, there are fierce battles among exchanges in the equity options space, the power and gas markets and the ESTRs futures markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />In the US, the Treasury and repo clearing mandate has lit a fire in the interest rate markets. FICC, CME, ICE, LCH and FMX are all putting forward offerings to improve this $27 trillion Treasury market.&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition drives us to do better, to modernize and to become more cost efficient. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />That is why FIA champions responsible innovation and fair competition through initiatives like our Expo Innovators Pavilion and the awarding of an annual Innovator of the Year to a deserving startup.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />We all benefit from this enhanced competitive environment. And that is why I remain optimistic about our industry right now.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Blinded Me with Science&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br />A third reason I&rsquo;m feeling positive is the transformative technologies that are beginning to impact our markets for the better. One such promising technology is tokenization. It has the potential to revolutionize how our markets work by digitizing the settlement of trades.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Fifteen years ago, the G20 nations put forward our markets as a model of reform after the financial crisis. In doing so, they cited the importance of clearing &ndash; the process that provides our markets a safe and transparent way for trades to settle. This is ensured through the daily collection of margin and collateral to guard against default.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />This settlement process works well but has room for modernization. The workflow of clearing and margining requires a coordinated ballet of market participants working together to make sure the right money and assets are moved to the right account on the right day.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />But what happens when trading moves to 24/7 beyond banking hours?&nbsp; What happens when a settlement cycle falls on a bank holiday and margin cannot be collected from clients?&nbsp; If clearing and settlement cannot run, risk builds in the system where it is not expected.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Are there ways to simplify and modernize this process to avoid these risk anomalies?&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />One solution may be tokenization. Tokenizing cash and collateral would allow us to move margin and settle trades faster and safer, lowering the risk of defaults disrupting our markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />This would allow us to settle trades on public holidays or during extended trading hours, making our markets more efficient and safer.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />The good news is there is a lot of work being done on this concept and it&rsquo;s worth our industry paying close attention. Recent public-private initiatives by central banks, regulators and market participants show great promise for developing standards and approaches for tokenizing assets.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />These are exciting developments that our industry must embrace. This is another reason we should be optimistic about our future.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Crossroads&nbsp;</strong><br />Clearly, not everything is as doom and gloom as it seems. There is a real opportunity to continue to grow our markets and make them more competitive in Europe and beyond.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />This is also an opportune time to take stock and examine the goal of developing a strengthened Capital Markets Union in the EU. FIA and its members strongly support developing more choices for capital formation and investment wherever clients need funding for growth, including the EU.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />That said, we find ourselves at a crossroads. The further development of the CMU requires many ingredients, including a sound and proportional regulatory framework, a harmonised insolvency structure, and, importantly, strong incentives for citizens and institutions to want to invest their savings in European companies.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Unfortunately, many companies find doing business in the EU complicated and burdensome.&nbsp;<br /><br />Today FIA and Acuiti are&nbsp;<a href="https://email.fia.org/c/12bXklZiBAWknb4a4aP6jYGucLqRqA">releasing a survey&nbsp;</a>on the state of the European markets, which speaks to this point. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />When asked, 53% of market participants believe that regulatory burdens are the biggest challenge to growing the derivatives business over the next five years.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Forty percent of respondents do not believe that EU regulations are proportionate to the risks of their activity.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />The survey also shows that more companies are looking outside Europe, rather than internally, for client growth of their business.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Such concerns around balkanization are also echoed by others within the EU, including prominent European political leaders. Several have noted that entrepreneurs and businesses face significant red tape, fragmentation and costs due to overlapping regulations and administrative complexities in the EU.<br />&nbsp;<br />Moving to a more simple, centralized and proportional set of rules could incentivize investors to unlock the $33 trillion of savings currently sitting in EU deposits.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Without this untapped investment, the EU economy is at risk of falling further behind in a fiercely competitive world. But if these funds can be put to productive use, it will fuel European growth and offer significant opportunities for our industry on the continent.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />The EU plans to prioritize the completion of a CMU once the new Commission and Parliament are formed. And if they can get this right, with a balanced approach of incentives and fit-for-purpose regulations, the EU has a real shot of strengthening its capital markets and creating a culture of investing. This would be a boon for our global economy and markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>This is the End&nbsp;</strong><br />In closing, I want to reiterate my optimism for this industry. Afterall, this is the time of year for renewal and hope as many young students from around the world graduate from schools and universities. My daughter is one of those graduates, so I have been listening to many speeches advising students on the keys to fulfilment, success and happiness in life.&nbsp;<br /><br />A common theme is the importance of giving back to others and thinking beyond yourself to serve a greater cause.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />When I think about my own happiness, it is when I feel a part of a greater good&mdash;when I have worked with smart people who earnestly are trying to help others and build something meaningful.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />I witness this all the time in our industry. One thing I love about our markets is we are always ready to roll up our sleeves when it matters to help the community.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Like seeing a backlog in trades at the start of Covid and our membership creating the standards body DMIST to address it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Or facing a major cyberattack last year and industry volunteers coming together to overcome the incident and prepare for the next attack.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Or even seeing injustice and a lack of opportunities among our youth and individuals from our community deciding to get involved with Futures for Kids and its Gala to raise money for this important cause.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Specifically, I want to give a shoutout to one such individual, SGX&rsquo;s Rama Pillai. Rama decided to take on the Kilt Challenge for Futures for Kids this year, more than doubling the record by raising &pound;60,000 pounds for this charity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />These are the human good news stories of the futures industry that I see all the time. It comes in the form of selfless acts of volunteers who give back, even when no one is looking.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />So, when you feel overwhelmed by the negative news that bombards us all day long, I challenge you to not retreat, but to combat it by giving back. Put positivity back into the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />It is this basic human interaction that connects us all and brings us happiness and joy. And I&rsquo;m humbled to be associated with an industry that comes together in times of troubles to solve problems for the greater good. That is the greatest good news story of them all.&nbsp;</p>

<h5><em>Report finds interest rates and energy are the asset classes with the greatest potential for growth in trading volume over the next five years</em></h5>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FIA today released a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fia.org/sites/default/files/2024-06/State%20of%20the%20European%20Derivatives%20Market_June2024.pdf">report</a>&nbsp;on the challenges and opportunities facing the European listed derivatives markets. The report is based on responses to a survey conducted recently by Acuiti, a market intelligence firm, that gauged industry sentiment regarding the key trends, opportunities and challenges facing the industry in Europe.</p>
<p>Acuiti surveyed more than 100 individuals at a variety of firms active in Europe, including clearing brokers, asset managers, hedge funds, principal trading firms, exchanges and software vendors. The survey asked for opinions on current trends as well as the outlook for the next five years.</p>
<p>The survey found that the industry is optimistic about the potential for growth and innovation in Europe, but also aware that other parts of the world may offer better growth prospects. The survey also found a high level of concern about existing and prospective regulations as well as the aftereffects of Brexit.</p>
<p>The key trends identified in this report are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Global ambitions: Many firms see more potential growth in terms of clients and trading volume outside of Europe than inside Europe.</li>
<li>Regulatory headwinds: There is a broad consensus across the industry that the combined impact of multiple sets of regulations has created a major burden for the industry.</li>
<li>Brexit aftermath: Most listed derivatives market participants see Brexit as having a negative effect on London's stature as a global financial center and predict that Paris will be the European financial center with the greatest growth potential over the next five years.</li>
<li>Cyber risk: The threat of disruption from cyber-attack was identified as the single greatest risk that the industry is currently facing.</li>
<li>Growth opportunities: Futures and options based on interest rates and energy were viewed as having the greatest growth potential over the next five years. Crypto and carbon also look attractive to many firms, although a sizeable number of survey respondents said their firms have no intention of entering these new asset classes.</li>
<li>Efficiency vs Innovation: Views on technology trends vary significantly across the industry. Clearing brokers and other sell-side firms are prioritizing gains in efficiency from their investments in technology. In contrast, principal trading firms and exchanges are more interested in innovative new technologies such as artificial intelligence and blockchain.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"This report provides an important window into how the European listed derivatives industry views the major challenges and opportunities in the years ahead," said Bruce Savage, FIA Head of Europe. "We look forward to working with European policy makers and the industry on ways to leverage the findings of this report and accelerate the growth of European markets."</p>
<p>"To better serve the exchange-traded and cleared derivatives markets, FIA is keenly interested in understanding the dynamics of growth and innovation at both the regional and global level," said Walt Lukken, FIA President and CEO. "Many of our most important members are based in Europe, and we are delighted to partner with Acuiti on this initiative to understand how the industry sees the outlook for this region."</p>
<p>&ldquo;Market participants within Europe are optimistic about their growth prospects and the future of European derivatives markets, however, many are looking outside Europe for client growth,&rdquo; said Will Mitting, Founder and Managing Director of Acuiti. &ldquo;Fragmented markets are increasing the costs of trading in Europe while regulation is hampering many firms&rsquo; ability to commit capital to expansion. For Europe to fully realise its potential, it is essential that these issues are addressed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The report is being released in conjunction with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fia.org/fia/events/international-derivatives-expo">International Derivatives Expo (IDX)</a>, FIA's annual conference and trade show in London. IDX brings together more than 1,000 executives from clearing firms, trading firms, exchanges and technology providers for three days of discussions on the most critical issues related to the cleared derivatives industry in Europe.</p>

<title>The Payments Association Echoes Industry Calls For Policymakers And The Fintech Sector To Support Consumers With Community Finance</title>

<div> Financial resilience, community finance, credit unions, regulatory barriers, financial inclusion
<br />
The Payments Association highlights barriers to community finance growth and proposes policy recommendations to improve access and support for financially underserved communities.
<br /><br />Summary: Financial resilience, community finance, credit unions, regulatory barriers, and financial inclusion are addressed in The Payments Association's call for support. <div>
<ul>
<li><em>12.9 million adults (one in four) in the UK have low financial resilience and a record 6.7 million are now in severe financial difficulty.</em></li>
<li><em>The Payments Association&rsquo;s &ldquo;Redefining Community Finance: Unlocking Pathways to Financial Inclusion&rdquo; whitepaper highlights the role of community finance organisations in expanding access to financially underserved communities across the UK.</em></li>
<li><em>The paper identifies barriers like limited reach due to language barriers and biases, and common bond requirements, as well as stifling regulations designed for larger institutions.</em></li>
<li><em>The paper proposes policy recommendations which have been crafted following extensive conversations with experts across academia, the industry, the third sector and regulators, as well as a review of other studies which have looked at how the community finance sector can help tackle financial exclusion.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><br /> With millions of people in the UK struggling to access affordable financial services, The Payments Association is calling attention to underutilised solutions including community finance options like credit unions. The association&rsquo;s newly released paper: "<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://usw2.nyl.as/t1/207/c6zntaoi6ajqd3ukoj60b45fd/1/2e44cbbf0477021345650bb651d6cb638d08e55e894e536994e8cef700f100dc" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Redefining Community Finance: Unlocking Pathways to Financial Inclusion</em></a>" highlights the potential of these institutions but also the significant barriers hindering their growth.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Payments Association's Financial Inclusion Working Group has the specific purpose to inform and collaborate with government, regulators and third sector bodies, providing clarity on innovations and solutions in payments that can reduce financial exclusion and the poverty premium. It seeks to achieve this by collaborating with industry bodies, developing thought-leadership campaigns, and informing regulatory and legislative decisions.</p>
<p>The FCA estimates one in four UK adults have low financial resilience &ndash; meaning they don&rsquo;t have enough savings or resources to cover unexpected expenses without significantly impacting their standard of living. The Debt Justice reports a record 6.7 million Britons in severe financial difficulty. A greater public understanding of community finance could be the answer, but it needs support.</p>
<h4><strong>The specific problems</strong></h4>
<p>The whitepaper identifies several hurdles. The first step towards prompting greater private and public sector buy-in, attracting investment to the sector, and reaching more consumers is to reassess and redefine the &lsquo;brand&rsquo; of community finance. There needs to be a distinction between credit and debt. There is a tendency to talk about finances as &lsquo;debt&rsquo; for subprime borrowers, while it is &lsquo;credit&rsquo; for those classed as prime borrowers. These nuances matter as they serve to reinforce stereotypes.</p>
<p>Additionally, the traditional geographic definition of "community" limits their reach. The paper proposes broadening the definition to encompass shared values or experiences, citing successful examples like Sibstar, a debit card designed for dementia patients. By leveraging these connections, community finance can serve a wider range of underserved consumers.</p>
<p>Regulatory pressures further complicate matters. Community finance providers face the same regulations as large institutions despite having fewer resources.</p>
<h4><strong>The Payments Association&rsquo;s call to action</strong></h4>
<p>They recommend establishing a dedicated "sandbox" environment where community lenders and technology providers can collaborate and develop innovative solutions. Additionally, the government should learn from successful initiatives in other countries, such as Credit Union Service Organisations (CUSOs) in the US.</p>
<p>A fairer regulatory framework that acknowledges the unique mission of community finance organisations is also needed. This can be coupled with business rate relief and a kitemark system to signify trust and quality.</p>
<p>Finally, to encourage engagement from mainstream financial institutions, targeted investments, levies, mentorship programs, and improved signposting initiatives could be explored. Collaboration between community finance providers and regulators is also crucial to navigate the common bond challenge and share successful solutions across the sector. By implementing these recommendations, the potential of community finance could be unlocked and empower financially underserved communities.</p>
<p><strong>Tony Craddock, Director General of The Payments Association</strong>, said:<strong>&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;</em></strong><em>Financial inclusion remains critically important, with a staggering number of people in this country still struggling to access financial services. Community finance providers, such as credit unions and Community Development Finance Institutions, play a vital role in bridging this gap. However, the sector faces significant barriers to growth, including negative perceptions, limited resources, and regulatory burdens. We hope policymakers realise the enormity of this issue and take our recommendations on board.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong>Pooja Bhachu, Chair of the Payments Association's Financial Inclusion Working Group and Director, Public Policy, UK &amp; Ireland, Mastercard,</strong>&nbsp;wrote the foreword to the paper - commenting:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;At both Mastercard and The Payments Association, we advocate for a society where equal access leads to equitable opportunity for everyone. This whitepaper is a call to action for the financial services industry, policymakers, and innovators to come together and build a more inclusive financial system."</em></p>
<p><strong>Neil Harris, Chair of The Payments Association&rsquo;s Advisory Board,&nbsp;</strong>said:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Community finance organisations are doing enormously important work serving the underserved, but all too often they lack the resources and support to effectively carry out this mission at the scale that is needed. It is clear what a powerful tool for financial inclusion that community finance can be, but it needs a collective effort from government, policymakers, the finance industry, and technology providers to support this sector to thrive.&rdquo;</em></p>

<title>SIX Launches New Global Equity Indices</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/six-launches-new-global-equity-indices/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/six-launches-new-global-equity-indices/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> global equity indices, financial institutions, API technology, client experience, market representation
<br />
Summary: 
SIX launches global equity indices for financial institutions, using API technology to enhance the client experience and provide market representation. Exciting innovations anticipated. <div>
<p><span>The global financial information provider SIX has launched today a family of global equity indices designed specifically for the retail, private banking, and asset management sector. This marks the company&rsquo;s latest move in its push to further strengthen its position as a global index and data provider.</span></p>
<div class="textimage ">
<div>
<div>
<p>The new indices come in response to the growing appetite from financial institutions to gain a clearer view of the stocks and markets in which their clients&rsquo; money is invested, as well as their performance. Beyond empowering financial institutions to provide customers with a simple, digital portal through which to view their equities investments, the new offering will significantly reduce the administrative burden for many existing clients of SIX. Rather than subscribing to several sources, SIX can provide access to equivalent indices with reduced administrative overhead.</p>
<p>In addition, the use of API technology by SIX means financial institutions can offer additional data sets to customers like real-time pricing information surrounding a given equity, along with more granular detail on its performance. Financial institutions will also not need to interact with multiple index and data providers any longer in order to be able to offer these services to their customers.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.six-group.com/en/products-services/financial-information/indices/global.html" target="_blank">SIX Global Equity Indices</a>&nbsp;comprise the SIX World and the SIX Broad &amp; Blue-Chip Indices. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.six-group.com/en/products-services/financial-information/indices/global/world-indices.html" target="_blank">SIX World Indices</a>&nbsp;have a variable number of components that aim to provide the broadest market representation for a diversified set of major geographic regions. The indices are reviewed on a semiannual basis in June and December and their components weighted by free-float market capitalization. The calculation is performed in USD, EUR and CHF, while the dissemination occurs as end-of-day only.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.six-group.com/en/products-services/financial-information/indices/global/broad-blue-chip-indices.html" target="_blank">SIX Broad &amp; Blue-Chip Indices</a>&nbsp;include indices with a fixed number of components that aim to capture the most representative companies of geographic or economic agglomerations from medium to country level. The review frequencies are set individually (with the majority being rebalanced on a quarterly, annual or semi-annual basis). The index components are typically weighted by free-float market capitalization, although some indices are offered as price weighted.</p>
<p>The existing Swiss (SMI/SPI/SBI/SARON), Spanish (IBEX35), Nordic and ESG indices from SIX are already popular with a vast array of global banks, asset managers and asset owners. To enhance and simplify the client experience, the solution combines all essential indices and instrument data into one single delivery channel, the Web API. This includes equity prices, index values, index constituents, reference data, corporate actions information and regulatory data.</p>
<p>All indices are available in USD, EUR, CHF and local currencies and as price, net and gross return versions. The SIX Global Indices also serve as basis for fully-customized indices, depending on individual client requirements and for use-cases in display, derived data, reporting, portfolio, risk and asset management.</p>

With the relentless growth of passive investing, this has become increasingly important in recent years. Many financial institutions are in the process of renewing their online banking products, including their own websites and apps. SIX supports them with a more sophisticated overview of market performance for their investment-savvy customers, and our combined proposition around API delivery will make accessing this data faster, simpler, and more cost-effective for financial institutions. We eagerly anticipate creating further innovations in this exciting space.&rdquo;</p>

<div> TT Futures TCA, TT Trade Surveillance, transaction cost analysis, machine learning algorithm, multi-asset coverage <br />
Summary: 
Trading Technologies introduces TT Futures TCA for futures trading and expands TT Trade Surveillance across asset classes with machine learning-driven models. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>Trading Technologies International, Inc. (TT), a global capital markets technology platform provider, today announced the introduction of TT Futures TCA and TT Trade Surveillance, two new offerings that significantly enhance its Data &amp; Analytics and Compliance lines of business. TT Futures TCA, a comprehensive transaction cost analysis (TCA) tool for futures trading, leverages the largest collection of anonymized, millisecond-level futures market and trade data with a vast array of metrics and measures. TT Trade Surveillance, powered by the proprietary SCORE machine learning algorithm, combines new multi-asset coverage and dozens of new configurable models with the machine learning-driven models from TT Score, the company's first-generation trade surveillance platform. The firm plans to upgrade and shift all TT Score users to TT Trade Surveillance in the second half of this year.</p>
<div dir="ltr" id="dvprnejpgba16left"><img align="middle" alt="Trading Technologies" id="prnejpgba16left" src="https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1672454/Trading_Technologies_Logo.jpg" title="Trading Technologies" /></div>
<p>TT Chief Operating Officer Justin Llewellyn-Jones said: "We are constantly in a mode of identifying opportunities that will enhance our clients' experience, simplify their day-to-day operations, increase efficiencies and add value to the trade life cycle. The introduction of our new futures TCA and expanded multi-asset trade surveillance capabilities are the latest examples of how Trading Technologies and the TT platform play a pivotal role in the global financial markets."</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TT Futures TCA</span></b></p>
<p>In August,&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="http://email.prnewswire.com/ls/click?upn=u001.v9xoTZaCB3KDvUFxTt6K9ITfJcLtx-2FOvmuVizoBK57AacPgsRbirR6CuZGxkHSuSUbaW4H0zcZiBBl94Z1g4aeR0iawYtrzAw0cGevNynIO3dh-2BM55hIVdcizmxfRJpkM1kYXBlwQ5dCyP-2BBlf54bDHak8m6ioW1fE2y-2BzXRr4TMlEkKIK0CFQXKp4orXYQ6ARRbzjyYU-2F3DuSUXCK5jzQziwweMgqWwERqkR7EG-2FHf2VDy6bplxQiiGeOgbBAkU2H7mMMh0uFf32jcFgD-2FyKBgJcwpSOf3vgYkRZaXbgGk-3DdoyD_pIbxPfpDI69aAybPrpOfg1n6CWmKMnb3conIyNKCYgr-2BTRqxLAwMRExIXLpGb5DJcFeSrgRvYMmMz8o6ugzHtVc36MB3pQA3u0YeMrNsMJLKeV-2B7olPs6FUPD5JgB1-2FTAXopCBrXNeMj1cWisEcPLAv4nTmnQ93F28kkL4UUvVouWHpsd57aGPUTNbjOtIIe74riq-2FHhvP2zYpoZp-2B4auyPmnyhSG08r9H0Tl5ZJlSPTqdfMXk3CwQzqpDAeM8R6GDOX3X30UEsBOUzZrdEqLTl1Bp8F-2FvgtIPDWia1QuGkCLGrXP98AbIF5G-2BZ2oK4rBjfJL1-2BNOBx08DE8gQX4H084FIC7UczRpXl7iPDg2J4-3D" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">TT acquired Abel Noser Solutions</a></span>, the leading global provider of TCA solutions. A pioneer in the space, Abel Noser co-created the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) methodology that is now one of the financial markets' most widely used technical analysis tools. TCA has been popular in equity markets and other asset classes for many years, but it hasn't yet been widely adopted as a tool for futures.</p>
<p>Peter Weiler, TT's EVP Managing Director, Data &amp; Analytics, said: "Historically, investment managers and traders have not been able to rely on a TCA tool tailored for futures. By leveraging the massive amount of real-world futures trading data &ndash; anonymized &ndash; that only a firm like TT can bring to the table, we're able to combine it with Abel Noser's extensive TCA data and custom reporting that has been an essential tool in other asset classes, and produce what is without question the most comprehensive TCA solution for futures. We'll be providing anonymized peer benchmarks for detailed, post-trade analyses down to the millisecond. Users can look at like trades under historically similar circumstances to make apples-to-apples comparisons, understand their success relative to their peers, ensure they are achieving best execution and more."</p>
<p>The new TCA for futures capability will enable users to choose from an array of customizable reports to analyze and improve their trading strategies while measuring the efficacy of their trading counterparties. The capability is available now and will be integrated in early 2025 into the TT platform as a widget on the front end, with the customized analytics available to the client based on the metrics, breadth and level of granularity desired. Clients will have an option of three levels of service dependent upon their analytical needs.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TT Trade Surveillance</span></b></p>
<p>TT is upgrading its trade surveillance capabilities beyond listed derivatives to a wide range of asset classes, including equities and equity-adjacent subclasses such as preferred, warrants and SPACs; equity options; foreign exchange (FX); and fixed income. TT Trade Surveillance adds 47 new user-configurable surveillance models to its existing suite of models driven by machine learning technology. The new models are designed to detect a wide range of manipulative or disruptive trading activities, including insider trading, front-running and naked short-selling practices.</p>
<p>Ted Morgan, Trading Technologies EVP Managing Director, Compliance, said: "We're building on our track record of innovation and investment in the product by extending our capabilities into new asset classes &ndash; consistent with our company-wide expansion &ndash; and more than doubling our surveillance models, putting more power into the users' hands. They can adjust settings and thresholds that pertain to any particular model and run them on any subset of data they want to filter, such as defining parameters differently for specific countries or distinguishing between retail and institutional flow."</p>
<p>Morgan said users will continue to enjoy the online suite of analysis tools and out-of-the-box features available to compliance officers investigating alerts, such as the market replay tool, reconciliation module and other graphical aids. TT Trade Surveillance provides the market data needed for particular surveillance models at no extra cost. Users can also create and configure a synthetic instrument to identify potential manipulation across products and markets.</p>

<div> Marshall Scholarship, Marshall Medal, Oxford, transformative experience, U.S.-U.K. relationship <br />
<br />
Summary: <br />
Marshall Scholar grateful for honor, discusses transformative experiences at Oxford, deep U.S.-U.K. relationship, and financial stability efforts. <div>
<p>Thank you, John. And thank you to the Marshall Aid Commemoration Commission and the commissioners for this most extraordinary honor. To be mentioned alongside previous Marshall Medal recipients, such as Secretary Madeleine Albright, Secretary Colin Powell, Justice Stephen Breyer, and eminent political scientist and university president Nan Keohane, is humbling. The distinction is especially meaningful to me, because I have taken great pride in being a Marshall Scholar from the moment I was selected during my senior year at Spelman College. In the years since, I have enjoyed meeting and being inspired by Marshall Scholars throughout the country and around the world. I also have enjoyed reviewing the applications of future Marshall Scholars, one way in which I have taken seriously the responsibility to serve as an ambassador for the program. I look forward to continuing to serve in such an ambassadorial role as a Marshall Medal recipient. Again, I am beyond grateful to the Commission for the truly humbling and thrilling honor.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20240617a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a></p>
<p>My Marshall experience completely changed my thinking about my life and career. The people I met had many different interests and experiences and were preparing for careers I had never heard of until I began my studies at the University of Oxford. I relished learning more about British culture and immersing myself in one of the U.K.'s and the world's storied universities. Likewise, I took pride in the fact that I could share my ideas, culture, and experiences with others during my time as a Marshall Scholar, and I forged strong friendships that endure to this day. Gaining a fuller understanding of the friendship and respect between the U.S. and U.K., and the global importance of these two economies and democracies, has held me in good stead for many years and continues to be important in my current role as a member of the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors.</p>
<p>In fact, I had my eyes on studying in Europe as far back as junior high school, when, during Latin class, I dreamed of following the Appian Way and other Roman routes that stretched from Britain to Israel to Morocco. I was eager to put my Girl Scout navigation and itinerary-building skills to the test on another continent. My first taste of European life came during my junior year abroad, when I won a Charles L. Merrill Scholarship to study in Strasbourg, France. During spring break of that year, I purchased a student Britrail pass and traveled to London, Southampton, and Stratford-upon-Avon. I met students and other people from all over Europe throughout the year, and I had many conversations on trains, ferries, and beaches, as well as in hostels and homes to which I was invited. I was immensely grateful to be able to do so many things my parents never had the opportunity to do, and I was eager to continue such experiences. As a result, on the advice of my mentors at Spelman&mdash;Professors Ethel Githii, Margery Ganz, and Lois Moreland&mdash;as well as the president at the time, Donald M. Stewart, I applied for the Marshall Scholarship and was humbled to be the first Spelman student to receive it.</p>
<p><strong>Transformative Experience</strong><br />Reflecting on the essay I wrote for my Marshall application, I invoked Plato's allegory of the cave from Book VII of the<em>&nbsp;Republic</em>&nbsp;to describe the transformation in my world view that occurred during my junior year abroad when it was challenged almost daily. My time as a Marshall Scholar would become the next phase of this ongoing transformation.</p>
<p>When I arrived in Oxford, I was excited and transfixed. The bucolic setting of Oxford was conducive to learning and sharing ideas. As a philosophy major at Spelman and long a student of Latin and the classics, I was incredulous that I had the chance to study philosophy at Oxford with a tutor employing the Socratic method. It was a dream come true. I lived with students from all over the world and made life-long friends. My studies at Oxford shined a bit more light on the subject of economics, perhaps subtly beginning the transformation to my eventual career. In my first (Michaelmas) term, I had a tutorial in mathematical economics, only my third economics course ever. I learned a lot, and I was surprised that I loved it! Maybe that should have been a hint? However, I did not choose it as my concentration. I had to select two subjects out of the three from philosophy, politics, and economics. I chose philosophy and politics, because I thought economics was too much fun.</p>
<p>My most influential tutor, as we called our professors at Oxford, was philosopher of mind and metaphysics Galen Strawson. Through my interactions with him, he helped me answer the question, "How does one construct a thoughtful, systematic world view?" After I completed my studies at Oxford, Galen also helped me hone further academic pursuits and advised me on plans that ultimately led me to pursue a PhD in economics. He was generous with his time and offered very useful advice in comparing British and American economics programs.</p>
<p>Outside of my studies, I enjoyed participating in extracurricular activities that I did not have the opportunity to participate in during high school or college. Those included the Oxford Union, the debate society, and traveling through Italy, Greece, and the Middle East during spring break of my first year. One of my favorite experiences at Oxford was producing, acting in, and serving as the dialect coach for the performance of "For Colored Girls&hellip;" by Ntozake Shange. I did so alongside my still very close friends, Ambassador Susan Rice and Congresswoman Terri Sewell. It was sponsored by the Oxford University Dramatic Society and presented in the historic Oscar Wilde Theatre at Magdalen College. It was the first time "For Colored Girls&hellip;" was put on at Oxford, because it was the first time there were six Black women to put it on! I helped actors from Liverpool and Trinidad and Tobago (and some from the U.S.) learn regional American accents. They joined four of us from the U.S. in the show, which included singing the Aretha Franklin hit "Respect." We sold out every single show.</p>
<p>In addition to sharing American culture, I picked up on the cultural influences of the British Isles. Songs from Irish rock band U2, such as "Pride (In the Name of Love)" and "New Year's Day," seemed to constantly play in the background during my time at Oxford. That exposure proved vital a few years later when I was teaching at Harvard and two gentleman named Paul and David came to speak to my colleagues and me about debt relief for highly indebted poor countries. Initially, I did not understand why everyone was abuzz about these visitors, until someone whispered the familiar song titles in my ear. Those words instantly transported me back to my time in Britain. I was, of course, speaking to Bono and The Edge.</p>
<p><strong>Lasting Bonds</strong><br />While the U.S. and U.K. share close cultural bonds&mdash;look no further than James Bond, Adele,&nbsp;<em>Downton Abbey</em>, Tom Jones,&nbsp;<em>Monty Python</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Bridgerton</em>&mdash;the relationship between the two countries runs much deeper than that. The Marshall Scholarship has its roots with George C. Marshall and the history-changing partnership between the U.S. and U.K during World War II. It is easy to see why a long friendship has endured. We share a language (for the most part!), a history, and a belief in democratic values. Our close economic ties are one aspect of the U.S.-U.K. relationship that stands out. Our countries feature two of the world's great financial centers and share other important connections. The U.K. is the top destination of U.S. direct investment and is the second-largest source of direct investment into this country. The U.S. is the U.K.'s largest trading partner, with 22 percent of U.K. exports heading here last year.</p>
<p>Our central banks have a close relationship as well. We at the Fed respect and work with our counterparts at the Bank of England, including through the Bank for International Settlements, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the G7, and the G20. Given our similar economic structures and banking systems, there is always much to learn from each other to help ensure a resilient financial system. Those efforts are especially important to me as I serve as chair of the Board's Committee on Financial Stability. We know economic shocks tend to reverberate around the world, so having clear and open communication with my fellow central bankers plays a valuable part in assuring financial stability.</p>
<p>It has been wonderful to have the opportunity today to reflect on my time as a Marshall Scholar and to consider how it more fully opened my eyes, allowing me to pursue my career and my passions. As a girl from a small town in Georgia, I debated and discussed ideas and issues during and outside of my tutorials that I had never done before. I met people from many different parts of the U.K. and the world I had never encountered before and who held views I had never heard articulated before. And that, I think, is the very spirit of the Marshall Scholarship and the Marshall Medal: building respect and understanding and strengthening the enduring friendship between our two countries.</p>
<p>Once again, thank you so very much to the Marshall Commission for this honor. I am most grateful and humbled to receive it.</p>

<title>CFTC Awards Over $8 Million To Insider Whistleblower Who Aided CFTC And Other Agency Actions</title>

<div> whistleblower, CFTC, enforcement actions, derivatives market, insider information
Summary:<br />Whistleblower awarded $8 million for providing key information in enforcement actions related to derivatives market deception, saving time and resources. CFTC's Whistleblower Program continues to grant awards. <div>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced it awarded over $8 million to one insider whistleblower who provided significant information and assistance that led the CFTC and other agencies to bring multiple enforcement actions. The whistleblower helped the CFTC establish that one or more derivatives market participants deceived clients about key aspects of trades.</span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>&ldquo;This&nbsp;</span>is an important<span>&nbsp;whistleblower&nbsp;</span>whose&nbsp;<span>information led multiple regulators to bring multiple enforcement actions,&rdquo;&nbsp;</span>said Director of Enforcement Ian McGinley. &ldquo;The whistleblower&rsquo;s assistance enabled the CFTC and other agencies to more efficiently investigate and prosecute the misconduct.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>&ldquo;Based on the whistleblower&rsquo;s involvement in the underlying conduct, the whistleblower provided extremely valuable insider information at a critical time during the investigations,&rdquo; said Whistleblower Office Director Brian Young.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The whistleblower provided direct evidence of not only the whistleblower&rsquo;s own intent in the relevant transactions, but also the whistleblower&rsquo;s knowledge and observations about clients, co-workers, and senior leadership at the liable entity or entities. This ultimately saved substantial time and resources for staff and resulted in a far stronger and more triable case in the event of litigation.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Attorney Advisor Nina Liao of the CFTC&rsquo;s Whistleblower Office handled this whistleblower award.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>About the CFTC&rsquo;s Whistleblower Program</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The Whistleblower Program was created under Section 748 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. Since issuing its first award in 2014, the CFTC has granted whistleblower awards amounting to approximately $380 million. Those awards are associated with enforcement actions that have resulted in monetary sanctions totaling more than $3.2 billion. The CFTC issues awards related not only to the agency&rsquo;s enforcement actions, but also in connection with actions brought by other domestic or foreign regulators if certain conditions are met.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) provides confidentiality protections for whistleblowers. Regardless of whether the CFTC grants an award, the CFTC will not disclose any information that could reasonably be expected to reveal a whistleblower&rsquo;s identity, except in limited circumstances. Consistent with this confidentiality protection, the CFTC will not disclose the name of the enforcement action in which the whistleblower provided information or the exact dollar amount of the award granted.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Whistleblowers are eligible to receive between 10 and 30 percent of the monetary sanctions collected. All whistleblower awards are paid from the CFTC&rsquo;s Customer Protection Fund, which was established by Congress, and is financed entirely through monetary sanctions paid to the CFTC by violators of the CEA. No money is taken or withheld from injured customers to fund the program.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p align="center"><span><span><span><span>* * * * *</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Anyone with information related to potential violations of the CEA or the CFTC&rsquo;s rules and regulations can submit a tip electronically by filing a&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.whistleblower.gov/overview/submitatip"><span>Form TCR&nbsp;</span></a><span>(Tip, Complaint or Referral) online</span><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<title>Statement Of CFTC Commissioner Caroline D. Pham Regarding Settlement Order With Trafigura Trading LLC</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Commissioner Caroline D. Pham, CFTC, Trafigura Trading LLC, administrative order, manipulation<br />Summary: Commissioner Pham criticizes CFTC's order, citing lack of evidence, overreaching, and voting process concerns. She questions the interpretation of the rule and lack of transparency. <div>
<p><span><span><span><span>Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Commissioner Caroline D. Pham released the following statement regarding the CFTC&rsquo;s administrative order regarding Trafigura Trading LLC announced today:</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>&ldquo;While I commend the CFTC Division of Enforcement for their efforts to pursue manipulation in global markets, the Commission inappropriately tacks on an additional charge to fly under the radar with a wholly new interpretation of a 7-year-old rule that has never been the subject of a staff advisory or other notice to the public since it was issued.&nbsp;<span>I&rsquo;m incredibly grateful for those whistleblowers that report bad actors&ndash;often at great risk to their own wellbeing.&nbsp;<span>Of course, we should always encourage open lines of communications and prevent whistleblowers from being silenced.&nbsp;But t</span></span>his settlement order essentially wordsmiths job offer letters and other employment-related agreements with confidentiality provisions for commodity firms around the world that have no CFTC registration requirements and other market participants. Because the settlement order not only inaccurately uses the term &ldquo;non-disclosure agreements,&rdquo; but also fails to include important details about what contractual language the CFTC thinks violates Regulation 165.19, companies and lawyers all over the world are left playing a guessing game to revise tens or hundreds of thousands of documents for both current and former employees that fail to include a carve-out for the magic words &ldquo;Commodity Futures Trading Commission.&rdquo; I made numerous requests for examples of the agreements that the CFTC found violative, and I received only one job offer letter and one separation agreement. Only the job offer letter had language requiring written pre-approval from the firm regarding confidential information, similar to prior SEC&mdash;not CFTC&mdash;enforcement actions, but it also had&nbsp;<strong><span>two</span></strong>&nbsp;savings clauses that voided any language that may violate any law or regulation whether current or prospective. In addition, the firm did not enforce these confidentiality provisions and the separation agreement actually&nbsp;<strong><span>required</span></strong>&nbsp;cooperation in government investigations. Let me be clear: These were not &ldquo;non-disclosure agreements&rdquo; as is commonly understood by in-house lawyers and external legal counsel. The Commission once again overreaches in its zeal to fine millions of dollars for technical issues like nitpicking legal documents in the absence of a firm taking any action to &ldquo;enforc[e] [] confidentiality and pre-dispute arbitration clauses respecting actions by potential whistleblowers in any pre-employment, employment or post-employment agreements&rdquo; as stated in the Commission&rsquo;s only interpretation of Regulation 165.19 to date, in its 2016 proposed rulemaking. As I keep reminding the Commission, we are not the SEC, and the SEC&rsquo;s orders or precedents do not provide sufficient notice to the public for CFTC interpretations because we are a different agency with a different statute, regulations, and markets.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>&ldquo;In addition, I could not vote on this matter because I did not have sufficient evidence to determine there was a reasonable basis for the alleged charges, even after repeated requests. Yet, this case was called for a vote anyway while I was still attempting to access and review the record. These actions are yet another example of why I have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024b"><span>called for a GAO study</span></a>&nbsp;on the CFTC&rsquo;s internal procedures.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></p>

<title>US Office Of The Comptroller Of The Currency Announces Enforcement Actions For June 2024</title>

<div> Credit Suisse AG, Touchmark National Bank, Manuel Alejandro Ramirez Perez, Avianna Rivera, Commonwealth National Bank <br />
Summary:<br /> 
Enforcement actions taken by the OCC against banks and individuals for compliance deficiencies, unsafe practices, and embezzlement. Termination actions also announced. <div>
<p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) today released enforcement actions taken against national banks and federal savings associations (banks), and individuals currently and formerly affiliated with banks the OCC supervises.</p>
<p>The OCC uses enforcement actions against banks to require the board of directors and management to take timely actions to correct the deficient practices or violations identified. Actions taken against banks are:</p>
<ul>
<li><span><a href="https://www.occ.gov/static/enforcement-actions/eaAA-ENF-2024-53.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Formal Agreement</a>&nbsp;with Credit Suisse AG New York Branch,</span>&nbsp;New York, New York, to address deficiencies in the branch&rsquo;s compliance related to the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering laws and regulations. The branch&rsquo;s execution of this formal agreement was a condition for the branch&rsquo;s conversion to a federal license. The provisions of the formal agreement are substantially the same as a prior written agreement between the branch and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the New York State Department of Financial Services. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2024-53)</li>
<li><span><a href="https://www.occ.gov/static/enforcement-actions/eaAA-SO-2024-25.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Formal Agreement</a>&nbsp;with Touchmark National Bank,</span>&nbsp;Alpharetta, Georgia, for unsafe or unsound practices, including those relating to the bank&rsquo;s strategic planning, board and management oversight, liquidity risk management, interest risk management, credit risk management, audit, and information technology. (Docket No. AA-SO-2024-25)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The OCC uses enforcement actions against an institution-affiliated party (IAP) to deter, encourage correction of, or prevent violations, unsafe or unsound practices, or breaches of fiduciary duty. Enforcement actions against IAPs reinforce the accountability of individuals for their conduct regarding the affairs of a bank. The term &ldquo;institution-affiliated party,&rdquo; or IAP, is defined in 12 USC 1813(u) and includes bank directors, officers, employees, and controlling shareholders. Orders of Prohibition prohibit an individual from any participation in the affairs of a bank or other institution as defined in 12 USC 1818(e)(7). Actions taken against IAPs are:</p>
<ul>
<li><span><a href="https://www.occ.gov/static/enforcement-actions/eaAA-ENF-2024-43.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Order of Prohibition</a>&nbsp;against Manuel Alejandro Ramirez Perez,</span>&nbsp;former Relationship Banker and Credit Solutions Advisor at Bonita Springs and North Naples, Florida branches of Bank of America, N.A., Charlotte, North Carolina, for improperly accessing customer accounts and providing information on those accounts to a third-party individual. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2024-43)</li>
<li><span><a href="https://www.occ.gov/static/enforcement-actions/eaAA-ENF-2024-40.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Order of Prohibition</a>&nbsp;against Avianna Rivera,</span>&nbsp;former Personal Banker at a Bryan, Texas branch of First National Bank Texas, Killeen, Texas, for embezzling $11,500 from the account of a bank customer. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2024-40)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The OCC terminates enforcement actions when a bank has demonstrated compliance with all articles of an enforcement action; or when the OCC determines that articles deemed &ldquo;not in compliance&rdquo; have become outdated or irrelevant to the bank&rsquo;s current circumstances; or when the OCC incorporates the articles deemed &ldquo;not in compliance&rdquo; into a new action. Termination actions include:</p>
<ul>
<li><span><a href="https://www.occ.gov/static/enforcement-actions/eaAA-ENF-2024-44.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Order Terminating the Formal Agreement</a>&nbsp;with Commonwealth National Bank,</span>&nbsp;Mobile, Alabama, dated January 31, 2022 (Docket No.&nbsp;<a href="https://occ.gov/static/enforcement-actions/ea2022-001.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">AA-ENF-2021-50</a>), for unsafe or unsound practices, including those relating to strategic planning, loan portfolio management, and internal audit. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2024-44)</li>

<title>Concurring Statement Of CFTC Commissioner Summer K. Mersinger Regarding Settlement With Trafigura Trading LLC</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> enforcement action, Regulation 165.19(b), whistleblower program, NDAs, CFTC<br />
The Commissioner criticizes the CFTC's enforcement action against Trafigura for overextending the interpretation of Regulation 165.19(b). The regulation lacks clear notice and imposes unrealistic expectations.<br /><br />Summary: The Commissioner criticizes the CFTC's enforcement action against Trafigura for overextending the interpretation of Regulation 165.19(b. The regulation lacks clear notice and imposes unrealistic expectations. <div>
<p>I respectfully concur on the Commission&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement061724?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt1" id="fntref1" name="fntref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;enforcement action settling charges against Trafigura Trading LLC (&ldquo;Trafigura&rdquo;). But I cannot fully support it because once again, we are falling victim to regulating by enforcement, this time through a first-of-its-kind-charge under Regulation 165.19(b) of the Commission&rsquo;s Whistleblower Rules. While I am a strong proponent of our whistleblower program, the Commission&rsquo;s decision to bring this specific charge is inconsistent with the regulation&rsquo;s text and prior Commission statements regarding the regulation&rsquo;s intent.</p>
<p><strong>Silence is Golden&hellip;And Now Illegal</strong></p>
<p>Seven years after the Commission adopted Regulation 165.19(b), today&rsquo;s settlement embraces a new interpretation, empowering the Commission to line-item edit non-disclosure agreements (&ldquo;NDAs&rdquo;).</p>
<p>The Commission&rsquo;s Order finds Trafigura violated Regulation 165.19(b) by requiring employees to sign agreements that contained broad non-disclosure provisions that prohibited sharing Trafigura&rsquo;s confidential information with third parties. The Commission is taking issue with the agreement&rsquo;s lack of &ldquo;carve-out language that would have expressly permitted sharing information with the Commission or law enforcement.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement061724?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt2" id="fntref2" name="fntref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;And it is the lack of these very specific words &ndash; words that the Commission has never required before or even identified previously &ndash; that underpins this violation.</p>
<p>Not only am I concerned that the Commission is taking this position as to words not included in an NDA without any previous public notice or communication, I also question the Commission&rsquo;s interpretation of the regulation. Specifically, I disagree with the Commission: (1) ignoring the regulatory definition of the word &ldquo;action&rdquo; that is used in Regulation 165.19(b) as well as the common understanding of the meaning of that word; (2) failing to point to an affirmative duty to include carveout language; and (3) disregarding statements in the proposed rulemaking release issued by the Commission when it adopted Regulation 165.19(b).</p>
<p><strong>Defining Inaction as Action</strong></p>
<p>Section 23 of the Commodity Exchange Act (&ldquo;CEA&rdquo;)<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement061724?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt3" id="fntref3" name="fntref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;authorizes the CFTC to establish a comprehensive whistleblower program and to protect certain parties who provide information to the Commission or who assist in an investigation or an administrative or judicial action related to such information. As relevant here, the statute prohibits waiver of a whistleblower&rsquo;s rights and remedies.</p>
<p>Regulation 165.19(b) is part of the Commission&rsquo;s implementation of the CEA&rsquo;s whistleblower provisions, and states: &ldquo;No person may take any&nbsp;<em>action</em>&nbsp;to impede an individual from communicating directly with the Commission&rsquo;s staff about a possible violation of the Commodity Exchange Act, including by enforcing, or threatening to enforce, a confidentiality agreement or predispute arbitration agreement with respect to such communications.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement061724?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt4" id="fntref4" name="fntref4">[4]</a></p>
<p>A foundational defect in the finding that Trafigura violated this regulation is the failure to identify an &ldquo;action&rdquo; satisfying the definition of that word in Regulation 165.2, which applies to all the Whistleblower Rules. As defined in Regulation 165.2, &ldquo;action&rdquo; &ldquo;generally means a single captioned judicial or administrative proceeding.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement061724?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt5" id="fntref5" name="fntref5">[5]</a></p>
<p>Applying the definition of the word &ldquo;action&rdquo; as defined in Regulation 165.2 to the use of the word in Regulation 165.19(b) limits the scope of the prohibition in the latter to enforcement through a judicial or administrative proceeding. This construction is consistent with the clause at the end of Regulation 165.19(b) that speaks to &ldquo;enforcing, or threatening to enforce,&rdquo; a confidentiality agreement.</p>
<p>Even if the use of the word &ldquo;generally&rdquo; in the definition of an &ldquo;action&rdquo; in Regulation 165.2 loosens the definition&rsquo;s construction somewhat, it still cannot support the Commission&rsquo;s finding in the settlement Order that an employment agreement, in and of itself, can rise to the level of an &ldquo;action&rdquo; that impedes an individual from communicating directly with the Commission&rsquo;s staff. Simply put, an agreement is not an &ldquo;action&rdquo; as that word is commonly understood.</p>
<p>This understanding is confirmed by the clause in Regulation 165.19(b) providing that an &ldquo;action&rdquo; to impede, includes &ldquo;enforcing, or attempting to enforce,&rdquo; a confidentiality agreement. If the agreement itself can be an &ldquo;action&rdquo; to impede, then there would have been no need for Regulation 165.19(b) to provide that the &ldquo;action&rdquo; of enforcing, or threatening to enforce, such an agreement is a violation &ndash; because the Regulation would already have been violated by the agreement itself.</p>
<p>The settlement Order does not contain any suggestion that Trafigura enforced, or threatened to enforce, a confidentiality agreement during the course of our staff&rsquo;s investigation of this matter. Accordingly, I cannot agree that Trafigura &ldquo;acted&rdquo; to impede its employees from communicating with our staff in violation of Regulation 165.19(b).</p>
<p><strong>We Can Learn from the Past, But We Cannot Change It</strong></p>
<p>The conclusory discussion of this issue in the settlement Order ignores the simple fact that Regulation 165.19(b) contains no requirement for a company&rsquo;s NDA to affirmatively inform employees that they may make voluntary disclosures to the Commission. Nor is such a duty ever meaningfully discussed in the rulemaking record in the&nbsp;<em>Federal Register</em>&nbsp;regarding the Commission&rsquo;s adoption of Regulation 165.19(b).</p>
<p>Indeed, the rulemaking record not only fails to support an affirmative obligation for NDA carveout language &ndash; it actually undercuts the finding of the settlement Order that Trafigura violated Regulation 165.19(b). While the CFTC&rsquo;s Whistleblower Rules were originally adopted in 2011, it was a rulemaking in 2017 that amended the Whistleblower Rules to add the provision in Regulation 165.19(b) that is at issue. The Commission&rsquo;s proposing release for those amendments specifically stated that Regulation 165.19(b) was added &ldquo;to prohibit the&nbsp;<em>enforcement of</em>&nbsp;confidentiality and pre-dispute arbitration clauses respecting actions by potential whistleblowers in any pre-employment, employment or post-employment agreements.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement061724?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt6" id="fntref6" name="fntref6">[6]</a></p>
<p>The Commission&rsquo;s approach to this issue will have far-reaching implications, affecting every company that requires its employees to sign NDAs similar to those used by Trafigura. Any of these companies that has participated in a market regulated by the CFTC is now at risk of a &ldquo;knock on the door&rdquo; from the CFTC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement seeking to impose a civil monetary penalty for failing to fulfill an obligation that the Commission has neither provided any notice of nor expressly imposed.</p>
<p><strong>Unspoken Expectations = Unrealistic Expectations</strong></p>
<p>If the Commission wants to implement a policy that an NDA can constitute an &ldquo;action&rdquo; that impedes employees from communicating with CFTC staff, and that companies using such agreements have an affirmative duty to inform employees that they may make voluntary disclosures to the Commission, it should do so by amending its rule.</p>
<p>But at a minimum, if that is how the Commission intends to interpret Regulation 165.19(b), it should provide notice of that interpretation to the marketplace. For the past seven years, neither the Commission nor its staff has issued any advisory, guidance, frequently asked questions (&ldquo;FAQs&rdquo;), or any other statement informing the public of how it interprets Regulation 165.19(b).<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement061724?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt7" id="fntref7" name="fntref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;By failing to do so, and instead enforcing Regulation 165.19(b) beyond its textual bounds, the Commission engages in a textbook case of &ldquo;regulation by enforcement,&rdquo; which I have repeatedly opposed.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement061724?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt8" id="fntref8" name="fntref8">[8]</a></p>

<p id="fnt7" name="fnt7"><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement061724?utm_source=govdelivery#fntref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;I recognize that: (1) the Securities and Exchange Commission (&ldquo;SEC&rdquo;) in recent years has settled charges under a similar theory based on similar rules, with differing gradations of facts; and (2) the CFTC&rsquo;s proposing release for Regulation 165.19(b) included a footnote acknowledging &ldquo;awareness of&rdquo; the SEC&rsquo;s 2015&nbsp;<em>KBR, Inc</em>&nbsp;settlement, which was consistent with the finding of the settlement Order before us. However, the mere mention of this SEC matter does not negate the fact that the Commission&rsquo;s 165.19(b) rulemaking record expressly stated the purpose was &ldquo;to prohibit the&nbsp;<em>enforcement of</em>&nbsp;confidentiality&rdquo; provisions. This plain language undermines the Order&rsquo;s conclusion that an unenforced NDA provision, in and of itself, can establish a violation. Moreover, SEC settlements under its similarly worded rule do not constitute fair notice to participants in CFTC-regulated markets. Trafigura illustrates this point nicely. It is a global commodities dealer, not an issuer of securities, and its participation in SEC-regulated equities markets is unknown. As a result, it cannot be assumed that it (and other companies in a similar situation) devote significant resources to monitoring settled enforcement actions of the SEC &ndash; let alone considering what such actions might foreshadow about how the CFTC will interpret its separate rule set.</p>

<div> violations, Trafigura Trading LLC, CEA, manipulative conduct, whistleblowers
Summary:
Trafigura Trading LLC charged with CEA violations including manipulation of benchmark rates, interfering with whistleblower communications, and misappropriation of material nonpublic information. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today issued an order simultaneously filing and settling charges against&nbsp;Trafigura Trading LLC, a global commodities merchant with its principal place of business in Houston, Texas, for multiple violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and associated CFTC regulations. The order requires Trafigura to pay a $55 million civil monetary penalty and implement certain remedial measures to ensure future compliance with the CEA.</p>
<p>The order includes three violations: &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Between 2014 and 2019, Trafigura traded gasoline while in knowing possession of material nonpublic information it knew or should have known had been misappropriated from a Mexican trading entity (MTE).</li>
<li>In February 2017, Trafigura manipulated a fuel oil benchmark to benefit its futures and swaps positions, including derivatives traded on United States registered entities.</li>
<li>Between 2017 and 2020, Trafigura required current employees and former employees to sign employment and/or separation agreements containing non-disclosure provisions prohibiting them from disclosing company information, with no exception for law enforcement agencies or regulators, which illegally impeded individuals from voluntarily communicating with Division of Enforcement (DOE) staff during the investigation.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As reflected in today&rsquo;s Order, Trafigura misappropriated material non-public information and engaged in manipulative conduct that affected published benchmark rates,&rdquo; said Director of Enforcement Ian McGinley.&nbsp; &ldquo;This enforcement action is yet another example of the CFTC&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring the derivatives markets remain free from trading abuses that undermine their integrity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Director of the Whistleblower Office Brian Young commented, &ldquo;This is the first CFTC action charging a company for interfering with whistleblower communications. This groundbreaking action demonstrates the CFTC&rsquo;s commitment to protecting potential whistleblowers and puts the market on notice that the CFTC will not tolerate attempts to silence potential witnesses.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Case Background</p>
<p><i>Misappropriation of Material Nonpublic Information</i></p>
<p>The order finds that between&nbsp;2014 and April 2019, directly and through intermediaries, Trafigura improperly obtained nonpublic information material to the gasoline market from an MTE employee in breach of the employer&rsquo;s rules.&nbsp;Among other things, Trafigura received MTE&rsquo;s pricing formulas used to sell its physical gasoline to another trading entity in Mexico, as well as the MTE&rsquo;s monthly import &ldquo;program,&rdquo; meaning the volumes, types, and destination ports for gasoline the MTE planned to import in the next month. Trafigura also sometimes received competitor pricing information in the context of bilateral negotiations. The MTE considered this information confidential and material to its own business, while the information was material to Trafigura&rsquo;s trading and business decisions, such as its negotiation and pricing strategies for gasoline products. Trafigura traders in Houston, Texas entered into physical and derivative gasoline transactions while knowing this confidential information.</p>
<p><i>Manipulative Conduct</i></p>
<p>The order further finds that Trafigura manipulated the benchmark price of U.S. Gulf Coast high-sulfur fuel oil throughout the month of February 2017. From approximately January to March 2017, Trafigura developed and deployed a large fuel oil export program designed to export fuel oil from the U.S. Gulf Coast to Singapore in order to profit from an observed open arbitrage for fuel oil. In connection with its arbitrage strategy, Trafigura established a long derivative position in U.S. Gulf Coast high-sulfur fuel oil, in part as an economic hedge for its anticipated purchases of physical fuel oil to export to Singapore. However, the long derivative position Trafigura entered was in excess of its short physical position that resulted from its intent to buy fuel oil in the U.S. Gulf Coast for arbitrage&mdash;the excess essentially constituting a long speculative bet on fuel oil prices in February 2017.</p>
<p>Beginning on February&nbsp;1, 2017, and continuing through the end of the month, Trafigura bid heavily for and bought cargoes of fuel oil in the benchmark&rsquo;s trading window, in an amount much larger than it had ever previously purchased in the window in a single month. Trafigura&rsquo;s heavy bidding and buying activity in that short period tended to increase prices paid in the window, and ultimately created artificially high benchmark values, which benefited Trafigura&rsquo;s long derivatives position. This impact on the fuel oil benchmark was to the detriment of market participants who looked to rely on the benchmark as a fair price reference.</p>
<p><i>Impeding Voluntary Communications with the CFTC</i></p>
<p>Finally, the order finds that between July 31, 2017 and 2020, Trafigura required its employees to sign employment agreements, and its former employees to sign separation agreements, with broad non-disclosure provisions that prohibited the sharing of Trafigura&rsquo;s confidential information with third parties. These non-disclosure provisions did not contain carve-out language expressly permitting communications with law enforcement or regulators such as the CFTC. The provisions caused confusion that resulted in an impediment to voluntary and direct communications with the CFTC about possible violations of the CEA and CFTC regulations in violation of the CEA&rsquo;s prohibitions against impeding direct communications with the CFTC.</p>
<p>The order finds that Trafigura&rsquo;s conduct defrauded its counterparties, harmed other market participants, and undermined the integrity of U.S. and global oil markets. This case is brought in coordination with the DOE&rsquo;s Corruption Task Force and Insider Trading Task Force.</p>
<p>&nbsp;* * * * * *</p>
<p>The CFTC thanks the Comisi&oacute;n Nacional Bancaria y de Valores of Mexico and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority for their assistance in this matter.</p>
<p>The DOE staff responsible for this matter are Doug Snodgrass, Matthew S. Edelstein, Patrick Marquardt, Joe Patrick, Ben Sedrish, Allison V. Passman, Scott Williamson, and Robert Howell.</p>
<p>Additional DOE staff who provided assistance are Gates S. Hurand and former staff Elise Kent Bernanke and Ilana Waxman. &nbsp;</p>
<p>* * * * * * *</p>
<p>CFTC&rsquo;s Foreign Corrupt Practices Advisory</p>
<p>The DOE issued an advisory on March 6, 2019 [See CFTC Press Release No.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/7884-19">7884-19</a>] on self-reporting and cooperation for CEA violations involving foreign corrupt practices. As set forth in the advisory, where a company or individual not registered or required to be registered with the CFTC voluntarily discloses violations of the CEA involving foreign corrupt practices, provides full cooperation and appropriately remediates, DOE will apply a presumption that it will not recommend the CFTC impose a civil monetary penalty in resolution of an action, absent aggravating circumstances.</p>
<p>Customers and other individuals can report suspicious activities or information, such as possible violations of commodity trading laws, to the Division of Enforcement via a toll-free hotline 866-FON-CFTC (866-366-2382),&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cftc.gov/ConsumerProtection/FileaTiporComplaint/index.htm">file a tip or complaint</a>&nbsp;online, or contact the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.whistleblower.gov/">Whistleblower Office</a>. Whistleblowers may be eligible to receive between 10 and 30 percent of the monetary sanctions collected paid from the CFTC Customer Protection Fund, which is financed through monetary sanctions paid to the CFTC by violators of the CEA.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<title>SEC’s New Public Service Campaign Emphasizes Investor Protection</title>

<div> campaign, investor protection, Investor.gov, SEC, knowledge-sharing<br />
Summary:<br />
SEC launches "Is This Right?" campaign on Investor.gov, featuring TV spots emphasizing fraud protection, investing knowledge-sharing, and resources for informed investors. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy (OIEA) today unveiled its new public service campaign, which highlights investor protection and encourages investors to explore the free tools and resources on Investor.gov.</p>
<p>The campaign, &ldquo;Is This Right?&rdquo; takes a multi-generational knowledge-sharing approach to educating investors. It features two TV spots and resources pages in both&nbsp;<a href="http://www.investor.gov/neverstoplearning">English</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.investor.gov/nuncadejedeaprender">Spanish</a>&nbsp;focusing on fraud protection, including the importance of investors monitoring their investment accounts, conducting a background check on investment professionals, and avoiding unsolicited investment pitches that could be scams.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Informed investors are better investors,&rdquo; said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. &ldquo;With this public campaign, Americans can learn more about how to meet their financial goals and invest for a strong financial future. I encourage everyone to take advantage of our resources on Investor.gov.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This year&rsquo;s public service campaign shows that although different generations may have various kinds of knowledge when it comes to investing and recognizing scams, they can each learn from one another,&rdquo; said Lori Schock, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy. &ldquo;Sharing knowledge and having a conversation with your family members can make talking about finances more comfortable and can also encourage younger members to become interested in saving and investing at an early age."</p>
<p>Nearly 70 million new users have accessed&nbsp;Investor.gov&nbsp;since it launched in October 2009, and thousands of investors test their investing knowledge by taking a new quiz published each month. This month&rsquo;s quiz, available at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investor.gov/additional-resources/spotlight/investing-quizzes">Investor.gov/quiz</a>, highlights messaging from the new campaign focused on investor protection.</p>
<p><span>TV Spots</span></p>
<p><span>Mother/Husband/Daughter/Granddaughter&nbsp;</span>[<a href="https://youtu.be/PKoWrjuc3Fs">English</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/tSh3KuwoRN0">Spanish</a>] ‒ Highlights the importance of being suspicious of unsolicited investment pitches, making sure you&rsquo;re dealing with a registered investment professional, and monitoring your investment accounts.</p>
<p>A mother, her daughter and teenage granddaughter sit at a kitchen island looking at their personal devices, with the mother&rsquo;s husband nearby. The mother shows her daughter an email about an influencer pitching a &ldquo;once in a lifetime&rdquo; investment and asks, &ldquo;Does this look right?&rdquo; The daughter says it seems suspicious and that she should check Investor.gov to see if they are registered. As the daughter checks her retirement statement, she notices a &ldquo;weird fee&rdquo; and asks her mother, &ldquo;Does this look right?&rdquo; The mother is glad her daughter is monitoring her accounts and says she should call and check it out. The spot also gives the teenager an introduction into discussing these kinds of important investing topics.</p>
<p><span>Father/Son/Aunt</span>&nbsp;[<a href="https://youtu.be/hNcl85ukNeg">English</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/pscG7CblArk">Spanish</a>] ‒ Stresses the importance of conducting a background check on an investment professional and spotting and avoiding scams.</p>
<p>A son is on his cell phone holding an infant and his father is on a laptop sitting in a living room. The son sees a message on his phone from an &ldquo;investment guy&rdquo; who&rsquo;s promising 15 percent return with zero risk. He asks his father, &ldquo;Does this seem right?&rdquo; The father tells him it sounds too good to be true, to ignore the message, and to conduct a background check on anyone offering zero risk. The father sees a random message from his investment firm asking him to wire money, and asks his son, &ldquo;Does this seem right?&rdquo; The son responds by saying they wouldn&rsquo;t do that and tells his father it sounds like a scam. An aunt is sitting nearby witnessing the exchange.</p>
<p>Both TV spots end with a bit of humor and the message: &ldquo;No matter your age, we can all learn something about investing. Explore our resources at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.investor.gov/neverstoplearning">Investor.gov/NeverStopLearning</a>.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Cboe Global Markets To Launch New U.S. Treasury Market Volatility Index (VIXTLT)</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cboe-global-markets-to-launch-new-us-treasury-market-volatility-index-vixtlt/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul type="disc">
<li>VIXTLT Index leverages Cboe's proprietary VIX&reg; Index methodology, applied to highly liquid, listed options on the iShares&reg; 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT)</li>
<li>Designed to provide a VIX Index-like measure for U.S. Treasury market volatility</li>
<li>VIXTLT Index available in both percentage price volatility and basis point volatility terms</li>
<li>New index complements Credit VIX Indices as Cboe expands its fixed income volatility index suite</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cboe Global Markets, Inc. (Cboe: CBOE), the world's leading derivatives and securities exchange network, today announced plans to launch the Cboe 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF Volatility Basis Point Index ("VIXTLT Index"). Using an adaptation of Cboe's proprietary VIX&reg; Index methodology, the VIXTLT Index will be calculated using listed options on the iShares&reg; 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) and provide market participants with the ability to track future (30-day) expected volatility in the U.S. Treasury market, the deepest and most liquid government securities market in the world. The VIXTLT Index is expected to launch in the third quarter of 2024.</p>
<p>Developed by Cboe Labs, the company's product innovation hub, and benchmark administered by Cboe Global Indices, the VIXTLT Index leverages the combined strengths of Cboe's derivatives and data businesses. The new index expands Cboe's growing volatility index suite and adds to Cboe's current offering of more than&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4192417-1&amp;h=4061598917&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cboe.com%2Fus%2Findices%2Findicesproducts%2F&amp;a=450+derivatives-based+indices" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">450 derivatives-based indices</a>, covering a range of strategy benchmarks and asset classes.</p>
<p>TLT is a transparent and highly liquid exchange-traded fund (ETF) composed of U.S. Treasury bonds with remaining maturities exceeding twenty years that have a relatively high duration. Highly liquid options on TLT with a wide range of strikes help convey information about how investors potentially view the future of U.S. interest rates, which is in turn distilled by the VIXTLT Index methodology down to one number designed to represent a consensus view on expected U.S. Treasury volatility.</p>
<p>Similar to how the Cboe Volatility Index&reg; (VIX&reg;) measures 30-day expected volatility of the U.S. equity market, the VIXTLT Index is designed to offer a comparable gauge for the U.S. Treasury market. Monitoring the VIXTLT and VIX indices together may afford investors a broad view of perceived uncertainty in two important asset classes that have historically experienced periods of co-movement as well as significant divergence.</p>
<p>"For more than 30 years investors across the globe have used the VIX Index as a benchmark to help gauge U.S. equity market volatility, and today Cboe is proud to further expand its volatility suite to include a U.S. Treasury market measure," said Rob Hocking, Senior Vice President and Head of Product Innovation at Cboe. "Cboe offers a comprehensive ecosystem of services, touching every aspect of the customer experience &ndash; from market access and data, to tradable products and beyond. By combining our derivatives expertise with leading indexing capabilities, we are able to identify gaps in our product offering and utilize our robust technology, data and customer feedback to continuously drive product development that meet customers' needs."</p>
<p>To reflect prevailing bond market pricing convention, VIXTLT will be available in basis point volatility terms. Basis point volatility is a key concept in fixed income markets where risk is more commonly perceived as the absolute&mdash;not percentage&mdash;change in yield or spread, multiplied by the price value of a basis point. Potential drivers of the VIXTLT Index may include unexpected shifts in monetary policy by the Federal Reserve, surprises in macroeconomic indicators, technical supply and demand shocks, adverse risk events or behavioral factors triggering sudden shifts in investor risk aversion.</p>

<p><span><span>For instance, deals volume for North America, Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa and South and Central America regions recorded YoY decline of 32.3%, 8.2%, 25% and 40%, respectively, during the review period. However, Europe emerged as an exception and showcased a YoY growth of 13.4% in deals volume during January-May 2024.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Meanwhile, several key global markets including the US, China and Australia saw respective deals volume declining by 30.4%, 52.2% and 15.4% during January-May 2024 compared to during January-May 2023. However, some markets such as the UK, India, South Korea and Germany managed to see some improvement in deal activity.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Bose concludes: &ldquo;Despite the overall decline in deal activity in the travel and tourism sector, the improvement in markets like Europe, the UK, India, South Korea, and Germany demonstrate the sector&rsquo;s adaptability and potential for strategic investments. Investors should seize these emerging opportunities to navigate the evolving landscape and drive future growth.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note: Historic data may change in case some deals get added to previous months because of a delay in disclosure of information in the public domain.</span></span></p>

<li>CEDX recently expanded its range of equity options and now offers contracts on over 300 European companies</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cboe Europe Derivatives (CEDX), Cboe's pan-European equity derivatives marketplace, today announces that IMC has become a new direct trading participant, gaining access to the exchange's range of pan-European index derivatives and equity options.</p>
<p>Iouri Saroukhanov, Head of European Derivatives at Cboe Europe, said: "We are thrilled to welcome IMC to CEDX and further diversify the types of liquidity the exchange is offering to its institutional and retail participants. The support of a firm of IMC's calibre demonstrates the broad appeal of CEDX, which is lowering barriers to entry for European derivatives through its pan-European model and promotion of deep and liquid on-screen markets. We look forward to IMC's active participation across our range of equity derivatives and supporting us on our journey to create a larger and more efficient European derivatives market."</p>
<p>IMC is a leading global market maker that trades in all major asset classes on more than 100 trading venues around the world. Founded in 1989, it was one of the first trading houses to recognise the importance of technology in the fast-evolving financial markets environment and today is known worldwide for its advanced, low-latency technology and world-class execution capabilities. With offices in Europe, the United States, and Asia-Pacific, its core business is to provide essential liquidity in financial instruments, helping to make markets more efficient and add value to all market participants.</p>

<p>CEDX launched in September 2021, initially offering trading in futures and options based on key Cboe Europe single country and pan-European indices, with clearing provided by Cboe Clear Europe N.V. The exchange is designed to promote on-screen liquidity and offers a single access point to pan-European equity derivatives products, creating significant operational and capital efficiencies for participants.</p>
<p>CEDX expanded into equity options in November 2023, and broadened its universe of these products during Q1 2024. It now offers more than 300 options on companies from 14 countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom).

<div> Federal Reserve, Interest Rates, IMF, Inflation, Stock Exchanges <br />
<br />Summary: The Federal Reserve plans to maintain higher interest rates due to slow inflation. The FTSE Mondo Visione Index increased by 1.3% in May. Bursa Malaysia was the top performer. The Multi Commodity Exchange of India experienced the steepest decline. The FTSE Mondo Visione Exchanges Index compares the performance of 33 publicly listed exchanges and trading floors, offering a reliable barometer of the health and performance of the exchange sector. <div>
<p>The U.S. Federal Reserve is poised to maintain higher interest rates for an extended period, as the International Monetary Fund predicts that elevated inflation will decline more slowly than expected.</p>
<p>The FTSE Mondo Visione Index closed May at 71,725.78 points, marking a 1.3% increase from its April close of 70,798.13 points.</p>
<p>The top 5 exchanges by market capitalisation at the end of May were:</p>

<title>Innovation In The Financial System, Federal Reserve Governor Michelle W. Bowman, At The Salzburg Global Seminar On Financial Technology Innovation, Social Impact, And Regulation: Do We Need New Paradigms?, Salzburg, Austria</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It is a pleasure to be back in Salzburg again for the next chapter in the Global Seminar, focusing on financial technology innovations and the developing financial regulatory framework.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240617a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;At this same gathering last year, we discussed the potential evolution of the bank regulatory framework in response to the banking stress during the spring of 2023. At that time, we were taking stock of the regulatory reforms implemented after the 2008 financial crisis and evaluating whether those reforms&mdash;and the resulting bank regulatory and supervisory framework we have now&mdash;were effective and efficient, and whether improvements may be appropriate. Of course, many of those conversations are ongoing in the United States, with proposals&mdash;in varying levels of formality&mdash;under discussion, including new and expanded long-term debt requirements for non-global systemically important banks (G-SIBs), new liquidity requirements, and a host of other supervisory and regulatory reforms. These are in addition to other regulatory reform matters, including Basel III capital reforms and changes to the G-SIB surcharge framework, that are not directly related to the 2023 banking stress.</p>
<p>Policy reforms in the United States, at times and to varying degrees, have arguably suffered from a lack of appropriate prioritization and focus.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240617a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;This trend has been evident recently, when one considers the sheer volume of reforms that have recently been completed, that have been proposed, or that are in the pipeline. Often shortchanged in the rush to implement reforms are considerations of effectiveness and efficiency&mdash;effectiveness in addressing identified shortcomings, and efficiency in providing solutions that address these shortcomings without imposing unnecessary costs or compliance burdens or resulting in unintended consequences.</p>
<p>While much of the reform agenda in the United States has been focused on the response to the 2023 banking stress, in my view, we also need to consider whether we have an appropriate bank regulatory and supervisory framework when it comes to innovation. So, today I would like to discuss how we can create a regulatory environment that fosters successful innovation. I will focus my remarks on the United States, specifically innovation within the "regulatory perimeter" in which regulated institutions&mdash;banks, holding companies, and their affiliates&mdash;operate. However, I think this approach has broader relevance for how regulation can more effectively support and promote innovation, including internationally.</p>
<p>The implications of our regulatory approach go beyond just the banking system. A reflexive "no" from regulators can encourage activity to migrate out of the banking system. The result could be decreased transparency, lower regulatory standards, and increased risks to financial stability. We tend to think that the "stakes" are confined to a particular technology or innovation, but this is a misleading approach. Instead, we should adopt a broader approach that considers financial system stability. To implement a successful "same activity, same risk, same regulation" approach requires either broad-based legislation to coordinate these standards or an effective interagency approach that incorporates regulators beyond traditional banking regulators.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits of Innovation</strong><br />In my experience, regulators love innovation&mdash;in the abstract. The idea of innovation is an alluring one. Among other things, innovation can help develop a faster and more efficient banking and payments system, it can lower the cost and expand the availability of products and services to consumers and businesses, it can improve the speed and reduce counterparty risk of securities transactions, and it can promote market competition.</p>
<p>And we see evidence all around in the banking system where innovation has had transformative effects: we have automated teller machines (ATMs) that allow ready access to cash and basic account services, we have the ability to make electronic payments at merchants both in-person and online, and almost every bank customer can access their bank account or transfer money to a friend by using only their mobile phone. When innovation becomes commonplace, and with the passage of time, we lose sight of the long and sometimes tortured road these innovators traveled to introduce and embed them into customer expectations for banking services.</p>
<p>I see a common theme between innovation as an abstract idea and "established" innovation that has become the new norm in the financial landscape&mdash;namely, that neither of these versions force us to confront the risks of the unknown. The abstract version does not force us to confront its practical implications, including: How does it work? What benefits could it bring? What risks does it present, and how will those risks be managed? Similarly, by the point at which the innovation becomes widely adopted and accepted, hopefully we have done the difficult work. We have come to understand the challenges it presents and have accepted the tradeoffs between the benefits, and the associated risks and costs, of allowing the new technology or process improvement to be introduced into the banking system.</p>
<p>When we think about the abstract, or look back on successful innovation, we lose sight of the unique path forged to ensure its success. Many of the technologies that we will discuss during this conference have the potential to bring benefits, including greater efficiency to banking and payments. So how do we create an environment that allows innovation to flourish and in which regulated banking institutions are able to play a role? In the past I have spoken about three principles that I believe are necessary building blocks to fostering innovation: developing an understanding of the technology, having an open approach to innovation, and making innovation a priority in the development of regulatory frameworks.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240617a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;I would like to revisit these principles today.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding Innovation</strong><br />As a threshold matter, regulators and innovators share some responsibilities when it comes to innovation. Regulators must work hard to understand the functionality of new innovation, including the benefits innovation can bring and its accompanying risks. Regulators must not fall into the trap of complacency. Comfort with the known and familiar risks of how things have always been done can present a barrier. Regulators must be willing to thoughtfully consider the possibilities of innovation within the regulated banking system.</p>
<p>At the same time, innovators must be committed to sharing their understanding and knowledge of innovation with regulators. But in doing so, innovators must not adopt the "sales" mentality that they may use when pitching investors or partners, and instead, acknowledge the unknowns&mdash;the risks that new technology presents, the various ways that the technology could be used or evolve over time, and how the technology could either complement or disrupt the current financial system. Going a step further, they may be best positioned to propose how regulators can best develop a regulatory framework to manage these risks.</p>
<p>This deeper level of understanding may assist regulators in their responsibility to consider how innovation could impact different financial sectors, from small banks to wholesale financial markets, and how those impacts may ultimately affect end users. Of course, regulators must also consider not only the intended objectives of innovation, but they must also anticipate and understand the unintended consequences.</p>
<p>Within the broad category of "understanding" innovation, I see three critical steps that regulators must take: understand the technology and landscape, recognize the use case for the technology, and anticipate the consequences. Each of these is a necessary ingredient for accepting the technology and developing a regulatory framework that effectively fosters innovation.</p>
<p><em>Understanding technology and the landscape</em><br />At its most basic level, many innovations involve a technological component and are situated in a landscape of different parties who may play a role in the use of the technology.</p>
<p>Take for example, distributed ledger technology (DLT), including blockchain, which is the backbone of some innovations that are being explored in the financial system. DLT highlights the challenges presented to regulators in understanding innovation. There are many variations in the application of DLT&mdash;with ongoing research and development creating more variability over time&mdash;which ultimately may complicate understanding how the technology can be used and how different functionality can be incorporated into DLT solutions for different use cases. DLT provides a way for parties to record transfers of digital assets without the need for any centralized authority and relies on multiple participants who coordinate to maintain a synchronized version of the "ledger." DLT combines a number of different design elements&mdash;like distributed data storage, cryptography, and consensus mechanisms&mdash;that support the transfer process, information visibility, and transaction recordkeeping. These design elements can be combined in a number of different ways, and different parties may play a role in its ultimate use.</p>
<p>Understanding technology is an important first step, but regulators also need to be confident in the players who operate in a particular innovative space. Banks of all sizes have a long history of innovation. And the many nonbank providers in this space, including core service providers, often hold the "keys" to innovation when they facilitate the add-on of new technology to core systems. There are also fintechs that may focus on even more transformational uses of technology, in ways that can affect all aspects of banking. Many of the parties involved in financial innovation describe themselves as financial system "disruptors." This may be an apt word to describe some of their ambitions, but it is certainly one that proves the need for a deliberate and cautious approach to regulation. The broad range of participants involved in this space presents another layer of complication. It is especially important for regulators to be able to distill the reality from the prototype hype to achieve a comprehensive understanding necessary to inform a policy viewpoint and ultimately an effective regulatory framework.</p>
<p><em>Understanding the use case</em><br />Apart from understanding the technology, and who may use it, regulators also need to clearly understand the use case&mdash;what existing problem does this technology solve? What are the costs and benefits, and are there tradeoffs policymakers would need to consider if the new technology were introduced or integrated in the existing financial system? DLT has inspired new ways of thinking about the exchange of assets and data, in addition to the role of intermediaries and trusted third parties. And of course, as will be discussed during this conference, artificial intelligence, or "AI," is increasingly discussed for its transformative potential not only in banking, but also in the broader world economy.</p>
<p>While innovation can take many forms, from the regulatory perspective, it is helpful to understand how innovation fits&mdash;or could fit&mdash;into the existing financial system. Does innovation meet customer demands for cheaper or new and innovative products? Does it operate in the background to reduce both the incidence and cost of fraud? Does it lower the cost of basic banking services or improve financial inclusion? Does it allow banks to do a better job evaluating the creditworthiness of their customers and make safer loans?</p>
<p>The "use case" is important because it helps to define the parameters around any particular innovation. Instead of saying the innovation is AI, or tokenization, or DLT, what is it exactly? How does it work? What technology underpins it, and what constraints would be placed on its use? Does its implementation rely on external participants or third parties to accomplish its use? Who has ultimate control over, and responsibility for, the function of the product or service?</p>
<p><em>Understanding the consequences</em><br />While understanding both the technology behind a new innovation and its use case is important, these steps alone are not sufficient. Regulators must also understand, to the extent possible, the consequences of specific innovations. Take, for example, the increasing interest in tokenization. There is a risk that tokenized products and platforms could duplicate existing bank deposits and payment rails, potentially creating parallel systems. How would these parallel systems interact with, or even replace, current systems? Will the products and platforms that duplicate these deposit and payment functions provide the same legal protections for customers and the overall financial system that they currently receive? In the long run, the goal of financial innovation is to integrate the new technology into the fabric of the financial system. To do so in a responsible way, we need to understand the effects the technology will have, including the risks and consequences of introducing it, and the risks and consequences of its wide adoption in the financial system.</p>
<p>It is not my intent to downplay the difficulty of understanding new developments that could change key activities, technology, products, or processes within the financial system. We are in an era of rapid change, and there are a wide range of innovations that may play an important role in the future of the financial system. But within the regulatory perimeter of the banking system, we need to be cautious about the risks of new technology, not only to the safety and soundness of individual financial institutions, but also to financial stability concerns.</p>
<p><strong>Openness to Innovation</strong><br />Earlier I mentioned the importance of ensuring the regulator understands the new technology. But while education is an important first step, it often runs headlong into regulatory skepticism. Often, a regulator's first reaction to proposed innovation in the banking system is not one of openness and acceptance but rather suspicion and concern. The use of emerging technology and innovation may require a change in policy or supervisory approach. It also very often requires regulatory feedback&mdash;ideally before the innovation is introduced or after it has been integrated by a bank and is reviewed during the supervisory process.</p>
<p>To be sure, skepticism is an understandable first reaction to new activities, particularly those that someone seeks to conduct within the regulatory perimeter after its integration. For regulators, the challenge is one of balance. How do we allow innovation to flourish, with sensible supervision and regulation, so that our financial system can reap the gains of innovation while preserving safety and soundness and consumer compliance?</p>
<p>Regulators need to ask whether we have considered the intended and unintended outcomes of a new innovation, and do the benefits of the new technology outweigh its risks? Would the introduction of a new technology or innovation in the banking system require updating our regulatory framework to incorporate clear oversight? Who should have responsibility for oversight, and what roles do we see for different regulators at both the state and federal level?</p>
<p>Transformational technology requires clear, consistent, and transparent guardrails and expectations to govern the activities that are allowed into the regulated financial system. Where current regulation does not contemplate a new activity, should it be acceptable for financial agencies to regulate the activity through supervision and enforcement alone? Or should congressional action address the treatment of these activities in the financial system?</p>
<p>I think it is vital that regulators work with banks through all stages of the innovation life cycle to achieve that baseline understanding I mentioned before. But it is incumbent on regulators to fight the temptation to say "no" and resist new technology and instead focus on solutions&mdash;how can we mitigate the risk of new technology? What benefits will technology bring to the financial system? How can we provide clear regulatory expectations?</p>
<p>I would suggest that adopting a posture receptive to innovation requires a shift in regulatory approach. The current temptation is to pre-judge financial innovation and to take a harsh view. But this resistance approach carries significant risks. One of the most important risks is that financial innovation stagnates or is pushed out of&mdash;and kept out of&mdash;the banking system. Eliminating innovation could result in significant harm to the stability of the financial system and in terms of limiting the role of banking in the economy. Ultimately, this approach could lead to a banking system that may be safer and smaller but also much less effective in providing banking products and services to support the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>In developing this regulatory "openness," I think it is important to acknowledge the shortcomings of our regulatory posture. This requires looking beyond the most immediate impacts on the banking system and considering the broader effects on the financial system. Hostility to innovation&nbsp;<em>within&nbsp;</em>the banking system often results in activity migrating&nbsp;<em>outside&nbsp;</em>of the banking system. This is not an elimination of the underlying risk of these activities. They remain in the financial system but are often subject to less transparency and less regulation than the same activities conducted by banks. There have been a number of examples in which regulatory approach has driven activity outside the banking industry, thereby creating different and less transparent risks.</p>
<p>Take for example mortgage servicing rights. In May, the U.S. Financial Stability Oversight Council released a report on nonbank mortgage servicing, documenting the growth of nonbank mortgage servicing since 2008, and the potential vulnerabilities that these servicers pose, vulnerabilities that could manifest as shocks to the U.S. financial system. As noted in the materials announcing this report, nonbank mortgage companies had servicing rights on 4 percent of U.S. mortgage balances in 2008; by 2022, this percentage had risen to 54 percent.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240617a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;The rapid shift of such activity out of banks and into nonbank mortgage companies should surprise no one, as this was a predictable result of post-2008 regulatory reforms that made it more costly for these activities to be conducted by banks. But equally unsurprising (in my view) is that this shift did not insulate the U.S. financial system from the risks of these activities. The U.S. mortgage industry in the United States is very large&mdash;shifting which entities are favored to conduct these activities merely transferred the risk to less-regulated entities. The mortgages did not disappear, nor did the underlying activities necessary to support this market.</p>
<p><strong>Innovation as a Priority in the Regulatory and Supervisory Agenda</strong><br />Financial innovation must be a core regulatory priority, in the sense that we must devote regulatory and supervisory resources and attention to building a framework that permits responsible innovation to flourish. Our approach must shift from reactive to active and one that facilitates innovation. Regulators must also promote innovation through transparency and open communication, ideally demonstrating a willingness to engage during the development process and within a restricted environment for experimentation.</p>
<p>Shifting to a more tangible example, in some instances there are policy reasons for regulatory hesitation. In the past, I have spoken about cross-border payments as one area that has historically presented many frictions that, at least in theory, could be improved with new innovations and technology. This challenge involves achieving the goal to serve new types of customers and increase the speed of payments without losing or diluting important compliance safeguards that deter criminal activity. Some perceived payment frictions exist for specific policy reasons, not because of issues with existing technology. Therefore, new technology alone cannot solve a particular issue unless it also incorporates the required safeguards.</p>
<p>The challenge is not just understanding innovative solutions to address cross-border payments, but also understanding how the framework itself could or should adjust in the face of innovation. Regulators can serve a valuable role in identifying where a technology solution may have an important "gap," as in the case of cross-border payments, by identifying how a solution can meet the needs of both customers and regulators. Innovation and regulatory and legal requirements can coexist&mdash;providing both enhanced capability and regulatory compliance. Transparency itself can promote innovation.</p>
<p>Our goal should be to develop&mdash;and continually invest in&mdash;building and supporting a clear and sensible regulatory framework. One that allows the private sector to innovate while also maintaining appropriate safeguards. A clear regulatory framework supports private-sector innovators by providing the clarity and consistency that encourage long-term business investment in pursing innovation, while continuing to support today's products and services. A clear regulatory framework empowers supervisors to focus on safety and soundness, while also ensuring a safe and efficient payment system.</p>
<p>The best way to build a regulatory system that is receptive to new financial technologies and innovations is to build on what has been effective in the past. This includes providing clear guidance to banks and the broader public, incorporating innovation into the regulatory agenda in a comprehensive way, and encouraging interaction between industry and regulators. This industry&ndash;regulator interaction must allow for feedback and information sharing throughout the innovation life cycle and incorporate regulatory feedback on innovation.</p>
<p>There is more that can be done to accomplish this. While we should expand opportunities for regulators to provide clear, actionable, and timely feedback on innovation proposals, we should also consider developing regulatory "sandboxes," those designed to allow some degree of testing and experimentation. We should also ensure our regulatory staff understands and appreciates the value of responsible new technologies, so they may contribute to crafting a sensible regulatory approach to financial innovation. The more that regulators understand innovation, the more comfortable they will be in accepting and promoting its adoption in the financial system.</p>
<p>As part of this framework, we also must consider the broader financial system. The "regulatory perimeter" between regulated banks and other parts of the financial system is a permeable barrier, and not only can activities shift between the two&mdash;as we saw with the migration of mortgage servicing in the United States&mdash;but&nbsp;<em>risk</em>&nbsp;can shift between the two as well. As our financial system has grown and become more complex over time, it has also become much more interconnected. Banks often have direct exposure to activities and risks that occur in other parts of the financial system. Even when they do not have direct exposures, they may have indirect exposures to financial stability risks originating in other parts of the financial system.</p>
<p><strong>Closing Thoughts</strong><br />The most unfortunate approach to innovation would be to simply prohibit it, or to impose such onerous standards that effectively discourage innovation or prevent it from developing and flourishing. This approach would not only decrease the importance and relevance of the banking system, but it could also generate new financial stability risks as activity migrates to areas with lower regulatory standards and less transparency. Broadly speaking, the regulatory framework should be dynamic, one that can and should accommodate new technology and services. Where the same underlying activity presents the same risk, there is a strong case to be made for imposing the same type of regulation. But we must successfully balance the standards that protect households and businesses and prohibit criminal and other illicit financial activity with maintaining the safety and soundness of individual financial institutions and the stability of the broader financial system. We must also prioritize working on a whole-of-government approach to ensure we appropriately monitor and manage the risks of financial activity, no matter where those occur. As we continue to enhance our understanding, my hope is that we can strike a more receptive tone to financial innovation, in a way that enables a more innovative, efficient, and effective financial system for the future.</p>

<div> Founders, AEASP, achievements, mentorship, diversity<br />
Summary: Celebrating 50 years of AEASP, reflecting on lessons learned: humility, agility, outreach, mentorship, and celebrating the program's success.<br /><br /> <div>
<p>I am delighted to celebrate 50 years of the American Economic Association's Summer Program (AEASP) with you this evening.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20240614a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;This is a momentous achievement and an historic moment. Not only is the program's continued success a testament to the dedicated efforts of the various faculty, fellows, and administrators, but it is also a testament to the achievements and efforts of its students and alumni. I am incredibly proud of all of you, the program, and its legacy. As an alumna of the program at Stanford University, I was deeply humbled, honored, grateful, and proud to be named co-director and then director of the AEA Summer Program at Michigan State University (MSU) from 2016 to 2020. I am also honored to be the first woman to have served as director of the program and proud to have worked with such an extraordinary group of instructors, administrators, seminar speakers, graduate students, and partners from all over the country who sacrificed their summers and time throughout the year over five years to execute this program each summer. The leadership team&mdash;Thomas Jeitschko, Christine Moser (from Western Michigan University), Antonio Doblas-Madrid, Mary Wortley, and Kirstin Heard&mdash;were great colleagues and instrumental in implementing the program each year. Finally, I am eternally grateful to the staff and leadership of the American Economic Association, who provided critical infrastructure, funding, and guidance; the National Science Foundation for its investment in training economists and in the future of economics; the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, our consummate host during our visit to Chicago each summer; the Board of Governors and individual Federal Reserve Banks for their support; and Western Michigan University, the co-sponsor of the program with MSU.</p>
<p>I would like to share with you just a few lessons I learned while leading the AEASP at MSU. Although the program's main priority is to teach courses that will encourage and prepare students to pursue further study in economics, I would like to highlight a few other features that I think led to success.</p>
<p>First, two key features of the AEASP team and program at MSU were humility and agility. As many of the former directors here know well, every program is a startup when it moves from one university to another. While we started with a detailed plan for all five years, we did not know how everything would turn out and had to be open to experimentation and innovation.</p>
<p>After the first year, it became obvious that the program needed a systematic advising component. Armed with this intensive training in economics, the students still needed help planning next steps back at their home institutions and for the future. The second year, we instituted a mandatory advising session with a faculty administrator on the last day of the program. The students completed a survey with their educational objectives for the next two to three years, and we commented on them. This became a critical and ongoing souvenir of the program. It has been heartwarming to see program alumni stick to these plans and execute them many years after leaving the AEASP.</p>
<p>During the second year, we also realized how important machine learning was becoming to conducting research and to preparing for graduate study in economics. One August, after the program was over, we enrolled in a machine learning short course, learned more about the power of these tools, and incorporated it into the program the next summer. Humility, agility, and being open to new ideas held us in good stead throughout the program in East Lansing.</p>
<p>Second, outreach and recruiting efforts are very important. My own journey and that of many others are evidence that not everyone comes to the field of economics the same way. In our experience, it was helpful to find novel ways to broaden our reach. In addition to traditional outreach methods, we engaged social media, including going to where economists were&mdash;EconTwitter&mdash;to introduce economics departments and interested students to the new program at MSU, to provide general information, and to give updates on students, program activities, and alumni. There were several memorable social media events: Two live social media sessions on different platforms, the Instagram photo contest, and the "Selfies with Sue" [Dynarski] sessions during our excursion to Detroit and Ann Arbor. Successful execution of a social-media strategy resulted in a more diverse applicant pool by type of educational institution and geographical location.</p>
<p>Third, anyone can be a mentor and influence the trajectory of a student or young scholar interested in economics. Students spontaneously became peer mentors to each other, using time they could have used to do their own problem sets or study for their own exams to mentor a student struggling in a course or grappling with misgivings about the path to a PhD instead. Fellows (TAs) came from all over the country and from a variety of economics programs to support the AEASP students and each other as participants in the dissertation brown bag seminar. Instructors, some of whom came from a plethora of other institutions, like Western Michigan University and Barnard College, gave 110 percent to the program and mentored students inside and beyond the classroom, as well as beyond the program. Finally, it was extraordinary, if not moving, to witness so many economists from many different subfields and from around the country come forward and volunteer to be research mentors for the students, especially during the pandemic. I was grateful for all these important mentoring relationships that were forged, that made a substantial contribution to the program, and that demonstrated that anyone at any stage of their career in economics could be a mentor.</p>
<p>Before concluding, I want to take the opportunity to recognize my classmate at Berkeley, gifted and prolific economic theorist, friend, and mentor, Gary Charness. Gary was a dedicated instructor in the AEASP at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and provided very helpful advice as we got the MSU program up and running. He also embodied the notion that people come to economics in different ways, as I mentioned earlier, having had a full career before undertaking graduate work in economics. He passed away last month; otherwise, given his legendary commitment to the program, I believe he would have been here to celebrate with us.</p>
<p>In closing, as an alumna and former director, I feel great joy witnessing the success of the AEASP students and alumni, with many having enrolled in economics PhD programs and others having pursued master's degrees or taken research jobs, including at the Board of Governors and elsewhere in the Federal Reserve System. AEASP alumni also have received National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowships and other competitive fellowships for graduate study. I hope that current AEASP students and alumni will continue not only their own research efforts but also their connections with each other and with a broader network of mentors and alumni.</p>
<p>Congratulations, again, on a half century of the AEA Summer Program! I am honored to have been a part of this important initiative and wonderful event. I am beyond grateful to Marcus Alexis, James Tobin, Andrew Brimmer, Robert Dorfman, Charles Schultze, George Borts, and all of the other founders and early supporters of the program for their vision and to the National Economic Association and all those who have contributed to advocating for and executing this vision over the years. With great pride for its past achievements, I look forward to seeing the program's legacy embodied in the future endeavors of each of its participants. Best of luck over the next 50 years!</p>

<title>FSB Plenary Meets In Toronto</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Plenary, financial stability, banking sector, non-bank financial intermediation, crypto-asset<br />
Summary:<br />
The FSB Plenary discussed the financial stability outlook, lessons from banking sector turmoil, non-bank financial intermediation, implementation of global regulatory framework for crypto-assets, and nature-related risks. <div>
<p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) Plenary met today in Toronto. The Plenary discussed follow-up work to the lessons learned from the banking sector turmoil and the outlook for global financial stability, as well as the FSB&rsquo;s deliverables to the July G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors meeting.</p>
<h3>Financial stability outlook</h3>
<p>Members discussed recent developments and implications for the financial stability outlook. Although there has been some improvement in the macroeconomic outlook, there are still a number of vulnerabilities in the financial system that require close monitoring. Some asset prices appear to have high valuations, bringing the risk of a sharp correction in the event of a large shock. Members are closely monitoring developments in commercial real estate markets. Market interest rates remain at higher levels than in recent years in a number of jurisdictions. Members noted vulnerabilities and uncertainties in private finance as well as concerns about leverage in non-bank financial institutions. A high-for-long environment could add to debt servicing pressures for borrowers, including more highly indebted companies and households that would need to rollover their financing at higher rates. The challenges arising from the high level of public debt globally and geopolitical uncertainties were also discussed.</p>
<h3>Lessons from the March 2023 banking turmoil</h3>
<p>The FSB&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2023/10/2023-bank-failures-preliminary-lessons-learnt-for-resolution/">review of lessons from the 2023 bank failures</a>, published in October 2023, confirmed the soundness of the international framework provided by the FSB Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes. It also highlighted areas that deserve further attention to ensure effective implementation of the framework.</p>
<p>The Plenary discussed the progress made on the key international work following up on the March 2023 turmoil, including work on public sector backstop funding mechanisms as a last resort; examining interest rate and liquidity risk in the financial system; and exploring vulnerabilities associated with depositor behaviour in light of new technologies and social media.</p>
<p>Members look forward to the completion of this work and will build on this next year by drawing together a holistic view on liquidity risk.</p>
<h3>Non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI)</h3>
<p>The FSB is pursuing a comprehensive work programme to enhance the resilience of non-bank financial intermediation, in coordination with other standard-setting bodies (SSBs). The Plenary discussed progress and next steps for this work.</p>
<p>In 2013, the FSB developed an overall framework to strengthen the oversight and regulation of NBFI, including recommendations with respect to securitisation. The Plenary reviewed the FSB&rsquo;s draft public consultation report on its evaluation of the effects of the G20 financial regulatory reforms on securitisation. The evaluation assesses the extent to which securitisation reforms implemented to date have achieved their financial stability objectives and examines the implications for financing to the real economy. The FSB will launch its public consultation in July and encourages responses.</p>
<p>As part of its NBFI work programme, the FSB is also working on policies to enhance the monitoring of, and to address financial stability risks stemming from, leverage in NBFI, and to enhance the liquidity preparedness of non-bank market participants for margin and collateral calls.</p>
<p>The Plenary also discussed the importance for policy-making of good data quality and availability. Members discussed the value of a data pilot programme to identify and close data gaps for monitoring key open-ended fund vulnerabilities related to liquidity mismatch and discussed how to address other identified data gaps.</p>
<p>The FSB will deliver a report detailing progress on the overall NBFI work programme to the G20 in July.</p>
<h3>Implementation of the FSB&rsquo;s global regulatory framework for crypto-asset activities</h3>
<p>The Plenary welcomed the progress made in implementing the FSB&rsquo;s July 2023&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2023/07/fsb-global-regulatory-framework-for-crypto-asset-activities/">recommendations for addressing financial stability risks relating to crypto-assets</a>. The FSB will continue to closely monitor implementation, not only in FSB member jurisdictions but also in jurisdictions beyond the FSB. Given the particularly acute risk of regulatory arbitrage in the crypto space, broad global implementation is crucial.</p>
<p>Members discussed recent developments in crypto-asset markets and areas that warrant further attention. In emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), crypto-assets pose particular challenges for monetary policy and capital flow management. Members discussed the challenges posed by the relatively higher levels of adoption and risks of global stablecoin arrangements in EMDEs. The FSB will undertake further work to consider how these challenges can be addressed.</p>
<h3>Nature-related risks</h3>
<p>G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors asked the FSB to carry out a stocktake on participating members&rsquo; initiatives concerning financial risks related to nature degradation and biodiversity loss. The Plenary discussed the FSB&rsquo;s draft stocktake on supervisory and regulatory initiatives related to nature-related financial risks. As well as supervisory and regulatory initiatives, the report provides an overview of members&rsquo; analytical work, and members discussed whether and to what extent the degradation of nature and the loss of biodiversity represent a financial risk. The Plenary looks forward to the publication of the report and delivery to the G20 in July.</p>
<h2>Notes to editors</h2>
<p>The FSB published in November 2020 a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2020/11/holistic-review-of-the-march-market-turmoil/">Holistic Review of the March Market Turmoil</a>, which lays out a comprehensive and ambitious work programme for strengthening the resilience of the NBFI sector while preserving its benefits. This work is being carried out within the FSB as well as by its member standard-setting bodies and international organisations, to ensure that relevant experiences and perspectives are brought to bear.</p>
<p>In August 2023, the FSB published a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2023/08/evaluation-on-effects-of-g20-reforms-on-securitisation-summary-terms-of-reference/">Summary Terms of Reference</a>&nbsp;on its evaluation on the effects of G20 reforms on securitisation. The summary terms of reference&nbsp;provide more details on the objectives, scope and process for this evaluation.</p>
<p>The FSB launched a public consultation on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/04/liquidity-preparedness-for-margin-and-collateral-calls-consultation-report/">liquidity preparedness for margin and collateral calls</a>&nbsp;in April. The comment period ends on Tuesday 18 June.</p>
<p>The FSB coordinates at the international level the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies and develops and promotes the implementation of effective regulatory, supervisory, and other financial sector policies in the interest of financial stability. It brings together national authorities responsible for financial stability in 24 countries and jurisdictions, international financial institutions, sector-specific international groupings of regulators and supervisors, and committees of central bank experts. The FSB also conducts outreach with approximately 70 other jurisdictions through its six Regional Consultative Groups.</p>
<p>The FSB is chaired by Klaas Knot, President of De Nederlandsche Bank. The FSB Secretariat is located in Basel, Switzerland and hosted by the Bank for International Settlements.</p>

<div> settlement, Gemini, investors, cryptocurrency, Attorney General<br />
Summary:<br />
New York Attorney General Letitia James secured a settlement with Gemini for defrauding investors in its cryptocurrency investment program. Gemini will return $50 million to investors. Attorney General James encourages affected individuals to come forward. <div>
<p>New York Attorney General Letitia James today&nbsp;<a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/vmm0dj30.r.us-east-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:*2F*2Fag.ny.gov*2Fsites*2Fdefault*2Ffiles*2Fsettlements-agreements*2F452784_2023_the_people_of_the_stat_v_the_people_of_the_stat_stipulation_settl_83.pdf/1/010001901790b7f8-11d117ea-a546-4aea-b9e9-f6a4fb14d759-000000/KciQxXC8K18ibNJ8vhFTlCzcXFc=378__;JSUlJSUlJQ!!Ke5ujdWW74OM!6LjZPKx9mG7mE-8P8OENt5Aqx_duCzxIymm7YsTvME3Fk7xhQMmwn4YsM53CsFkVG9uvY1KnwAkrIOksKQMHnU-Rx60Eggfz8qyRjrI-MGa5$">recovered approximately $50 million from the cryptocurrency platform Gemini Trust Company, LLC</a>&nbsp;(Gemini) for more than 230,000 investors, including at least 29,000 New Yorkers, who invested in the Gemini Earn program and were defrauded. Gemini allegedly misled thousands of investors on the risks associated with Gemini Earn, an investment program it offered with another cryptocurrency company, Genesis Global Capital (Genesis). The settlement provides all defrauded investors full recovery of the assets they invested in the Earn program but were unable to withdraw when the investment program collapsed. Today&rsquo;s settlement follows Attorney General James&rsquo;&nbsp;<a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/vmm0dj30.r.us-east-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:*2F*2Fag.ny.gov*2Fpress-release*2F2024*2Fattorney-general-james-secures-settlement-worth-2-billion-crypto-firm-genesis/1/010001901790b7f8-11d117ea-a546-4aea-b9e9-f6a4fb14d759-000000/9MG3hvml1hzveVb3jqBYMbjj2CU=378__;JSUlJSU!!Ke5ujdWW74OM!6LjZPKx9mG7mE-8P8OENt5Aqx_duCzxIymm7YsTvME3Fk7xhQMmwn4YsM53CsFkVG9uvY1KnwAkrIOksKQMHnU-Rx60Eggfz8qyRjnVsSm6l$">$2 billion settlement with Genesis</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/vmm0dj30.r.us-east-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:*2F*2Fag.ny.gov*2Fpress-release*2F2023*2Fattorney-general-james-sues-cryptocurrency-companies-gemini-genesis-and-dcg/1/010001901790b7f8-11d117ea-a546-4aea-b9e9-f6a4fb14d759-000000/7EyBSwWTE2ZTPQfuzkqZdugCApo=378__;JSUlJSU!!Ke5ujdWW74OM!6LjZPKx9mG7mE-8P8OENt5Aqx_duCzxIymm7YsTvME3Fk7xhQMmwn4YsM53CsFkVG9uvY1KnwAkrIOksKQMHnU-Rx60Eggfz8qyRjggknrRX$">resolves claims against Gemini</a>, bans Gemini from operating any cryptocurrency lending program in New York, and requires the company to cooperate with the Office of Attorney General&rsquo;s (OAG) litigation against Digital Currency Group (DCG), DCG&rsquo;s CEO Barry Silbert, and Genesis&rsquo; former CEO Soichiro Moro.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hundreds of thousands of people, including at least 29,000 New Yorkers, had their trust broken and their money swindled by Gemini through its bogus Earn program,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span>Attorney General James</span>. &ldquo;Gemini marketed its Earn program as a way for investors to grow their money, but actually lied and locked investors out of their accounts. Today&rsquo;s settlement will make defrauded investors whole and should remind cryptocurrency companies that deceiving investors is illegal and will not be tolerated by my office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under today&rsquo;s settlement, Gemini will return approximately $50 million worth of digital assets to Gemini Earn investors who were locked out of their accounts. Investors do not need to take any action to recover their digital assets and they will be able to access their digital assets in their accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In October 2023, Attorney General James&nbsp;<a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/vmm0dj30.r.us-east-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:*2F*2Fag.ny.gov*2Fpress-release*2F2023*2Fattorney-general-james-sues-cryptocurrency-companies-gemini-genesis-and-dcg/2/010001901790b7f8-11d117ea-a546-4aea-b9e9-f6a4fb14d759-000000/1RDs-xBvTPh72J48PnzFHzwIotQ=378__;JSUlJSU!!Ke5ujdWW74OM!6LjZPKx9mG7mE-8P8OENt5Aqx_duCzxIymm7YsTvME3Fk7xhQMmwn4YsM53CsFkVG9uvY1KnwAkrIOksKQMHnU-Rx60Eggfz8qyRjla3VDKs$">sued Gemini for lying to investors</a>&nbsp;about its Gemini Earn program. Gemini repeatedly assured investors that investing with Genesis through their Gemini Earn program was a low-risk investment. However, OAG&rsquo;s investigation found that Gemini&rsquo;s internal analyses of Genesis showed that the company&rsquo;s financials were risky. The lawsuit alleged that Gemini knew Genesis&rsquo; loans were under-secured and at one point highly concentrated with one entity, Sam Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s Alameda, but did not reveal this information to investors. Last month, Attorney General James secured&nbsp;<a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/vmm0dj30.r.us-east-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:*2F*2Fag.ny.gov*2Fpress-release*2F2024*2Fattorney-general-james-secures-settlement-worth-2-billion-crypto-firm-genesis/2/010001901790b7f8-11d117ea-a546-4aea-b9e9-f6a4fb14d759-000000/IB48j3fL_pl4_7dZo5pVw8GA0cU=378__;JSUlJSU!!Ke5ujdWW74OM!6LjZPKx9mG7mE-8P8OENt5Aqx_duCzxIymm7YsTvME3Fk7xhQMmwn4YsM53CsFkVG9uvY1KnwAkrIOksKQMHnU-Rx60Eggfz8qyRjjZhL0Zb$">$2 billion from Genesis for defrauded victims</a><a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/vmm0dj30.r.us-east-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:*2F*2Fag.ny.gov*2Fpress-release*2F2024*2Fattorney-general-james-secures-settlement-worth-2-billion-crypto-firm-genesis/3/010001901790b7f8-11d117ea-a546-4aea-b9e9-f6a4fb14d759-000000/wH0_jqKwwhiDghxdvKo-JRih-hk=378__;JSUlJSU!!Ke5ujdWW74OM!6LjZPKx9mG7mE-8P8OENt5Aqx_duCzxIymm7YsTvME3Fk7xhQMmwn4YsM53CsFkVG9uvY1KnwAkrIOksKQMHnU-Rx60Eggfz8qyRjhEikTwB$">.</a>&nbsp;</p>

<div> Securities, Market, Regulation, Cooperation, Technology
Summary:
Regulatory framework, international cooperation, and technology are crucial for efficient capital markets, investor protection, and economic growth.<br /><br /> <div>
<p>Thank you to all of you for participating in the SEC&rsquo;s 30th Annual International Institute for Securities Market Growth and Development.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-30th-intl-institutes-securities-mrket-growth-development-061424?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;It is a privilege to be here at the end of the first week of the Institute. We are gathered here because of our mutual goals of effective and efficient capital markets, that can lead to economic growth, jobs creation, higher standards of living, and the protection of investors.</p>
<p>The Institute provides a valuable opportunity to meet colleagues from around the world and to discuss regulatory perspectives, technology that you use or have used in the past, and to compare notes. In other words, we can learn from each other&rsquo;s successes and failures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, I will provide some thoughts about a strong regulatory framework, the importance of international cooperation, and the role of technology in finance. I hope we can continue to learn from each other and continue to improve our globally connected capital markets.</p>
<h3>Regulatory Framework</h3>
<p>For capital markets to succeed, there should be a respect for the rule of law and the upholding of contracts. These objectives are rooted in the goals of protecting investors and promoting capital formation. While there are honest firms that seek to raise capital in the market, there are also bad actors that lie, cheat, and steal. Regulators should strive to root out bad actors and promote transparency of disclosures. Otherwise, investors may not trust the markets and will not invest due to fears that they will be defrauded.</p>
<p>Increased cost of capital can negatively impact a country&rsquo;s economic growth and resulting job creation, infrastructure development, and decreased standards of living. When a regulator fails to address fraud and the cost of capital increases, honest entrepreneurs may also be adversely affected, and as a result, they may withdraw from the market. Removing bad actors from the market should lower the cost of capital, resulting in increased investments, greater economic growth, and more prosperity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, any regulatory framework must be cost efficient. When regulation is too costly, especially relative to any benefits from that regulation, it may have the unintended consequence of interfering with capital formation and damaging the capital market&rsquo;s potential. One method for reducing costs is to look for opportunities to eliminate duplicative regulations for companies that access more than one capital market and to cooperate internationally with regulators&rsquo; efforts to oversee and regulate the markets.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>International Cooperation</h3>
<p>The importance of international cooperation cannot be overstated. In 2002, the International Organization of Securities Commissions (&ldquo;IOSCO&rdquo;) adopted its Multilateral Memorandum of Understanding (&ldquo;MMOU&rdquo;), and there are currently 130 signatories to that MMOU.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-30th-intl-institutes-securities-mrket-growth-development-061424?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;In 2016, IOSCO adopted the Enhanced Multilateral Memorandum of Understanding (&ldquo;EMMOU&rdquo;), which included additional powers to obtain and share information.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-30th-intl-institutes-securities-mrket-growth-development-061424?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;As one example of the importance of cooperation, last week, the Korean Financial Supervisory Service acknowledged the growing need for reciprocal international cooperation given the increasing number of cross-border issues.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-30th-intl-institutes-securities-mrket-growth-development-061424?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cooperation goes both ways. The SEC staff routinely seeks international assistance and the assistance that many of you have provided to us has been invaluable. In turn, the SEC has often assisted non-U.S. regulators in their investigations.</p>
<h3>Technology in Finance</h3>
<p>Another way that we can learn from, and cooperate with, each other is through technology. Modern capital markets have the advantage of technology, which has significantly reduced costs and made the capital markets more efficient. Last week, the SEC celebrated its 90th anniversary. Technology has come a long way in 90 years. For example, the settlement of securities transactions used to require the movement of physical securities certificates, checks, and other paper documents. Today, with the benefit of technology, that is no longer the case.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-30th-intl-institutes-securities-mrket-growth-development-061424?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;In fact, countries in Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America have stopped issuing physical certificates all together.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-30th-intl-institutes-securities-mrket-growth-development-061424?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;Technology allows transactions to be settled in a faster, more cost-effective manner and in much larger volumes, and thus facilitated a T+1 settlement cycle for equity securities in the United States.</p>
<p>New technologies and innovations might provide further efficiencies to our global markets and investors. One such technology is tokenization, or the process of converting asset rights into a digital token on a blockchain. Proponents suggest that a wide range of assets can be tokenized, including securities holdings. Tokenization may provide transactions with a higher level of security, transparency, and immutability. It also may remove the need for most intermediaries, streamlining the process and reducing transaction costs.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-30th-intl-institutes-securities-mrket-growth-development-061424?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p>However, as with any new technology or innovative idea, regulators should understand its costs, benefits, and risks. In November 2023, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority&rsquo;s (&ldquo;FCA&rdquo;) Asset Management Task force published a report detailing a &ldquo;blueprint&rdquo; for the implementation of tokenization for FCA-authorized funds.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-30th-intl-institutes-securities-mrket-growth-development-061424?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;In March 2024, a second interim report was published, highlighting use cases and the next stages for fund tokenization.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-30th-intl-institutes-securities-mrket-growth-development-061424?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;While the FCA continues its review of securities tokenization, it is important to highlight the depth of research they are undertaking to allow for innovation and growth while still protecting investors from harm. More importantly, other regulators can review the FCA&rsquo;s research in considering what steps, if any, they might take regarding tokenization.</p>
<p>As technology continues to evolve, regulators will face new and challenging issues. It is important that we continue our regulatory cooperation in order to advance our shared goal of protecting investors and facilitating capital formation.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time this morning. I invite you to maintain communications with my office, should you return to Washington, D.C. in the future. I can be reached through the Office of International Affairs, whom I also thank for their tremendous efforts in organizing this Institute.</p>

<title>B.C. Securities Commission Asking British Columbians To Watch For Signs Of Elder Financial Abuse</title>

<div> elder financial abuse, BCSC, warning signs, prevention, resources<br />
Summary:<br />
BCSC urges awareness of elder financial abuse. Signs include unusual transactions, changes in living, and disappearance of possessions. Prevention and resources available. <div>
<p>The B.C. Securities Commission (BCSC) is urging British Columbians to learn the signs of elder financial abuse ahead of World Elder Abuse Awareness Day on June 15, 2024.</p>
<p>Elder financial abuse &ndash; the use of someone&rsquo;s money without their permission or in a fraudulent way &ndash; continues to be the most common form of elder abuse. The BCSC is highlighting elder financial abuse through a social media outreach campaign during the month of June, reaching thousands of British Columbians to raise awareness that elder financial abuse is a serious issue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Raising awareness about elder financial abuse is one of the most effective tools we have to prevent abuse,&rdquo; said Pamela McDonald, the BCSC&rsquo;s Director of Communications and Education. &ldquo;I encourage all British Columbians to learn the warning signs of elder financial abuse because by doing so, you can help prevent your older loved ones from becoming victims of financial exploitation.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following are some common warning signs of elder financial abuse:</p>
<ul>
<li>unusual financial transactions like increased bank withdrawals or liquidating investments</li>
<li>sudden changes in living arrangements, spending habits or inability to pay bills</li>
<li>unexplained disappearances of valuable possessions, such as jewelry and art, and</li>
<li>discrepancy between standard of living and financial assets.</li>
</ul>
<p>The abuser can be someone the older person trusts and cares about, such as a family member, caregiver, or friend. This personal relationship makes it difficult for the older person to come forward to get help. The abuser may use a variety of tactics to take control of the victim&rsquo;s finances. They may steal their money or bank cards, attempt to take over their investment portfolio or pressure them to make changes to their will or power of attorney.</p>
<p>Older adults can be vulnerable to financial abuse due to isolation, cognitive decline or fear of asking for help because it could affect their independence.&nbsp;Older adults may also be attracted to fraudulent investment offers, like promises of high-returns and low-risk, because they want to maximize their investments for retirement, or they want to leave money for their children and grandchildren.</p>
<p>Resources about elder financial abuse are available on the BCSC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investright.org/avoid-fraud/identify-frauds-and-scams/elder-financial-abuse/" target="_blank">InvestRight.org website</a>, including tips on how to initiate a conversation with a loved one about financial abuse, information about why having a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investright.org/news-and-insights/investing-articles/the-value-of-choosing-a-trusted-contact-person/" target="_blank">Trusted Contact Person</a>&nbsp;is important and instructions on how to report suspected investment fraud.</p>

<title>Canadian Securities Administrators Urge Vigilance Against Online Financial Abuse Of Older Canadians And Highlights The Importance Of A Trusted Contact Person</title>

<br />
The Canadian Securities Administrators urge vigilance against online elder financial abuse, offer tips to avoid scams, and recommend appointing a Trusted Contact Person.
<br /><br />Summary:
The article discusses the growing issue of online financial elder abuse, provides tips to avoid scams, and recommends appointing a Trusted Contact Person for financial security. <div>
<p>In recognition of World Elder Abuse Awareness Day, the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) is urging older adults, and their loved ones, to remain vigilant in the face of growing online financial elder abuse and to remember the importance of naming a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asc.ca/en/News-and-Publications/News-Releases/2024/06/www.securities-administrators.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CSA_TCP101_What_is_a_Trusted_Contact_Person.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Trusted Contact Person</a>&nbsp;(TCP).</p>
<p><strong>Canadian seniors are being targeted with sophisticated online scams</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Older adults can often be the target of financial scams. Scam artists take advantage of those who may be socially isolated or have diminished capacity and who have accumulated savings over time. Advancements in technology, like artificial intelligence (AI), have created new avenues for criminals to exploit these vulnerabilities and deceive victims. AI voice cloning allows scammers to impersonate family members or friends in urgent need of money. AI can also be used to easily manipulate images and videos, known as deepfakes, to create credible personas on dating sites and social media along with fake celebrity endorsement ads.</p>
<p>The CSA urges older Canadians to be cautious and offers these tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Restrict the amount of personal information you share publicly on social media sites by adjusting your privacy settings.</li>
<li>Avoid celebrity or public figure endorsements or investment opportunities promoted online. These are often AI-generated scams.</li>
<li>Be skeptical of new acquaintances or love interests online that take an immediate interest in your finances or offer unrequested investment opportunities, especially involving crypto.</li>
<li>Do not send money online to anyone or invest based solely on the advice of someone you have not met in person.</li>
<li>Check the registration of any individual, firm or platform you plan to invest with by visiting AreTheyRegistered.ca and confirming the identity of the representative by calling the phone number listed.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Trusted Contact Person: a valuable safeguard</strong></p>
<p>Canadians can further protect themselves by assigning a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asc.ca/en/News-and-Publications/News-Releases/2024/06/www.securities-administrators.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CSA_TCP101_What_is_a_Trusted_Contact_Person.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Trusted Contact Person</a>&nbsp;(TCP) to their financial accounts. An appointed TCP gives a financial advisor another resource to turn to if they cannot reach their client, or if they suspect their client may be a victim of financial abuse or fraud. A TCP does not have power of attorney or any access or view into the clients&rsquo; accounts at any time.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor, has published its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-06/ESMA22-50751485-1453_2023_Annual_Report.pdf">Annual Report for 2023</a>. It sets out the key achievements of the authority&nbsp;in the first year of implementing its new 5-year strategy, delivering on the mission of enhancing investor protection and promoting stable and orderly financial markets in the European Union (EU).</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>Verena Ross, Chair of ESMA, said:&nbsp;</p>
<h6><em>&ldquo;Retail investors are at the core of our strategy through the key role they play in financial markets. In 2023 we saw for the first time that the average cost of investing in certain funds had declined year on year, but there are still significant differences across the Union. We continued our mission to protect investors, including through a mystery shopping exercise on costs and charges under MiFID and targeted warnings about the risks of crypto assets.&nbsp;</em></h6>
<h6><em>As geopolitical tensions and macro-economic developments continued to impact European financial markets in 2023, vigilance and proactive measures by supervisory authorities remained fundamental. ESMA was again at the forefront of coordinating the actions and sharing information between national supervisors in the EU, ensuring common approaches to any crisis responses.</em></h6>
<h6><em>I would like to thank my colleagues in the ESMA Board of Supervisors and Management Board for their continued support.&rdquo;</em></h6>
<p>Natasha Cazenave, Executive Director of ESMA, said:</p>
<h6><em>&ldquo;Consistent with our strategic priority to strengthen supervision of EU financial markets we continued to reinforce and streamline the framework we use to identify supervisory risks, not just within ESMA but also with national supervisors.&nbsp;</em></h6>
<h6><em>As ESMA grows and evolves in a complex environment with rapid technological innovation and challenging economic conditions, we focus on retaining a strong culture internally and stay rooted in a clear set of values. This allows us to have the necessary agility needed to continue delivering on our strategic priorities.</em></h6>
<h6><em>I would like to warmly thank all the staff for their commitment and enthusiasm in delivering on ESMA&rsquo;s mission.&rdquo;</em></h6>
<h4><br /><span>ESMA's key achievements in 2023&nbsp;</span></h4>
<p>Throughout the year, ESMA actively monitored risks and resilience of financial markets, contributed to completing the single rulebook and supported supervisory convergence notably through extensive work in the digital finance space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ESMA&rsquo;s key accomplishments during 2023 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exploring new areas of regulation and working closely with EBA and EIOPA in preparation for the implementation of Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA).</li>
<li>Preparing for Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) implementation and together with the NCAs fostering convergent authorisation and supervision approaches,&nbsp;providing guidance to market participants,&nbsp;conducting consultations on detailed rules,&nbsp;and collaborating with international bodies on crypto-asset regulation.</li>
<li>Enhancing supervisory convergence through peer reviews on the supervision of central counterparties (CCPs) and central securities depositories (CSDs),&nbsp;identifying areas for improvement and issuing recommendations to ensure consistent supervision across the EU.</li>
<li>Monitoring retail investment markets and reporting on the costs and performance of retail investment products,&nbsp;highlighting cost reductions and variations across products and Member States,&nbsp;and recommending that investors carefully evaluate costs and diversify investments.</li>
<li>Enhancing sustainability disclosures through active participation in the development and application of European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) and in the IOSCO endorsement of the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Launching a new data strategy for 2023-2028,&nbsp;aiming to leverage technology and data to improve market supervision and investor protection.&nbsp;The strategy outlines six key objectives to enhance data utilization, reduce reporting burden and promote data-driven supervision.</li>
<li>Assessing greenwashing through a progress report on greenwashing risks and supervision,&nbsp;setting out a definition of greenwashing agreed with EBA and EIOPA, identifying material risks across the sustainable investment value chain and outlining preliminary remediation actions.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>These achievements reflect ESMA's commitment to navigating the evolving financial landscape,&nbsp;ensuring effective regulation and supervision,&nbsp;and protecting investors in the EU.</p>

<title>LuxSE Reports 7% Revenue Growth For 2023</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/luxse-reports-7-revenue-growth-for-2023/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: Luxembourg Stock Exchange, financial results, sustainable finance, trading offering, sustainability strategy<br />
Summary: LuxSE had a strong year in 2023, with increased activity and market share, particularly in sustainable finance and trading offerings. Sustainability is integrated into its strategy.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p class="paragraph"><span class="eop"><b><span>Despite a challenging macro-economic and geopolitical context, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange maintained a strong activity level in 2023, increased its global market share in international debt listings, and kept its position as the reference exchange for sustainable securities.</span></b></span><span class="normaltextrun"><b><span></span></b></span></p>
<p class="paragraph">At the annual general meeting of<b> </b>the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (LuxSE) held earlier today, the stock exchange released its financial results for the financial year ending on 31 December 2023, reporting a solid performance against the backdrop of a complex geopolitical and economic environment.</p>
<p class="paragraph">LuxSE reported operational revenues of EUR 40.8 million for 2023, which represents a year-over-year revenue growth of 7%. The stock exchange also reported a net profit of EUR 10.6 million for the same period, driven by robust operational results.</p>
<p class="paragraph">&ldquo;We are delighted to report that the Luxembourg Stock Exchange has demonstrated a strong performance last year, marked by a significant increase in activity levels across listing, data and trading, which we see as a direct result of our strategic developments. Beyond achieving substantial revenue growth, LuxSE remained the reference exchange for sustainable finance and further expanded its leadership position in international bond listings. We also explored AI solutions and advanced the digital transformation of our core listing system, and we remain committed to driving progress and innovation in these critical areas,&rdquo; commented Julie Becker, CEO of LuxSE.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph"><b>Listing activity at a 15-year high</b></h4>
<p class="paragraph">LuxSE welcomed 13,900 new listings in 2023, a 13% increase year over year and representing the highest number of new listings in a single year since 2007. This led LuxSE to increase its global market share in listed international bonds, capturing 34% of the market in 2023, according to figures from Dealogic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="paragraph">With 42,494 securities admitted on its markets and on the Securities Official List as of 31 December 2023, including more than 38,000 debt instruments, LuxSE reported a 4% increase year over year in the total number of listed securities at year end.</p>
<p class="paragraph">&ldquo;LuxSE remains the undisputed leader in the listing of international debt securities. However, competition is getting fiercer and through the implementation of our 4-year strategic plan, we are working to strengthen our core activities while exploring new business opportunities. LuxSE has a key role to play both in Luxembourg and in global markets, and we are capitalising on its unique expertise and positioning to ensure that it will remain a relevant,</p>
<p class="paragraph">innovative and sustainable exchange in the long term,&rdquo; stated Alain Kinsch, President of the Board of Directors of LuxSE.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph"><b>Doubling down on sustainable finance</b></h4>
<p class="paragraph">The macroeconomic environment caused a slowdown in the global sustainable bond market in 2023, resulting in a 6% decline in global issuance volumes compared to 2022, according</p>
<p class="paragraph">to estimates from Dealogic. Despite the global trend, LGX displayed 554 new green, social, sustainability and sustainability-linked (GSSS) bonds in the course of 2023, a 4% increase compared to 2022. The new GSSS bonds on LGX raised a total of EUR 207 billion for specific green and social projects and sustainable developments across the world, which is consistent with the previous year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph"><b>Strengthening the trading offering</b></h4>
<p class="paragraph">In the context of the discussions around the Capital Markets Union and the European Union&rsquo;s Retail Investment Strategy, in 2023, LuxSE made it a priority to further facilitate access to its trading platform. The exchange welcomed four new trading members and made available LuxTrader, a tool which greatly reduces the costs and complexities of setting up a technical connection to LuxSE&rsquo;s markets for brokers and banks. This and other developments resulted in a 20% increase in the number of trades executed on LuxSE&rsquo;s markets in 2023.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph"><b>Sustainability an integrated part of the strategy </b></h4>
<p class="paragraph">Along with its financial results, LuxSE also published its Sustainability Report 2023. The report reflects the progress made towards the three pillars of the exchange&rsquo;s sustainability strategy, namely climate transition, education and gender equality, and describes how LuxSE is embedding its sustainability strategy into its operations and business strategy.</p>

<title>Ripple Collaborates With Archax To Bring Hundreds Of Millions Of Dollars Of Tokenized Real-World Assets To The XRP Ledger</title>

<div> Collaboration, Ripple, Archax, XRPL, RWA tokenization
Summary:<br />Ripple and Archax extend collaboration to bring real world assets to the XRPL, establishing it as a leading blockchain for RWA tokenization. Compliance-focused partnerships drive mainstream adoption. <br /> <div>
<p align="left"><span>Ripple, the leader in enterprise blockchain and crypto solutions, and Archax, the UK&rsquo;s first Financial Conduct Authority regulated digital asset exchange, broker and custodian, today announced an extension to their existing collaboration which is expected to bring hundreds of millions of dollars of tokenized real world assets (RWAs) onto the XRP Ledger (XRPL) over the coming year and establish the XRPL as one of the leading blockchains for RWA tokenization.</span></p>
<div class="dombanner"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Archax works with leading financial institutions to enable them to tokenize their financial RWAs. As a result of this collaboration, financial institutions will be able to select the XRPL to tokenize their RWAs, creating opportunities for numerous downstream use cases for these assets.</span></p>
<p><span>The agreement represents an evolution of the relationship between Ripple and Archax which was established in 2022 when Archax collaborated with Metaco to offer digital asset custody services to its clients. Metaco was acquired by Ripple in mid-2023.</span></p>
<p><span>The XRPL is an open-source public decentralized Layer 1 blockchain. With built-in capabilities like tokenization, a native decentralized exchange, compliance features and more, the XRPL is built to power institutional-grade financial use cases.</span></p>
<p><span>"Our industry is at the start of the next major adoption stage in which blockchain technology will deliver real utility in financial markets at scale," said Markus Infanger, SVP, RippleX. "Ripple is excited to see Archax&rsquo;s vision of driving the adoption of blockchain and digital assets technology amongst financial institutions come to life, while further underlining the credentials of the XRPL as one of the leading blockchains for RWA tokenization.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>Ripple and Archax share a compliance-first mindset. Both companies work proactively with regulators and policymakers around the world to bring the benefits of crypto and blockchain technology to the world&rsquo;s global financial infrastructure. As the first and only FCA-regulated digital securities exchange, custodian and brokerage, Archax is uniquely positioned to provide its clients with the means to derive the benefits of DeFi through RWA tokenization, all underpinned by the strength and capabilities of the XRPL.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;We have hit the tipping point for mainstream adoption of digital assets for real world use cases,&rdquo; said Graham Rodford, CEO, Archax. &ldquo;There is clear real-world utility in use cases like RWA tokenization for the operational efficiency, access to liquid markets and transparency inherent to crypto, and Archax has already tokenised assets such as equities, debt instruments and money market funds. Financial institutions are now understanding this and we are excited to play our part in helping them to embrace the technology by bringing their assets onto the XRPL.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>The XRPL provides a strong foundation for RWA tokenization and institutional-grade DeFi thanks to its proven reliability, efficiency, and its roadmap of comprehensive features such as an Automated Market Maker (AMM) currently live on the XRPL as well as the upcoming Decentralized Identifier (DID), Multi-Purpose Tokens (MPT) capability, a Lending Protocol, and Oracles. Over the past decade, the XRPL has been the home of over 1,000 projects, processing over 2.8 billion transactions without failure or security breach since 2012 and supporting over 5 million active wallets with a network of over 120 validators.</span></p>
<p><span>The partnership has been announced at XRP Ledger APEX 2024, the largest annual XRPL summit, which is taking place between June 11-13, 2024 in Amsterdam.</span></p>

Summary:
The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong proposes improvements to board effectiveness, independence, diversity, risk management, and capital management in corporate governance practices.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p class="spanHeading"><span>The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the Exchange), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX), today (Friday) published&nbsp;a&nbsp;</span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.hkex.com.hk/-/media/HKEX-Market/News/Market-Consultations/2016-Present/June-2024-Review-of-CG-Code/Consultation-Paper/cp202406.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">consultation paper</a></span></span></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>outlining proposed enhancements to the Corporate Governance</span><span class="spanHeading">&nbsp;Code (Code) and related Listing Rules</span><span>.</span></p>
<p class="spanHeading"><span>HKEX Head of Listing, Katherine Ng, said:&nbsp;</span><span>&ldquo;At HKEX, we are committed to driving the long-term growth and attractiveness of our markets by further elevating the quality of our issuers, and promoting strong corporate governance practices is a key part of our approach. We are therefore pleased to be presenting for consultation the latest proposed enhancements to the Corporate Governance Code. This will ride on the success of our efforts to ban single-gender boards &ndash; which will take full effect from the end of 2024 &ndash; further helping issuers to create a more diverse boardroom and strengthen risk management and internal controls.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="spanHeading"><span>Key proposals include:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Board effectiveness improvements &ndash;</span> 
<ul>
<li class="spanHeading"><span>The designation of a lead INED<span>1</span>&nbsp;where the board chair is not independent (<em>New CP<span>2</span></em>).</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="spanHeading"><span>Annual director training on specific topics, with a minimum of 24 hours of training for first-time directors<span>3</span>&nbsp;within the first 18 months of appointment (<em>New Rule</em>).</span></li>

<ul>
<li class="spanHeading"><span>Regular board performance reviews and the disclosure of a board skills matrix (<em>New CPs</em>).</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="spanHeading"><span>Capping &ldquo;overboarding&rdquo; INEDs so they don&rsquo;t hold more than six Hong Kong-listed issuer directorships simultaneously (<em>New Rule / MDR<span>4</span></em>).</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="spanHeading"><span>Strengthening board independence</span><span>&nbsp;&ndash; INEDs serving more than nine years (Long Serving INED) will no longer be considered independent&nbsp;</span><span>(</span><em class="spanHeading">New Rule</em><span>).</span><br /><br /></li>
<li class="spanHeading"><span>Promoting diversity</span><span>&nbsp;&ndash; to require: (i) the nomination committee to comprise directors of different genders (<em>New CP</em>); (ii) annual reviews of board diversity policy (<em>Upgraded to MDR</em>); and (iii) a workforce diversity policy (<em>New Rule</em>).</span><br /><br /></li>
<li class="spanHeading"><span>Enhancing risk management and internal controls</span><span>&nbsp;&ndash; to require (at least) an annual review of these systems and enhanced disclosures of the review and findings (<em>Upgraded to MDR</em>).</span><br /><br /></li>
<li class="spanHeading"><span>Better capital management</span><span>&nbsp;&ndash; to require enhanced disclosures of an issuer&rsquo;s dividend policy and its board&rsquo;s dividend decisions (</span><em class="spanHeading">New MDR</em><span>).</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="spanHeading"><span><br />The proposed amendments will apply to corporate governance reports for financial years commencing on or after 1 January 2025, with a three-year transition period for the proposals on overboarding and Long Serving INEDs.</span></p>

<title>Parliamentary Joint Committee Opening Statement, 14 June 2024 - Opening Statement By ASIC Chair Joe Longo At The Parliamentary Joint Committee On Corporations And Financial Services, Oversight Of ASIC, The Takeovers Panel And The Corporations Legislation, 14 June 2024</title>

<div> enforcement, technology, ASIC, court, digital transformation
Summary: ASIC presents enforcement statistics, court outcomes, and its digital transformation plans. It highlights specific cases and the importance of data and technology. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to appear today.</p>
<p>I am joined today by Deputy Chair Sarah Court and Commissioners Kate O&rsquo;Rourke, Alan Kirkland and Simone Constant.</p>
<p>Also present today are Chief Executive Officer, Greg Yanco, our General Counsel, Chris Savundra; our Executive Director of Markets, Calissa Aldridge and our Chief Financial Officer, Peter Dunlop.</p>
<p>Last time we appeared before this Committee in April, there was significant interest by members in relation to our enforcement activity and actions.</p>
<p>As at 30<span>th</span>&nbsp;April (over a 12-month period), we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>commenced over 130 new investigations, this is an increase of around 25% on the previous year; and</li>
<li>filed 29 new civil proceedings in the Federal Court (against 64 defendants), representing an increase of 11% in civil proceedings on the previous year.</li>
<li>Investigations have led to 23 individuals charged by the CDPP for criminal offences with 16 convictions with a total $936,000 in fines ordered by the courts.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ASIC is one of the nation&rsquo;s most active law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>Amongst our domestic peers, I don&rsquo;t think you will find a regulator in court more often than we are.</p>
<p>As members will be aware, court action can be costly, resource-intensive, and it can be complex. No two cases are the same.</p>
<p>We pursue court-based outcomes and substantial penalties when we find evidence of serious misconduct and it is in the public interest to do so.</p>
<p>Our enforcement outcomes are strong &ndash; our record shows that ASIC is securing materially higher penalties than it did a decade ago.</p>
<p>We also pursue difficult cases where the outcome is not guaranteed, but we consider it important to test the law.</p>
<p>Some matters can run over several years, particularly if appeals are involved.</p>
<p>There are two recent examples I&rsquo;d like to share with the Committee which demonstrate public interest outcomes that ASIC has achieved through the courts.</p>
<p>Firstly, the Committee will be familiar with the final stop order we issued under the design and distribution obligations regime against Coral Coast Distributors Pty Ltd.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s stop order prohibits Coral Coast from allowing its customers to use Centrepay to pay for items at its Urban Rampage stores.</p>
<p>Coral Coast has applied to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for a review of ASIC&rsquo;s decision to make a final stop order and for a stay of that order pending the hearing of this application.</p>
<p>We strongly defended our position.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the Tribunal rejected Coral Coast&rsquo;s application for a stay.</p>
<p>This is a positive and welcome outcome for vulnerable First Nations consumers.</p>
<p>Where ASIC sees conduct that places consumers at risk of financial harm, we will act to stop it.</p>
<p>Secondly, in late May, ASIC secured a guilty plea in its ongoing proceedings against John Bigatton, the Australian promoter of the now-collapsed investment vehicle BitConnect.</p>
<p>BitConnect was a financial services business and online crypto platform, which required investors to acquire a BitConnect Coin - a form of cryptocurrency token - in order to invest its investment opportunities.</p>
<p>In promoting this financial product, Mr Bigatton provided unlicensed financial advice in seminars around the country, as well as online via social media.</p>
<p>Mr Bigatton will proceed to sentencing hearing next month.</p>
<p>Back in September 2020, ASIC banned Mr Bigatton from providing financial services for seven years.</p>
<p>This work demonstrates our ongoing commitment to combatting misconduct arising from emerging technologies like cryptocurrency using the regulatory tools and legal frameworks available to us.</p>
<p>Both the Coral Coast and BitConnect examples highlight the complexity, time and resources involved in many of our cases.</p>
<p>But we run them for good reason.</p>
<p>We do not believe that it is in the public interest for serious contraventions to go unpunished.</p>
<h2>ASIC&rsquo;s digital transformation</h2>
<p>Enforcement and compliance work requires investment in technology &ndash; any regulator will tell you that.</p>
<p>In this environment of rapid change, that technology is more important than ever.</p>
<p>The Financial Regulator Assessment Authority (FRAA) recommended that ASIC needed a substantial uplift in its data and technology capability.</p>
<p>ASIC wholeheartedly agrees with this recommendation.</p>
<p>ASIC is in a digital arms race, with AI rapidly being adopted in financial services firms and digitally-enabled misconduct is on the rise.</p>
<p>We need to be a leading digitally enabled and data-informed regulator who is ahead of the game.</p>
<p>To support this vision, we have developed a digital target state and we received initial funding in the recent federal budget to commence a program of work to uplift our cyber security across our regulatory systems which will set us on firm foundations for our digital uplift.</p>
<p>We will now move to implement these initiatives, including a new &lsquo;threat intelligence platform&rsquo; to improve information collection and real-time detection of internal and external cyber threats.</p>
<p>Last year, ASIC seized and reviewed 2.6 million documents, as part of its investigations.</p>
<p>The time to collect, process and sift through this volume of data to find the "needle in the haystack" and make the connections with other data sets we've previously collected is exceedingly labour-intensive, relying heavily on manual efforts from our investigators.</p>
<p>Bolstering our data and analytics capabilities through investment in creating a unified view of entities, coupled with advanced analytics, would significantly expedite ASIC's ability to connect disparate data sets, and accelerate the investigation process.</p>
<p>This improvement would not only aid in bringing relief to victims more swiftly, but also serve as a deterrent to potential bad actors.</p>
<p>Transitioning to a leading digitally enabled and data-informed regulator reduces the dependency on human intuition and experience for decision-making.</p>
<p>We know that utilising innovative digital and data driven approaches works.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s innovative approach to tackling investment scams with website takedown powers, has seen us shutter about 5000 scam websites since 1 July 2023, all to help protect consumers.</p>
<p>This is work that has been recognised globally in the last fortnight, with ASIC to help lead a new anti-scams working group of regulators in Asia-Pacific to tackle the issue in our region.</p>
<p>A further uplift in data capabilities will empower ASIC to make more timely decisions regarding resource allocation and fine-tuning of priorities across prevention, investigation, and enforcement efforts.</p>
<p>These advancements will enable us to achieve better outcomes and bolster public trust and confidence in the Australian financial system.</p>
<p>Finally, in recent weeks, I have had the opportunity to discuss the priorities of financial and markets&rsquo; regulators across a range of jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The rise and use of AI and the proliferation and impact of digitally-enabled scams were significant areas of focus at the recent meeting of the International Organization of Securities Commissions.</p>
<p>So too were the growth in private markets and sustainable finance and climate disclosure reporting.</p>
<p>It is reassuring that the issues ASIC is focused on in Australia, are the same as our global peers.</p>
<p>We look forward to answering the Committee&rsquo;s questions.</p>

<div> FMA, smaller firms, Fair Conduct Programme, Financial Institution licence, CoFI
Summary:<br /><br />The FMA has published an information sheet for smaller firms on establishing and maintaining a Fair Conduct Programme and applying for a CoFI licence. It provides support with examples and principles-based guidance. The FMA is taking an educative approach to help firms transition into the new CoFI regime, providing ongoing support through the application process. Fair Conduct Programmes should be proportionate to the size and complexity of each firm's business and are expected to evolve over time. Small firms are encouraged to read the information sheet and attend CoFI workshops. It's important for all firms to get their licence applications in well in advance of the deadline. <div>
<p><span class="EOP SCXW234653080 BCX8">The Financial Markets Authority (FMA) &ndash; Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko &ndash; has today published an information sheet specifically for smaller firms to assist in establishing and maintaining a Fair Conduct Programme (FCP) and applying for a Financial Institution (CoFI) licence. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="EOP SCXW234653080 BCX8">The sheet provides information and examples to help smaller firms establish, implement and maintain their FCP. Financial institutions are required to have an FCP that is designed to ensure their compliance with the fair conduct principle, as set out in the Financial Markets (Conduct of Institutions) Amendment Act 2022. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="EOP SCXW234653080 BCX8">The fair conduct principle is the overarching principle of CoFI that a financial institution must treat consumers fairly. The CoFI regime is designed to protect consumers by putting them at the forefront of institutions&rsquo; decisions and actions. CoFI is principles-based and the requirements for FCPs have been designed to enable and accommodate a wide variety of financial institutions to design and implement processes and controls in their business that work to ensure that consumers they deal with are treated fairly.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="EOP SCXW234653080 BCX8">The information sheet is the latest piece of support from the FMA to help smaller firms prepare for the new regime when it comes into effect in March 2025. The FMA continues to take a supportive and educative approach to implementing and transitioning firms into the new CoFI regime, as it has shown with the Financial Advice regime and the new Climate Related Disclosure regime.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="EOP SCXW234653080 BCX8">The FMA has held numerous market engagements to help firms understand what obligations and requirements they must meet under the new legislation. This includes two webinars with approximately 150 people in attendance. Forty firms provided feedback on how the FMA can best support them following recent engagement. FMA staff have held 11 one-on-one clinics with smaller firms, while 20 other firms have expressed interest in a one-on-one session. The FMA will continue to provide ongoing support to firms through the application process.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="EOP SCXW234653080 BCX8">FMA Executive Director of Regulatory Delivery Clare Bolingford said: &ldquo;We have some great examples of working with a diverse range and size of businesses from the financial advice sector while we implemented the new advice regime. CoFI is also principles-based and therefore we won&rsquo;t be taking a &lsquo;one size fits all&rsquo; approach to the way that firms meet the minimum requirements. Each firm&rsquo;s Fair Conduct Programme needs to be the proportionate to the nature, size and complexity of its business. We expect smaller firms will need a less complex FCP compared to bigger financial institutions. We also expect firms to review and evolve their FCPs over time. FCPs do not need to be fully implemented until the regime comes into force.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="EOP SCXW234653080 BCX8">&ldquo;I encourage all small firms to read the information sheet and attend our CoFI workshops. The FMA is here to support firms on their journey. It is also a timely reminder for all firms to get their licence applications in well in advance of the March 2025 deadline for obtaining a licence.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>

<title>SEC: Terraform And Kwon To Pay $4.5 Billion Following Fraud Verdict - Kwon To Contribute More Than $200 Million, Terraform To Wind Down, And Assets To Be Distributed To Investor Victims And Creditors In Bankruptcy</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Terraform Labs PTE, Ltd. and Do Kwon agreed to pay more than $4.5 billion following a unanimous jury verdict holding them liable for orchestrating a years-long fraud involving crypto asset securities that led to massive investor losses when the scheme unraveled.</p>
<p>A nine-day jury trial in April exposed the extent of the defendants&rsquo; lies to victims about the false use of the Terraform blockchain to settle transactions and about the stability of their crypto asset security, UST. The SEC also offered evidence at trial showing that, in May 2022, after UST de-pegged from the U.S. dollar, the price of UST and Terraform&rsquo;s other tokens plummeted to close to zero. This wiped out $40 billion in market value nearly overnight and caused devastating losses to countless investors, including numerous retail investors who believed defendants&rsquo; lies and poured their life savings into Terraform&rsquo;s ecosystem.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This case affirms what court after court has said: The economic realities of a product&mdash;not the labels, the spin, or the hype&mdash;determine whether it is a security under the securities laws,&rdquo; said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. &ldquo;Terraform and Do Kwon&rsquo;s fraudulent activities caused devastating losses for investors, in some cases wiping out entire life savings. Their fraud serves as a reminder that, when firms fail to comply with the law, investors get hurt. Terraform and Kwon fought our efforts to investigate &ndash; taking a fight over investigative subpoenas all the way to the Supreme Court. Thankfully, with this settlement, the victims of their massive fraud will now get some justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do Kwon and Terra orchestrated one of the largest securities frauds in U.S. history by, among other things, falsely claiming that they had achieved the Holy Grail of crypto: a non-illicit use case. As the jury found, that was a lie, as was their claim of creating an &lsquo;algorithmic stablecoin.&rsquo; In the end, all they succeeded in doing was lying to investors, wiping out tens of billions of dollars in market value, and creating a trail of victims,&rdquo; said Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s multi-billion dollar settlement not only holds them accountable and prioritizes the return of hundreds of millions of dollars to harmed investors, but also makes clear that, despite the vast resources that crypto asset defendants deploy against us, the dedicated staff of the Division of Enforcement will not stop until they achieve justice for the victims of these breathtaking frauds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC charged Terraform and Kwon in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on February 16, 2023, with securities fraud and for offering and selling securities in unregistered transactions. On December 28, 2023, the District Court found Terraform and Kwon liable for offering and selling crypto asset securities in unregistered transactions. On January 21, 2024, Terraform filed a voluntary Chapter 11 petition in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. On April 5, 2024, a jury unanimously found Terraform and Kwon liable for securities fraud after less than two hours of deliberation.</p>
<p>As part of the settlement, Terraform agreed to pay $3,586,875,883 in disgorgement, $466,952,423 in prejudgment interest, and a $420,000,000 civil penalty. Terraform also agreed to stop selling its crypto asset securities, wind down its operations, replace two of its directors, and distribute its remaining assets to investor victims and creditors through a liquidation plan, subject to approval by the court in Terraform&rsquo;s pending bankruptcy case.</p>
<p>Kwon agreed to pay $110,000,000 in disgorgement and $14,320,196 in prejudgment interest on a joint and several basis with Terraform, as well as an $80,000,000 civil penalty.</p>
<p>In addition, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining them from violating the registration and fraud provisions they violated.</p>
<p>The litigation is being handled by Devon Staren, Laura Meehan, Christopher Carney, and Carina Cuellar from the Trial Unit, as well as Roger Landsman, and supervised by James Connor and Jorge Tenreiro. The SEC is represented in Terraform&rsquo;s bankruptcy case by Therese Scheuer, Michael Kelly, and William Uptegrove, with supervision by Alistaire Bambach. The investigation was conducted by Mr. Landsman, Elisabeth Goot, Kathleen Hitchins, James Murtha, Daniel Koster, Donald Battle, and David Crosbie and was supervised by Reid Muoio, Osman Nawaz, Mr. Tenreiro, and David Hirsch from the Complex Financial Instruments and Crypto Assets and Cyber Units.</p>

<title>FSI, ICI, IRI, SIFMA Urge Senate Passage Of Financial Exploitation Prevention Act - Call Comes Ahead Of World Elder Abuse Awareness Day</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/fsi-ici-iri-sifma-urge-senate-passage-of-financial-exploitation-prevention-ac/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/fsi-ici-iri-sifma-urge-senate-passage-of-financial-exploitation-prevention-ac/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As World Elder Abuse Awareness Day approaches, the Financial Services Institute (FSI), the Investment Company Institute (ICI), the Insured Retirement Institute, and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) call on senators to pass the Financial Exploitation Prevention Act (S. 1841) and for President Biden to sign it into law. The bill aims to protect vulnerable adults from financial exploitation by permitting companies to postpone securities redemption if they suspect exploitation of seniors or individuals unable to protect their interests.</p>
<p>The bipartisan legislation, introduced by Senators Bill Hagerty (R-TN) and Jon Tester (D-MT) and Representatives Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ-05) and Ann Wagner (R-MO-02), comes at a time when financial exploitation of seniors is increasing. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, in 2022, there were 167,889 reported fraud or other financial incidents committed against adults aged 65 or older&nbsp;<a href="https://learcat.bjs.ojp.gov/IncidentsCrime?Data%20Year=2022&amp;Unit%20of%20Analysis=Count&amp;Crime%20Type=Fraud%20and%20Other%20Financial%20Crimes&amp;Victim%20Age%20-%20Null%20Handle=Age%2065%20and%20Older">[1]</a>. In 2023, elder fraud complaints increased by 14%, with corresponding losses rising by 11%&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2023_IC3ElderFraudReport.pdf" target="_blank">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As we mark World Elder Abuse Awareness Day, we applaud lawmakers for their commitment to preventing elder financial abuse and increasing protection for seniors,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span>FSI President and CEO Dale Brown</span>. &ldquo;However, there is more to do, which is why we urge the Senate to pass the Financial Exploitation Prevention Act now. With the increase in new technologies, including AI, financial fraudsters are growing more sophisticated in their schemes to defraud seniors. Financial advisors often serve as the first line of defense in detecting and preventing elder financial abuse and fraud, and this legislation equips our members with the necessary tools to best protect senior clients.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We strongly support the efforts in the Senate to pass the Financial Exploitation Prevention Act (S. 1841) to protect our senior citizens from the threat of financial exploitation,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span>SIFMA President and CEO Ken Bentsen</span>. &ldquo;This legislation is a helpful, additional tool in providing essential safeguards for vulnerable adults. As financial crimes against seniors continue to rise, it is imperative that we equip our industry with the tools needed to combat these increasingly sophisticated schemes. We commend the bipartisan effort behind this bill and call on President Biden to sign it into law. By doing so, we take an additional step towards ensuring the financial security and dignity of our elder population.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mutual funds are vital to building financial security for millions of Americans, and around a third of those are seniors. The bill would give our industry better tools to address suspected financial exploitation and abuse of seniors and those with mental and physical disabilities,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span>ICI CEO and President Eric J. Pan</span>. &ldquo;As we approach World Elder Abuse Awareness Day, ICI thanks Senators Hagerty and Tester and Representatives Wagner and Gottheimer for their leadership on this important legislation. We urge the Senate to pass the bipartisan Financial Exploitation Prevention Act swiftly so seniors and vulnerable investors can receive a greater level of protection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prevention of financial exploitation and the protection of older and vulnerable Americans is an important IRI objective,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span>Wayne Chopus, President and CEO of IRI</span>. &ldquo;Our members are on the front lines of this issue, working with clients across America every day. As a result, they are often the first to notice that a client may be the victim of a financial crime. We urge the Senate to act quickly to pass this bipartisan solution to protect retirees and their hard-earned savings from the potentially devastating effects of economic exploitation and fraud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Last year, the House of Representatives unanimously passed the bill, a pivotal step in preventing the financial exploitation of vulnerable adults.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> SEC, budget request, market growth, funding, oversight <br />
Summary: The SEC is requesting increased funding due to market growth, increased workload, and the need for more oversight to prevent wrongdoing.  <div>
<p>Good morning, Chair Van Hollen, Ranking Member Hagerty, and members of the Subcommittee. Thank you for inviting me to testify today on the Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s Fiscal Year (FY) 2025 budget request.</p>
<p>As is customary, I&rsquo;d like to note that my views are my own as Chair of the SEC, and I am not speaking on behalf of my fellow Commissioners or the SEC staff.</p>
<p>At the SEC, we just had our 90th birthday last week.</p>
<p>Congress and President Roosevelt set up our agency in the aftermath of the Great Depression to ensure that our capital markets work for investors and issuers alike.</p>
<p>They knew this was critical to restoring trust in the markets and promote the economy. The SEC they created serves investors building for a better future and issuers raising money to fund innovation, while overseeing the capital markets where they meet.</p>
<p>The SEC is the cop on the beat watching out for the investing public and issuers.</p>
<p>I believe the securities laws and this agency have been a significant contributor to our economic success as well as the U.S. dollar&rsquo;s global role ever since.</p>
<p>Today, the $110-plus trillion U.S. capital markets are the deepest, most liquid in the world.</p>
<p>We cannot, however, take this leadership for granted.</p>
<p>Today, our limited resources contrast against the tremendous growth and change in our markets.</p>
<p>In the face of this significant growth in registrants, complexity, and individual investor engagement in markets, one may have thought that our agency would have grown. The reverse was the case&mdash;the SEC actually shrank between 2016 and 2022. With Congress&rsquo;s help, we were authorized to hire 400 people in FY 2023 to bring us just modestly above where we were in 2016.</p>
<p>While our funding was kept flat for FY 2024, growth in market activity was anything but flat. We are losing pace with the ever-increasing scale of the capital markets.</p>
<p>Transaction volume in listed equities doubled in the last five years and tripled in the last 17.</p>
<p>Today, more than 15,400 registered investment advisers advise 57 million clients. At the end of 2016, by comparison, 12,000 registered investment advisers advised 43 million clients.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d note that the more than $32 trillion in registered funds and $30 trillion in private funds each are larger than the entire $23 trillion U.S. banking system.</p>
<p>Such growth and rapid change also mean more possibility for wrongdoing. We&rsquo;ve seen the number of tips, complaints, and referrals we get climb from 16,700 in 2019 to 40,000 in 2023.</p>
<p>Allow me to put flat funding into context. Seventy percent of our budget is for staff, 15 percent technology, 5 percent facilities, and 10 percent everything else. Flat funding means cutting staffing, technology, and real estate.</p>
<p>We have paused on nearly all job postings and backfilling for departing staff. We are currently more than 300 positions below the level Congress authorized for both FY 2023 and 2024.</p>
<p>While the agency&rsquo;s rules get outsized attention in the media, the vast majority of the SEC&rsquo;s staff works on oversight of the markets and responding to inquiries. We collectively review tens of thousands of filings a year.</p>
<p>Without additional resources, oversight of markets is at risk. Our ability to find bad actors is at risk. Our responsiveness to market participants is at risk. American capital formation and innovation are at risk as issuers will have to wait longer to hear from us.</p>
<p>As this Committee continues its work, it&rsquo;s worth noting the SEC&rsquo;s funding is deficit-neutral; our appropriations are offset by transaction fees.</p>
<p>I am pleased to take your questions.</p>

<title>US Justice Department Repatriates $1.4B Misappropriated 1MDB Funds To Malaysia</title>

<div> repatriation, misappropriated funds, 1MDB, international money laundering, embezzlement
<br /><br />Summary:
The Justice Department repatriated $156 million in misappropriated 1MDB funds, totaling $1.4 billion. The funds were laundered through major financial institutions worldwide. The embezzlement proceeds were used for bribes and extravagant items. The Justice Department led the seizure of over $1.7 billion in stolen assets. The funds were intended to promote economic development in Malaysia but were misappropriated for personal use. The Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative aims to forfeit the proceeds of foreign official corruption. <div>
<p>The Justice Department announced today that it has repatriated an additional $156 million in misappropriated 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) funds to the people of Malaysia, bringing the total returned by the department to approximately $1.4 billion.</p>
<p>According to court documents, the funds from 1MDB, formerly Malaysia&rsquo;s investment development fund, were laundered through major financial institutions worldwide, including in the United States, Switzerland, Singapore, and Luxembourg. As alleged in the civil forfeiture complaints, from 2009 through 2015, high-level officials of 1MDB, their associates, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-entertainer-convicted-engaging-foreign-influence-campaign">Low Taek Jho</a>, also known as Jho Low, misappropriated more than $4.5 billion in funds belonging to 1MDB through a criminal scheme involving international money laundering and embezzlement. Some of the embezzlement proceeds were also allegedly used to pay bribes.</p>
<p>Beginning in 2016, a landmark effort encompassing 41 civil forfeiture actions filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California and one in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia by the Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section (MLARS) of the Justice Department&rsquo;s Criminal Division led to the seizure of over $1.7 billion in stolen assets. This is the largest recovery to date under the department&rsquo;s Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative. The funds include both funds finally forfeited and funds the department assisted in recovering and returning. The department continues to litigate actions against additional assets allegedly linked to this scheme.</p>
<p>1MDB was created by the government of Malaysia to promote economic development in Malaysia through global partnerships and foreign direct investment. Its funds were intended to be used for improving the well-being of the Malaysian people. Instead, funds held by 1MDB and proceeds of bonds issued for and on behalf of 1MDB were misappropriated and spent on a wide variety of extravagant items, including luxury homes and properties in Beverly Hills, New York, and London; a 300-foot superyacht; and fine art by Monet and Van Gogh. The funds were also sent into numerous business investments, including a boutique hotel in Beverly Hills, a movie production company that made &ldquo;The Wolf of Wall Street,&rdquo; the redevelopment of the Park Lane Hotel in Manhattan, and shares in EMI, the largest private music rights holder. As alleged, other funds were provided to various public officials and co-conspirators.</p>
<p>Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department&rsquo;s Criminal Division; Assistant Director Michael D. Nordwall of the FBI&rsquo;s Criminal Investigative Division; and Chief Guy Ficco of the IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) made the announcement.</p>
<p>The FBI&rsquo;s International Corruption Squads in New York and Los Angeles and IRS-CI are leading the investigation.</p>
<p>MLARS Trial Attorneys Barbara Levy, Josh Sohn, Jonathon Baum, and Sean Fern are prosecuting the case, with assistance from former MLARS Deputy Chief Woo S. Lee; Trial Attorney Kyle Freeny; and former Asset Forfeiture Section Chief Steven Welk, Asset Forfeiture Section Chief Jonathan Galatzan, and former Assistant U.S. Attorneys John Kucera and Michael Sew Hoy for the Central District of California.</p>
<p>The Justice Department&rsquo;s Office of International Affairs is providing substantial assistance. MLARS&rsquo; Program Operations Unit and the U.S. Marshals Service also provided significant support.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Significant assistance has also been provided to the department over the course of its work in the investigations and civil and criminal litigation by the Attorney General&rsquo;s Chambers of Malaysia, the Royal Malaysia Police, the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, the United Kingdom Prudential Regulation Authority, the United Kingdom National Crime Agency (NCA), the Attorney General&rsquo;s Chambers of the Territory of the British Virgin Islands, the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office of the Bailiwick of Guernsey and the Guernsey Economic Crime Division, the International Anti-Corruption Coordinate Centre, the Attorney General&rsquo;s Chambers of Singapore, the Singapore Police Force&ndash;Commercial Affairs Division, the Office of the Attorney General and the Federal Office of Justice of Switzerland, the judicial investigating authority of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Criminal Investigation Department of the Grand-Ducal Police of Luxembourg, and Indonesian, Latvian and French authorities.</p>
<p>The Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative is led by a team of dedicated MLARS prosecutors in partnership with federal law enforcement agencies, and often with U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Offices, to forfeit the proceeds of foreign official corruption and, where appropriate, to seize, forfeit, and repatriate those recovered assets to benefit the people harmed by these acts of corruption and abuse of office. Individuals with information about possible proceeds of foreign corruption located in or laundered through the United States should email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:kleptocracy@usdoj.gov">kleptocracy@usdoj.gov</a>&nbsp;or submit information at&nbsp;<a href="https://tips.fbi.gov/">https://tips.fbi.gov/</a>.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<div> revocation, registration, CFTC, guilty plea, wire fraud <br />
Summary:<br />
The CFTC revoked Ted Brent Alexander's registrations as a Commodity Trading Advisor and Associated Person due to his guilty plea for conspiracy to commit wire fraud. <div>
<p><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today issued an opinion and order revoking the registrations of&nbsp;<span>Ted Brent Alexander</span>&nbsp;of Jackson, Mississippi. The CFTC filed a Notice of Intent to Revoke Registration Pursuant to Section 8a(2) of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) against Alexander on March 13, 2024. [See CFTC Press Release No.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8876-24">8876-24</a>]. The CFTC action is based on Alexander&rsquo;s guilty plea to conspiracy to commit wire fraud in a federal criminal case.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Case Background</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Alexander has been registered with the CFTC as a Commodity Trading Advisor (CTA) and Associated Person (AP) since October 2008. On April 26, 2003, Alexander pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud in&nbsp;<i>United States v. Alexander</i>, No. 3:20-cr-00031 (S.D. Miss.). On November 13, 2023, a judgment of conviction was entered against Alexander. Because Alexander&rsquo;s guilty plea involved a crime involving one or more of embezzlement, theft, fraud, fraudulent conversion, misappropriation of funds, securities or property, and/or false pretenses, federal commodity laws allow Alexander&rsquo;s registrations to be permanently revoked.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The CFTC&rsquo;s order finds that Alexander is subject to statutory disqualification from registration with the CFTC under Section 8a(2)(D)(iii) of the CEA and permanently revokes Alexander&rsquo;s registrations under the terms of the order.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Settlement Revokes Alexander&rsquo;s Registrations</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Alexander, who admits the charges in the Notice of Intent, consented to the entry of a CFTC order that revokes his registrations as a CTA and AP.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The Division of Enforcement (DOE) thanks the National Futures Association for its assistance in this matter.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>DOE staff responsible for this case are Eugenia Vroustouris and Rick Glaser.</span></span></p>

<li><span>Final&nbsp;draft regulatory technical standards specifying adjustment of own funds requirement and minimum features&nbsp;of stress testing programmes of issuers of asset-referenced tokens (ARTs) and of e-money tokens (EMTs) subject to such requirements.</span>&nbsp;These standards&nbsp;specify: i) the criteria for the assessment of&nbsp;&lsquo;higher degree of risk&rsquo;, ii) the procedure for competent authorities to determine the period of time considered appropriate for issuers to increase the own funds amount to the higher own funds requirements and the measures to be taken to ensure the timely compliance thereof and iii) a minimum set of requirements to issuers for the design and implementation of their stress-testing programmes.</li>
<li><span>Final draft regulatory technical standards specifying the procedure and timeframe for an issuer to adjust the amount of its own funds to 3% of the average amount of the reserve of assets</span>&nbsp;when the relevant issuer is issuing an ART or EMT classified as &lsquo;significant&rsquo;. Considering the feedback received on both RTSs, following the consultation period, the timeframe for the issuer to provide an implementation plan to increase the own funds requirements has been changed to 25 working days. Additionally, the maximum amount of time that the competent authority may grant to the issuer to comply with the plan has been adjusted upwards to 6 months maximum.</li>
<li><span>Final draft RTS further specifying the liquidity requirements of the reserve of assets.&nbsp;</span>The draft RTS set specific minimum percentages of the reserve of assets according to daily and weekly maturities. They also establish the minimum amount of deposits in each official currency referenced. Furthermore, they envisage overall techniques of liquidity management to seek minimum creditworthiness, liquidity soundness and minimum diversification of bank deposits counterparties in the reserve of assets as well as to ensure minimum overcollateralisation to seek correlation between the reserve of assets and the assets referenced.</li>
<li><span>Final draft RTS to specify the highly liquid financial instruments</span>.&nbsp;These draft RTS set the highest quality liquid assets in the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) as eligible highly liquid financial instruments. At the same time, and in order to seek for correlation between the highly liquid financial instruments and the assets referenced, in the case of ARTs referencing assets other than official currencies, financial instruments tracking the value of the assets referenced by the token or derivatives relating to them, are deemed eligible as highly liquid financial instruments. Furthermore, the draft RTS set concentration limits of highly liquid financial instruments by issuer.</li>
<li><span>Final draft RTS to specify the minimum content of the liquidity management policy and procedures.</span>&nbsp;These draft RTS envisage procedures for identifying, measuring and managing liquidity risk, a contingency policy and mitigation tools as well as minimum aspects of liquidity stress testing.</li>
<li><span>Guidelines on recovery plans&nbsp;</span>specifying the format and the content of the recovery plan that issuers need to develop and maintain. Considering the feedback received during the consultation period, the Guidelines further specify the content of the communication and disclosure plan. A number of targeted amendments were also made to streamline the wording and provide further clarity, inter alia by adding new definitions and by introducing a new paragraph to clarify that any provision regarding certain requirements applicable to the reserve of assets (e.g. certain recovery plan indicators and scenarios) does not apply to issuers of EMTs that are not subject to hold a reserve of assets in accordance with MiCAR.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Legal basis and next steps</h4>
<p>The&nbsp;<span>draft RTS relating to own funds</span>&nbsp;have been developed in close cooperation with the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the European Central Bank (ECB), in accordance with Article 35(6) and Article 45(7)(c) of Regulation (EU) 2023/1114 on Markets in Crypto-assets (MiCAR), and specify the procedure and timeframe for own funds adjustments.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<span>draft RTS on liquidity</span>&nbsp;have been developed, in close cooperation with ESMA and the ECB, to further specify the liquidity requirements of the reserve of assets, to specify the highly liquid financial instruments in the reserve of assets and to specify the minimum content of the liquidity management policy and procedures, in accordance with Articles 36(4), 38(5) and 45(7)(b) of MiCAR respectively.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<span>Guidelines on recovery plans&nbsp;</span>have been developed in accordance with&nbsp; Article 46(6) of MiCAR after consultation with ESMA. The Guidelines specify the format of the recovery plan and the information to be provided therein.</p>

<div> Securities and Exchange Commission, budget request, fiscal year 2025, capital markets, investment advisers<br />Summary:
SEC requests budget increase to match market growth, addresses need for additional resources in technology, real estate, and programmatic divisions. <div>
<p>Good morning, Chair Van Hollen, Ranking Member Hagerty, and members of the Subcommittee. Thank you for inviting me to testify today on the Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s Fiscal Year (FY) 2025 budget request. As is customary, I&rsquo;d like to note that my views are my own as Chair of the SEC, and I am not speaking on behalf of my fellow Commissioners or the SEC staff.</p>
<h2>The SEC at 90 Years</h2>
<p>At the SEC, we had our 90<span>th</span>&nbsp;birthday just one week ago.</p>
<p>After the 1929 market crash, President Franklin Roosevelt signed the first of the federal securities laws in 1933. He followed a year later with the passage of the Securities Exchange Act&mdash;making June 6, 1934, our birthday at the SEC.</p>
<p>The SEC was created to ensure that the markets worked free of fraud and manipulation&mdash;and that investment advisers carried their duties to the clients they advised.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Congress and Roosevelt understood how important our capital markets are to investors, issuers, and more broadly our economy. Today, the $110-plus trillion U.S. capital markets are the deepest, most liquid in the world. At 40 percent of the world&rsquo;s capital markets,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;they outpace our roughly 24 percent of the world&rsquo;s economy.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;The U.S. capital markets also play an integral role in the dollar&rsquo;s dominance.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>We cannot, however, take this leadership for granted.</p>
<p>The SEC is a remarkable agency. We serve investors building for a better future and issuers raising money to fund innovation, while overseeing the capital markets where they meet. The essence of this is captured in our three-part mission to protect investors, facilitate capital formation, and maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets.</p>
<p>The SEC is the cop on the beat watching out for the investing public and issuers. The dedicated staff of this agency does extraordinary work with limited resources.</p>
<h2>Growth and Change in the Markets</h2>
<p>Our limited resources contrast against the tremendous growth and change in our markets.</p>
<p>The U.S. capital markets benefit from significant engagement from everyday investors. About 58 percent of U.S. households own stocks, up from 52 percent in 2016.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;More than half of American households, representing nearly 121 million individual investors, own registered funds.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p>The U.S. has long benefitted from robust competition between nonbanks and banks. The Commission plays a key role in overseeing many aspects of the nonbank sector. Each of the registered funds and private funds sectors surpasses the size of the banking sector.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Further, U.S. debt capital markets facilitate 75 percent of debt financing of non-financial corporations. In Europe, the U.K., and Asia, only 12-29 percent is raised in capital markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p>Today, more than 15,400 registered investment advisers advise 57 million clients.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;This includes advising on more than $32 trillion in registered funds,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;$30 trillion in private funds,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;and nearly $50 trillion in separately managed accounts.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p>At the end of 2016, by comparison, 12,000 registered investment advisers advised 43 million clients.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></p>
<p>Let me put this in context. The entire U.S. banking system is $23 trillion.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;Thus, the capital markets are nearly five times the size of our banking sector.</p>
<p>The Commission has a role in both public and private markets, each of which offer investors and companies opportunities. Our public markets have approximately 7,400 actively reporting issuers, of which more than 4,000 companies list on U.S. exchanges.</p>
<p>We now oversee approximately 40,000 entities&mdash;including more than 13,000 registered funds, more than 15,400 investment advisers, more than 3,300 broker-dealers, 24 national securities exchanges, 103 alternative trading systems, 10 credit rating agencies, 33 self-regulatory organizations (SROs), and six active registered clearing agencies, among other external entities. The SEC oversees the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB), the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).</p>
<p>Technology is rapidly transforming markets and business models. These changes range from electronic trading and the cloud to artificial intelligence and predictive data analytics, just to name a few. There has been dynamic change in communications to and among investors, from Reddit forums to celebrity influencers. Further, we&rsquo;ve seen the Wild West of the crypto markets, rife with noncompliance, where investors have put hard-earned assets at risk in a highly speculative asset class. Many of those investments have disappeared after a crypto platform or service went under due to fraud or mismanagement, leaving investors in line at bankruptcy court.</p>
<p>Today, there are more than 54 million separately managed accounts; in 2018, there were 37 million.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>&nbsp;Transaction volume in listed equities has doubled in the last five years and tripled in the last 17 years.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></p>
<p>Such growth and rapid change also mean more possibility for wrongdoing. We&rsquo;ve seen the number of tips, complaints, and referrals we get at the SEC climb from about 16,700 in 2019 to more than 40,000 in 2023. As the cop on the beat, we must be able to meet the match of bad actors.</p>
<p>Despite the increasing workload, the SEC staff again has rated us among the best places to work in the federal government; this year, we ranked third among midsized agencies.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>&nbsp;Our attrition this fiscal year is at historically low levels, so far averaging around 3 percent at an annualized rate.</p>
<h2>Budget Request</h2>
<p>I am pleased to support the President&rsquo;s FY 2025 request of $2.594 billion for SEC operations in support of 5,621 positions and 5,073 full-time equivalents (FTEs). In addition, we&rsquo;ve requested $8.4 million for needs supporting General Services Administration (GSA)-led real estate projects. As this Committee considers this request, it&rsquo;s worth noting the SEC&rsquo;s funding is deficit-neutral; our appropriations are offset by transaction fees.</p>
<p>In the face of significant growth in registrants, complexity, and individual investor engagement in markets, one may have thought that our agency would have grown over the last eight years. Unfortunately, the reverse was the case&mdash;the SEC actually shrank between 2016 and 2022. With Congress&rsquo;s help, we were authorized to hire 400 people in FY 2023 to bring us just modestly above where we were in 2016. &nbsp;</p>
<p>While our funding was kept flat for FY 2024, the growth in market activity was anything but flat. We are losing pace with the ever-increasing scale of the capital markets we oversee.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Allow me to put flat funding into the context of the SEC&rsquo;s overall budget. Approximately 70 percent of our budget is for staff, about 15 percent is for technology, 5 percent is for facilities, and 10 percent is for everything else. This agency doesn&rsquo;t give out grants or other programmatic money. Thus, given year-over-year price and wage increases, flat funding means cutting staffing, technology, and real estate. &nbsp;</p>
<p>At the start of FY 2024, we paused on nearly all job postings and backfilling for departing staff. As a result, we are currently more than 300 positions below the level authorized by Congress for both FY 2023 and FY 2024.</p>
<p>While the agency&rsquo;s rules get outsized attention in the media, it&rsquo;s worthwhile noting that the vast majority of the SEC&rsquo;s staff works on day-to-day oversight of the markets and responding to public and registrant inquiries. We collectively review tens of thousands of filings a year.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>&nbsp;More than 10 percent of the agency reviews disclosure documents, more than half of the agency is within the Divisions of Enforcement and Examinations, and 13 percent of the agency is in support operations. Shrinking any of these efforts will inevitably mean that the agency will be less responsive to the public and less able to protect the public.</p>
<p>As it relates to technology, we cut IT spending by roughly a quarter in FY 2024. These reductions in technology spending will delay transitions to the cloud, investments in data analytics, modernizations of key systems, and important enhancements to our technology infrastructure. As a result, we are scaling back our technology programs at a time when the markets we oversee are growing more technologically complex with each passing year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As it relates to facilities, in fiscal years 2021 to 2024, we will have shed 275,000 usable square feet from the SEC&rsquo;s real estate footprint. This includes vacating one of our three headquarters buildings in Washington, D.C., at the end of FY 2023, resulting in approximately $14 million per year in savings. Furthermore, the SEC announced it will close our Salt Lake City office early in FY 2025.</p>
<p>As it relates to other expenses, we also have reduced spending on contracts that support mission critical efforts. An example includes our ability to update and improve the Division of Enforcement&rsquo;s document management and review systems&mdash;tools that are critical to reviewing massive document productions during the course of investigations and litigations.</p>
<p>If we are again flat funded, there will be significant further implications on our ability to monitor the markets, maintain SEC programs, adequately resource technology, and meet the agency&rsquo;s critical mission.</p>
<p>Without additional resources, the oversight of markets is at risk. Our ability to find bad actors is at risk. Our responsiveness to market participants is at risk. American capital formation and innovation are at risk as issuers will have to wait longer to hear from us.</p>
<p>The SEC currently has 30 Divisions and Offices across our 11 regional locations<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a>&nbsp;and Washington, D.C., headquarters. I&rsquo;m summarizing below the budget requests for our six Divisions and will briefly touch on technology and real estate. For further details as well as a review of the other offices of the SEC, please reference the FY 2025 Congressional Budget Justification.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<h2>Enforcement and Examinations</h2>
<p>As I mentioned, the Divisions of Enforcement and Examinations account for more than half of the SEC&rsquo;s staff. Without examination of our registrants and enforcement of rules and laws when they are broken, we can&rsquo;t instill the trust necessary for our markets to thrive. Stamping out fraud, manipulation, and abuse lowers risk in the system. It means that fewer bad actors will get away with misconduct. It protects investors and reduces the cost of capital. The whole economy benefits from that.</p>
<h3>Division of Enforcement</h3>
<p>As I noted, in FY 2023, the SEC received more than 40,000 separate tips, complaints, and referrals from whistleblowers and others, a 13 percent increase over FY 2022.</p>
<p>Even with limited resources, the Division brought 784 enforcement actions in FY 2023, a three percent increase over fiscal year 2022. When looking only at the 501 original, or &ldquo;stand-alone,&rdquo; enforcement actions we file&mdash;whether settled or litigated&mdash;it&rsquo;s an 8 percent increase over the prior fiscal year. Our actions resulted in orders for $4.9 billion in penalties and disgorgement. The SEC distributed $930 million to harmed investors in FY 2023.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, rapid technological innovation in the financial markets has led to misconduct in emerging and new areas, not least in the crypto space. Further, the complexity of the frauds we are investigating&mdash;and the sophistication of the fraudsters&mdash;is ever increasing.</p>
<p>Addressing this requires new tools, expertise, and resources. When the cars become faster and the highways more congested, you want more cops, not fewer.</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s request would grow the team by 27 FTEs to 1,447. The additional staff will provide the Division with more capacity to meet these challenges, investigate misconduct on a larger scale, accelerate the pace of enforcement investigations to resolution, and represent the Commission and protect investors in increasingly complex litigations.</p>
<h3>Division of Examinations</h3>
<p>The Division of Examinations serves a critical role in helping to ensure firms comply with the law.</p>
<p>In FY 2023, we conducted more than 3,100 examinations across our tens of thousands of registrants. From investment advisers to broker-dealers to exchanges, the Division helps ensure that registrants are following their legal obligations to customers and clients, including seniors and other vulnerable investors.</p>
<p>Importantly, the Division is the first line of defense for the investing public relying on investment advisers. It is responsible for examining and overseeing a growing registrant population, including more than 15,400 investment advisers and approximately 800 investment company complexes.</p>
<p>Further, we work in parallel with SROs to examine the more than 3,300 broker-dealers with roughly 150,000 branch offices.</p>
<p>This stretches thin the limited resources of the Division.</p>
<p>Our FY 2025 request would help the Division grow 20 FTE to reach 1,156 FTEs.</p>
<p>These additional resources are the minimum just for the Division to stay abreast of the growth in market participants and make key investments to help protect the American public regarding emerging cyber and information security risks.</p>
<h2>Programmatic Divisions</h2>
<p>Next, I will turn to our three programmatic Divisions.</p>
<h3>Corporation Finance</h3>
<p>The Division of Corporation Finance oversees the disclosures of new issuers and public companies so that investors can make informed investment decisions. It&rsquo;s important for investors to receive useful, timely, and accurate disclosure. It&rsquo;s important that issuers can get timely feedback on their registration statements and other filings. Today, there are more than 7,400 active reporting companies, up from about 6,800 in 2020.</p>
<p>In FY 2023, the Division reviewed the filings of more than 3,700 reporting companies and new issuers.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 2025 budget request would grow the team to 447 FTEs. With this increase of 16 FTEs, the Division would still be 30 FTEs under the 2016 level.</p>
<p>Additional resources would allow the Division to serve investors and issuers more ably as markets grow and evolve.</p>
<h3>Investment Management</h3>
<p>The Division of Investment Management oversees the 13,000 registered funds and 15,400 investment advisers that steward nest eggs for 57 million clients. At the end of 2016, by comparison, 12,000 registered investment advisers advised 43 million clients.</p>
<p>As noted earlier, both the registered funds market and the private funds market are each bigger than the banking sector, and we&rsquo;ve seen significant growth in both. More than half of American households, representing more than 115 million individual investors, own registered funds. When I started on Wall Street 45 years ago, household penetration was less than 6 percent.</p>
<p>In FY 2023, the Division reviewed more than 4,200 annual and periodic reports as well as more than 8,600 total portfolios and insurance contracts.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a></p>
<p>Given this growth in the markets, we&rsquo;ve asked to grow the division by nine FTEs to a total of 237.</p>
<h3>Trading and Markets</h3>
<p>The Division of Trading and Markets serves on the front line for maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets. Market monitoring and supervision are essential parts of the Division&rsquo;s activity&mdash;especially during times of market stress.</p>
<p>The Division oversees 24 national securities exchanges, 103 alternative trading systems, more than 3,300 broker-dealers, 51 security-based swap dealers, six active registered clearing agencies, and more than 200 transfer agents, among other entities.</p>
<p>In FY 2023, the Division responded to more than 16,000 public inquiries. In FY 2023, the Division also reviewed more than 660 filings of broker-dealers as well as more than 1,700 SRO proposed rule changes and advance notices.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a></p>
<p>As market centers, broker-dealers, and clearance and settlement systems continue to grow in size and activity, so does the need for robust supervision of these entities and intermediaries.</p>
<p>In FY 2025, we&rsquo;ve requested 14 additional FTEs, for a total of 293, to support this important function of the Commission.</p>
<h3>Economic and Risk Analysis</h3>
<p>Economic analysis is critical to all of the agency&rsquo;s work. The Division of Economic and Risk Analysis provides impartial economic analyses that consider the costs and benefits of our rules as well as their effects on efficiency, competition, and capital formation.</p>
<p>We get feedback from the public on these economic analyses, which benefits our rulemaking. Our economic analyses also benefit the markets broadly because making data available creates a public good.</p>
<p>In the Enforcement context, the Division&rsquo;s staff is instrumental in assisting Enforcement staff with identifying potential wrongdoing, assessing ill-gotten gains, and working to return funds to harmed investors.</p>
<p>DERA assists the Commission in its efforts to identify, analyze, and respond to economic and market issues, including those related to new financial products, investment and trading strategies, systemic risk, and fraud.</p>
<p>Given the critical nature of the Division&rsquo;s work, for FY 2025, we&rsquo;ve asked for funding to support 196 FTEs total, just one additional FTE.</p>
<h2>Additional Matters</h2>
<h3>Technology</h3>
<p>Technology and data continue to fuel rapid change in our markets. The rise of big data, algorithms, and AI in our markets has put more pressure than ever on the SEC to keep pace. For example, the data processing by the Division of Enforcement alone has grown 20 percent year over year for the last three years. Cyber threats represent an ever-increasing threat to the agency and our markets alike. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet, as I mentioned, the SEC is cutting its IT program by about a quarter this fiscal year because of budget pressures. We have had to delay technology upgrades, some migrations to the cloud, and enhancements in data analytics.&nbsp; For example, we cut back significantly our investments in Enforcement case management; Enforcement, Exams, and DERA analytics capabilities; implementation of the government-wide Zero Trust security program; and the workflow system supporting the Division of Corporation Finance&rsquo;s disclosure review program. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus, we have requested $457 million for information technology. This would help support the Commission&rsquo;s cybersecurity, migration to the cloud, modernization of key systems like EDGAR, implementation of the Financial Data Transparency Act, and other critical IT needs. This request assumes full use of an additional $50 million from the SEC Reserve Fund for multi-year IT projects and programs. To put these figures in context, this spending is dwarfed by what some of the biggest market participants spend in a month on technology.</p>
<h3>Facilities</h3>
<p>We currently have offices in Washington, D.C., and 11 regional offices. The total facilities cost in FY 2024 is only 5 percent of our budget. We continue to work with GSA to manage it prudently, significantly reducing our space footprint as I described earlier.</p>
<p>Part of the SEC&rsquo;s FY 2025 request is $8.4 million for lease procurements managed by GSA. This amount represents the additional funds needed for GSA&rsquo;s recompete of the lease for the SEC&rsquo;s Chicago Regional Office.</p>
<p>We will continue looking for opportunities to achieve cost savings across our leasing footprint in the years to come.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The U.S. capital markets are the deepest, most liquid in the world. We cannot, however, take this leadership for granted. The SEC needs to be funded to meet the match of the growing and evolving markets we oversee. I thank the Committee for providing me the opportunity to summarize this budget request.</p>
<p>I am pleased to take your questions.</p>

Summary: <div>
<p>Thank you, Chairman Van Hollen, Ranking Member Hagerty, and members of the Subcommittee.&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate the opportunity to testify before you today on the President&rsquo;s fiscal year 2025 budget request for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC or Commission).</p>
<p>For over a century, derivatives markets have played a key role in the U.S. economy, promoting economic growth and contributing to financial stability and the predictability of prices that impact the daily lives of all Americans.&nbsp;&nbsp;This October, the CFTC will commemorate its 50th&nbsp;anniversary as an independent agency with exclusive jurisdiction over futures trading in&nbsp;all<i>&nbsp;</i>commodities.&nbsp;&nbsp;This milestone provides a natural inflection point as we consider how the past 50 years will impact the next.</p>
<p>Over the last nearly 15 years, I have witnessed the massive expansion of the CFTC&rsquo;s jurisdiction through Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act, organic growth in our historic markets, the introduction of new products, including the digital commodity asset class, and the significant expansion of market participants, both institutional and retail as a result of technological disruption.&nbsp;&nbsp;To put a number on it, trading volumes in exchange-traded futures and options have more than doubled; and the swaps market is now over $350 trillion,<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam47?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;which is approximately half of the estimated $715 trillion global market.&nbsp;&nbsp;Given this exponential global growth, and working individually, through our operating divisions, and the Office of International Affairs (OIA), I have prioritized a collaborative working relationship with our domestic and international regulatory partners to ensure regulatory harmonization, market efficiency, and reducing unintended and negative consequences to U.S. derivatives markets.</p>
<p>As Chairman, I am focused on: identifying and addressing regulatory gaps and uncertainty; strengthening the agency organizationally so that we are an operationally effective, diverse, and competitively attractive employer; better understanding and incorporating the digital asset ecosystem and&nbsp;artificial intelligence (AI)&nbsp;into our decision making; and addressing the need for guidance regarding emerging product and market structures such as voluntary carbon credit (VCC) derivative contracts and vertical integration.</p>
<p>Today, technology is driving change in the financial markets, and the CFTC must keep pace in order to fulfill its mission and Congressional mandate.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our work centers on customer protection and market resiliency, while supporting continued growth and innovation that will take the agency into the next 50 years.</p>
<p>To date, and thanks to my fellow Commissioners and the incredibly hardworking staff of the CFTC, the agency has stayed on course following an agenda I outlined in early 2023 to consider and vote on roughly 30 new regulatory and policy matters in addition to all proposed rules and orders from the prior year.&nbsp;&nbsp;I bucketed these actions into themes that address:&nbsp;risk management and resilience; customer protections; efficiency and innovation; reporting and data policy; duplicative regulatory requirements; and international comity.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fundamental to&nbsp;all of these themes is the need to update our ruleset to address the derivatives industry&rsquo;s current course, which is driven by technology and seeks to both leverage and, in some instances, move away from traditional and familiar models.&nbsp;&nbsp;The dominant disruptors of our current era raise important questions about conflicts of interest, the strength of capital, margin, and segregation requirements, the role and responsibilities of self-regulatory organizations, affiliate risk management and customer protections.</p>
<p>As the CFTC&rsquo;s Chairman, I have made very conscious and intentional decisions aimed at ensuring that we not only exemplify good stewardship of taxpayer dollars, but also provide genuine organizational support for our valued employees.&nbsp;&nbsp;My first priority as Chairman included directing an agency-wide strategic approach to human capital management focused on rebalancing and upskilling our workforce through succession planning and building a bench of future expertise that brings diversity of thought, experience, and background.&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been over four years since our people left the confines of their offices and we assumed an expansive telework posture.&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that while we have been productive and achieved success in certain mission critical functions, we are keenly aware of the benefits of being together in person in the office.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, we have heard from some of our staff and supervisors their desire to return to the office.&nbsp;&nbsp;A resolution to the impasse in our negotiations will allow staff to plan their lives accordingly.&nbsp;&nbsp;The CFTC has always been a place that valued its peoples&rsquo; needs to balance work and home life, and we will continue to do so as we negotiate the next steps.</p>
<p>In addition, I have led reforms in how the Commission collects, interprets and reports on market data. This data connects our infrastructure, security, surveillance, analytical, and enforcement needs and duties, and will significantly impact how we meet our mission in the tech-driven future.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam47?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2">[2]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The CFTC has, under my direction, moved to the cloud, achieved significant advancement in cybersecurity protections, reorganized, increased the visibility of, and added new leaders to, our Division of Data (DOD)&mdash;including our first Chief Data Scientist who will lead our AI training and implementation-- and launched a CFTC-wide technical training initiative.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our goal is the long game: building capabilities over time towards organizational maturity and technical achievement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, I am proud to say that under my direction, the CFTC&rsquo;s new AI Task Force issued a request for comment (RFC) on the use of AI in CFTC-regulated markets.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam47?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3">[3]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The AI RFC is part of a greater vision to advance analytical capabilities through building talent, leveraging the cloud, and developing a forward-looking culture.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a process in place for exploring AI use cases to&nbsp;help the agency better monitor, regulate, surveil, identify pockets of stress, and enforce compliance.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are currently reviewing the RFC comments to better understand what, if any, policy changes are needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, the Office of Customer Education and Outreach (OCEO), the agency&rsquo;s education arm, issued a Customer Advisory in January warning the public about emerging AI-driven fraud and scams.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam47?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4">[4]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Consistent with mandates by the Administration and OMB guidance, I recently announced that our Chief Data Officer and DOD Director will serve as the CFTC&rsquo;s first Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer responsible for&nbsp;promoting the agency&rsquo;s use of AI and guide us in managing AI risks.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam47?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5">[5]</a></p>
<p>Said a bit differently, my goal is to modernize the CFTC to ensure our continued success well into the future. We are seeing changes in market structure and in the demographics of market participants.&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that institutions, products, and processes that prove valuable enough to producers, consumers, investors, and the general public&mdash;however such value is determined&mdash;will inevitably find a way to integrate with established regulatory systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is our role to ensure market safety and integrity by enforcing existing standards under our governing statute and regulations, and by determining new approaches when warranted and consistent with the law.</p>
<p>The proposed budget before you today reflects the minimum resources needed for the CFTC to perform its role as the primary regulator of the U.S. futures, swaps, and options markets, and to properly enforce the law to protect markets and market participants.&nbsp;&nbsp;It provides the resources we absolutely need to ensure that the agency has the appropriate and necessary capabilities to keep up with technological innovation shaping our markets in 2024 and beyond.&nbsp;&nbsp;It optimizes resources to ensure the protection of the market data we receive and keeps the agency&rsquo;s systems and infrastructure shielded from emerging risks and cyber threats. It funds oversight and surveillance responsibilities generated by an increasing number of derivatives exchanges offering products that require consideration of new and emerging risks.&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the budget&nbsp;ensures that our enforcement program continues its proactive approach in identifying and addressing misconduct within our ever expanding and transforming markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is especially critical in light of growing retail participation and the need for greater protections in the digital asset space.&nbsp;&nbsp;The planned prioritization in these areas will help the CFTC fulfill its mission in a rapidly changing marketplace.</p>
<p>The CFTC&rsquo;s Budget Request for Fiscal Year 2025</p>
<p>The Commission is requesting a total of $399 million and 725 FTE for FY 2025.&nbsp;&nbsp;The request for its operational budget was developed with the &ldquo;Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023&rdquo; in mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;With the understanding that the budgetary challenges we are currently addressing will likely bleed into the coming year, and that some difficult decisions will be made, we have sought to focus on the most critical areas to reach this number that represents about a 2.9 percent decrease below the FY 2024 budget request, and just over a nine percent increase above the FY 2023 and 2024 enacted budget.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Division of Enforcement (DOE)</p>
<p>The Commission requests $74 million and 163 FTE to protect the public and preserve market integrity by detecting, investigating, and prosecuting violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and Commission regulations through the activities of its Division of Enforcement. This is an increase of $5.5 million over the FY 2024 enacted budget.</p>
<p>The Commission&rsquo;s exercise of its enforcement authorities to address misconduct that has a direct impact on CFTC jurisdictional markets, affects the larger economy, causes public harm, or interferes with market integrity is one facet of our approach to innovation and the evolution of financial markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;This increase will, among other things, support the development of innovative approaches utilizing cutting edge technologies and upskilling of Commission staff with the goal of identifying misconduct earlier and addressing bad actors expediently.</p>
<p>A review of the filings for FY 2024 demonstrates that while digital asset related cases are rightfully demanding significant attention,<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam47?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6">[6]</a>&nbsp;DOE is ensuring that we take necessary action in all of our directly regulated markets and in the retail fraud space involving precious metals and forex (foreign exchange).&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also building even stronger networks and partnerships through cooperative enforcement efforts with other civil and criminal agencies domestically and internationally.&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the matters that have stood out this fiscal year, several in the agricultural, energy, and financial sectors exemplify our unwavering commitment to ensuring that registrants meet their regulatory obligations, that customers receive the protections they deserve, that our markets remain free from manipulation and fraud, and that misconduct in the digital asset space receives swift attention.</p>
<p>Nowhere have we been more active than in the digital asset space.&nbsp;&nbsp;In FY 2023, we&nbsp;brought 47 actions involving conduct related to digital commodities, representing more than 49 percent of all CFTC actions filed during that period.&nbsp;&nbsp;A staggering statistic given the fact that no federal agency retains any direct regulatory authority over the underlying (or cash) digital commodity asset market.&nbsp;&nbsp;We can only act on digital asset fraud or manipulation when we uncover or discover anomalies through regulated market surveillance and oversight, or through tips and complaints we can pursue. With many agency resources which are not considered in our budget appropriation being allocated to an unregulated market, I fear the current trajectory is unsustainable.&nbsp;&nbsp;Namely, we will continue to see rampant fraud and manipulation in the digital asset market that will hurt American customers, and possibly infect the traditional financial markets.</p>
<p>To date, FY 2024 is demonstrating a similar cadence.&nbsp;The lack of legislation addressing the regulatory gap over the digital commodity asset spot market has not hindered the public&rsquo;s enthusiasm for digital assets, and I continue to believe Congress must act, as the 2022 FSOC (Financial Stability Oversight Council) report highlighted<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam47?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7">[7]</a>, and as I have mentioned publicly on multiple occasions.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam47?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8">[8]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Until such time, the Commission will continue to use its expertise and the tools it has to protect our markets and the public.</p>
<p>Division of Market Oversight (DMO)</p>
<p>The Commission requests $36 million and 88 FTE for the Division of Market Oversight to continue its commitment to maintaining the integrity of the markets as it reviews new applications and monitors ongoing compliance with core principles and regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>DMO is expecting growth in 2024 and 2025 given the growing interest in offering novel, innovative, and increasingly complex products. Currently, there are seven exchange or DCM (designated contract market) applications in review.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each registration application requires both intra-divisional and inter-divisional teams of staff to review the application and the applicant&rsquo;s planned operations, and determine compliance with the CEA and Commission regulations.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Division will need to train and dedicate additional staff to registrations as the number and variability of applicants continues to grow.</p>
<p>In FY 2025, the Commission&rsquo;s system safeguards examinations&mdash;an essential component of the examination program for DCMs, SEFs (swap execution facilities), and SDRs (swap data repositories)&mdash;will remain crucial to economic stability. Effective cybersecurity practices and system safeguards of regulated entities requires increased direct surveillance and vigilance for the scope of examinations conducted each year.</p>
<p>With respect to rule and product filings, in FY 2023, the Commission continued to receive a diverse array of product filings from exchanges seeking to meet market participants&rsquo; varying needs, including many innovative products. The number of filings and the diversity of product offerings require additional resources to ensure Division staff can complete their reviews, and stay abreast of market developments and the technological advancements underlying these new products and attendant rules.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example,&nbsp;since 2021, there has been a significant uptick in the number of event contracts listed for trading by CFTC-registered exchanges.&nbsp;&nbsp;From 2006 through 2020, DCMs listed for trading an average of approximately five event contracts a year. In 2021, this number increased to 131, and the number of newly-listed event contracts per year has remained at a similar level in subsequent years.</p>
<p>With respect to rulemakings, in FY 2024 the Division continues to plan and undertake rulemakings to amend Commission rules, as appropriate, to address changes in the constantly evolving derivatives markets. The Division expects efforts in proposing, adopting, and implementing rules to ensure the Commission&rsquo;s regulatory framework keeps pace with recent market innovations, to continue in FY 2025.</p>
<p>Division of Clearing and Risk (DCR)</p>
<p>Market events and the volatility in the global financial markets linked to geopolitical issues, continued pandemic recovery and reformation, weather and climate-related risk, and monetary and fiscal policy consistently raise challenges related to liquidity and margin requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;These factors also fuel active debate on the need for additional tools and resources to manage risks, including collateral management.&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the importance of clearing to the financial system, and the role of U.S.-regulated central counterparties (CCPs) as among the strongest in the world, the Commission requests $35.6 million and 86 FTE for the Division of Clearing and Risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;These funds are necessary to maintain current capabilities and expand examination and surveillance of activities that will impact clearing markets, credit, liquidity, and modeling risks, enhance cyber and operational resilience, and support the safety and soundness of derivatives clearing organizations (DCOs).</p>
<p>Currently, the CFTC has ten registered DCOs in the United States, including two DCOs that have been designated as systemically important by FSOC. In addition, the Commission regulates five registered DCOs located outside the United States, including some that have a direct impact on U.S. markets, given the volume of swaps and futures cleared for U.S. entities.&nbsp;&nbsp;DCO examinations, which are time and staff resource intensive, help the Commission identify issues that may affect a DCO&rsquo;s ability to identify, manage, and monitor its risks. DCOs represent single critical points of managing risk in the global financial system where the failure or disruption to the functioning of these DCOs could create or increase the risk of liquidity or credit problems spreading among other financial institutions.</p>
<p>There are four DCOs outside the United States exempted from registration by the Commission that are permitted to clear proprietary swap transactions for U.S. entities. Although the CFTC relies principally on foreign authorities for oversight, it does engage in limited monitoring and surveillance of these exempt DCOs. The Commission maintains an active, data-driven quantitative risk surveillance function. It expects to continue investing additional resources in human capital, data, and technology to improve its current analytical capabilities and keep up with growth in both the scale and complexity of risk transmission in the derivatives markets - both cleared and uncleared.</p>
<p>Market Participants Division (MPD)</p>
<p>The Commission requests $28.5 million and 69 FTE&nbsp;for the Market Participants Division to maintain effective oversight of registered market participants using current delegated authorities and improved cooperative oversight policies.&nbsp;&nbsp;The CFTC oversees the registration and compliance of thousands of derivatives market participants, including swap dealers (SDs), major swap participants (MSPs), Futures Commissioners Merchants (FCMs), retail foreign exchange dealers (RFEDs), introducing brokers (IBs), commodity trading advisors (CTAs), commodity pool operators (CPOs), floor brokers, and floor traders. MPD also oversees the self-regulatory organizations (SROs), including the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the National Futures Association (NFA), by assessing whether the SROs&rsquo; compliance programs over member firms meet established regulatory standards.</p>
<p>Regulated market participants are a cornerstone of the Commission&rsquo;s regulatory framework. To date, 62 registered FCMs hold more than $474 billion in customer funds, and 106 registered SDs collectively transact hundreds of trillions in notional value swap contracts annually, serving as a vital source of liquidity for financial institutions and commercial end users seeking to hedge their risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, the CFTC directs its registration and compliance resources to provide critical policy and regulatory guidance to registered market participants, both directly and in coordination with the SROs. In addition, the Commission oversees the National Futures Association (NFA) in its role implementing delegated authorities to register and oversee compliance by registered market participants. The Commission ensures that registration rules, standards, and reporting requirements continue to be responsive to the needs of the evolving marketplace.</p>
<p>Division of Data</p>
<p>The Division of Data develops and implements the CFTC&rsquo;s enterprise data strategy, providing the specialized technical, analytical, and related services necessary for the Commission to standardize, acquire, process, examine, govern and exploit mission critical market and industry data.&nbsp;&nbsp;As the agency&rsquo;s designated authority on data issues, DOD provides CFTC regulatory and enforcement staff with the data and analytical capabilities needed to perform mission work, develops and oversees data sharing and protection agreements with external entities, and enables policymakers to make data-driven decisions for overseeing the U.S. derivative markets. In accordance with this mission, the responsibilities of DOD include establishing the Commission&rsquo;s data strategy, data standards, data architecture and governance, and building/maintaining the agency&rsquo;s core data infrastructure.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission requests $42.1 million and 41 FTE to continue leveraging cloud and other new technology to enhance and transform its ability to collect, analyze and draw informed conclusions from market data to both conduct and support effective enforcement actions, oversee rapidly evolving markets, and formulate sound regulatory policy.</p>
<p>Whistleblower Incentives and Protection</p>
<p>A key to the effectiveness of our enforcement division is the CFTC&rsquo;s whistleblower program.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dodd-Frank Act established the Customer Protection Fund<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam47?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9">[9]</a>&nbsp;that supports our Whistleblower Program<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam47?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10">[10]</a>&nbsp;and the OCEO.&nbsp;As of FY 2023, the Whistleblower program has issued 41 orders granting awards totaling almost $350 million since its inception in FY 2010.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam47?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11">[11]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;In fiscal year 2024, the program has, thus far, awarded $18 million to whistleblowers.&nbsp;&nbsp;The total sanctions ordered in all whistleblower-related enforcement actions has surpassed the $3 billion milestone.</p>
<p>As this Committee knows, the overwhelming success of the Whistleblower Program has unintentionally led to the potential for disruptions in these two vital offices due to their funding mechanisms.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the importance of a long-term fix to avoid depletions greater than the total balance of the fund,&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;believe Congress should amend the statutory provisions to clarify the permitted uses of the Customer Protection Fund by the OCEO.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam47?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12">[12]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;This change would allow the Commission to implement a host of new investor protection programs and provide information aimed at ensuring American families have the knowledge and tools to not only protect themselves from fraud and manipulation, but to more fully engage with the Commission and the markets we oversee.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>I know I speak for all the Commissioners when I thank CFTC staff for their commitment to the agency and its mission.&nbsp;&nbsp;My team and I are working closely with staff and their union representatives in order to find a suitable work posture, post-pandemic, that honors the importance of being present and together in the office with appropriate flexibility, and ensures our accountability as good stewards of taxpayer money.&nbsp;&nbsp;The agency&rsquo;s long-term health and success depend on it.</p>
<p>As we move through 2024, I am proud of the CFTC&rsquo;s undeniable record of using regulation, innovation, and collaboration to ensure our markets function well, and of providing risk management and transparency for all stakeholders, including, most notably, America&rsquo;s commercial end-users who rely on derivatives markets to manage risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;More than ever, in these uncertain times both domestically and internationally, we need thorough and thoughtful regulation to ensure confidence and accountability in the derivatives markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;To continue delivering results to the derivatives markets and American public, we need consistency and certainty so that we can allocate resources towards critical and multi-year investments.</p>
<p>Thank you again for the opportunity to appear before you today.&nbsp;&nbsp;I look forward to your questions.</p>

<div> municipal, corporate, CUSIP, issuance, volume
Summary: Municipal CUSIP issuance surged in May, while corporate volumes remained steady. International debt CUSIP requests saw a significant increase. <div>
<p align="left"><a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=8Y6jULk71JCJVWAHccbE23Hd8yr6H9OVDOO4qu1xfmOcFwR0IRnsdOQKRp2sDwWYBjqHD6gGFZW4UBqRidJGNeFLHJGnmAN6TK0q3KIK-k8NHQQW4HXreypGLgJ_QpaT" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="CUSIP Global Services">CUSIP Global Services</a>&nbsp;(CGS) today announced the release of its CUSIP Issuance Trends Report for May 2024. The report, which tracks the issuance of new security identifiers as an early indicator of debt and capital markets activity over the next quarter, found a fourth-consecutive monthly increase in request volume for new municipal identifiers, while corporate volumes were steady overall.</p>
<p>North American corporate requests totaled 7,362 in May, which is down 3.2% on a monthly basis. On a year-over-year basis, North American corporate requests closed the month up 10.2%. The monthly volume decline was driven by a decrease in issuance volume for medium term notes. Other key asset classes, such as U.S. corporate equity (13.5%), U.S. corporate debt (17.8%) and Canadian corporate securities (17.9%) all saw monthly request volume increases.</p>
<p>The aggregate total of identifier requests for new municipal securities &ndash; including municipal bonds, long-term and short-term notes, and commercial paper &ndash; rose 51.5% versus April totals. On a year-over-year basis, overall municipal volumes are up 8.4%. Texas led state-level municipal request volume with a total of 143 new CUSIP requests in May, followed by New York (102) and California (90).</p>
<p>&ldquo;New issuance activity in the municipals space has been consistently high for the past four months, but we saw a major surge in the May data,&rdquo; said Gerard Faulkner, Director of Operations for CGS. &ldquo;Similarly in the corporate asset classes, we see pockets of high volume in U.S. corporate debt and equity, Canadian corporates and certificates of deposit, all of which points to issuers finding opportunity to bring new securities to market in the current economic cycle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Requests for international equity CUSIPs rose 5.1% in May and international debt CUSIP requests rose 19.0%. On an annualized basis, international equity CUSIP requests are down 4.4% and international debt CUSIP requests are up 106.5%.</p>

<div> platform, portfolio trade, tax-exempt municipal bonds, efficiency, electronic marketplaces
Summary:
MarketAxess introduces portfolio trading tool for tax-exempt municipal bonds, allowing efficient negotiation and execution for up to 1,500 unique CUSIPs. Growing market share and automated execution suite. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>MarketAxess Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: MKTX), the operator of a leading electronic trading platform for fixed-income securities, today announced the platform&rsquo;s first ever portfolio trade for tax-exempt municipal bonds. The portfolio trade was executed earlier this month between a large bank and a large asset manager.</p>
<p>The new Portfolio Trading for Tax-Exempt Munis tool allows clients to send lists to multiple counter-parties or a single dealer, negotiating price improvements and trading discreetly on a diversified basket of Tax-Exempt Munis in one singular point of transaction. Clients can load portfolio trades manually or utilize straight-through-processing via their OMS. Once loaded, clients can see instantly the changes in portfolio metrics, any impact on the portfolio&rsquo;s overall market value and utilize MarketAxess&rsquo; technology to make split-second decisions on portfolio composition and pricing. During the portfolio negotiation process, clients also have the option to counter or remove individual line items for optimal execution.</p>
<p>Daniel Kelly, Head of Municipal Securities at MarketAxess, commented, &ldquo;The portfolio trading tool was among the most requested enhancements to our Municipal bond franchise. Now muni traders can finally experience the same efficiency their counterparts in the corporate bond market have enjoyed for years&mdash;the flexibility to negotiate on individual line items without sacrificing certainty of execution for up to 1,500 unique CUSIPs in a single transaction.</p>
<p>With the launch of our automated execution suite of tools for munis last year and now, portfolio trading&mdash;we are proud to be delivering the innovation municipal market participants have asked for, and needed, to effectively scale their businesses,&rdquo; he continued.</p>
<p>MarketAxess is one of the fastest growing electronic marketplaces for muni bonds. Last month, MarketAxess accounted for 8.1% estimated market share of municipal bonds&mdash;up from 5.6% the year prior&mdash;and representing $577 million in average daily volumes.</p>

<br />
Brickken, a Barcelona-based startup, joins the European Commission's Regulatory Sandbox to collaborate with regulators, expand its market, and revolutionize tokenization.
<br /><br />Summary: Brickken, a Barcelona-based startup, is selected for the European Commission's Regulatory Sandbox to collaborate with regulators and expand its market. <div>
<ul>
<li>This regulatory sandbox, driven by the European Commission, fosters a secure and reliable environment where blockchain technology providers and regulators can collaborate and reach agreements.</li>
<li>The Spanish startup, which has already tokenized assets worth 200 million euro, continues to lead the tokenization path following its recent inclusion in PwC's digital assets program and its partnerships with industry leaders such as Chainlink, Psalion and Keyrock among others.</li>
<li>Coinbase will work with Brickken and each of the partners engaging the European Commission sandbox to help shape best practices for institutions to engage in products safely and securely onchain.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Brickken, a Barcelona-based startup pioneering in the tokenization of real-world assets, announced today its selection to participate in the European Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) Regulatory Sandbox. This regulatory sandbox will provide legal certainty for decentralized technological solutions, including blockchain, by identifying deployment obstacles from a legal and regulatory perspective. Additionally, it will offer legal advice, regulatory expertise, and guidance in a secure and confidential environment.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The program, driven by the European Commission, will enable regulators and supervisors to enhance their understanding of the latest blockchain technologies and share best practices through ongoing dialogue between public institutions and private entities such as Brickken.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>With its inclusion in the European Regulatory Sandbox, Brickken will be able to develop and optimize its solutions within a secure environment, boosting its acceptance among institutional clients, market operators, and bond issuers, thereby facilitating its entry into new markets. Brickken aims to become a strategic ally for various capital market players, maximizing their operational efficiency and fostering technological synergy in digital asset management.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Edwin Mata, CEO and co-founder of Brickken, expressed his enthusiasm about the selection, stating: "</span><span>This opportunity validates our innovative approach to asset tokenization and also allows us to collaborate with regulators and other industry leaders to build a stronger and more reliable blockchain ecosystem. The experience and knowledge we gain in this regulatory sandbox will be invaluable for our future growth and success</span><span>."</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Brickken&rsquo;s inclusion in this sandbox represents another milestone in its mission to revolutionize the tokenization industry. Just one week ago, the startup announced its selection for the Scale program for tokenization and digital assets by the international consultancy PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), marking another step towards the adoption of blockchain by institutional clients, banks, and capital m</span><span>arkets. Furthermore, the company has secured partnerships with industry giants&nbsp;</span><span>such as Psalion and Chainlink, the world's leading real-world asset tokenization technology, used by global financial institutions</span><span>.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Brickken and Coinbase will combine their expertise to advance best practices for infrastructure and market structure powering the tokenization of real-world assets. Brickken brings their know-how in tokenization and technology, and will build solutions on infrastructure supported by Coinbase such as Wallet and Base.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Founded in Barcelona in 2020 by Edwin Mata, Yassir Haouati, Bram Duindam, and Dario Lo Buglio, Brickken is experiencing rapid growth. It is now active in over 14 countries, has tokenized more than 200 million euro in assets, boasts over 50 clients, and has seen a growth rate of over 100% compared to the previous year. The company is now addressing new verticals that are open to the solutions offered by Brickken.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>This company's digital asset platform specializes in the tokenization of financial instruments like equity and debt, regardless of the company's size, asset type, or jurisdiction. It provides robust technological support for anyone looking to enter the market without the need to develop their technology, as they can rely on Brickken's infrastructure, which offers a frictionless entry. This enables them to serve a wide range of sectors, including real estate, startups, institutions, venture capital funds, and Family Offices, allowing them to efficiently digitize and manage their assets.</span></p>

<title>Retail Investors Bullish On Gold And Silver In May: Spectrum Markets</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li>Spectrum's European retail investor sentiment indicator shows bullish behaviour on gold and silver</li>
<li>Sentiment suggests retail investors saw a buying opportunity as gold prices dipped in May</li>
<li>Retail investor sentiment has remained bullish on silver since its introduction on Spectrum in December 2023</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spectrum Markets (&ldquo;Spectrum&rdquo;), the pan-European trading venue designed for retail investors, has published its SERIX sentiment data for European retail investors for May, revealing bullish trading behaviour for both available precious metal underlyings, gold and silver.</p>
<p>Gold prices fluctuated in May, peaking at $2,449 per ounce by 20<sup>th</sup> May before dropping to $2,325 towards the end of the month<a href="file://C:/Users/Herbie%20Skeete/Downloads/Spectrum%20Markets_European%20Retail%20Investors%20bullish%20on%20Gold%20and%20Silver%20in%20May.docx#_ftn1">[1]</a>. This dip created a buying opportunity for investors and was likely a key driver of the bullish SERIX sentiment of 104.</p>
<p>Silver also reached a record high of $32.391 per ounce by the end of May<a href="file://C:/Users/Herbie%20Skeete/Downloads/Spectrum%20Markets_European%20Retail%20Investors%20bullish%20on%20Gold%20and%20Silver%20in%20May.docx#_ftn2">[2]</a>. However, retail investors remained bullish, with the SERIX for silver closing at 108 points for the month. Since Spectrum introduced products with silver as an underlying asset to trade in December 2023 in response to investor demand, sentiment towards the precious metal has been consistently bullish, starting with a peak SERIX value of 125 points.</p>
<p>The SERIX value indicates retail investor sentiment, with a number above 100 marking bullish sentiment, and a number below 100 indicating bearish sentiment. (See below for more information on the methodology).</p>
<h4><b>Market opinion</b></h4>
<p>&ldquo;Despite the SERIX sentiment on gold indicating tactical buying behaviour from retail investors, the SERIX on silver tells a different story, aligning with its high market price,&rdquo; says Michael Hall, Head of Distribution at Spectrum Markets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While the performance of gold is strongly connected with currencies and interest rates, the SERIX sentiment indicator suggests European retail investors track the silver market based on rising demand patterns. This increasing demand is driven in part by the search for alternative energy solutions, as silver is essential in photovoltaic panels, which convert sunlight into electricity,&rdquo; adds Michael Hall.</p>
<h4><b>Spectrum&rsquo;s May data</b></h4>
<p>In May 2024, order book turnover on Spectrum was &euro;246.7 million, with 36% of trades taking place outside of traditional hours (i.e., between 17:30 and 9:00 CET).</p>
<p>70.5% of the order book turnover was on indices, 16.8% on commodities, 5.4% on equities, 3.6% on currency pairs, and 3.7% on cryptocurrencies, with the top three traded underlying markets being DAX 40 (25.1%), NASDAQ 100 (24.9%), and DOW 30 (9%).</p>
<p>Looking at the SERIX data for the top three underlying markets, the DAX 40 sentiment decreased from 101 to a bearish 98. Similarly, the NASDAQ 100 dropped from 101 to 99 and the DOW 30 fell from 103 to 99 this month.</p>

<div>
<p align="center"><b>Calculating SERIX data</b></p>
<p>The Spectrum European Retail Investor Index (SERIX), uses the trading venue&rsquo;s pan-European trading data to shed light on investor sentiment towards current development in financial markets.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The index is calculated on a monthly basis by analysing retail investor trades placed and subtracting the proportion of bearish trades from the proportion of bullish trades, to give a single figure (rebased at 100) that indicates the strength and direction of sentiment:</p>
<p align="center"><i>SERIX = (% bullish trades - % bearish trades) + 100</i></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;<span>Trades where long instruments are bought and trades where short instruments are sold are both considered bullish trades, while trades where long instruments are sold and trades where short instruments are bought are considered bearish trades. Trades that are matched by retail clients are disregarded.

<div> Securities Commission Malaysia, Practical Guide, Venture Capital, Private Equity, Malaysia

The Securities Commission Malaysia issued a Practical Guide to provide knowledge on VC and PE in Malaysia, aiming to support investment and innovation. <div>
<p>The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) today issued the first edition of the &lsquo;Practical Guide on Venture Capital and Private Equity in Malaysia&rsquo; (Guide) in Malaysia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Guide will equip prospective venture capital (VC) and private equity (PE) fund managers, service providers and investors with in-depth practical knowledge to navigate the Malaysian policy landscape governing VC and PE operations.</p>
<p>The VC and PE are important components of the alternative financing ecosystem in the Malaysian capital market. VC and PE firms play an essential role in nurturing promising startups and high growth enterprises, which are key to catalyse innovation, opportunities for local talent and contribute to the growth of the Malaysian economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SC Chairman, Dato&rsquo; Seri Dr. Awang Adek Hussin said, &ldquo;The Practical Guide on VC and PE in Malaysia is our commitment to fostering a conducive environment for investment and innovation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With clarity on the Malaysian business landscape for VC and PE firms, we aim to build a more vibrant community of professional investors to support entrepreneurs in Malaysia,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Key contents of the Guide include information on local capital market regulations pertaining to the VC and PE industries, foreign exchange policy, tax matters, fund structuring considerations and other areas critical to fund operations.</p>
<p>The issuance of the Guide is part of the SC&rsquo;s efforts to fostering a more dynamic private market sector under the Capital Market Masterplan 3. It will enhance the role of professional fund managers and cultivate a more vibrant investor base capable of channelling investments into startups and high growth micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs).</p>
<p>This initiative aligns with the SC&rsquo;s broader efforts to deepen market-based financing avenues for MSMEs and mid-tier companies (MTCs).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Guide also supports the national KL20 agenda to establish Malaysia as a leading startup ecosystem globally by providing practical guidance for prospective fund managers and investors seeking to establish or expand their presence in Malaysia.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The VC and PE industries have demonstrated steady growth. In 2023, the total fund commitments for VC and PE totalled RM17.85 billion, up from RM16.08 billion in 2022.&nbsp; VC and PE investments accounted for RM5.9 billion of total funds raised in Malaysia&rsquo;s capital markets between 2017 and 2023.&nbsp;</p>

<div> Keywords: WhatsApp bans, communication surveillance technology, compliance solutions, Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policies, AI in financial compliance
Summary:<br /><br />More firms use WhatsApp bans, surveillance technology, and compliance solutions. Difficulty in getting staff to comply persists. BYOD policies increase, AI adoption uncertain. North American firms cautious about AI. Regulatory scrutiny intensifies. <div>
<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.globalrelay.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Global Relay</a>, the&nbsp;leading provider of electronic communication compliance and archiving solutions,&nbsp;released its second annual&nbsp;<i>Industry Insights Report: Compliant Communication 2024</i>, discovering that despite a decrease of 15% year-over-year (YoY), WhatsApp bans prevail as the most-commonly used solution (43%) to marshal internal business communications. The report also revealed that four out of five firms (79%) are increasingly using communication surveillance technology to identify misconduct and culture risk.</p>
<p>The global survey examines how compliance, surveillance, and risk leaders in financial services are responding to intensified regulatory scrutiny surrounding recordkeeping and compliant communications, charting attitudes to WhatsApp, social media risks, monitoring and surveillance, sentiment around AI, and what the future might hold for compliance.&nbsp;Despite many firms noting that they ban the use of WhatsApp at work to mitigate the risk of non-compliant off-channel communications, only 50% of respondents said they thought that channel bans would withstand regulatory scrutiny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Asset managers, broker-dealers, and investment banks are all grappling with the WhatsApp conundrum,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<strong>Alex Viall, Chief Strategy Officer for Global Relay</strong>. &ldquo;We engineered Global Relay&rsquo;s unified platform to help institutions adapt to the fast-evolving business communications recordkeeping environment. It&rsquo;s significant progress that compliance solutions are more road-worthy than during the initial panic when the US Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission started their rolling enforcements. Many firms know they ultimately will have to enable this type of communication to stay competitive. We have worked hard to understand firms&rsquo; communications compliance needs and craft technology that addresses them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since the publication of last year&rsquo;s global&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Industry Insights Report</span>,&nbsp;U.S. regulators have continued to issue significant fines to firms that &ldquo;did not maintain or preserve the substantial majority of these off-channel communications,&rdquo; with three tranches of enforcements totalling&nbsp;nearly $450 million, most recently in February with the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2024-18" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SEC&rsquo;s $81 million in penalties against 16 firms</a>.</p>
<h4><b>Majority of firms encounter difficulty getting staff to comply with communication rules</b></h4>
<p>Global Relay&rsquo;s report also revealed that more firms &ndash; up 4% YoY &ndash; around the globe are facing difficulty getting staff to comply with rules around electronic communication channels, with nearly two-thirds (65%) citing this issue as part of their ongoing challenge around off-channel communications risk.&nbsp; Financial services firms are making progress toward monitoring business communications with significantly fewer respondents having difficulty monitoring all communication channels, down to 24% from 54% last year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Financial institutions are reacting in response to the substantial regulatory penalties,&rdquo; continued&nbsp;<strong>Viall</strong>. &ldquo;They have got the message and are implementing strategic compliant solutions that ensure the capture, storage, and monitoring of all essential business communication channels. This is no easy task. Compliance and risk officers are more aware that banning social media channels and forbidding the use of personal mobile devices are impractical measures that are difficult to enforce. Many are still in the planning phase but all are tackling this and prepared to show stakeholders and regulators how they best plan to manage off-channel communications.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Contrary to industry perception, the report revealed the number of financial institutions using Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policies has ballooned from 36% in 2023 to 53% in 2024. Considering continued enforcement for personal device usage, 45% of respondents have looked to clarify their BYOD policies, with 17% moving away from BYOD altogether.</p>
<h4><b>72% of global firms seek to introduce&nbsp;AI&nbsp;in the next year, but North American interest lags behind</b></h4>
<p>Respondents reported general uncertainty about AI in financial compliance, including whether it is a risk (17%), reward (10%) or both (32%). Despite this caution, 42% of global respondents said they would be looking to introduce AI to compliance workflows in the next 12 months, with 57% saying that they would not be. Leaders at North America firms demonstrated reticence compared to their European and Global counterparts, with 65% of North American firms noting they do not have plans to introduce AI within the next year.</p>
<p><i>Industry Insights Report: Compliant Communication 2024</i>&nbsp;serves as a litmus test for market responsiveness to regulatory action for recordkeeping and communications compliance. Regulators have taken steps to clarify expectations, including guidance from the&nbsp;SEC&nbsp;on when it will&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.globalrelay.com/resources/blog/fair-warning-sec-sets-out-trigger-factors-for-acting-against-ccos" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">enforce against Chief Compliance Officers</a>&nbsp;directly and the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.globalrelay.com/resources/blog/remediate-recordkeep-rinse-repeat" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">factors it considers</a>&nbsp;when imposing fines for recordkeeping violations.<span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<div> strategy, technology modernisation, regulatory commitments, expense management, capital expenditure
Summary:<br />ASX marks one year of progress on its five-year strategy, including technology modernization, regulatory achievements, expense and capital expenditure guidance, and continued business investment. <div>
<p>Today&rsquo;s Investor Forum marks one year since ASX announced its new five year strategy and Managing Director and CEO Helen Lofthouse will detail the progress made on strategic outcomes including the key focus areas of technology modernisation and regulatory commitments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The briefing today will also deliver further detail on the indicative technology roadmap and outline growth opportunities ASX is pursuing while maintaining its focus on executing Horizon 1 strategic outcomes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms Lofthouse said: &ldquo;Our five year strategy builds on the foundations of a high quality portfolio of businesses that deliver resilient revenue performance throughout market cycles. The key regulatory deliverables for FY24 were achieved within expected timelines, and we&rsquo;re pleased to share further detail on our major technology projects including CHESS replacement and the work underway to upgrade our trading and derivatives clearing platforms.&rdquo; Key highlights since the last investor briefing include:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>CHESS replacement in delivery phase following decision to progress with a product based solution to be delivered by global technology firm Tata Consultancy Services;</li>
<li>Commencement of program of industry consultation for CHESS replacement releases and for potential shortening of settlement cycle to T+1;</li>
<li>Delivery of three special reports to ASIC detailing roadmap for maintenance and supportability of CHESS, implementation of external review recommendations on aspects of CHESS replacement and further uplift of delivery capability;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Increase in stakeholder engagement and independent advice for cash market clearing and settlement with the formation of the Advisory Group and the appointment of an independent chair to the ASX Business Committee;</li>
<li>Launch of first ASX corporate bond, raising $275 million;</li>
<li>Targeted restructure in early 2024 delivering $11 million in annual savings;</li>
<li>Ongoing Listings activity which attracted total capital onto exchange of $73.6 billion for financial YTD (after delisted capital for the same period of $51.1 billion, this delivered net new capital of $22.5 billion);&nbsp;</li>
<li>Announcement of exploratory work with Clean Energy Regulator to develop an Australian Carbon Exchange.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Being able to deliver these key wins in the first year of our strategy gives us confidence in our ability to continue to execute strongly,&rdquo; Ms Lofthouse said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve made strong progress against our strategic goals but we have more to do and we&rsquo;ve prioritised investment into technology modernisation and regulatory commitments to support long term shareholder value.&rdquo;&nbsp; ASX continues to prioritise business efficiency and provides the following financial guidance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forecast FY24 total expense growth rate of ~15%, at the top end of guidance provided with 2H24 expenses expected to be lower than 1H24;</li>
<li>Guidance for FY25 total expense growth rate to be between 6% and 9% (when excluding depreciation and amortisation, the range is expected to be between 4% and 7%);</li>
<li>Forecast capital expenditure for FY24 of around $135 million which is within previous guidance range;</li>
<li>FY25 technology capital expenditure guidance of between $160 million and $180 million<a href="file://C:/Users/Herbie%20Skeete/Documents/27-13-june-2024-investor-forum-2024-market-release.pdf#_ftn1" style="font-size: 11px;"><sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup></a><span style="font-size: 11px;">, with this elevated range expected for the medium term (FY25 &ndash; FY27) before starting to reduce beyond this point; and</span></li>
<li>Intention to maintain capital management settings for dividend payout ratio of between 80% and 90% of underlying net profit after tax for the medium term, and to continue to operate the Dividend Reinvestment Plan.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FY25 expense growth rate set out above is primarily driven by ongoing technology related investment including software licensing, equipment costs and depreciation and amortisation. ASX will maintain focus on expense management initiatives in FY25 including optimising our workforce mix, process simplification and automation, and strategic procurement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Continuing to invest in our business is critical to our strategy. We have high quality businesses, a compelling value chain and structural tailwinds that will support us into the future, and I&rsquo;m confident we are building a clear path to our growth horizon,&rdquo; Ms Lofthouse said.&nbsp;</p>

<title>CalPERS To Vote Against Tesla CEO’s Multibillion-Dollar Pay Package</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> compensation, Tesla, CalPERS, CEO, vote<br />
Summary:<br />
CalPERS opposes Tesla CEO Elon Musk's $46 billion compensation package due to excessive dilution, lack of performance ties, and board independence concerns. Additionally, CalPERS opposes a shareholder lawsuit's proposed $5.6 billion attorneys' fees in Tesla stock. <div>
<p>CalPERS today announced that it will again vote against a multibillion-dollar compensation package that Tesla proposes to give its chief executive officer at the company&rsquo;s annual meeting on June 13. The package would allow Elon Musk to buy 304 million shares of Tesla stock at its 2018 value, which would be worth approximately $46 billion. CalPERS also opposed the deal when shareholders approved the measure in 2018.</p>
<p>"This exorbitant compensation package is at odds with CalPERS' longstanding views on executive pay," said CalPERS CEO Marcie Frost. "The compensation is excessive when compared to executives at peer companies, highly dilutive to shareholders, and isn&rsquo;t tied to the long-term profitability of Tesla."</p>
<p>CalPERS has developed an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.calpers.ca.gov/docs/executive-compensation-analysis-framework.pdf" target="_blank" title="opens in new window">Executive Compensation Analysis Framework (PDF)</a>&nbsp;to help guide decisions on "say on pay" votes. The framework helps CalPERS assess whether executive pay is aligned with company performance and is reasonable relative to peers.</p>
<p>"While we agree that Mr. Musk is entitled to be well compensated for his work, we also believe that a pay package should be commensurate to a company&rsquo;s performance with reasonable salary caps," Frost added. "These features are absent in the deal as structured."</p>
<p>Some data points highlight the excessive nature of the award:</p>
<ul>
<li>The value is approximately $46 billion, accounting for the cost to exercise the options, which is larger than the last four years of Tesla&rsquo;s aggregate net income of $33.8 billion (2020-2023).</li>
<li>The award would be highly dilutive to existing shareowners and reduce their ownership proportion.</li>
<li>While the award does have a five-year holding period, it is concentrated in a single individual.</li>
<li>Compared with other high-performing companies over the same period, the Tesla option award is nearly 140 times the annual pay opportunity for other high-performing CEOs.</li>
<li>The payout rewards short-term growth and not sustained profitability. Tesla&rsquo;s value has fallen by more than half from its peak in 2021.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"We do not think a payout based on short-term market exuberance is warranted without sustained performance," said CalPERS Global Equities Investment Director Drew Hambly. "Additionally, this deal concentrates power in a single shareholder and was negotiated by board members whose independence from Tesla's CEO is questionable. For these reasons, CalPERS could not support the deal in 2018 and remains opposed today."</p>
<p>In addition, CalPERS also announced that it&nbsp;<a href="https://secure.fileandservexpress.com/Document/Download/517b5336-476e-4385-adcf-7b97caa71bdc3" target="_blank" title="Opens in new window">filed an objection</a>&nbsp;in a related matter involving Tesla. Early this year, a judge nullified the 2018 pay package after a shareholder filed suit. The plaintiff&rsquo;s lawyers have asked the court to award them $5.6 billion in attorneys&rsquo; fees, taken in the form of Tesla stock. CalPERS believes this sum is also exorbitant and would dilute shareholders&rsquo; interests in Tesla. As a result, CalPERS is joining at least one other Tesla shareholder in protesting this proposed windfall.</p>
<p>CalPERS owned nearly 9.2 million Tesla shares as of June 7.</p>

<div> charge, fraud, investment, settlement, criminal <br />
<br />
The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Joshua Goltry and JAG Capital Advisors LLC with defrauding investors of at least $3 million through a three-year scheme. Goltry and JAG Advisors raised funds by lying about the fund's performance, investment activity, and risks. They used more than $1.1 million on personal expenses and lost over $1.7 million through high-risk trading and speculative investments. They falsified documents to conceal the trading losses. Goltry and JAG Advisors agreed to settle the charges against them, which includes a permanent injunction from violating the federal securities laws. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey announced criminal charges against Goltry. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Joshua Goltry and his investment management firm, JAG Capital Advisors LLC (JAG Advisors), in connection with a three-year scheme to defraud investors of at least $3 million.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, from 2020 to 2023, Goltry, the founder and Chief Investment Officer of a purported equity fund called JAG Cap, LLC, and JAG Advisors, the purported equity fund&rsquo;s investment manager, raised at least $3 million from approximately nine investors by lying about nearly every aspect of the fund, including its performance, investment activity, and investment risks. Goltry is the principal of JAG Advisors. As alleged, of the funds raised, Goltry and JAG Advisors used at least $1.1 million on personal expenses, including travel and jewelry, and lost more than $1.7 million through high-risk trading and speculative investments. The complaint further alleges that Goltry and JAG Advisors falsified documents, including expense invoices, to conceal the trading losses from investors. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As alleged in the complaint, Goltry and JAG Advisors repeatedly lied to investors to lure them into investing in the JAG Fund and then lost their money or stole it to pay for lavish personal expenses,&rdquo; said Nicholas P. Grippo, Regional Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Philadelphia Regional Office. &ldquo;We will continue to diligently hold accountable those who exploit investors&rsquo; trust for personal gain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint charges Goltry and JAG Advisors with violating antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. Goltry and JAG Advisors agreed to settle the charges against them. The settlement, which is subject to court approval, would permanently enjoin Goltry and JAG Advisors from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and allows the court to decide the amounts of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties at a later date.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the District of New Jersey announced criminal charges against Goltry.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Suzanne C. Abt and Michael Cuff and supervised by Julia C. Green, Scott A. Thompson, and Mr. Grippo, all of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Judson T. Mihok and supervised by Gregory R. Bockin.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<div> Securities, Research, Regulation, AI, Capital Markets
<br />
Investment research, regulation, and AI are discussed. SEC rules, including research regulations, and the impact of AI in the capital markets.
<br /><br />Summary: 
Investment research regulation, including SEC rules and global impact. The role of AI in the capital markets. <div>
<p>Thank you for the kind introduction. I&rsquo;m pleased to be at the International Bar Association&rsquo;s Asset Management Industry Conference on Global Challenges and Opportunities.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-intl-bar-assoc-asset-mngmtindustry-conference-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;For the participants attending from abroad, welcome to Boston. It is an exciting time to be in the city, with the Boston Celtics competing at this moment for the NBA championship.</p>
<p>I understand that this particular IBA committee focuses on the global fund industry. It is no small feat to navigate the maze of laws and regulations and to counsel clients on complex issues that cross jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Despite our differences around the world, one constant is that the effectiveness of capital markets depends on the quality of the information environment. Today, I will discuss investment research provided by sell-side firms to asset managers and the rules governing such research. I have followed with much interest the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority&rsquo;s (&ldquo;UK FCA&rdquo;) recent consultation on modifying certain research unbundling rules required by the UK Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (&ldquo;UK MiFID&rdquo;), which were derived from the European Union&rsquo;s MiFID II.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-intl-bar-assoc-asset-mngmtindustry-conference-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;I commend the UK FCA for taking up this important issue and believe it is past time to review how investment research is regulated, including in the United States.</p>
<p>Investment research serves an important role in the global capital markets. It promotes the efficient allocation of capital and risk, resulting in increased economic growth and market liquidity. Sell-side and independent investment research help contribute to the efficient market hypothesis, in which prices reflect publicly available information. By contrast, buy-side research is typically proprietary and often only becomes incorporated into market prices when reflected by a manager&rsquo;s buy and sell orders. The decline of third-party investment research runs the risk that social media and rumors may increase in outsized influence &ndash; as nature abhors a vacuum. The result might be less informed and less efficient markets that do not serve investors and increase the cost of capital.</p>
<p>Regulators are demanding more disclosure than ever from public companies. For example, in the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s (&ldquo;SEC&rdquo;) climate-related disclosure rule would require extensive new public company disclosure.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-intl-bar-assoc-asset-mngmtindustry-conference-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;Public companies are also now required to disclose material cybersecurity incidents and describe their approach to cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-intl-bar-assoc-asset-mngmtindustry-conference-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;The New York Stock Exchange (&ldquo;NYSE&rdquo;) and Nasdaq-listed companies must also adopt and file policies regarding the recovery or &ldquo;clawback&rdquo; of excessive incentive-based compensation from current and former executive officers in the event of an accounting restatement.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-intl-bar-assoc-asset-mngmtindustry-conference-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;Third-party research can be an important resource in helping investors and asset managers digest the increasing volume of public company disclosures mandated by regulators. After all, what good is disclosure if no one has time to read it?</p>
<p>Despite the role played by investment research in price discovery and market efficiency, sell-side investment research that is bundled with trade execution has been viewed with skepticism by regulators, including by the SEC, due to potential conflicts of interest. First, a brief history about sell-side research in the United States: until May 1, 1975, when the SEC adopted Rule 19b-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (&ldquo;Exchange Act&rdquo;), NYSE required brokers to charge a minimum brokerage rate.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-intl-bar-assoc-asset-mngmtindustry-conference-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p>Fixed commission rates meant that broker-dealers had to compete in other ways, such as by providing customers with bundled research. The elimination of fixed commission rates thus raised questions for investment managers and the capital markets: for example, would managers be required by their fiduciary duty to pay the lowest commission rate and forgo bundled research? If brokers decided to stop producing research and compete solely on execution costs and speed, would smaller companies receive less research coverage and be less successful in raising capital? Would fewer companies decide to go public due to a concern about research coverage?</p>
<p>Congress recognized these potential problems and enacted section 28(e) of the Exchange Act in 1975.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-intl-bar-assoc-asset-mngmtindustry-conference-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;Section 28(e) provides a safe harbor for investment managers to pay more than the lowest commission rate if the manager determines in good faith that the commission is reasonable in relation to the value of such services. This permitted investment managers to &ldquo;pay up&rdquo; for soft dollars (e.g., research) alongside execution services and continue to use client funds to do so. With this safe harbor, however, came difficult interpretative questions about whether a product or service could be paid with soft dollars. To this end, the Commission and its staff have studied and issued guidance over the years about certain services and practices that were remotely connected to the investment decision-making process and thus did not likely qualify to be paid with soft dollars.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-intl-bar-assoc-asset-mngmtindustry-conference-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p>However by its terms, section 28(e) expressly permits broker-dealers to continue bundling execution and research and recognized that research can benefit investors by promoting more informed decision making from asset managers. Section 28(e) also demonstrates Congress&rsquo;s view of the importance of the service that broker-dealers provide in producing research, and that it is acceptable for managers to use client funds to pay for bundled research and execution, subject to certain safeguards.</p>
<p>During the dot-com bubble of the late-1990s that eventually crashed, concerns were raised about the role played by sell-side investment research. It culminated in the global research analyst settlements, when the then-NASD (now FINRA), the SEC, the NYSE, the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA), and the New York State Attorney General settled with 12 major broker-dealer firms for conflicts of interest between their research analysts and investment bankers (&ldquo;Global Research Settlement&rdquo;).<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-intl-bar-assoc-asset-mngmtindustry-conference-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;Investment bankers also were alleged to have supervised and taken part in research analyst compensation decisions. The Global Research Settlement required these broker-dealers to wall off research analysts from investment banking due to allegations that analysts published research designed to attract investment banking business based on favorable company reports. The Global Research Settlement&rsquo;s terms were modified in 2010. Only specific 12 firms were subject to the Global Research Settlement, and two &ndash; Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers &ndash; are no longer in existence, and Credit Suisse has since been acquired by UBS.</p>
<p>In addition, Regulation AC &ndash; which stands for &ldquo;Analyst Certification&rdquo; &ndash; was adopted by the SEC in 2003. While the proposal predated the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (&ldquo;SOX&rdquo;), which required the SEC to adopt certain rules regarding research analysts, the SEC noted that it would abide by the SOX directives in adopting Regulation AC.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-intl-bar-assoc-asset-mngmtindustry-conference-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;Regulation AC generally requires research analysts to certify to the truthfulness of the views they express in research reports and public appearances, and to disclose whether they have received any compensation related to the specific recommendations or views expressed in those reports and appearances.</p>
<p>Regulators elsewhere in the world, notably the EU and the UK, have taken a different approach, viewing the bundling of execution and research as an inducement to asset managers and thus an investor protection issue. Accordingly, MiFID II generally requires managers to pay for research separately from execution services, charge clients a separate fee, or pay for research themselves. MiFID II&rsquo;s research rules may have intended for independent research and lower commissions to offset the reduction in sell-side research; however, it appears that this experiment may have not accomplished these goals and has had unintended results.</p>
<p>For example, due to concerns about MiFID II leading to a decline in research on small and medium companies, the French Authorit&eacute; de March&eacute;s Financiers has recommended that MiFID II&rsquo;s inducements regime should not apply to research on companies with market capitalizations of &euro;1 billion or less.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-intl-bar-assoc-asset-mngmtindustry-conference-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;Across the English Channel, the UK FCA has issued a consultation requesting input on re-bundling investment research with brokerage execution services. This consultation follows up other work by the UK FCA, including the concerns noted by an Independent Research Review (&ldquo;IRR&rdquo;) study.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-intl-bar-assoc-asset-mngmtindustry-conference-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;The IRR found that the UK MiFID unbundling requirements adversely affected the quality and coverage of investment research for UK companies, and the UK&rsquo;s economic growth as a result. In addition, UK asset managers were disadvantaged as compared to their international peers in accessing global investment research, making them less competitive. Finally, the IRR noted a possible decline in the quality of UK research due to a &ldquo;juniorization&rdquo; in the ranks of sell-side research analysts. The efforts of these regulators to take a hard look at whether their regulatory policies achieved their intended goals is commendable.</p>
<p>MiFID II&rsquo;s inducements regime also caused challenging conflicts of laws issues for U.S. broker-dealers: charging separately for research services implicated questions of whether U.S. broker-dealers could rely on the exclusion from the definition of an investment adviser if they complied with MiFID II.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-intl-bar-assoc-asset-mngmtindustry-conference-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>&nbsp;To that end, the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Investment Management issued temporary no-action letter relief to permit U.S. broker-dealers to comply with MiFID II&rsquo;s research requirements and continue their business models.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-intl-bar-assoc-asset-mngmtindustry-conference-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>&nbsp;This relief was left to expire in July 2023, which was most unfortunate. In my view, the no-action letter should have been extended for a modest period to accommodate potential changes in UK MiFID and MiFID II.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-intl-bar-assoc-asset-mngmtindustry-conference-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>&nbsp;With the UK FCA&rsquo;s consultation, it become even more apparent that allowing the letter to expire was premature.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the Global Settlement, the SEC&rsquo;s then-enforcement director stated that &ldquo;the full impact remains to be seen&rdquo; and others hoped that it would lead to &ldquo;more straight talk on Wall Street.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-intl-bar-assoc-asset-mngmtindustry-conference-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>&nbsp;The impact, unfortunately, has been a lot less research out of Wall Street, particularly for small and medium sized companies. I hope that the SEC can learn from our international colleagues and examine our own research rules, including the Global Research Settlement.</p>
<p>The SEC should further undertake a retrospective review of the similarly 20-year-old Regulation AC, which would be an exercise of good government and responsible regulation. In this regard, the SEC should take heed of the 2017 recommendation from the U.S. Department of the Treasury that the SEC should conduct a holistic review of the Global Research Settlement and the research analyst rules to determine which provisions should be retained, amended, or removed, with the objective of harmonizing a single set of rules for all financial institutions.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-intl-bar-assoc-asset-mngmtindustry-conference-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a></p>
<p>Turning to today, I noticed that the IBA is holding two discussions on artificial intelligence (&ldquo;AI&rdquo;). AI is a hot topic, as it touches many areas of financial services and the capital markets, including investment research. AI and machine learning can automate and analyze vast quantities of data, such as financial statements and other public company disclosures. With AI, the research analyst&rsquo;s role could change, perhaps focusing less on data collection and more on interpretation and qualitative analysis. AI also could increase the resources available for smaller company coverage. &nbsp;Of course, AI is fallible and if not properly constructed and monitored, it could miss patterns, correlations, and risks. Therefore, while I am not overly concerned about a dystopian future where we are ruled by AI, we should continue to evaluate its use.</p>
<p>Thank you again for the invitation to speak and for your continued commitment to the global rule of law.</p>

<div> indicators, economic activity, inflation, monetary policy, Committee
Summary: Economic activity remains solid with strong job gains and low unemployment. Inflation is elevated but easing. Committee maintains federal funds rate and is committed to achieving 2 percent inflation. <div>
<p>Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. Job gains have remained strong, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Inflation has eased over the past year but remains elevated. In recent months, there has been modest further progress toward the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective.</p>
<p>The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals have moved toward better balance over the past year. The economic outlook is uncertain, and the Committee remains highly attentive to inflation risks.</p>
<p>In support of its goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent. In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent. In addition, the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage‑backed securities. The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.</p>
<p>In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.</p>
<p>Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chair; John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Thomas I. Barkin; Michael S. Barr; Raphael W. Bostic; Michelle W. Bowman; Lisa D. Cook; Mary C. Daly; Philip N. Jefferson; Adriana D. Kugler; Loretta J. Mester; and Christopher J. Waller.</p>

<div> monitoring report, cross-zonal transmission capacities, EU electricity market, grid congestion, future-looking assessment<br />
Summary:<br />
ACER and JRC will present findings on 70% transmission capacity requirement, integration of EU electricity market, and future assessment of grid congestion. <br /> <div>
<p>ACER and the Joint Research Centre (JRC) are organising a joint webinar to present and discuss the key findings from their&nbsp;2024 publications, focusing on electricity grid congestion and transmission capacities for cross-border electricity trade:</p>
<ul>
<li>ACER&rsquo;s yearly monitoring report on cross-zonal transmission capacities and the progress of Member States in reaching the minimum 70% requirement (to be published on 3 July 2024);</li>
<li><a href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsCVAYABVIBV0wIDwFSHVZbAFIdCggIAxpTAVZWVlADBw5QDgIdUAVbU1tTVVcdVAAAVx0GXwQAGldSVgMZAVZRAFBXVFBUXFJQRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" target="_blank">JRC&rsquo;s future-looking assessment on the evolution of congestion management in the current EU electricity market design</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">When?</span></p>
<p>Wednesday, 10 July 2024, 14:30 - 15:30 CET, online</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tackling barriers in the EU&rsquo;s transition to net-zero</span></p>
<p>A successfully integrated EU electricity market is crucial for the EU&rsquo;s ambitions of achieving net-zero emissions while maintaining its global competitiveness. How efficiently the electricity market design addresses grid congestion is key to this effort.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Realising the 70% transmission capacity requirement helps further integrate markets</span></p>
<p>EU rules mandate that grid operators ensure at least 70% of transmission capacity is available for electricity trade with neighbouring countries by the end of 2025. Why? Making the required 70% of capacity available for cross-zonal trade better integrates markets, enhances security of supply, reduces price volatility and increases the flexibility of the system. ACER monitors annually the availability of cross-zonal capacities in the EU and the progress of Member States in reaching the 70% requirement.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Future-proofing the European electricity market</span></p>
<p>The European Commission&rsquo;s JRC has developed a future-looking assessment of the volume and cost of addressing congestion in the electricity grid for the target years 2030 and 2040, based on different grid expansion scenarios.</p>

<p>&ldquo;CanDeal offers a deep liquidity pool for Canadian debt securities through its tight-knit community of buy-side firms and sell-side dealers,&rdquo; said Jamie Grant, President of CanDeal Markets. &ldquo;As the Canadian fixed income market continues to deepen its use of electronic trading, new protocols such as buy-side automated rules-bound trading and deferred spotting, which reduces tracking error, are introducing much greater efficiency.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On May 27, CanDeal Markets successfully transitioned all fixed income and derivatives trading activity to the T+1 settlement cycle, in accordance with the guidance set by the Canadian Capital Markets Association.

<title>DTCC’s FICC Launches CCLF Public Calculator To Support Expansion Of U.S. Treasury Clearing - In Anticipation Of The New SEC Requirements For Expanded U.S. Treasury Clearing, This New Tool Simulates Estimated CCLF Obligations Associated With FICC GSD Membership</title>

<div> DTCC, FICC, CCLF, liquidity obligations, transparency<br />
Summary:<br />
DTCC launches public-facing CCLF calculator for U.S. Treasury market participants to estimate liquidity obligations and understand GSD membership requirements. <div>
<p>DTCC, the premier post-trade market infrastructure for the global financial services industry, today announced the launch of FICC&rsquo;s interactive, public-facing&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.dtcc.com/managing-risk/stress-testing-and-liquidity-risk-management/ccfl-public-calculator" target="_blank">Capped Contingency Liquidity Facility (CCLF) Calculator</a></span>.</p>
<p>With the expansion of central clearing in U.S. Treasuries on the horizon and given the size of transactions in the U.S. Treasury market - now exceeding USD $7 trillion daily - CCLF is a critical risk management tool used for managing DTCC&rsquo;s Fixed Income Clearing Corporation&rsquo;s (FICC) liquidity risk arising from settlement activity. Market participants can input their current unique settlement activity into the calculator to estimate and understand the CCLF-related liquidity obligations that could arise from membership.</p>
<p>CCLF is a rules-based liquidity resource facility that would provide FICC with additional liquid financial resources to meet its cash settlement obligations in the event of a default of the largest GSD family of affiliated Netting Members. To anticipate this potential funding need, GSD Netting Members incorporate their individually determined CCLF obligation amounts into their own liquidity plans. While the CCLF obligation is a committed obligation for the Netting Members, FICC does not require pre-funding or deposits of the obligation amount. Instead, as an ongoing FICC membership requirement Netting Members provide up-front attestations regarding their ability to provide such CCLF amounts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By providing the public CCLF calculator, we continue to increase transparency into our financial risk management program, empowering potential members to understand their role and obligations as a FICC GSD member,&rdquo; Tim Hulse, Managing Director, Financial Risk &amp; Governance at DTCC. &ldquo;CCLF provides a critical backstop to address the financial impact of volatility and stress across repo markets while safeguarding the industry and individual members.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The new CCLF calculator, accessible on dtcc.com, requires a series of data points to be provided by users. Once entered on screen, the calculator processes the data points using the existing GSD CCLF engine logic, delivering an estimated individual CCLF obligation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;FICC recognizes that many firms are considering membership with GSD to comply with the final SEC rule on expanded clearing of U.S. Treasury activity,&rdquo; said Claire Lough, Executive Director, Financial Risk &amp; Governance at DTCC. &ldquo;This calculator will enable market participants to simulate their potential CCLF obligations to assist in understanding what is required of a GSD Netting Member.&rdquo;</p>
<p>FICC is the leading provider of trade comparison, netting and settlement for the Government Securities marketplace. As part of its commitment to the industry, DTCC continues to assess calculators, tools and enhanced access methods to best support the expansion of U.S. Treasury clearing activity.</p>

<div> MOU, TFEX, RAOT, rubber reference prices, Thailand
Summary:<br />TFEX and RAOT partner to establish standardized Rubber Reference Prices, benefiting the industry and enhancing transparency and confidence.<br /> <div>
<p class="BodyA">Thailand Futures Exchange PCL (TFEX) has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Rubber Authority of Thailand (RAOT) for collaboration to establish the standardized Rubber Reference Prices. These benchmarks will serve as references trading transactions for both domestic and international players and facilitate the development of related products.</p>
<p class="BodyA"><b>TFEX Managing Director Rinjai Chakornpipat </b>said that<b> </b>the initiative is aimed to develop a recognized Rubber Reference Prices for Thailand, which will benefit both the rubber and related industries.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BodyA">"TFEX and RAOT aim for the reference prices to be widely accepted and used in trading transactions domestically and internationally. TFEX will calculate and publish the reference prices. The methodology for established reference price will be published for general public to ensure transparency of the benchmark. TFEX and RAOT also have a plan to consult with the industry to explore the development of rubber reference prices that comply with the European Union Deforestation-Free Regulation (EUDR). Besides, TFEX will further explore to utilize these reference prices for Rubber Futures product development," said Rinjai.</p>
<p class="BodyA"><b>RAOT Governor Nakorn Tangavirapat</b> said that even though Thailand is the world's major rubber producer, the country had relied on international rubber market prices as reference for its export contracts. Development of its domestic reference prices will help reflect the costs of Thai rubber farmers and local producers. To address this issue, RAOT, the central agency overseeing the entire rubber industry including domestic and export markets, has partnered with TFEX to develop the reference price calculation methodology for trading Thai rubber with aims to ensure transparency and adhere to international standards. The established reference prices will be publicly published, enabling relevant stakeholders to use them as a basis for determining contract prices for rubber exports (FOB prices). This development is expected to enhance confidence among stakeholders in the rubber industry. Under the collaboration, RAOT will gather and provide data on trading volumes, product information for various types of rubber, and other necessary information from RAOT&rsquo;s central rubber markets in each province. TFEX will use such data to calculate reference prices. RAOT and TFEX will disseminate these reference prices.</p>
<p class="BodyA">"We firmly believe that this collaboration marks a significant step in establishing internationally accepted methodology to establish Thai rubber reference prices and will pave the way for Thailand to become a hub for the rubber product industry, ultimately benefiting rubber farmers and Thai rubber entrepreneurs by strengthening their livelihoods and ensuring career stability,&rdquo; added Nakorn.</p>
<p>The MOU signing ceremony was held on June 12, 2024. The rubber reference prices will be calculated and published twice daily as follows: the price for Ribbed Smoked Sheet Grade 3 (RSS3) will be released at 12:00 hrs. (planned to launch in July 2024), while the prices for concentrated latex and block rubber will be announced at 19:00 hrs. (planned to launch in September 2024). For information on the Rubber Reference Prices, please visit TFEX website (<a href="http://www.tfex.co.th/">www.TFEX.co.th</a>) and the RAOT website (www.raot.co.th).</p>

<title>Three Million 'Frankenstein' Identities Pose A Multi-Billion Pound Fraud Threat: LexisNexis Risk Solutions</title>

<div> fraud, synthetic identity, UK, businesses, credit checks
Summary:<br /><br />New research from LexisNexis Risk Solutions shows that synthetic identity fraud threatens UK businesses with potential losses of £4.2billion by 2027. Scammers are creating synthetic identities to bypass fraud defenses, leading to potential significant financial losses for organizations. Noreen Altaf, an Identity Fraud specialist at LexisNexis Risk Solutions, advises businesses to invest in tools capable of spotting synthetic identities and review existing portfolios for any synthetic identities that may have infiltrated before they result in financial losses. <div>
<p>The latest fraud threatening the UK could cost businesses at least &pound;4.2billion if appropriate steps are not taken, new research from&nbsp;LexisNexis Risk Solutions shows.</p>
<div class="PRN_ImbeddedAssetReference" id="DivAssetPlaceHolder1">
<p><img src="https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2436045/LexisNexis_Risk_Solutions.jpg" title="Hotspots showing the fast-growth of synthetic Frankenstein identities across the UK" /></p>
</div>
<p>A new study looked at over 72million consumer profiles and found 2.8million showing several signs of 'Frankenstein cloning', where fraudsters stitch real and made-up personal details together to create a 'new' synthetic identity to spoof credit checks and commit high-value fraud against banks and credit providers.</p>
<p>In the U.S. where synthetic fraud is already a major issue, businesses report an average $15k<sup>[1]</sup>&nbsp;loss to each confirmed synthetic fraud case. As a result, experts at LexisNexis Risk Solutions estimate that it could cost the UK economy around &pound;4.2billion by 2027, unless firms start properly screening now, for the threat.</p>
<p>Most organisations' existing fraud defences are ineffective against synthetic identities because they appear as normal, good customers until the fraud is committed. Once they 'bust out' with the funds, the lender is left to suffer the loss, as there's no 'real' person to pursue for the debt.</p>
<p>Noreen Altaf, Identity Fraud specialist at LexisNexis Risk Solutions, explains: "At first, a synthetic ID has little value to a fraudster, as it has no credit history, so they need to play the long game. Scammers nurture each false identity by building what appears to be a real credit profile over time, making the synthetic ID seem like a trustworthy customer &ndash; because of this the fraud threat is effectively invisible to firms' existing fraud defences, until it's too late.</p>
<p>"Once a fraudster thinks the synthetic ID has enough plausibility, they'll aim to max out available credit lines. This might be applying for a loan or credit card for thousands of pounds, taking a PCP contract for a new vehicle, or making a high-value purchase via a buy now pay later arrangement. The fraudster has no intention of repaying this, leaving organisations to foot the bill and chasing ghosts to recover the debt.</p>
<p>"There is still much businesses don't know about this fast-emerging threat, so it's difficult to predict the true potential cost of synthetic fraud to the UK. However, even a very conservative estimate of a &pound;1,500 loss per fraud attack amounts to &pound;4.2 billion in future credit write-offs for companies, with synthetic identities already hiding amongst their customer base &ndash; and it could be a lot higher."</p>
<p>The study found strong evidence of scammers up and down the country using 'synthetic farms' in rural locations and 'synthetic factories' in urban areas to build up the credit scores of new synthetic identities on an industrial scale, in readiness for fraud attacks.</p>
<p>In one example, rental cottages based on a farm in Chichester appeared to have 439 highly suspect identities 'living' there over the past seven years, only 22 of which showed any evidence of being real people. The identities were making hundreds of applications for credit, such as short-term and payday loans and some were also linked to a similar farm hundreds of miles away near Dundee, Scotland.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A heat map produced alongside the report shows similar activity is happening across the whole UK. Suspected synthetic farms can be seen in multiple locations across rural Wales and the Scottish Highlands.</p>
<p>Noreen continues: "A common characteristic of synthetic farms and factories is that they are properties where the mail can be easily intercepted by the fraudsters making credit applications. A farm, for example, might have a mailbox that's at the end of a track, while empty buildings or shared mailboxes in cities can be exploited in a similar way.</p>
<p>"Synthetic fraud has been around for a while, but with sophisticated fraud modelling, we can, for the first time, more accurately detect and put a figure on it.</p>
<p>"Businesses need to act fast to protect themselves by investing in tools capable of spotting synthetic identities at application or onboarding stage, before they become customers. Given the length of time fraudsters have already been creating and nurturing synthetic identities in the UK &ndash; as evidenced by our research &ndash; banks, lenders and credit providers, in particular, should take appropriate action to review their existing portfolios to ascertain the extent to which synthetic identities may have infiltrated their organisations over time, before those identities get a chance to cash out."</p>

<div> Blueprint, Climate risk platform, Financial authorities, Integration, Data

Summary:
- Project Viridis integrates regulatory and climate data
- Developed by BIS and MAS
- A platform to identify, monitor and manage climate risks
- Uses EDKP technology
- Demonstrates integration of regulatory and climate data<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<ul>
<li>Project Viridis explores how regulatory and climate data could be integrated to provide insights into climate-related financial risks.</li>
<li>The project&rsquo;s report outlines a blueprint for a climate risk platform that can be used to identify, monitor and manage climate risks in the financial system.</li>
<li>The platform uses technology architecture developed by the BIS Innovation Hub Singapore Centre and MAS, enhanced in collaboration with other financial authorities from around the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) have developed a blueprint for a platform that integrates regulatory and climate data to help financial authorities identify, monitor and manage climate risks in the financial system.</p>
<p>2&nbsp;<span> </span>Integrating climate risk analysis into financial stability surveillance is challenging due to the complex nature of climate change, notable data gaps and limited understanding of how to measure the associated risks. To help tackle this challenge, a blueprint of a climate risk platform has been developed at the BIS Innovation Hub Centre in Singapore through Project Viridis.</p>
<p>3&nbsp;<span> </span>The blueprint lays out the key features and metrics required for a climate risk platform. These incorporate data and information on financed emissions, physical risk exposure and forward-looking assessments under different climate scenarios.</p>
<p>4&nbsp;<span> </span>&ldquo;As the impact of climate change on the global financial landscape intensifies, the need for adaptive and forward-thinking strategies has never been more urgent. Project Viridis helps equip financial authorities with the insights needed to integrate emerging climate risks into their analysis &ndash; and thereby help promote global financial stability,&rdquo; said Maha El Dimachki, Head of the BIS Innovation Hub Singapore Centre.</p>
<p>5&nbsp;<span> </span>&ldquo;Project Viridis is an innovative, collaborative blueprint that leverages technology solutions to systematically track climate-related data and metrices, thereby augmenting regulators&rsquo; efforts in assessing physical and transition climate risk exposures of individual banks and the financial system. This project addresses a common need of global financial authorities, and we look forward to further collaboration to expand such toolkits,&rdquo; said Celine Sia, Assistant Managing Director (Economics &amp; Knowledge Management), MAS.</p>
<p>6&nbsp;<span> </span>Project Viridis demonstrates how regulatory data can be integrated with climate data, which are extracted from corporate disclosure documents using natural language processing techniques. This provides authorities with insights into climate-related financial risks, helping them form an initial view of financial institutions&rsquo; risk exposures, and to identify areas that may require deeper risk assessment.</p>
<p>7&nbsp;<span> </span>More information on the platform can be found in the Project Viridis final report published&nbsp;<a class="mas-link" href="https://www.bis.org/publ/othp85.htm" target="_blank"><span class="mas-link__text">here</span>&nbsp;<span class="mas-icon mas-glyphs-external--link">&nbsp;</span></a>.</p>

<title>New Zealand Financial Markets Authority Files Civil Proceedings Against Booster Investment Management Ltd And Individual Directors And Senior Managers</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-files-civil-proceedings-against-booster/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-files-civil-proceedings-against-booster/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The FMA has filed civil proceedings against Booster Investment Management Limited (BIML), a wholly owned subsidiary of Booster Financial Services Limited. The proceedings allege breaches of the Financial Markets Conduct Act (FMCA) by BIML and the following directors and senior managers of BIML:&nbsp;Allan Yeo (director), Paul Foley (director), Brendon Doyle (former director), David Beattie (senior manager) and Nicholas Craven (senior manager).</p>
<p>The FMA proceedings allege that multiple breaches occurred through 2017-2022, arising from investments made by BIML into a related, limited partnership, the Booster Tahi Limited Partnership (Tahi), which in turn invested into a series of domestic wine businesses, later amalgamated into the Booster Wine Group (BWG).&nbsp;The investors referred to in this case are retail investors and the funds involved come from three Booster Schemes (the Booster KiwiSaver Scheme, Booster Super Scheme and Booster Investment Scheme, (the&nbsp;Schemes)).&nbsp;Booster has advised that as at 31 May 2024, 24 of the 61 retail funds Booster manages have exposure to BWG, including six KiwiSaver Funds. Those Funds&rsquo; exposure ranges from 0.77% to 3.83%.</p>
<p>The FMA alleges 75 causes of action that:</p>
<ul>
<li>BIML breached its duties and obligations as the manager of the Schemes when investing in the manner described above;</li>
<li>the individuals involved used their positions improperly as directors or senior managers, in circumstances where conflicts of interest and related party benefits were not properly managed, when making investments of Scheme funds to benefit Tahi and the BWG; and</li>
<li>failures to follow required processes meant that the relevant transactions were made in breach of the prohibition against related party transactions.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Relevant provisions of the FMCA</p>
<p>Managers&rsquo; Duties</p>
<p>The entity, BIML:</p>
<ul>
<li>section 143(1)(b)(i) - to act in best interests of scheme participants (six causes of action);</li>
<li>section 143(2) - to carry out the functions of a manager in accordance with the governing document (18 causes of action);</li>
<li>section 143(3) - to comply with the same duties and liabilities as those imposed on a trustee (one cause of action); and</li>
<li>section 144 - to exercise any powers, or perform any duties, with the care, diligence and skill that a prudent person engaged in that profession would exercise (14 causes of action).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Individuals:</p>
<ul>
<li>sections 145(1)(b) - duty to not make an improper use of their position to gain an advantage for another (17 causes of action); and</li>
<li>section 533(1)(c) - being knowingly concerned in a breach of s 143 (for Mr Yeo and Mr Doyle only) (one cause of action).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Related party transactions</p>
<ul>
<li>section 173(1) - general prohibition on transactions giving a related party benefit (18 causes of action).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The basis for the FMA filing a case for these alleged breaches is broadly as follows:</p>
<p>As the Manager of these schemes, BIML is responsible for selecting and managing the investment portfolios of Scheme funds in accordance with its governing documents (including the trust deed, Product Disclosure Statement and Statement of Investment Policy and Objectives). BIML&rsquo;s Investment Committee (BIML IC) is delegated to make specific investment decisions within the framework of those governing documents, and in accordance with BIML&rsquo;s Investment Charter.</p>
<p>The FMA alleges the relevant Tahi investments were made without any consideration by the BIML Investment Committee:</p>
<ul>
<li>where the specific circumstances of an investment suggest that it was not in the best interests of Scheme participants. These circumstances include the concerns of BWG's lenders (that were known to BIML), the purpose of advances, and the underperformance of the BWG;</li>
<li>where the specific investment was not made in accordance with Tahi's investment criteria (which BIML was obliged to monitor);</li>
<li>the size and timing of particular requests for funding, and the timeframe for responses; and where there were material changes in the underlying business or the broader circumstances of that underlying business, without any reassessment of the appropriateness of the ongoing investment.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Margot Gatland, FMA Head of Enforcement, said: &ldquo;The FMA considers the alleged breaches to be serious, and that civil proceedings are the proportionate response. The allegations are centred around important governance provisions of the FMCA, including fiduciary duties of managers and related party transactions. The Court&rsquo;s determination will provide guidance to the market about the application of these core FMCA investor protection provisions, that managers and directors are required to comply with when making investment decisions on behalf of others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The FMA will be seeking declarations of contravention, pecuniary penalties to be paid to the Crown, and an inquiry into damages. As the case is now before the courts, the FMA cannot comment further on these matters.</p>
<p>FMA&rsquo;s approach to supervision during a litigation process</p>
<p>The FMA's regulatory delivery team has increased engagement with BIML to ensure it is satisfied with aspects of BIML&rsquo;s governance and operations, with a focus on its direct investment activities. Booster is cooperating with the FMA&rsquo;s supervisory team. This work will continue in parallel with the proceedings and is focused on current and future compliance and investor outcomes.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Each contravention has a maximum penalty of $600,000 for the entity, and $200,000 for an individual.</p>
<p>A court directed inquiry into damages would determine, if agreed to by the court, what harm or loss any investors have suffered as a result of the alleged breaches.</p>

<div> SEC, PCAOB, Erica Y. Williams, Chairperson, appointment<br />
Summary:<br />SEC appoints Erica Y. Williams as PCAOB Chairperson for a second term, overseeing public company audits and standards. Williams has extensive SEC and legal experience. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the appointment of Erica Y. Williams to a second term as Chairperson of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) beginning on Oct. 25, 2024, and running through Oct. 24, 2029.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank Erica for her leadership and am pleased that she will continue to serve as Chairperson of the PCAOB,&rdquo; said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. &ldquo;I also thank the PCAOB staff and the Board for their diligent work to ensure that public company financial disclosures can be trusted by investors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>SEC Chief Accountant Paul Munter added, &ldquo;I look forward to continuing to work with Chairperson Williams to further the PCAOB&rsquo;s long-overdue plan to modernize standards and improve audit quality to promote investor protection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>"I am honored to have Chair Gensler and the Commission's confidence and grateful for the opportunity to continue working alongside my fellow Board Members and the talented and dedicated PCAOB staff to protect investors," said Chair Williams. "I'm proud of our work together and eager to continue executing our mission on behalf of investors who depend on U.S. capital markets to build their American dream."</p>
<p>Prior to joining the PCAOB in January 2022, Erica Y. Williams was a litigation partner with Kirkland &amp; Ellis LLP. She previously spent more than a decade in various roles at the SEC, including as Deputy Chief of Staff to three former SEC Chairs and Assistant Chief Litigation Counsel in the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement trial unit.

<title>SEC Charges Founder Of AI Hiring Startup Joonko With Fraud</title>

<div> charged, fraud, artificial intelligence, SEC, investor <br />
<br />
Ilit Raz, CEO of Joonko, charged by SEC for defrauding investors of $21M with false statements about company's clients, revenue, and AI capabilities. Criminal charges also filed. <br />
Summary: <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Ilit Raz, CEO and founder of the now-shuttered artificial intelligence recruitment startup Joonko, with defrauding investors of at least $21 million by making false and misleading statements about the quantity and quality of Joonko&rsquo;s customers, the number of candidates on its platform, and the company&rsquo;s revenue.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Joonko claimed to use artificial intelligence to help clients find diverse and underrepresented candidates to fulfill their diversity, equity, and inclusion hiring goals. To raise money for Joonko, the complaint alleges that Raz falsely told investors that Joonko had more than 100 customers, including Fortune 500 companies, and provided investors with fabricated testimonials from several companies expressing their appreciation for Joonko and praising its effectiveness. Raz also allegedly lied to investors that Joonko had earned more than $1 million in revenue and was working with more than 100,000 active job candidates. When an investor grew suspicious of Raz&rsquo;s claims, Raz allegedly provided the investor with falsified bank statements and forged contracts in an effort to conceal the fraud. According to the complaint, the scheme unraveled in mid-2023 when the investor confronted Raz, who admitted to forging bank statements and contracts and lying about Joonko&rsquo;s revenue and number of customers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We allege that Raz engaged in an old school fraud using new school buzzwords like &lsquo;artificial intelligence&rsquo; and &lsquo;automation,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;As more and more people seek out AI-related investment opportunities, we will continue to police the markets against AI-washing and the type of misconduct alleged in today&rsquo;s complaint. But at the same time, it is critical for investors to beware of companies exploiting the fanfare around artificial intelligence to raise funds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges Raz with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and seeks a permanent injunction, civil money penalties, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and an officer-and-director bar against Raz.</p>
<p>In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Raz.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Alicia Guo, Ariel Atlas, Neil Hendelman, and Lindsay S. Moilanen and was supervised by Sheldon L. Pollock of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Guo and Ms. Atlas, and supervised by Daniel Loss and Mr. Pollock. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Southern District of New York and the FBI.</p>

<div> SEC, capital markets, securities laws, agency, international dialogue <br />
Summary:<br />
SEC Chair welcomes Class of 2024 to International Institute. Discusses capital markets, securities laws, and SEC's role. Emphasizes international cooperation. <div>
<p>Thank you, YJ, for that kind introduction.</p>
<p>As is customary, I&rsquo;d like to note that my views are my own as Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and I am not speaking on behalf of my fellow Commissioners or the staff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to welcome you&mdash;the nearly 120 members of the &ldquo;Class of 2024&rdquo; attending the SEC&rsquo;s International Institute on Securities Market Growth and Development.</p>
<p>Traveling from approximately 70 different countries and territories, and spending the next week and a half here, is a big commitment on your part.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re investing in your own human capital, taking time out of your busy lives, and learning about our securities markets, U.S. securities laws, and the SEC.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re also investing in your nation&rsquo;s capital by learning about how to promote your capital markets to the best they can be.</p>
<p>This is the 30<span>th</span>&nbsp;International Institute. It&rsquo;s also the 90<span>th</span>&nbsp;anniversary of this agency&rsquo;s formation. One of the SEC&rsquo;s founding principles is what President Roosevelt called &ldquo;complete and truthful disclosure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the spirit of disclosure, I will share that the SEC has a direct interest in sharing our expertise and experience with each of you.</p>
<p>First, robust regulatory frameworks across the globe limits opportunities for fraudsters to harm U.S. investors when investing overseas. It also limits opportunities for regulatory arbitrage.</p>
<p>Second, meeting the highest standards for international cooperation will ensure that you have the legal authority and tools to assist us on regulatory, enforcement, and supervisory matters, when needed.</p>
<h2>History of the Institute</h2>
<p>This program has its roots in post-World War II. President Truman envisioned a coordinated U.S. effort to assist its allies around the world and help them develop their own market-based economies.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-iismgd-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Then, just months before the Berlin Wall collapsed in 1989, SEC Chair Richard Breeden created the Office of International Affairs.</p>
<p>He crafted a global strategy to assist other countries in developing their capital markets, which began this very program. It&rsquo;s a great example of how this agency has continually responded to the unique challenges of the times.</p>
<p>Let me now turn to say a bit about our capital markets, our securities laws, and who we are as an agency.</p>
<h2>Capital markets</h2>
<p>First, the U.S. has the deepest, most liquid capital markets in the world. At over $110 trillion, we&rsquo;re over 40 percent of the world&rsquo;s capital markets, though we&rsquo;re only roughly 24 percent of the world&rsquo;s economy.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-iismgd-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Second, the U.S. capital markets benefit from significant engagement from everyday investors. Over half of American households, representing more than 115 million individual investors, own registered funds.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-iismgd-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>About 58 percent of U.S. households own stocks, up from 52 percent in 2016.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-iismgd-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p>Third, the U.S. has long benefitted from robust competition between nonbanks and banks. In fact, each of the registered funds and private funds sectors surpasses the size of the banking sector. Further, U.S. debt capital markets facilitate 75 percent of debt financing of non-financial corporations. In Europe, the U.K., and Asia, only 12-29 percent is raised in capital markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-iismgd-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p>Today, registered investment advisers advise 57 million clients with respect to $129 trillion in assets. Roughly speaking, that breaks down to advising on more than $32 trillion in registered funds, $30 trillion in private funds, and nearly $50 trillion in separately managed accounts.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-iismgd-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p>Let me put this in context. The entire U.S. banking system is $23 trillion.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-iismgd-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;Thus, the capital markets are nearly five times the size of our banking sector. Each of these sectors, in and of themselves, are larger than our banking sector.</p>
<p>Fourth, we also have robust competition between both public and private markets. Our public markets have approximately 7,400 actively reporting issuers, of which more than 4,000 companies listed on U.S. exchanges.</p>
<p>With the privileges of dollar and capital markets dominance also comes real responsibilities and challenges. Given how integrated our capital markets are into the world&rsquo;s capital markets, events in our capital markets can flow into others&mdash;and, events in yours can flow into ours.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen this time and again. For instance, in the 2008 mortgage crisis, we exported instability to the rest of the world, which then had further reverberations back into the United States.</p>
<p>In terms of challenges, foremost of course is that nothing stands still. The economies, rule of law, and capital markets of other countries will continue to evolve and compete for leadership.</p>
<p>Technology and business models continue to change. Further, nation states, including the United States, can be prone to policy mistakes.</p>
<h2>Our securities laws</h2>
<p>Our securities laws play a crucial role behind our success. After the 1929 market crash, President Roosevelt signed the first of the federal securities laws in 1933. He followed a year later with the passage of the Securities Exchange Act&mdash;making June 6, 1934, our birthday at the SEC.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-iismgd-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p>Roosevelt went on to work with Congress to enact five more securities laws, ending with the Investment Company Act and Investment Advisers Act of 1940.</p>
<p>Taken together, they formed the foundation of our capital markets. These laws were about protecting the investing public by ensuring they had what Roosevelt called, &ldquo;complete and truthful disclosure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC was created to ensure that the markets worked free of fraud and manipulation&mdash;and that investment advisers carried their duties to the clients they advised.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our laws have been updated over the years in response to changes in technology, markets, business models, and, from time to time, inevitable turmoil in the markets.</p>
<p>At its core, the SEC has a three-part mission: protect investors; maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and facilitate capital formation.</p>
<h2>Who we are as an agency</h2>
<p>That brings me back to who we, the SEC, are as an agency and as a Commission.</p>
<p>Our responsibility is vast. We oversee approximately 40,000 entities&mdash;including more than 13,000 registered funds, more than 15,400 investment advisers, more than 3,400 broker-dealers, 24 national securities exchanges, 103 alternative trading systems, 10 credit rating agencies, 33 self-regulatory organizations, and six active registered clearing agencies, among other entities.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re led by a five-member Commission appointed by the President&mdash;which, by law, requires that no more than three Commissioners can be from his or her party.</p>
<p>The SEC has nearly 5,000 staff here in Washington and in regional offices across the nation. Many may think of us as the largest group of securities lawyers in the world, with over 2,000 lawyers at the agency&mdash;but we do a lot more. Our work is organized across 6 main divisions and 25 offices.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-iismgd-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<p>The Divisions of Enforcement and Examinations account for about half of the SEC&rsquo;s staff. Without examination of compliance with and enforcement of our rules and laws, we can&rsquo;t instill the trust necessary for our markets to thrive.</p>
<p>Last year, we filed 784 enforcement actions and conducted approximately 3,000 examinations.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-iismgd-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;Stamping out fraud, manipulation, and abuse lowers risk in the system. It protects investors and reduces the cost of capital. The whole economy benefits from that.</p>
<p>Think about a football match without referees. It would quickly break down&mdash;it would start to look like rugby, and get worse from there.</p>
<p>Next, we have three programmatic divisions.</p>
<p>The Division of Corporation Finance oversees the disclosures of public companies so that investors can make informed investment decisions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Division of Investment Management oversees the funds and advisers that steward nest eggs for millions of American investors.</p>
<p>The Division of Trading and Markets serves on the front line for maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets. Market monitoring and supervision are essential parts of the Division&rsquo;s activity&mdash;especially during times of market stress.</p>
<p>Intertwined in everything we do is the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, which supports the Commission in every role, whether it&rsquo;s enforcement or examinations, monitoring the markets, or rulemaking.</p>
<p>As I said, we also have 25 other offices that contribute to our mission every day.</p>
<h2>Closing</h2>
<p>Finance knows no geographical boundaries. With a tap of a smart phone, money and risk can move across the globe in less than a second.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what makes it so important to foster international dialogue and coordination regarding global capital markets.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also why, with appropriate safeguards around confidentiality, that we&rsquo;ve come to collaborate on information sharing around our examination and enforcement efforts.</p>
<p>In the coming days, you&rsquo;ll hear from SEC staff about securities regulation, including building strong disclosure, examination, and enforcement programs.</p>
<p>They also will share lessons learned on oversight, creating an effective secondary market for securities, capital formation, and international cooperation.</p>
<p>Finally, they will cover new and emerging issues in data analytics, fintech, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that you all play an important role in our international capital markets. You were hand-selected by your agencies to represent your nations.</p>
<p>I encourage you to invest in the human capital in this room. Look around&mdash;there are likely future finance ministers and world leaders amongst you. Some of the alumni of this Institute have gone on to become Chairs of securities regulators and Ministers of Finance. Some have taken on leadership roles at the highest levels of their governments.</p>
<p>Finally, beyond all the technical skills and networking you take home with you, I hope you also remember the words of President Roosevelt&rsquo;s advisor, Felix Frankfurter, who would go on to be an Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p>90 years ago, when Roosevelt was first setting up the SEC, Frankfurter wrote: &ldquo;You need administrators who have stamina and do not weary of the fight, who are moved neither by blandishments nor fears, who in a word, unite public zeal with unusual capacity.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-iismgd-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></p>
<p>I hope we can all answer Frankfurter&rsquo;s call. Thank you.</p>

<title>Cboe Announces Expanded Collaboration With FTSE Russell To Drive Innovation In Digital Asset Derivatives</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> collaboration, derivatives, digital assets, FTSE Russell, Cboe
<br />
Cboe and FTSE Russell are collaborating to develop new derivatives products for digital assets, beginning with options tied to the FTSE Bitcoin and Ethereum indices. They aim to provide trusted, transparent, and regulated trading options in response to growing investor demand for crypto exposure. Cboe is expanding its digital assets business, consolidating its US futures products onto one exchange and introducing new products to complement existing initiatives. The planned cash-settled index options on the FTSE Bitcoin and Ethereum indices will provide a more comprehensive product suite and foster greater liquidity and hedging opportunities in the digital asset markets. 
Summary: <div>
<p>Cboe Global Markets, Inc. (Cboe: CBOE), the world's leading derivatives and securities exchange network, today announced it is expanding its collaboration with FTSE Russell, a leading global index provider, to drive product innovation in the digital assets space. This new initiative builds on Cboe and FTSE Russell's longstanding relationship and will leverage their combined expertise to develop new derivatives products, potentially beginning with cash-settled index options tied to the FTSE&nbsp;<span>Bitcoin</span>&nbsp;Index and the FTSE&nbsp;<span>Ethereum</span>&nbsp;Index.</p>
<div class="dombanner"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The collaboration underscores the companies' shared commitment to growing the digital assets space and expanding investor access to the asset class. Cboe's plans to list cash-settled index options on FTSE's indices, subject to regulatory approvals, would help meet growing investor demand for exchange-traded derivatives to gain and manage&nbsp;<span>crypto</span>&nbsp;exposures in a trusted, transparent and U.S.-regulated trading environment.</p>
<p>"For many years, Cboe and FTSE Russell have worked together to offer index options based on FTSE Russell indices, which have grown into some of the world's most actively traded products," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Catherine Clay</span>, Global Head of Derivatives at Cboe. "Our expanded relationship today mirrors that successful model of collaboration, combining Cboe's unrivalled derivatives expertise with FTSE's world-class indexing capabilities to potentially bring new solutions to the digital assets space. Derivatives has long been an area where Cboe excels, and now we are strategically expanding our expertise into the digital assets space. As these two asset classes converge, we look forward to driving continued innovation and our relationship with FTSE Russell will be key to this strategy."</p>
<p>The FTSE&nbsp;<span>Bitcoin</span>&nbsp;Index and FTSE&nbsp;<span>Ethereum</span>&nbsp;Index are part of the FTSE Digital Asset Indices Series, which is developed in partnership with Digital Asset Research (DAR). These indices are designed to capture the performance of&nbsp;<span>bitcoin</span>&nbsp;and ether, as determined by the FTSE DAR Reference Price, and provide institutional-quality, liquidity-screened exposure to the digital asset market.</p>
<p>Talking about the expanded collaboration,&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Fiona Bassett</span>, CEO of FTSE Russell, said: "We are delighted to continue working alongside Cboe Global Markets, realizing our mutual commitment to enable new asset innovation in financial markets. Our indices are used by some of the largest&nbsp;<span>crypto</span>&nbsp;asset managers in the world for their best-in-class data and processes built to manage regulatory and trading risk &ndash; critical differentiators for the data in this asset class."</p>
<p><b>Cboe's Broader Digital Assets Franchise</b></p>
<p>Cboe's expanded collaboration with FTSE Russell follows the recent realignment of its digital assets business &ndash; a move that will consolidate all Cboe U.S. futures products, including digital asset futures, onto one exchange, subject to regulatory review, powered by Cboe's broader global derivatives franchise and technology platform.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the collaboration is expected to introduce new products that will complement Cboe's existing digital assets initiatives. These currently include the listing and trading of cash-settled&nbsp;<span>bitcoin</span>&nbsp;and ether margin futures, along with spot&nbsp;<span>bitcoin</span>&nbsp;ETFs, where Cboe BZX Equities Exchange lists six out of the 11 ETFs listed domestically. Additionally, Cboe submitted five of the eight recently SEC-approved rule filings to list ETFs tied to the price of ether.</p>
<p>"Our plans to develop&nbsp;<span>bitcoin</span>&nbsp;and ether index options come at an exciting time as more investors of all types enter the&nbsp;<span>crypto</span>&nbsp;markets and are increasingly seeking exchange-listed derivatives to manage their&nbsp;<span>crypto</span>&nbsp;exposures," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Rob Hocking</span>, Head of Product Innovation at Cboe. "Many of our customers are already trading Cboe-listed digital asset products, whether margin futures or ETFs, tied to&nbsp;<span>bitcoin</span>&nbsp;and ether. The launch of cash-settled index options will be additive &ndash; resulting in a more comprehensive product suite and helping to foster greater liquidity and hedging opportunities in these markets. We believe that derivatives will drive the next phase of the digital asset market's maturation, and we're excited about the potential benefits that cash-settled index options can bring to the space."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cboe intends to share more details about its plans for cash-settled index options on the FTSE&nbsp;<span>Bitcoin</span>&nbsp;Index and the FTSE&nbsp;<span>Ethereum</span>&nbsp;Index potentially later this year.</p>

<title>DTCC And Cboe Clear Europe To Introduce New Clearing Workflow For OTC Cash Equities Trades And Deliver Enhanced Efficiencies To The Industry</title>

<div> DTCC, Cboe Clear Europe, post-trade workflow, OTC cash equities, settlement efficiencies
Summary:
DTCC and Cboe Clear Europe collaborate to enhance post-trade workflow for OTC cash equities, increasing settlement efficiencies and reducing risks. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>DTCC, the premier post-trade market infrastructure for the global financial services industry, today announced it is working with Cboe Clear Europe to deliver an enhanced post-trade workflow for over-the-counter (OTC) cash equities trades to help increase settlement efficiencies across UK and European markets.</p>
<p>DTCC, the leading post-trade market infrastructure, will collaborate with Cboe Clear Europe, the largest and most-connected pan-European cash equities CCP, to increase post-trade efficiencies while providing clients with the benefits of an established risk management counterparty. The service will bring OTC cash equities trades into Cboe Clear Europe&rsquo;s cleared environment, which can then be netted against on-exchange transactions for settlement purposes, delivering potentially significant efficiencies.</p>
<p>As part of this initiative, DTCC and Cboe Clear Europe will develop a proof of concept that links DTCC CTM's tri-party trade matching workflow with Cboe Clear Europe. This connection will allow Prime Brokers to receive a golden copy of transaction details when a match is achieved between a Hedge Fund and Executing Broker via DTCC&rsquo;s CTM service. Once the Prime Broker enters into this tri-party match, CTM automatically sends those matched trades to the CCP, providing netting and clearing benefits to mutual clients.</p>
<p>The new workflow will help reduce operational and settlement risk, as well as post-trade friction as additional markets consider and prepare for accelerated settlement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are pleased to be working with Cboe Clear Europe on this important initiative to bring greater post-trade efficiencies to the industry as the global markets look to accelerate to a T+1 settlement cycle. Cboe Clear Europe&rsquo;s extensive venue coverage combined with CTM&rsquo;s large client base will deliver increased operational efficiency and netting opportunities across European trading venues,&rdquo; said Val Wotton, Managing Director and General Manager, DTCC Institutional Trade Processing. &ldquo;DTCC remains committed to bringing greater post-trade automation to increase efficiencies for global financial markets as they work toward implementing accelerated settlement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are excited to be the first CCP to connect to DTCC&rsquo;s CTM tri-party matching workflow,&rdquo; said Vikesh Patel, President, Cboe Clear Europe. &ldquo;This joint solution enables us to bring greater efficiencies to our clients, helping to optimise their current post-trade workflows and operational processes as the global financial markets look to accelerate settlement cycles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The benefits of this initiative include reductions in post-trade processing time, risks associated with OTC transactions and settlement costs between Executing Brokers and Prime Brokers. It is anticipated that the joint solution will also help facilitate a reduction of capital requirements when moving from OTC to CCP settlement as well as lower trade fails and defaults.</p>
<p>CTM is DTCC Institutional Trade Processing&rsquo;s (ITP&rsquo;s) central matching service for cross-border and domestic transactions across multiple asset classes, including OTC and on exchange cash equity transactions. Today, there are 6,000+ clients in more than 80 countries using CTM to streamline workflows.</p>
<p>Cboe Clear Europe is a pan-European Central Counterparty, the most connected CCP in Europe - offering clearing services to 46 trading venues. Cboe Clear Europe is approved to clear cash equities, depositary receipts, ETFs and equity derivatives (index futures and options and equity options) contracts.</p>

<div> Trustees, IFRS Foundation, Monitoring Board, IASB, ISSB <br />
Summary: The IFRS Foundation Monitoring Board discussed sustainability standards, oversight of IASB and ISSB, and the development of new accounting standards. Effective governance and funding were also emphasized. <br /> <div>
<p>During last week&rsquo;s meeting of the IFRS Foundation Monitoring Board in Singapore, the Monitoring Board discussed the activities of the Trustees of the IFRS Foundation, including their oversight responsibilities in respect of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB). The meeting was joined by the members of the Trustees of the IFRS Foundation under the leadership of Erkki Liikanen, Chair of the Trustees, as well as Andreas Barckow, Chair of the IASB, and Emmanuel Faber, Chair of the ISSB.</p>
<p>Among other activities, the Monitoring Board welcomed the finalization of the&nbsp;<em>Inaugural Jurisdictional Guide for the adoption or other use of ISSB Standards</em>&nbsp;in May 2024. The Monitoring Board members shared their views on different ways to adopt, apply or make use of sustainability-related disclosures. They also acknowledged the usefulness of consistency, comparability and interoperability of sustainability-related information for the benefit of investors and the ISSB&rsquo;s capacity-building efforts as jurisdictions consider incorporation of climate-related and other disclosures in their corporate reporting regimes. In this context, effective functioning of a multi-location model<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;would be essential for close engagement with stakeholders in various regions in the ISSB&rsquo;s effort to promote the implementation of IFRS S1 and S2 around the globe.</p>
<p>The Monitoring Board noted the importance of rigorous due process in the development of high-quality IFRS Accounting Standards and the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards and that the Monitoring Board will continue to collaborate with the Trustees to ensure both sets of Standards are developed under robust governance, due process and oversight while ensuring independence in their individual standard setting activities. In this context, the Monitoring Board took particular note of the finalization of the two new IFRS Accounting Standards, IFRS 18&nbsp;<em>Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements</em>&nbsp;and IFRS 19&nbsp;<em>Subsidiaries without Public Accountability: Disclosures</em>&nbsp;by the IASB and the recent decision by the ISSB to commence research projects related to biodiversity, ecosystems and ecosystem services as well as human capital.</p>
<p>As for the broad strategies of the IFRS Foundation, the Monitoring Board reaffirmed that stable and diversified funding should be achieved in a transparent manner in support of both Standard Setting Boards&rsquo; activities. The Monitoring Board also noted the importance of connectivity between the two Boards under the &ldquo;Two Boards under One Foundation&rdquo; model.</p>
<p>Takashi Nagaoka, Chairman of the IFRS Monitoring Board and Deputy Commissioner for International Affairs of Japan Financial Services Agency said:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I am pleased to co-host a discussion between the IFRS Foundation Trustees and the Monitoring Board members at an important juncture where the ISSB finalized its &ldquo;Inaugural Jurisdictional Guide for the adoption or other use of ISSB Standards,&rdquo; providing much-awaited support to jurisdictional approaches, and the IASB released two new accounting standards, IFRS 18 and 19, which is the first such output of new accounting standards in over six years. The IFRS Foundation Trustees and the Monitoring Board members are aligned in support of good governance of the Foundation to promote sustainability-related disclosures and continuing development of high-quality financial reporting standards to serve the capital markets globally.&rdquo;</em></p>

<title>World Federation Of Exchanges: Demystifying Tokenisation: Dispelling Myths, Explaining The Muted Traction, And Setting Out The Starting Point For Regulation</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/world-federation-of-exchanges-demystifying-tokenisation-dispelling-myths-expl/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Tokenisation, traditional assets, benefits, limitations, regulatory certainty
<br />
Tokenisation is a modern version of traditional finance with benefits such as fractional ownership and enhanced liquidity, but it has limitations and regulatory uncertainty.
<br /><br />Summary: 
Tokenisation offers new opportunities but faces limitations in technology, infrastructure, costs, and regulatory uncertainty. <div>
<p>As the European Commission today gathers stakeholders in Brussels to discuss the further tokenisation of assets, the WFE (the global industry association for exchanges and clearing houses) has published a paper, &ldquo;Demystifying Tokenisation: Embracing the Future&rdquo;, that provides a reality check: we shouldn&rsquo;t curtail the further development of tokenisation, nor should we run blindly towards it.<br /><br />Rather than a radical departure from the norm, tokenised traditional assets should be viewed as nothing more than a modernised and innovative iteration of traditional finance, providing new opportunities for investors and market participants. This is one of the many ways in which exchanges continue to invest serious effort and money in innovation.<br /><br />Tokenisation has many benefits that could make it a natural next step for financial markets. Fractional ownership, allowing multiple investors to own a share of an asset thereby lowering the capital requirement for individuals to invest in high-value assets; enhanced liquidity, which arises from fractionalisation enabling access to investments that may have been out of reach for many; and enhanced trust could all lead to greater financial inclusion, diversification and ultimately economic growth.&nbsp;<br /><br />Some of the supposed benefits are overexaggerated or frankly don&rsquo;t exist at all. Continuous 24/7 trading &ndash; if truly needed &ndash; can be achieved without tokenisation. Disintermediated models face conflicts of interest and instantaneous settlement in tokenised trading may have unpredictable timing, affecting market liquidity and trading costs, especially if assets and funding need to be blocked prior to execution.<br /><br />With over 15 years passed since the Bitcoin white paper, tokenisation has not &ldquo;taken off&rdquo; in traditional markets and there are several reasons why:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DLT has limitations</strong>, particularly in high transaction environments, as the technology is currently not fast enough to execute and settle all the trades running through a highly active exchange in any given moment. There are also other limitations such as storage problems caused by the distributed ledger.</li>
<li>The nature of different DLT creations means that there is a&nbsp;<strong>fragmented infrastructure&nbsp;</strong>with tokenised assets managed on different blockchains which are not interoperable. Financial institutions would have to build connections with each platform, leading to significant operational costs and challenges, meaning there are only marginal efficiency gains in certain markets, particularly those that are already liquid.</li>
<li>There are&nbsp;<strong>significant sunk costs</strong>&nbsp;involved in implementing DLT. It is a capital-intensive investment to move to the new technology and build the relevant infrastructure. These costs would be felt across the market, from infrastructure providers to market participants and end users. Even then, there may not be sufficient demand if customers do not have the correct infrastructure or capital to invest.</li>
<li>The lack of&nbsp;<strong>regulatory certainty</strong>, which is improving thanks to the efforts of regulators and industry, persists. Most jurisdictions&rsquo; bodies of law do not reflect the creation of tokenised assets, leaving firms apprehensive. Anything that is, in effect, a financial instrument, should be treated in the same way, regardless of whether it is tokenised.</li>
<li>The lack of adoption further inhibits tokenisation because, without widespread use, there are&nbsp;<strong>no network effects</strong>&nbsp;and there is little value to firms and exchanges to update their technology stacks to incorporate tokenised assets.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tokenisation should be seen as a creative and modern version of traditional finance that offers new possibilities to investors and market players. However, current limitations mean that it won&rsquo;t be right for every type of asset.<br /><br /><strong>James Auliffe, Manager, Regulatory Affairs at the WFE commented,</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;The fundamentals of tokenisation and the infrastructures these assets trade on need to be better understood. Regulation in this area should reflect that tokenisation is a natural evolution in the financial industry, rather than a drastic break from the norm. Its usage is suitable in particular environments and for particular assets, but in these cases, market participants can reap great benefits.&rdquo;<br /><br />The full paper can be read&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://world-exchanges.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=48ddcbc11eb58f141a51219ea&amp;id=10c6fc2baf&amp;e=979576350c" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

The move further strengthens the bank&rsquo;s customer services and competitive position as the primary bank of choice across affluent, international, corporate and wealth management segments.</p>
<p>The successful transformation program gives Eurobank Cyprus an agile, future-ready banking platform and forms a group wide IT blueprint for other subsidiaries in Eurobank Group. It involved replacing 85% of the bank&rsquo;s IT landscape and included Temenos Core and Digital (formerly Infinity) together with Wealth Management, Financial Crime Mitigation (FCM), Analytics and Payments.</p>
<p>Through this program, Eurobank Cyprus modernized completely its front-to-back operations, centralizing operations such as payments and wealth management back office and moving several transactional activities to digital channels for client self-service. The scope of the change impacts the entire bank&rsquo;s customer base, including individual and business customers served by its Corporate, Affluent, International and Private Banking divisions.</p>
<p><b>Michalis Louis, Chief Executive Officer, Eurobank Cyprus, commented:</b>&nbsp;&ldquo;The go-live with Temenos is a major milestone that allows us to transform the bank at a high level. This was a complex and challenging project, but it was expertly delivered by our internal teams and Temenos working closely together. The new Temenos platform gives us business&nbsp;agility&nbsp;to achieve our goals and opens the roadmap for further expansion, enhancements and growing the Bank&rsquo;s position as a market leader through the latest technology. We look forward to building on this success for customers in Cyprus and across the Eurobank Group&rdquo;.</p>
<p><b>Mark Yamin-Ali, Managing Director - Europe, Temenos, said:</b>&nbsp;&ldquo;I wish to congratulate Eurobank Cyprus for its vision and execution in transforming the bank for the modern digital age. Eurobank has always been a pioneer, and the move to Temenos including a full breadth of banking capabilities from digital and core banking to payments on an agile, open platform will enable the bank to continue to drive innovation, deliver an outstanding customer experience across all segments and grow sustainably. Temenos has enjoyed a long and successful partnership with Eurobank Group, and we are delighted to support the bank and its future success in Cyprus.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Eurobank Cyprus is now well positioned to advance its long-term business strategy of expanding its banking services in addition to ESG compliant banking and advancing sustainability through paperless and efficient banking operations. The Bank has also recently received four prestigious awards by Euromoney Magazine for Best International Private Bank in Cyprus as well as Best for Digital Solutions, Best for Sustainability and Best for High-Net-Worth Clients. These awards are a testament to the Bank&rsquo;s effective use of technology.</p>
<p>Focused on innovation and sustainability, Eurobank Group designs and implements initiatives using cutting-edge technology and following ESG rules.</p>

<div> monitoring, regional banks, securities investment, risk management, financial institutions
Summary: The FSA monitors regional banks' securities investment, targeting high-risk banks. It seeks to improve risk management and governance in financial institutions. <div>
<p class="indent mb0">The Financial Services Agency (FSA), from the perspective of maintaining the stability of the financial system in Japan, conducts intensive monitoring of regional banks' securities investment, targeting those with large risk-taking in securities investment.</p>
<p class="indent mt0">The report summarizes key points and observed cases during the monitoring process.</p>
<p class="indent">It is intended not only for the targeted financial institutions but also as a reference for risk management by other financial institutions (primarily those institutions with substantial risk exposure to securities investment).</p>
<p class="indent">The FSA will continue to encourage financial institutions&rsquo; enhancement of their securities investment management and risk management systems and demonstration of effective risk governance through monitoring focused on such issues in the future. We expect financial institutions to put effort into further improving their risk management practices.</p>

<div> Feedback, Derivative Issuer Licences, Leverage, Suitability, Monitoring

Summary:
The FMA seeks feedback on potential changes to Derivative Issuer licences, particularly regarding leverage and investor suitability. Changes aim to align with international norms.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW191560321 BCX8">The Financial Markets Authority (FMA) &ndash; Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko &ndash; is seeking feedback on potential changes to the standard conditions imposed on Derivative Issuer (DI) licences. The changes relate to leverage and the suitability of investors for derivative trading. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW191560321 BCX8">The proposed changes have been identified in the FMA&rsquo;s 2020 Derivatives Issuer Sector Risk Assessment (SRA) and subsequent monitoring of the sector. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Proposed leverage standard condition</span></p>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW191560321 BCX8">Investing with leverage amplifies the risk by enabling an investor to have much greater exposure to an increase and decrease in value. Currently, there is no limit to the amount of leverage a licensed DI can offer to retail investors in New Zealand. For example, while some licensed DIs limit contracts for difference (CFDs) leverage to 30:1, others offer up to 500:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW191560321 BCX8">The higher the level of leverage, the greater the financial impact felt from price volatility. For example, if a trade is leveraged 10:1, an investor with $1,000 in their account can control a position in an underlying asset valued at $10,000. When a position is leveraged 500:1, that same investor with $1,000 can control a $500,000 position. Leverage can enable efficient asset allocation, but highly leveraged derivatives mean retail investors may experience much higher losses. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW191560321 BCX8">The proposed standard condition is similar to those in the UK, Europe and Australia and varies depending on the underlying asset class of the derivative. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Changes to suitability standard condition&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW191560321 BCX8">The SRA and subsequent monitoring indicated some licensed DIs were not always taking sufficient steps to determine suitability for the investor. Monitoring also found that some of the suitability assessments were poorly designed or ineffective. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW191560321 BCX8">Licensed DIs offer a wide range of derivatives with varying degrees of risk. While some are straightforward, others, like binary options or cryptocurrency CFDs, can be opaque or volatile and are therefore riskier.</span></p>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW191560321 BCX8">The FMA considers it both appropriate and necessary to revise the suitability standard condition to ensure that DIs ask retail investors for relevant information needed to assess whether the derivative is suitable.</span></p>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW191560321 BCX8">The FMA has revised the suitability condition to require that DIs must determine whether the retail investor understands the derivative before investing.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW191560321 BCX8">Director of Markets, Investors and Reporting, John Horner said: &ldquo;The proposed changes are about ensuring retail investors fully understand the nature and extent of the risk around derivatives and to align protection measures with international norms.&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW191560321 BCX8">The consultation period runs until 7 August.&nbsp;</span></p>

<div> Securities and Exchange Commission, 90th anniversary, Securities Exchange Act of 1934, market trust, economic welfare
Summary:
SEC celebrates 90th anniversary, highlighting the importance of Securities Exchange Act of 1934, market trust, and economic welfare for everyday Americans. <div>
<p>Good afternoon. As is customary, I&rsquo;d like to note that my views are my own as Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and I am not speaking on behalf of my fellow Chairs or the staff.</p>
<p>I want to welcome the public and thank you for tuning in as we celebrate the 90<span>th</span>&nbsp;anniversary of a milestone in American history.</p>
<p>In the depths of the Great Depression, President Roosevelt worked with Congress to enact the Securities Exchange Act of 1934&mdash;creating the SEC and making June 6 our official birthday.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-90thsec-060624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>It's just one of a handful of the original securities laws. But taken together, those laws and this agency put our markets on a path in which investors and issuers alike can have trust in the markets.</p>
<p>These time-tested laws have played an important part in boosting the economic welfare of everyday Americans.</p>
<p>For anyone who doubts the significance of these laws and regulations, think about the schemes and frauds throughout the 1920s that contributed to the Great Depression.</p>
<p>For the sports fans, imagine what would happen to teams, athletes, and fans without fair competition.</p>
<p>The SEC remains a steward of trust, efficiency, and competition within our markets. While the U.S. is roughly 24 percent of the world&rsquo;s economy, it represents over 40 percent of the world&rsquo;s capital markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-90thsec-060624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s part of why the U.S. dollar is the world&rsquo;s leading currency.</p>
<p>I want to close with two letters FDR received before he signed our founding document.</p>
<p>On April 12, 1934, Richard Whitney, then-President of the New York Stock Exchange, wrote to Roosevelt that he was &ldquo;sincerely disturbed as to what may happen if unsound legislation is enacted.&rdquo; He went on to write about Sam Rayburn&rsquo;s modified bill, saying, &ldquo;I am confident that its enactment would be a disaster.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-90thsec-060624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>A few months later, FDR received a letter from Felix Frankfurter, his adviser who later would become a Supreme Court justice. Frankfurter wrote regarding the &ldquo;effective administration&rdquo; the SEC would need to succeed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need administrators,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;who have stamina and do not weary of the fight, who are moved neither by blandishments nor fears, who in a word, unite public zeal with unusual capacity.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-90thsec-060624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p>90 years later, thousands of SEC staff and over 100 Commissioners and Chairs have answered Frankfurter&rsquo;s call. I thank them for their service. I thank them for their rectitude. Contrary to Whitney&rsquo;s belief, the SEC has made it work for investors, issuers, and the over $110 trillion markets we oversee today.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<div> Meeting, Global Markets Advisory Committee, GMAC, recommendations, Subcommittee
Summary:
- Thanking attendees for participation
- Update on status of GMAC recommendations
- Welcome new members
- Overview of today's agenda
- Recognition of impactful work of GMAC
- Highlighting importance of GMAC's work <div>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Good morning. It&rsquo;s great to convene another Global Markets Advisory Committee (GMAC) meeting in New York. I want to start by thanking everyone for taking the time to travel here&mdash;from all across the United States, and as far away as London, Frankfurt, Tokyo and more&mdash;to share your expertise with the GMAC. I know that a lot of time and work goes into preparing for these meetings, so I also want to thank the GMAC members and Subcommittee members for their service, and our presenters for joining us today. The GMAC&rsquo;s recommendations have real impact and add value to not only the Commission, but also to the international policy dialogue. I especially want to recognize the GMAC&rsquo;s leadership team for your continued stewardship of the GMAC, and all the Subcommittee workstream leads for their tireless efforts. We have a truly impressive group of leaders to examine the issues.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Of course, I want to acknowledge and thank my team: Harry Jung, the GMAC Designated Federal Officer, and Nicholas Elliot, the GMAC Alternate Designated Federal Officer, as well as Meghan Tente and Taylor Foy. And, as always, many thanks to all the CFTC staff in both the New York office and our DC headquarters who made the GMAC&rsquo;s meeting today possible.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>I will provide a brief update on the status of each of the GMAC&rsquo;s 11 recommendations to date and potential next steps. I will also recognize the new members of the GMAC and its Subcommittees, and then provide an overview of today&rsquo;s agenda and speakers.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The GMAC Continues to Deliver</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The GMAC continues to support the growth of liquid and efficient markets and make great progress developing thoughtful recommendations and insightful work product to aid the CFTC, both U.S. and non-U.S. authorities, and indeed, all stakeholders in global markets and financial services.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The GMAC was first created in 1998 to handle the issues associated with globalization and access to markets. These issues remain critically important given the interconnected market environment, everchanging geopolitical dynamics, and emerging and innovative products and tools. Accordingly, global collaboration and coordination amongst authorities is critical to promoting regulatory cohesion and financial stability, and mitigating market fragmentation and systemic risk. That is why the GMAC&rsquo;s mandate includes assessing and informing international standards.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Since it was relaunched, the GMAC has worked to ensure that global markets are well-functioning, promote market integrity and resilience, facilitate compliance, and foster innovation and growth. As the GMAC&rsquo;s sponsor, I&rsquo;m honored to help provide a public venue for preeminent industry experts and regulators to discuss and develop pragmatic solutions to global challenges. I hope we have built a union of minds brought together for a common purpose.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Status of GMAC Recommendations and Next Steps</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>First, I want to commend the GMAC for kicking off last year with a comprehensive stock-take of the most significant current and emerging issues in global markets and the financial system. This global stock-take informed the development of the GMAC&rsquo;s work program and included input from policymakers, dealers, asset managers, liquidity providers, exchanges, trading facilities, clearinghouses, technology service providers, and end users.&nbsp;</span>I particularly note that the GMAC&rsquo;s work is based on data and observations from the markets that will support better policy outcomes.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>In less than a year, the GMAC has adopted 11 recommendations to date on a variety of issues, including U.S. Treasury market liquidity, well-functioning repo and funding markets, exchange volatility controls, T+1 securities settlement, improved collateral management, central counterparty (CCP) default simulation, streamlining trade reporting data to monitor systemic risk, and a foundational digital asset taxonomy to facilitate alignment in regulation across jurisdictions.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>These recommendations have provided data-driven and transparent resources for the CFTC and our counterparts around the world. Just last week, I was honored to present the GMAC&rsquo;s recommendations at the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) 49<span>th</span>&nbsp;Annual Meeting, and I note Chairman Behnam serves as IOSCO Vice Chair. The CFTC has long been a leader in various international fora. The degree of interest in the GMAC&rsquo;s work speaks for itself.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><i><span><span>Global Market Structure Subcommittee (GMSS)</span></span></i></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/9606/GMAC_NewBlockCap110623/download"><i>GMSS Recommendation 1 &ndash; New Block and Cap Sizes</i></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>Appropriately calibrated block and cap sizes are vital to the proper functioning of derivatives markets, including price discovery and transparency. However, the CFTC&rsquo;s new post</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>‐</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>initial block and cap sizes that will require compliance starting July 1, 2024, may negatively affect market liquidity and could significantly raise trading and hedging costs for buy</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>‐</span></span></i><i><span><span>side market participants and end users such as pension and other retirement plans.</span></span></i></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The GMAC recommends extending the compliance date for the post</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>‐</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>initial block and cap sizes for all asset classes to at least December 4, 2024. The GMAC further recommends that, during the extension period, the Commission engages with market participants in discussions and analysis to ensure the post</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>‐</span></span></i><i><span><span>initial block and cap sizes are appropriately tailored, including with respect to current market and macroeconomic conditions.</span></span></i></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The CFTC recently issued a letter that will allow for further study including implications of decreased liquidity and access to markets. I believe that the GMAC&rsquo;s presentations and recommendations were key, especially the market data and observations. I appreciate the support of Commissioner Mersinger, and Chairman Behnam&rsquo;s pragmatic approach and consideration of this issue.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/9731/gmac_Rule1_25d2_110623/download"><i>GMSS Recommendation 2 &ndash; Proposal to Add CCPs as Permitted Counterparties</i></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>Further alignment of SEC and CFTC regulations would support critical risk management functions that will promote well-functioning repo and funding markets. While CFTC rules impose customer protection requirements and permit a futures commission merchant (FCM) or derivatives clearing organization (DCO) to utilize repos to manage customer funds, an SEC-registered clearing agency is not a permitted counterparty under Rule 1.25(d)(2).</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The GMAC recommends that the Commission allow a CCP that meets the definition of a &ldquo;covered clearing agency&rdquo; under SEC Rule 17-Ad-22(a)(5) to be designated a &ldquo;permitted counterparty&rdquo; pursuant to CFTC Rule 1.25(d)(2).</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>I&rsquo;m pleased to note that I have discussed this recommendation with Chairman Behnam, and it will be considered for CFTC rulemaking given that this recommendation will facilitate implementation of the SEC&rsquo;s Treasury clearing mandate.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/9591/gmac_FICC_CME110623/download"><i>GMSS Recommendation 3 &ndash; FICC-CME Customer Position Cross-Margining Structure</i></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>For two decades, the CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have approved cross-margining for Treasury securities transactions and Treasury futures, promoting the efficiency and well-functioning of the U.S. Treasury markets&mdash;the backbone of the global financial system.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The GMAC recommends the Commission make the benefits of cross-margining available to a broader range of sophisticated customers, including those customers that will be subject to the new SEC Treasury clearing requirements, as well as to all customers that voluntarily elect to clear Treasury transactions and will post margin.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>This GMAC recommendation is being actively considered as part of the implementation of the SEC&rsquo;s Treasury clearing mandate. I thank FICC and CME&rsquo;s leadership on this issue. Both are members of the GMAC&rsquo;s Global Market Structure Subcommittee and led this work.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/9736/gmac_FIAExecutiveSummary110623/download"><i>GMSS Recommendation 4 &ndash; Endorsement of Futures Industry Association (FIA) Volatility Controls Mechanism Paper</i></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The efficient management of financial market volatility is paramount. During recent crises in markets, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as in commodity markets, the Futures Industry Association (FIA) has noted the pivotal role volatility control mechanisms have played in preserving market integrity. Consequently, FIA engaged with global derivatives exchanges and market participants to explore the most effective ways to mitigate disruptions while ensuring transparent price discovery.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The GMAC recommends the Commission use the best practices as a tool for understanding exchange market risk controls and when engaging with global regulators and international standard setters.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>This GMAC recommendation has been a beneficial resource to ensuring market integrity during periods of high market volatility, market stress, or other disruptions through effective application of exchange market risk controls and other volatility control mechanisms and sharing best practices across jurisdictions.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/10331/CFTC_GMAC_GM_Structure_Subcommittee_Recommendation-UST_ETF_as_UMR_Collateral/download"><i>GMSS Recommendation 5 - Inclusion of U.S. Treasury ETFs as Eligible Initial Margin Collateral</i></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The use of exchange traded funds (ETFs) that invest in U.S. Treasury bonds has dramatically increased in recent years. While standalone U.S. Treasury bonds can be used as initial margin (IM) collateral for uncleared swaps, ETFs that invest in them are not similarly eligible as collateral, despite being more diversified which can mitigate idiosyncratic risk.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>During many historic volatile trading sessions, certain UST ETFs have acted globally as &ldquo;shock absorbers,&rdquo; providing real-time prices and liquidity. Most notably, during the bond market volatility in 2020, volatility increased in U.S. Treasury bonds as dealers&rsquo; balance sheets were constrained. During this time, many UST ETFs traded at tighter bid-ask spreads than their portfolio of underlying bonds. For example, dislocations in U.S. Treasuries caused the bid/ask spreads of &ldquo;off-the-run&rdquo; bonds with a maturity of 20+ years to widen to almost 20 times that of the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT).</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The inclusion of U.S. Treasury ETFs as eligible IM collateral under the CFTC Margin Rules for Covered Swap Entities would enhance the robustness and resilience of the collateral pipeline. This enhancement, driven by factors such as diversification, liquidity, efficiency, and market stability, could prove beneficial for end-users seeking a wider range of eligible IM, CSEs and the broader financial markets. Allowing UST ETFs as IM collateral could not only help safeguard CSEs from counterparty default, but also help reduce the overall risk in the financial system and limit the potential for contagion arising from uncleared swaps.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The GMAC recommends the CFTC expand the universe of liquid assets that can be posted as uncleared margin, specifically to include U.S. Treasury ETFs.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The CFTC has been considering various aspects of margin and eligible collateral requirements. This GMAC recommendation and associated market data and observations are timely given recent developments in Treasury markets, and have contributed to an informed analysis of appropriate collateral management practices.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><i><span><span>Technical Issues Subcommittee (TIS)</span></span></i></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/9576/gmac_TechnicalSubcommitteeRecommendationsDefault110623/download"><i>TISS Recommendation 1 - Global Default Simulation</i></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>In November 2023, CCP Global conducted a global default simulation across CCPs. Global regulator support of the exercise was critical to its success. The default simulation was arranged in consultation and with input from regulators. It is critical the CFTC continue its support and valuable input, alongside its role in convening regulators and market participants.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The GMAC recommends the CFTC consider inclusion of lessons learned and best practices arising from such simulations into its capacity building programs with, especially, some emerging market regulatory homologues.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The CFTC, through the work of the Office of International Affairs, actively provides technical assistance to many other jurisdictions in the development of effective derivatives markets. CCP resilience, recovery, and resolution has been a top financial stability priority, and the GMAC recommendation has supported ongoing efforts to identify and mitigate systemic risk.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/9721/gmac_TechnicalSubcommitteeRecommendationsMMF110623/download"><i>TIS Recommendation 2 &ndash; MMFs as Eligible Collateral</i></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The CFTC&rsquo;s proposed rule amendment to remove the asset transfer restriction from money market funds (MMFs) used as eligible collateral for non</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>‐</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>cleared margin will harmonize the parameters for MMF use with the UK and resolve one of the impediments to the use of MMFs between the U.S. and European Union (EU). The proposed rule will also allow the CFTC to self</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>‐</span></span></i><i><span><span>align MMFs with its eligible collateral requirements for cleared margin, per CFTC Rule 1.25, which governs the investment of customer money by FCMs without similar asset transfer restrictions.</span></span></i></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The GMAC recommends the Commission: (i) finalize the proposed rule amendment; (ii) encourage the U.S. Prudential Regulators to adopt a corresponding amendment to their non</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>‐</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>cleared margin rules, including allowing third country funds; and (iii) encourage European Union (EU) policy makers to remove the third country fund restriction for eligible collateral from their non</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>‐</span></span></i><i><span><span>cleared margin rules.</span></span></i></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The CFTC currently has a pending rulemaking proposal on MMFs as eligible collateral for non-cleared margin. The GMAC recommendation has provided a key perspective on cross-border harmonization of MMF treatment.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/9726/gmac_TIS_P42P45Streamlining110623/download"><i>TIS Recommendation 3 &ndash; Improve Trade Reporting for Market Oversight, Streamline Potential 40% Increase in CFTC Reportable Data Elements</i></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The Commission is currently amending its Part 43 and Part 45 swap data reporting requirements to potentially add nearly 50 additional reportable fields on top of the currently required 128 data elements that were just implemented in December 2022. The potential 40% increase in data reporting elements distracts from optimizing analysis and use of the recently expanded data set and creates further obstacles and uncertainty for meaningful global aggregation and analysis of trade repository data. Further, an ad hoc approach to additional data reporting elements unnecessarily increases costs.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The GMAC recommends several steps to improve data reporting elements which will (i) advance analytical tools to optimize use of the current, recently expanded, data set; and (ii) focus on impediments to data sharing, including the alignment of the validations and requirements for critical data elements (CDE) fields and global identifiers.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>This GMAC recommendation informed the CFTC&rsquo;s recent Part 43 and Part 45 rulemaking proposal, and was then submitted to the public comment file. The CFTC is working to finalize this proposal.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/9596/gmac_TIS_Recommendation_DataSharingAnalysis110623/download"><i>TIS Recommendation 4 &ndash; Improve Trade Reporting for Market Oversight and Improving Data Sharing and Systemic Risk Analysis</i></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>Regulators, including the CFTC, have implemented global trade reporting harmonization efforts to enable data amalgamation to facilitate regulatory data usage across jurisdictions. However, there are non</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>‐</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>data related impediments that could prevent data sharing, thus undermining the value of these significant projects.</span></span></i></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The GMAC recommends the Commission facilitate discussions with key regulators (market and prudential) on the desire to share data elements and agree upon the Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) needed to allow such activity, starting with U.S. and then prioritize other G20 regulators where there is significant overlap.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>There are several international, major trade reporting initiatives at the FSB and IOSCO, among others, to improve trade reporting for market oversight and improve data sharing and systemic risk analysis consistent with this GMAC recommendation. The CFTC is actively participating in these ongoing initiatives.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/10326/GMAC_T+1_Resources_030624/download"><i>TIS Recommendation 5 - Publication of Resource Document to Support Transition to T+1 Securities Settlement</i></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>As the United States prepares to transition to next-day trade settlement (T+1) for securities in May 2024, the Subcommittee crafted a resource document to support market participants. The document details products covered by the transition to T+1, timelines for transition in various markets, and the benefits to the transition. The document also highlights the implications T+1 has for various markets &ndash; particularly foreign exchange markets, and discusses its impacts on transaction processes for various products, including cross-border impacts. Further, it provides a list of resources to help firms prepare for the transition.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>This GMAC recommendation helped to prepare the U.S. securities markets, and other impacted asset classes and products, for a smooth T+1 securities settlement transition completed over the Memorial Day holiday weekend. It provided resources for aspects such as foreign exchange (FX) markets and cross-border transactions.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><i><span><span>Digital Asset Markets Subcommittee (DAMS)</span></span></i></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/10321/CFTC_GMAC_DAM_Classification_Approach_and_Taxonomy_for_Digital_Assets_030624/download"><i>DAMS Recommendation 1 - Adoption of an Approach for the Classification and Understanding of Digital Assets</i></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>A clear, consensus-driven approach to classifying assets and the functions they serve underpins robust markets and effective regulation. The evolving digital asset ecosystem has led many to develop proprietary taxonomies to classify digital assets and their related technology. In recognition of this progress, the Subcommittee has engaged digital asset stakeholders across the broader digital asset ecosystem to build a common approach for the classification and understanding of digital assets.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>This approach aims to set out consistent language for participants in the digital asset ecosystem to promote innovation, identify and address risk considerations, and enable effective regulatory understanding. With this objective in mind, the approach builds upon the considerable classification efforts of global prudential standard setters and regional authorities, including the Bank for International Settlements, the Financial Stability Board and others.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The GMAC recommends this approach be considered an initial basis for a consensus-driven, functional taxonomy. However, as the digital asset ecosystem continues to evolve, so too will the terminology used to classify it. The Subcommittee will reassess any future developments to provide further recommendations to this approach, based on the guidance of its members. The Subcommittee seeks to support effective rules and regulations for digital assets, and recommends continued collaboration between industry, standard-setting bodies, and the regulatory community.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The first-of-a-kind GMAC digital asset taxonomy&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span><span>framework provides valuable foundational guidelines to further advance the discussion and promote U.S. regulatory clarity, and was extensively vetted by stakeholders such as regulatory authorities, financial institutions, asset managers, market infrastructures, and service providers.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>New GMAC and Subcommittee Members</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>I also want to welcome a few new faces to the GMAC and our Subcommittees. We've added a few new experts to our ranks since we last met.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>On the GMAC, we&rsquo;ve added&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Chuck Mack, Head of Strategy for North American Markets at Nasdaq, and Derek Kleinbauer, President of Bloomberg SEF. On the Digital Asset Markets Subcommittee, we&rsquo;ve added Mo Shaikh, Co-Founder and CEO of Aptos Labs; Terrence Dempsey, Senior Vice President and Head of Product Strategy at Fidelity Digital Assets; Ian Grieves, Vice President for Product &amp; Strategy at Cboe</span></span></span><span><span>; and&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Chen Arad, Co-Founder &amp; Chief External Affairs Officer at Solidus Labs.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Welcome, and I look forward to your contributions to the GMAC.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Today&rsquo;s GMAC Meeting</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Today&rsquo;s meeting will continue to build on the significant progress we&rsquo;ve already made. We&rsquo;ll start with a presentation from the Global Market Structure Subcommittee on the impact the proposed U.S. implementation of Basel III endgame&rsquo;s bank capital requirements would have on end users who rely on cleared derivatives markets. Providing this timely presentation will be Kyle Glenn, Vice President for Government Relations at FIA, and Thane Twiggs, Chief Compliance Officer for Risk Management at Cargill.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>We&rsquo;ll then have a panel discussion on Swap Execution Facilities. Our esteemed panelists are:</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span><span>Thomas Pluta, President of Tradeweb;</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>Scott Fitzpatrick, CEO of Tradition SEF; and</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>Adam Lister, Interest Rate Swaps Electronic Trading Product Manager at Bloomberg</span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Tara Kruse will lead our Technical Issues Subcommittee&rsquo;s discussion on its proposed recommendation on Variation Margin Processes in Non-Centrally Cleared Markets. Tara is the Global Head of Infrastructure, Data, and Non-Cleared Margin at ISDA.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Following a brief break, we&rsquo;ll receive an update on global commodity markets from Derek Sammann, Senior Managing Director and Global Head of Commodities, Options &amp; International Markets at CME Group.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Finally, we&rsquo;ll receive a presentation on the CFTC&rsquo;s international engagement from Andrea Musalem, Associate Director of the Commission&rsquo;s Office of International Affairs. We&rsquo;ll close out today&rsquo;s meeting with updates from each of the Subcommittees on ongoing workstreams and future agenda items.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>I&rsquo;m very much looking forward to these timely presentations and the consideration of the latest round of recommendations. Once again, thanks to our speakers and all members for being here and making the GMAC such a success.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The GMAC and the CFTC&rsquo;s Mission</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Today highlights that the CFTC is first and foremost a market regulator, and I&rsquo;m pleased we&rsquo;re getting back to basics with very important presentations and discussion of market characteristics, trading activity, and market fundamentals driving both, as well as capital and margin requirements. I look forward to the insights that will be shared on ways to enhance liquidity in markets, which could be the basis for additional GMAC initiatives. This is the bread and butter of the CFTC&rsquo;s core mission to oversee derivatives markets and ensure they are well-functioning. This doesn&rsquo;t get the headlines, but it is absolutely our day job and I appreciate Chairman Behnam&rsquo;s focus on this. I especially thank the CFTC&rsquo;s Office of International Affairs for their presentation and international leadership. Thank you all.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<div> CDCC, SGC Notes, Canadian Dollar Offered Rate cessation, investment vehicle, money market instruments
<br />
Summary:<br />CDCC launches SGC Notes program to accommodate transition from CDOR and Bankers’ Acceptances, offer investment opportunities in Canadian money markets with strong investor protection. <div>
<p><span>The Canadian Derivatives Clearing Corporation (CDCC), Canada's national central clearing counterparty (CCP) for exchange-traded derivative products and repurchase agreements, today announced the launch of the new Secured General Collateral (SGC) Notes program.</span></p>
<p><span>SGC Notes are short-term discounted money market instruments developed by CDCC in collaboration with Canadian market participants and designed to meet the demand for the transition from Bankers&rsquo; Acceptances (BAs) as a result of the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR) cessation.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;​We are proud to bring this innovative​, customized ​​investment vehicle to market, designed to provide Canada's market participants with an effective funding solution and support the industry transition from CDOR and Bankers&rsquo; Acceptances,​"&nbsp;<strong>said George Kormas, President of CDCC</strong>.​ "​CDCC is grateful for the input of our valued stakeholders ​across Canada&rsquo;s money markets, including both sell and buy side participants​, in the launch of SGC Notes and we look forward to serving their needs as our markets continue to evolve into the future.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>SGC Notes provide an investment policy-friendly opportunity for Canadian money market institutional investors to roll their BA exposure into SGC Notes. SGC Notes are linked to the same highly-rated Canadian bank credit exposure as BAs, but are secured with a basket of high quality debt securities (SGC Securities) which are sold to a trust through repurchase agreements cleared through CDCC.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>SGC Notes represent an attractive investment option relative to available alternatives.</span></p>
<p><span>SGC Notes are designed to provide strong investor protection through active risk management by CDCC of the basket of SGC Securities securing the SGC Notes and to leverage TMX Group&rsquo;s infrastructure, including the recently announced&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.tmx.com%2Fnewsroom%2Fpress-releases%3Fid=1198/1/0102019002405f87-43999f98-e6ce-40fa-a3a9-d5090bd56623-000000/rvtVaflIpdY6crSZ4ofJY_MJ0o8=377" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>Canadian Collateral Management Service (CCMS)</span></a>, which allows for automated collateral movements.</span></p>
<p><span>For more information on the new SGC Notes, please visit&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.cdcc.ca%2Fen%2Fsgc-notes/1/0102019002405f87-43999f98-e6ce-40fa-a3a9-d5090bd56623-000000/0evjN4dvExAx65ubdu6vN8Dl25k=377" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>&nbsp;</span></a><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.cdcc.ca/en/sgc-notes" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.cdcc.ca/en/sgc-notes</a></span>&nbsp;to review the offering memorandum.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>SGC Notes will be issued by a special purpose vehicle formed as an Ontario trust (&ldquo;Trust&rdquo;), of which ComputerShare Trust Company of Canada is trustee and CDCC is promoter, administrative agent, custodian and paying agent.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The SGC Notes will be subscribed for by CIRO investment dealers and Canadian chartered banks that are eligible to clear repurchase transactions relating to SGC Securities through CDCC (the &ldquo;SGC Clearing Members&rdquo;). The SGC Clearing Members will purchase the SGC Notes, as principals, at a discount to face value and may offer the SGC Notes for sale to investors subject to prior sale, if, as and when issued by the Trust and accepted by the SGC Clearing Members on a private placement basis to investors which are &ldquo;accredited investors&rdquo; and &ldquo;permitted clients&rdquo; (other than individuals) as defined in securities legislation in reliance on exemptions from the prospectus requirements of applicable provincial securities laws. The resale of the SGC Notes will be restricted by applicable provincial securities laws.</span></p>
<p><span>The SGC Notes are obligations of the Trust and not obligations of or interests in CDCC, Computershare Trust Company of Canada, any member of the TMX Group, or any SGC Clearing Member. The SGC Notes will represent limited recourse obligations of the Trust. Only the SGC Securities (and other collateral listed in the offering memorandum describing the SBC Notes) will secure payment of the SGC Notes.</span></p>
<p><span>The SGC Notes have not been registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, or the &ldquo;U.S. Securities Act&rdquo; or under the securities laws of any state of the United States, and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to U.S. persons within the meaning of Regulation S under the U.S.&nbsp; Securities Act, or &ldquo;Regulation S&rdquo; unless the securities are registered under the U.S. Securities Act or an exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act is available.</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Trade surveillance, financial risk solutions, Validus platform, legacy providers, global expansion<br />
Summary:<br />
Eventus' Validus platform sees 25% client base increase, global expansion, high renewal rates, and multiple award wins for trade surveillance excellence. <div>
<p>Eventus, a leading provider of comprehensive, at-scale trade surveillance and financial risk solutions, announced that its Validus platform continues to capture business from firms seeking to move away from legacy trade surveillance providers, with a 25% increase in its client base over the past year. The announcement comes on the heels of another award win for excellence in trade surveillance, further global expansion with the signing of its first South African client &ndash; one of Africa&rsquo;s largest diversified financial groups &ndash; and a continued high renewal rate for existing clients globally. The company now has clients on six continents.</p>
<p>Eventus CEO Travis Schwab said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve never been in a better position as a company. Our retention rates remain close to 100%, we are growing across asset classes and geographies, our platform continues to perform at the highest levels with new functionality rolling out consistently, and we are profitable. We are especially excited about some new clients that include three tier-1 banks all now actively using Validus to meet a range of compliance and regulatory goals. Our existing clients are routinely adding more areas of coverage and our Eventus Services offering to their contracts too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Companies keep turning to us, particularly if they&rsquo;ve had experience with legacy providers, because our sole focus is our clients and the delivery of best-in-class trade surveillance and financial risk solutions, such as algo monitoring. In an extraordinarily competitive landscape, we have what I would argue is more markets and regulatory expertise and a more responsive approach than any provider in the market, along with the unique ability for clients to fully customize the platform and work with our team on solving compliance challenges they are facing in real time. Our experience as market practitioners give us the ability to partner with each and every client &ndash; whether they are a start-up exchange, global trading firm, broker/dealer or tier 1 bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eventus Global Head of Regulatory Affairs Joe Schifano said: &ldquo;For many years, those of us who built surveillance programs for our firms were frustrated with the lack of flexibility in legacy trade surveillance systems. But now, it is even more critical to keep pace with technology as regulators are no longer satisfied with compliance programs that just &lsquo;follow the pack.&rsquo; At Eventus, we offer a &rsquo;buy-to-build&rsquo; solution that clients can tailor and easily scale specific to their risk assessment and data requirements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eventus also announced that it was just named Best Trade Surveillance Solution at the TradingTech Insight USA Awards 2024, based on votes from market participants and the publication&rsquo;s global audience. In March, the company won the same category in the 2024 RegTech insight Awards APAC for its work in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
<p>Schwab said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re honored to see recognition of our hard work and results through votes by so many market participants selecting Validus as Best Trade Surveillance Solution, reflecting our focus on our clients, expert service and constant enhancements to the platform.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Enhancements to the Validus platform this year include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reports and visualizations to help clients ensure accurate and complete data coverage.</li>
<li>Introduction of a first-of-its-kind cross-product spoofing functionality to detect this type of market manipulation in real time for clients engaged in multiple asset classes. This includes a new visualization methodology to review activity across products and new technology that facilitates cross-product review across all accounts and all activity.</li>
<li>New large trader reporter functionality, built for a designated clearing organization (DCO) client and now available to all users.</li>
<li>Enhanced behavioral analytics, including changes in trader profiles identifying potential red flags for rogue trading and account takeovers.</li>
<li>Expanded market data coverage.</li>
<li>Testing of the firm&rsquo;s next-generation platform that enables performance speeds and scale commensurate with growth in the markets and client data requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A-Team Group&rsquo;s series of awards, including those from TradingTech Insight and RegTech Insight, recognize outstanding performance by the vendors of data and technology solutions to the financial industry. Eventus has now won six A-Team Group awards over the past five years, including two RegTech Insight Europe Awards. To date, the company and its Validus platform have earned more than 40 awards and honors in the past six years.</p>

Rosa Armesto appointed as new FESE Director General, replacing Rainer Riess. Bratislava Stock Exchange approved as full FESE member. <div>
<p>The General Assembly of the Federation of European Securities Exchanges (FESE) appointed Rosa Armesto as the new Director General of FESE during its meeting last Friday. As of 1st July 2024, she will be leading the federation. Armesto has been the Deputy Director General of FESE since 2018 and has extensive experience in EU affairs for financial services, covering the exchange and insurance industries. She holds a master&rsquo;s degree in economics from the University of Zaragoza (ES) and the University of Groningen (NL). Armesto is also a lecturer in financial market infrastructures at Solvay Brussels School of Economics &amp; Management (BE).</p>
<p>Rosa Armesto will replace Rainer Riess, who has been the Director General of FESE since 2014 and has decided to pursue other interests at the end of his term. Riess will continue to serve as Senior Advisor to FESE until the end of 2024 to ensure a smooth transition.</p>
<p>The General Assembly also approved the application of the Bratislava Stock Exchange to become a full FESE member. With this, FESE represents the exchange sector in all 27 Member States of the EU and beyond.</p>
<p>The General Assembly elected the following FESE Board members for a 3-year term: Niels Brab, Chief Regulatory Officer at Deutsche B&ouml;rse; Ian Cornwall, Head of Market Structure at SIX Group; and Tomasz Bardziulowski, Chief Executive Officer of the Warsaw Stock Exchange. The FESE Board is composed of 10 members, representing the diversity of FESE&rsquo;s membership across Europe. The General Assembly also ratified the nomination of Ludovic Aigrot, Vice President, Head of Government Relations Europe, Nasdaq as the new FESE Management Committee Chair.</p>
<p>FESE President&nbsp;<span>Petr Koblic</span>&nbsp;said:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>We are delighted to welcome Rosa Armesto as the new Director General of FESE. She has proven to be a great asset to our organisation and has a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities facing our industry. We are confident that she will lead FESE with vision and dedication and will continue to promote the vital role of exchanges in financing the European economy. We also want to express our sincere gratitude to Rainer Riess for his outstanding contribution to FESE over the past decade. Under his leadership, FESE has strengthened its position as the voice of European exchanges, and he has contributed to the development of a sound and competitive capital markets union in Europe. We wish him all the best in his future endeavours. Moreover, we welcome the Bratislava Stock Exchange as a full member, broadening our membership to cover all 27 member states of the European Union and beyond.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>Armesto&nbsp;</span>said:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I am honoured and committed to take on this new role as Director General of FESE. I look forward to working with the FESE Board, the FESE team and our members to advance the interests of European exchanges and to support the development of a fair, transparent and efficient capital markets union in Europe. I also want to thank Rainer for his trust and guidance during the time we worked together.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>Riess&nbsp;</span>said:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>It has been a pleasure and a privilege to serve as Director General of FESE for the past 10 years. I am proud of what we have accomplished together with our members and partners in shaping the regulatory framework and the market structure of European exchanges. I am also very happy that Rosa will succeed me. She is a highly qualified and experienced professional who has a clear vision and a strong commitment to our industry.

<div> Partnership, Blue Carbon, Investments, Ocean Protection, Mangrove Conservation
<br />
XTCC, Lady Merle, and Logos Capital Group partner to create listed blue carbon investments supporting ocean protection and community benefits. Revolutionizing climate finance.
<br /><br />Summary:
XTCC, Lady Merle, and Logos Capital Group collaborate to create listed blue carbon investments, supporting ocean protection, community benefits, and revolutionizing climate finance. <div>
<ul>
<li><span>Collaboration with Lady Merle Liivand (the Eco Mermaid) and Logos Capital Group to generate liquidity in investments supporting vital ocean protection projects</span></li>
<li><span><em>Brings together the best thought leaders and deep expertise around Blue Carbon</em>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Stock market-listed blue carbon investments help bridge multi-trillion-dollar gap in climate finance</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>XTCC, the investment ecosystem specialising in high-integrity carbon based listed investments, celebrates World Ocean Day with the announcement of a partnership with Lady Merle, the Estonian swimming champion and ocean protection advocate acknowledged globally as the &lsquo;Eco Mermaid&rsquo;, and Silvio Pupo-Casco of Logos Capital Group, to scale</span></p>
<p><span>up investment opportunities and enable global access to this new asset class, providing support for projects including mangrove conservation and transparent fund distribution to adjacent communities.</span></p>
<p><span>Lady Merle and Silvio will work closely with XTCC to identify mangrove and other blue carbon projects that also directly benefit adjacent local communities. XTCC will mobilise Lady Merle&rsquo;s expertise in the science of blue carbon and Silvio&rsquo;s investment network and commitment to driving significant investment capital into more impactful asset classes in the creation of new Blue Carbon investments listed on global stock markets. XTCC creates a bridge between blue carbon projects and<br />the capital markets, enabling an asset class for the Beyond Net Zero world.</span><span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Blue carbon is carbon captured by the world's ocean and coastal ecosystems, including mangroves that can, through sequestration - taking carbon in - provide a natural way of reducing the impact of greenhouse gases on earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. Coastal systems such as mangroves sequester high amounts of carbon quickly and sustainably (over millions of years). In fact, mangroves are ten times more effective at sequestering carbon than any other type of forestry, with a multitude of associated benefits such as clean water, food security, and protection against extreme weather events.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Seth Elliot, XTCC CEO</span>&nbsp;said: &ldquo;To truly move beyond Net Zero, we must combat global warming via significant nature-based project investments in ocean protection. By introducing Blue Carbon based listed investments, we aim to stimulate interest and generate liquidity to support the funding of blue carbon projects, redefine trust in the carbon market, and stimulate climate investments crucial for saving the planet.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Lady Merle said:&nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;Our oceans are the lungs of the world, playing a crucial role in producing oxygen and absorbing carbon dioxide and waste. Thriving mangrove ecosystems not only sustain the natural world but also support and enrich the communities that live alongside. On the negative side, when these important coastal systems are damaged, they emit enormous amounts of carbon into the atmosphere, contributing to climate change. As such, it is essential to protect and conserve mangroves and other coastal habitats, for the benefit of the climate and as importantly, to protect the communities that depend on them to survive and thrive&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Silvio Pupo-Casco, Logos Capital Group said</strong>: "Investing in natural capital and purchasing high-integrity carbon credits can often be complex and opaque. Through our joint venture with XTCC, we aim to simplify and clarify this process, ensuring that investors know exactly what they are getting for their money. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies, we will restore trust in critical natural capital and ecosystem service investments, particularly in the realm of blue carbon." He continued, &ldquo;Our new blue carbon investment instrument is designed to exceed current market standards for transparency and reporting. By setting new benchmarks for accountability and integrity, we are committed to offering unparalleled clarity and reliability in the carbon credit markets. This next-generation investment vehicle is poised to revolutionize global capital markets, driving significant impact in blue finance."</span></p>

<div> Equity Hedge, Event-Driven, Cryptocurrency, Risk Parity, Performance Dispersion
Summary:
- Hedge funds gained in May, led by Equity Hedge and Event-Driven strategies.
- Cryptocurrency and Risk Parity indexes surged.
- Performance dispersion declined in May.
- Equity Hedge funds, driven by Energy and Technology exposures, led gains.
- Interest rate-sensitive strategies also advanced, while Macro strategies posted mixed performance. <div>
<p>Hedge funds gained in May as equities recovered the prior month&rsquo;s decline, and as inflationary pressures remained elevated, but investors positioned for interest rate reductions in 2H24. Led by directional Equity Hedge and Event-Driven strategies, the HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index advanced +1.3 percent in May, with additional positive contributions from Relative Value Arbitrage strategies offsetting a decline in Macro strategies. The HFRI Equity Hedge (Total) Index jumped +2.5 percent for the month, reversing the April decline and marking the fifth gain for this index in the trailing seven months, posting its strongest monthly return since February.</p>
<p>The HFR Cryptocurrency Index surged +13.6 percent in May, while the HFR Risk Parity Vol 15 Index jumped +3.0 percent for the month.</p>
<p>Performance dispersion declined in May, as the top decile of the HFRI FWC constituents advanced by an average of +7.6 percent, while the bottom decile fell by an average of -4.1 percent, representing a top/bottom dispersion of 11.7 percent for the month. By comparison, the top/bottom performance dispersion in April was 14.3 percent. In the trailing 12 months ending May 2024, the top decile of FWC constituents gained +42.9 percent, while the bottom decile declined -7.3 percent, representing a top/bottom dispersion of 50.2 percent. Approximately 70 percent of hedge funds produced positive performance in May.</p>
<p>Equity Hedge (EH) funds, which invest long and short across specialized sub-strategies, led gains in May, driven by advances in Energy and Technology exposures. The HFRI Equity Hedge (Total) Index gained +2.5 percent (estimated) for the month, improving the YTD 2024 return to +6.1 percent. EH sub-strategy gains were led by the HFRI EH: Sector-Energy Index, which surged an estimated +3.6 percent, while the HFRI EH: Sector-Technology Index added +3.2 percent. Other strong contributors in May were the HFRI EH: Multi-Strategy Index and the HFRI EH: Fundamental Value Index, each of which advanced +3.1 percent for the month. Through the first five months of the year, the HFRI EH: Quantitative Directional Index leads EH sub-strategy performance with a YTD return of +8.6 percent.</p>
<p>Event-Driven (ED) strategies, which often focus on out-of-favor, deep value equity exposures and speculation on M&amp;A situations, also advanced in May, driven by Multi-Strategy and Distressed exposures. The HFRI Event-Driven (Total) Index gained +1.6 percent for the month, led by the HFRI ED: Multi-Strategy Index, which jumped +2.35 percent, and the HFRI ED: Distressed Index, which added +1.7 percent for the month.</p>
<p>Fixed income-based, interest rate-sensitive strategies also advanced in May as investors positioned for interest rate cuts in 2H24 despite persistent inflation. The HFRI Relative Value (Total) Index added an estimated +0.6 percent for the month, increasing its YTD 2024 return to +3.3 percent. RVA performance was led by the HFRI RV: Asset Backed Index and HFRI RV: Convertible Arbitrage Index, each of which advanced +0.9 percent for the month.</p>
<p>Macro strategies posted mixed performance in May as interest rates and financial market volatility fell, and as investors positioned for interest rate cuts in 2H24. The HFRI Macro (Total) Index fell -0.65 percent in May, the<sup>&nbsp;</sup>first monthly decline since November 2023. Losses were driven by the HFRI Macro: Systematic Diversified Index, which declined -1.3 percent for the month but remains the leading area of sub-strategy performance over the first five months of the year, with a YTD return of +9.15 percent. Partially offsetting the May declines, the HFRI Macro: Active Trading Index jumped +2.7 percent for the month, bringing its YTD performance to +6.3 percent.</p>
<p>Liquid Alternative UCITS strategies posted gains in May, as the HFRX Global Index advanced +0.6 percent for the month, led by the HFRX Equity Hedge Index, which advanced +1.25 percent, and the HFRX Relative Value Index, which added +0.7 percent. The HFRX Market Directional Index also advanced in May, adding +1.7 percent for the month.</p>
<p>The HFRI Diversity Index advanced an estimated +1.8 percent in May, while the HFRI Women Index gained +1.9 percent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hedge funds posted strong gains in May, reversing April declines, with leadership from directional equity and credit strategies, as investors positioned for continued inflation, ECB and US Federal Reserve rate cuts, and an improving economic growth in 2H24. Uncorrelated Macro hedge funds, the leading strategy area of performance over the first four months of the year, posted its first monthly decline since November as financial market volatility fell in May,&rdquo; stated Kenneth J. Heinz, President of HFR. &ldquo;The primary risks for hedge funds and hedge fund positioning accelerated the shift from macroeconomic risks to geopolitical risks, with these comprising not only ongoing, active military conflicts but also potential for additional conflicts and risks associated with policy changes as a result of major political elections in the coming months. Hedge funds have effectively positioned portfolios in a tactical sense for these highly fluid and uncertain situations, including not only military threats, but possibilities for supply chain disruptions, outright trade embargoes or halts, and destabilizing dislocations and volatility associated with banking and broader financial market operation. Institutions interested in access to opportunities which may be created by this volatility, as well as portfolio protection from these risks, are likely to increase exposure to hedge funds which have demonstrated their strategy&rsquo;s robustness of navigating these building and evolving risks over recent months and years.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>NOTE: May 2024 index performance figures are estimated as of June 7, 2024</i></p>

<title>SEC Charges Three New Yorkers For Raising More Than $184 Million Through Pre-IPO Fraud Schemes - After Commission Shut Down Original Ploy, Defendants Started Another One</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-charges-three-new-yorkers-for-raising-more-than-184-million-through-pre-ipo/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> charged, fraud, unregistered, pre-IPO, SEC
Summary:
SEC charged individuals with fraud for selling unregistered pre-IPO shares, involving high-pressure sales tactics and undisclosed markups. U.S. Attorney's Office also filed charges. Ongoing investigation in the pre-IPO space. SEC prioritizes enforcement in the pre-IPO space, filing charges in various cases. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged three individuals with fraud for selling unregistered membership interests in LLCs that purported to invest in shares of pre-IPO companies, first on behalf of StraightPath Venture Partners LLC, the subject of the Commission&rsquo;s emergency&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-83">action</a>&nbsp;in May 2022, and, later, on behalf of Legend Venture Partners LLC, the subject of the Commission&rsquo;s emergency&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-119">action</a>&nbsp;in June 2023. Both&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr-25429">StraightPath</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr-25772">Legend</a>&nbsp;are now under court-ordered receiverships.</p>
<p>In this new action, the SEC alleges that New York residents Mario Gogliormella, Steven Lacaj, and Karim Ibrahim directed an unregistered sales force of more than 50 callers in boiler rooms to pressure investors into making investments without telling them that the shares had been substantially marked up&mdash;between approximately 19 and 105 percent on average above the prices that StraightPath or Legend had paid for the underlying shares. As a result of these tactics, the defendants and their sales force allegedly pocketed more than $45 million in fees from unsuspecting investors from 2019 to 2022.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We allege that the fraud in this case is like a Hollywood movie where the defendants ran boiler rooms using scripts they referred to as the &lsquo;Bible,&rsquo; engaged in high-pressure sales tactics, and employed outright falsehoods to defraud investors,&rdquo; said Sheldon L. Pollock, Associate Director of the New York Regional Office. &ldquo;After the SEC shut them down the first time, they simply rebranded their outfit, and today through our action we are seeking to ensure that they are held accountable for enticing and lying to investors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint charges the defendants with violating antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws. The complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, return of allegedly ill-gotten gains, and civil penalties. The SEC also charged Adam Ibrahim, Karim Ibrahim&rsquo;s brother, as a relief defendant.</p>
<p>The U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Southern District of New York today unsealed an indictment charging Gogliormella, Lacaj, and Karim Ibrahim with securities fraud, among other offenses, in connection with their work for StraightPath and Legend.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s ongoing investigation is being conducted by Joshua D. Tannen and Lee A. Greenwood of the Asset Management Unit and Sushila P. Rao, Suzanne M. Bettis, Megan Genet, Tiantong Wen, Douglas Smith, Kerri L. Palen, Patricia Schrage, Daniel Loss, Alistaire Bambach, and Steven G. Rawlings of the New York Regional Office. It is being supervised by Mr. Pollock. The litigation will be led by Ms. Rao, Mr. Tannen, and Ms. Bettis and supervised by Mr. Loss and Mr. Pollock.</p>
<p>The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Southern District of New York and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service.</p>

<p>The pre-IPO space remains a priority area for the Division of Enforcement and the New York Regional Office. In addition to the prior StraightPath and Legend actions, the New York Regional Office has also filed other charges in other matters, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>In December 2023, the Commission&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-245#:~:text=The%20Securities%20and%20Exchange%20Commission,and%20JL%20Rivera%20Enterprises%20Ltd.">charged</a>&nbsp;five individuals and four companies in a $528 million pre-IPO fraud.</li>
<li>In March 2023, the SEC&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-61">charged</a>&nbsp;three StraightPath sales agents with fraud and unregistered broker activity.</li>
<li>In December 2020, the SEC&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr-24972">charged</a>&nbsp;a boiler room operator with defrauding retail investors in the sale of pre-IPO shares.</li>

<p>The EACH General Assembly also agreed on the EACH Strategy for the 2024-2026 period. EACH will enhance its role as both the proactive voice of CCPs in Europe in front of public authorities and private stakeholders as well as acting as a dynamic forum to develop the CCP clearing industry through the agreed strategic priorities. The EACH community will continue to focus on fostering robust and efficient capital markets for companies to grow and investors to manage their risks.</p>
<p>The EACH Co-Chairs&nbsp;Julien Jardelot, Niels Brab and Tim Grange said: &lsquo;We are delighted to the trust European CCP and clearing houses are putting in us by renewing our mandate to represent the EACH community. We aim to increase the understating of how CCPs contribute to robust and more efficient capital markets for the benefit of businesses, investors and the economy as a whole. We welcome the efforts of different European jurisdictions to further diversify funding opportunities by strengthening capital markets and believe CCPs and clearing houses have a key role to play in supporting these efforts&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The EACH Secretary General Rafael Plata said: &lsquo;The next two years are likely crucial to plant the seeds of a new era of capital markets in Europe. Companies, investors and pensioners amongst other are likely to benefit from it. I look forward to continuing working with the capital markets ecosystem to make the dream of deeper and strong capital markets in Europe come true&rsquo;.</p>

<title>A New Class Of Trailblazers, Federal Reserve Governor Lisa D. Cook, At The Girls Global Academy 2024 Commencement Ceremony, Washington, D.C.</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Dr. O'Neal. It is an honor to be here to celebrate with you&mdash;the Girls Global Academy's first-ever graduating class. This is a momentous achievement and occasion. You are making history today! But, of course, you could not have done it alone. So let me start by acknowledging the teachers; administrators, staff, and board members of the Girls Global Academy; and the parents, grandparents, siblings, mentors, and friends who made today possible. Thank you and congratulations on a job well done.</p>
<p>And a very special congratulations to the Girls Global Academy Class of 2024! Soon you will embark on new journeys. I understand that many of you are going on to college in the fall, including one of you heading to my alma mater, Spelman College. (Be sure not to miss the 144th Founders Day celebration next year and the annual Spelman-Morehouse Christmas Carol concert in historic Sisters Chapel.) Others are off to start careers or to pursue vocational training. One of you will enter public service directly and become a member of the U.S. Air Force. That is a lot to be proud of and excited about. Whatever path you take next, I know the education and experience you gained here will guide you.</p>
<p>The Class of 2024 stands out. This is not only because you are the first, but also because you achieved so much all while overcoming extremely challenging circumstances by starting high school during the pandemic. Like you, I know what it is like to be the first to take a path, a path that was not always smooth and predictable. I will tell you more about that shortly.</p>
<p>Four years ago, all of you could have taken a more well-marked route. Instead, you had the courage to enroll at a brand new school during a global pandemic. You learned virtually during your first year. When you were able to attend your school in person for the first time, you did so with masks on, while social distancing. Forging new friendships is always challenging. It is even harder when you cannot sit next to a new classmate at the lunch table. But I know you worked hard to move your learning and your friendships beyond the screens and into real life. Now that those bonds have formed, I hope you hold on to them for many years to come, as I did with my classmates at a women's college.</p>
<p>As the inaugural class of the Girls Global Academy, your list of firsts is long and impressive. You formed the academy's first ever student government. You started a debate team and created cooking and DJ clubs, to name a few. You took the court and field as the first volleyball, basketball, softball, track, and cross-country teams. (I would have gone out for the softball and track teams. I was a catcher on my softball team in junior high and shot put was my event on the track team in high school.)</p>
<p>Everything was new, and probably a bit scary. Yet, you learned to become outspoken, you took on leadership roles, and you set an example for younger students. Through it all you grew, and you became the remarkable young women you are today.</p>
<p>With all those firsts, I was told that you sometimes call yourselves "the guinea pigs." I get that. However, I would like to offer a different moniker for this group: trailblazers. You bravely went where no one had gone before, and you accomplished great things through difficult challenges. To honor that, I want to tell you about a favorite trailblazer of mine and a girl who looked up to her.</p>
<p>The trailblazer I am thinking of is Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander. A little more than a century ago, she graduated from high school here in Washington, D.C., less than a mile away from your school. It was then called M Street High School. She went on to earn bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Pennsylvania. During her doctoral studies, she undertook research on the living standards of Black families that were migrating to Philadelphia during World War I. After completing that work, she became the second African American woman ever to earn a PhD and the first African American to earn a PhD in economics.</p>
<p>But in the 1920s, Dr. Alexander was actively denied entry into the economics profession on the basis of her race and sex. Some might have been crushed and deterred by the impediment. Not Dr. Alexander. Instead, she went on to blaze another trail. She became the first African American woman to earn a law degree from the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Alexander was also the first African American woman to pass the bar and practice law in the state of Pennsylvania. She continued to think and write about economic issues in her legal work and public service. She went on to be a top attorney for the city of Philadelphia and served the public in many other ways, including being asked by two U.S. presidents to serve on important committees.</p>
<p>Dr. Alexander was also the first national president of Delta Sigma Theta, a public service sorority. My mother helped to start a Delta Sigma Theta chapter at Georgia College and State University. That is how I first learned about Dr. Alexander. In fact, when I was in seventh grade, I entered my county social science fair with a project inspired by her work: identifying the major causes of unemployment among Black Americans. I did not realize it then, but that turned out to be my first foray into economic research, which became the cornerstone of my career.</p>
<p>It was helpful to have trailblazers to look up to, including Dr. Alexander, but also my aunts, uncles, parents, and other relatives and family friends who played important roles in the Civil Rights Movement. They instilled in me the confidence to blaze trails of my own. I was among the first African American students to desegregate one of the schools I attended in my hometown of Milledgeville, Georgia. Although some of the students and others in the community did not welcome us, I drew strength from the example set by my family and others in the Civil Rights Movement, and from their conviction in the hope and promise of a world that could and would continually improve.</p>
<p>While I had an interest in economics even before I entered high school, that profession was not the first path I choose. I started Spelman as a physics and philosophy major. It was not until after my undergraduate years, when I was literally on a trail&mdash;one climbing Mount Kilimanjaro&mdash;that I discovered economics was the path for me. I was hiking alongside a British economist. By the end of that journey, he had convinced me that studying economics would provide me the tools to address some big and important questions I had pondered for a long time&mdash;as far back as when Dr. Alexander inspired my submission to the county social science fair.</p>
<p>Following in her footsteps, I went on to earn my PhD in economics from the University of California, Berkeley. The path of an economist led me many places, including to Moscow to research banking in pre- and post-Soviet Russia and to the White House as an economist for President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers. In 2022, President Biden nominated me to serve on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. I am proud to say that I am the first African American woman and first woman of color to serve on the Board of Governors, a body that makes decisions affecting the entire economy and the well-being of every American.</p>
<p>I hope that my story, and Dr. Alexander's story, might inspire you to see that even when you encounter roadblocks, you can chart your own path and achieve great things. I know you can do that, because you established a strong foundation here at the Girls Global Academy, starting with the four pillars of sisterhood, scholarship, service, and safety.</p>
<p>I can see you have the spirit of sisterhood today as you celebrate all your achievements. You established a sisterhood as the first Girls Global Academy alumnae, and you also joined a broader sisterhood of strong, courageous, trailblazing women. You are scholars, earning your diploma and going on to college and onto various career paths. You worked in service to your community by each completing at least 50 service hours. The scholarship and service pillars show that you are already like Dr. Alexander, who highly valued education and used her education to improve the world. And you certainly learned the importance of safety as you started high school in the pandemic&mdash;and the importance of creating a safe environment of belonging where you can learn, be challenged, and grow, while comfortably being yourself. Holding these four pillars close will serve you well as you take the next step in your journeys.</p>
<p>As I conclude, I would like to thank you for allowing me to add another first&mdash;the first Girls Global Academy commencement speaker. I am deeply humbled by this honor. Once again, congratulations to the very first Girls Global Academy graduating class&mdash;the Class of 2024! We are all so proud of you and cannot wait to see what you will do.</p>

<title>NGX Launches New USSD To Enhance Capital Market Access</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ngx-launches-new-ussd-to-enhance-capital-market-access/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ngx-launches-new-ussd-to-enhance-capital-market-access/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Nigerian Exchange (NGX) Limited has urged investors to leverage on its new USSD platform for enhanced capital market access.</p>
<p>NGX stated this at its Investor Education Series, partnered with Meristem via a zoom meeting held on Thursday, June 6, 2024 with the theme, &lsquo;Unlocking Potential: Leveraging USSD For Enhanced Capital Market Access&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Speaking at the event, Head, Trading &amp; Products of NGX, Abimbola Babalola stated that the NGX USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) platform is a technology that allows mobile phone users to access a variety of services by dialing a short code (*5474#) on their phone keypad, saying that the NGX USSD platform is a new and innovative way for investors to access real-time stock market information and connect with a stockbroker.</p>
<p>According to him, the product is designed to boost financial inclusion and market participation in Nigeria by providing investors easy access to price information of listed companies and connecting them with Trading License Holders.</p>
<p>He further said that &ldquo;what we are doing at the exchange is to put investors at the driver&rsquo;s seat of their investment. Gone are those days when you buy securities and you go to sleep, or you have to start reading the newspaper or wait for news to know what is happening to the stocks. So, this time around, you have a device that you can use to monitor your stock at any time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Babalola added that investors' education is key, and this is what the products will address.</p>
<p>The Head, Investment Advisory at Meristem Stockbrokers Limited, Temitope Oludimu said that Meristem Securities has been in the industry for over two decades, growing her clients&rsquo; wealth and enhancing their financial wellbeing.</p>
<p>She noted that the Stockbrokers subsidiary of the Group provides easy access to online brokerage accounts allowing clients to monitor trades in real-time via MeriTrade and the first online stock trading platform in Nigeria commenced in 2014.</p>
<p>Oludimu added that &ldquo;MeriTrade allows users to buy and sell stocks online through the Nigerian Stock Exchange from the comfort of their home, office, car and even on the go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The platform defines stock broking in an entirely different language and creates a world class experience, bringing your broker (electronically) to the comfort of your home and office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The panel session speaking on the theme for the event emphasized the importance of investors' education in the capital market.</p>
<p>Afeez Ramoni, Head, Data and Digital Innovation, NGX stated that the public can now conveniently receive market information and commence account opening processes through their mobile phones by dialing *5474#. This marks a significant stride in NGX&rsquo;s commitment to democratizing access to investment opportunities and promoting retail investors participation through digital channels for accessing the capital market.</p>
<p>He anticipates that the USSD short code *5474# will enhance market accessibility and contribute significantly to the broader financial inclusion landscape in Nigeria.</p>
<p>Martha Ibrahim of NGX Group said that financial inclusion is really about inclusivity and creating access to financial services to investors.</p>
<p>She stated that this is really important for a vibrant capital market and also the country&rsquo;s economic development in general.</p>
<p>According to her, with the coming up of this initiative, integrating USSD with NGX, we also understand the importance of technology as a key financial enabler for financial inclusion. We are simplifying access to the stock markets and reducing barriers to entry. This would also promote a significant increase in the level of financial inclusion we have currently within the capital markets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By leveraging on this investor education and simplifying access to the markets, this validates that NGX is on the right step towards driving financial inclusion within the Nigerian capital markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Also, Oluwatobi Adesanya of Meristem added that &ldquo;we cannot overemphasize the need for financial literacy in the Nigerian capital market.&rdquo;</p>
