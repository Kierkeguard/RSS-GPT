<div> repatriation, misappropriated funds, 1MDB, international money laundering, embezzlement
<br><br>Summary:
The Justice Department repatriated $156 million in misappropriated 1MDB funds, totaling $1.4 billion. The funds were laundered through major financial institutions worldwide. The embezzlement proceeds were used for bribes and extravagant items. The Justice Department led the seizure of over $1.7 billion in stolen assets. The funds were intended to promote economic development in Malaysia but were misappropriated for personal use. The Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative aims to forfeit the proceeds of foreign official corruption. <div>
<p>The Justice Department announced today that it has repatriated an additional $156 million in misappropriated 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) funds to the people of Malaysia, bringing the total returned by the department to approximately $1.4 billion.</p>
<p>According to court documents, the funds from 1MDB, formerly Malaysia&rsquo;s investment development fund, were laundered through major financial institutions worldwide, including in the United States, Switzerland, Singapore, and Luxembourg. As alleged in the civil forfeiture complaints, from 2009 through 2015, high-level officials of 1MDB, their associates, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-entertainer-convicted-engaging-foreign-influence-campaign">Low Taek Jho</a>, also known as Jho Low, misappropriated more than $4.5 billion in funds belonging to 1MDB through a criminal scheme involving international money laundering and embezzlement. Some of the embezzlement proceeds were also allegedly used to pay bribes.</p>
<p>Beginning in 2016, a landmark effort encompassing 41 civil forfeiture actions filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California and one in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia by the Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section (MLARS) of the Justice Department&rsquo;s Criminal Division led to the seizure of over $1.7 billion in stolen assets. This is the largest recovery to date under the department&rsquo;s Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative. The funds include both funds finally forfeited and funds the department assisted in recovering and returning. The department continues to litigate actions against additional assets allegedly linked to this scheme.</p>
<p>1MDB was created by the government of Malaysia to promote economic development in Malaysia through global partnerships and foreign direct investment. Its funds were intended to be used for improving the well-being of the Malaysian people. Instead, funds held by 1MDB and proceeds of bonds issued for and on behalf of 1MDB were misappropriated and spent on a wide variety of extravagant items, including luxury homes and properties in Beverly Hills, New York, and London; a 300-foot superyacht; and fine art by Monet and Van Gogh. The funds were also sent into numerous business investments, including a boutique hotel in Beverly Hills, a movie production company that made &ldquo;The Wolf of Wall Street,&rdquo; the redevelopment of the Park Lane Hotel in Manhattan, and shares in EMI, the largest private music rights holder. As alleged, other funds were provided to various public officials and co-conspirators.</p>
<p>Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department&rsquo;s Criminal Division; Assistant Director Michael D. Nordwall of the FBI&rsquo;s Criminal Investigative Division; and Chief Guy Ficco of the IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) made the announcement.</p>
<p>The FBI&rsquo;s International Corruption Squads in New York and Los Angeles and IRS-CI are leading the investigation.</p>
<p>MLARS Trial Attorneys Barbara Levy, Josh Sohn, Jonathon Baum, and Sean Fern are prosecuting the case, with assistance from former MLARS Deputy Chief Woo S. Lee; Trial Attorney Kyle Freeny; and former Asset Forfeiture Section Chief Steven Welk, Asset Forfeiture Section Chief Jonathan Galatzan, and former Assistant U.S. Attorneys John Kucera and Michael Sew Hoy for the Central District of California.</p>
<p>The Justice Department&rsquo;s Office of International Affairs is providing substantial assistance. MLARS&rsquo; Program Operations Unit and the U.S. Marshals Service also provided significant support.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Significant assistance has also been provided to the department over the course of its work in the investigations and civil and criminal litigation by the Attorney General&rsquo;s Chambers of Malaysia, the Royal Malaysia Police, the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, the United Kingdom Prudential Regulation Authority, the United Kingdom National Crime Agency (NCA), the Attorney General&rsquo;s Chambers of the Territory of the British Virgin Islands, the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office of the Bailiwick of Guernsey and the Guernsey Economic Crime Division, the International Anti-Corruption Coordinate Centre, the Attorney General&rsquo;s Chambers of Singapore, the Singapore Police Force&ndash;Commercial Affairs Division, the Office of the Attorney General and the Federal Office of Justice of Switzerland, the judicial investigating authority of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Criminal Investigation Department of the Grand-Ducal Police of Luxembourg, and Indonesian, Latvian and French authorities.</p>
<p>The Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative is led by a team of dedicated MLARS prosecutors in partnership with federal law enforcement agencies, and often with U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Offices, to forfeit the proceeds of foreign official corruption and, where appropriate, to seize, forfeit, and repatriate those recovered assets to benefit the people harmed by these acts of corruption and abuse of office. Individuals with information about possible proceeds of foreign corruption located in or laundered through the United States should email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:kleptocracy@usdoj.gov">kleptocracy@usdoj.gov</a>&nbsp;or submit information at&nbsp;<a href="https://tips.fbi.gov/">https://tips.fbi.gov/</a>.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<div> revocation, registration, CFTC, guilty plea, wire fraud <br>
Summary:<br>
The CFTC revoked Ted Brent Alexander's registrations as a Commodity Trading Advisor and Associated Person due to his guilty plea for conspiracy to commit wire fraud. <div>
<p><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today issued an opinion and order revoking the registrations of&nbsp;<span>Ted Brent Alexander</span>&nbsp;of Jackson, Mississippi. The CFTC filed a Notice of Intent to Revoke Registration Pursuant to Section 8a(2) of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) against Alexander on March 13, 2024. [See CFTC Press Release No.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8876-24">8876-24</a>]. The CFTC action is based on Alexander&rsquo;s guilty plea to conspiracy to commit wire fraud in a federal criminal case.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Case Background</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Alexander has been registered with the CFTC as a Commodity Trading Advisor (CTA) and Associated Person (AP) since October 2008. On April 26, 2003, Alexander pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud in&nbsp;<i>United States v. Alexander</i>, No. 3:20-cr-00031 (S.D. Miss.). On November 13, 2023, a judgment of conviction was entered against Alexander. Because Alexander&rsquo;s guilty plea involved a crime involving one or more of embezzlement, theft, fraud, fraudulent conversion, misappropriation of funds, securities or property, and/or false pretenses, federal commodity laws allow Alexander&rsquo;s registrations to be permanently revoked.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The CFTC&rsquo;s order finds that Alexander is subject to statutory disqualification from registration with the CFTC under Section 8a(2)(D)(iii) of the CEA and permanently revokes Alexander&rsquo;s registrations under the terms of the order.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Settlement Revokes Alexander&rsquo;s Registrations</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Alexander, who admits the charges in the Notice of Intent, consented to the entry of a CFTC order that revokes his registrations as a CTA and AP.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The Division of Enforcement (DOE) thanks the National Futures Association for its assistance in this matter.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>DOE staff responsible for this case are Eugenia Vroustouris and Rick Glaser.</span></span></p>

<div> technical standards, guidelines, prudential matters, asset-referenced tokens, e-money tokens
<br>
Regulatory products under MiCAR for asset-referenced and e-money tokens, including own funds, liquidity requirements, and recovery plans.
<br><br>Summary:
Technical standards and guidelines on prudential matters, own funds adjustment, liquidity requirements, highly liquid financial instruments, and recovery plans for asset-referenced and e-money tokens. <div>
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) publishes today the package of technical standards and guidelines under MiCAR on prudential matters, namely own funds, liquidity requirements, and recovery&nbsp; &nbsp;plans. These products are part of the EBA&rsquo;s ongoing efforts to foster a well-regulated market for asset-referenced and e-money tokens in the EU.</span></p>
<p>The package of EBA regulatory products comprises:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Final&nbsp;draft regulatory technical standards specifying adjustment of own funds requirement and minimum features&nbsp;of stress testing programmes of issuers of asset-referenced tokens (ARTs) and of e-money tokens (EMTs) subject to such requirements.</span>&nbsp;These standards&nbsp;specify: i) the criteria for the assessment of&nbsp;&lsquo;higher degree of risk&rsquo;, ii) the procedure for competent authorities to determine the period of time considered appropriate for issuers to increase the own funds amount to the higher own funds requirements and the measures to be taken to ensure the timely compliance thereof and iii) a minimum set of requirements to issuers for the design and implementation of their stress-testing programmes.</li>
<li><span>Final draft regulatory technical standards specifying the procedure and timeframe for an issuer to adjust the amount of its own funds to 3% of the average amount of the reserve of assets</span>&nbsp;when the relevant issuer is issuing an ART or EMT classified as &lsquo;significant&rsquo;. Considering the feedback received on both RTSs, following the consultation period, the timeframe for the issuer to provide an implementation plan to increase the own funds requirements has been changed to 25 working days. Additionally, the maximum amount of time that the competent authority may grant to the issuer to comply with the plan has been adjusted upwards to 6 months maximum.</li>
<li><span>Final draft RTS further specifying the liquidity requirements of the reserve of assets.&nbsp;</span>The draft RTS set specific minimum percentages of the reserve of assets according to daily and weekly maturities. They also establish the minimum amount of deposits in each official currency referenced. Furthermore, they envisage overall techniques of liquidity management to seek minimum creditworthiness, liquidity soundness and minimum diversification of bank deposits counterparties in the reserve of assets as well as to ensure minimum overcollateralisation to seek correlation between the reserve of assets and the assets referenced.</li>
<li><span>Final draft RTS to specify the highly liquid financial instruments</span>.&nbsp;These draft RTS set the highest quality liquid assets in the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) as eligible highly liquid financial instruments. At the same time, and in order to seek for correlation between the highly liquid financial instruments and the assets referenced, in the case of ARTs referencing assets other than official currencies, financial instruments tracking the value of the assets referenced by the token or derivatives relating to them, are deemed eligible as highly liquid financial instruments. Furthermore, the draft RTS set concentration limits of highly liquid financial instruments by issuer.</li>
<li><span>Final draft RTS to specify the minimum content of the liquidity management policy and procedures.</span>&nbsp;These draft RTS envisage procedures for identifying, measuring and managing liquidity risk, a contingency policy and mitigation tools as well as minimum aspects of liquidity stress testing.</li>
<li><span>Guidelines on recovery plans&nbsp;</span>specifying the format and the content of the recovery plan that issuers need to develop and maintain. Considering the feedback received during the consultation period, the Guidelines further specify the content of the communication and disclosure plan. A number of targeted amendments were also made to streamline the wording and provide further clarity, inter alia by adding new definitions and by introducing a new paragraph to clarify that any provision regarding certain requirements applicable to the reserve of assets (e.g. certain recovery plan indicators and scenarios) does not apply to issuers of EMTs that are not subject to hold a reserve of assets in accordance with MiCAR.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Legal basis and next steps</h4>
<p>The&nbsp;<span>draft RTS relating to own funds</span>&nbsp;have been developed in close cooperation with the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the European Central Bank (ECB), in accordance with Article 35(6) and Article 45(7)(c) of Regulation (EU) 2023/1114 on Markets in Crypto-assets (MiCAR), and specify the procedure and timeframe for own funds adjustments.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<span>draft RTS on liquidity</span>&nbsp;have been developed, in close cooperation with ESMA and the ECB, to further specify the liquidity requirements of the reserve of assets, to specify the highly liquid financial instruments in the reserve of assets and to specify the minimum content of the liquidity management policy and procedures, in accordance with Articles 36(4), 38(5) and 45(7)(b) of MiCAR respectively.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<span>Guidelines on recovery plans&nbsp;</span>have been developed in accordance with&nbsp; Article 46(6) of MiCAR after consultation with ESMA. The Guidelines specify the format of the recovery plan and the information to be provided therein.</p>

<div> Securities and Exchange Commission, budget request, fiscal year 2025, capital markets, investment advisers<br />Summary:
SEC requests budget increase to match market growth, addresses need for additional resources in technology, real estate, and programmatic divisions. <div>
<p>Good morning, Chair Van Hollen, Ranking Member Hagerty, and members of the Subcommittee. Thank you for inviting me to testify today on the Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s Fiscal Year (FY) 2025 budget request. As is customary, I&rsquo;d like to note that my views are my own as Chair of the SEC, and I am not speaking on behalf of my fellow Commissioners or the SEC staff.</p>
<h2>The SEC at 90 Years</h2>
<p>At the SEC, we had our 90<span>th</span>&nbsp;birthday just one week ago.</p>
<p>After the 1929 market crash, President Franklin Roosevelt signed the first of the federal securities laws in 1933. He followed a year later with the passage of the Securities Exchange Act&mdash;making June 6, 1934, our birthday at the SEC.</p>
<p>The SEC was created to ensure that the markets worked free of fraud and manipulation&mdash;and that investment advisers carried their duties to the clients they advised.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Congress and Roosevelt understood how important our capital markets are to investors, issuers, and more broadly our economy. Today, the $110-plus trillion U.S. capital markets are the deepest, most liquid in the world. At 40 percent of the world&rsquo;s capital markets,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;they outpace our roughly 24 percent of the world&rsquo;s economy.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;The U.S. capital markets also play an integral role in the dollar&rsquo;s dominance.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>We cannot, however, take this leadership for granted.</p>
<p>The SEC is a remarkable agency. We serve investors building for a better future and issuers raising money to fund innovation, while overseeing the capital markets where they meet. The essence of this is captured in our three-part mission to protect investors, facilitate capital formation, and maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets.</p>
<p>The SEC is the cop on the beat watching out for the investing public and issuers. The dedicated staff of this agency does extraordinary work with limited resources.</p>
<h2>Growth and Change in the Markets</h2>
<p>Our limited resources contrast against the tremendous growth and change in our markets.</p>
<p>The U.S. capital markets benefit from significant engagement from everyday investors. About 58 percent of U.S. households own stocks, up from 52 percent in 2016.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;More than half of American households, representing nearly 121 million individual investors, own registered funds.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p>The U.S. has long benefitted from robust competition between nonbanks and banks. The Commission plays a key role in overseeing many aspects of the nonbank sector. Each of the registered funds and private funds sectors surpasses the size of the banking sector.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Further, U.S. debt capital markets facilitate 75 percent of debt financing of non-financial corporations. In Europe, the U.K., and Asia, only 12-29 percent is raised in capital markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p>Today, more than 15,400 registered investment advisers advise 57 million clients.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;This includes advising on more than $32 trillion in registered funds,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;$30 trillion in private funds,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;and nearly $50 trillion in separately managed accounts.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p>At the end of 2016, by comparison, 12,000 registered investment advisers advised 43 million clients.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></p>
<p>Let me put this in context. The entire U.S. banking system is $23 trillion.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;Thus, the capital markets are nearly five times the size of our banking sector.</p>
<p>The Commission has a role in both public and private markets, each of which offer investors and companies opportunities. Our public markets have approximately 7,400 actively reporting issuers, of which more than 4,000 companies list on U.S. exchanges.</p>
<p>We now oversee approximately 40,000 entities&mdash;including more than 13,000 registered funds, more than 15,400 investment advisers, more than 3,300 broker-dealers, 24 national securities exchanges, 103 alternative trading systems, 10 credit rating agencies, 33 self-regulatory organizations (SROs), and six active registered clearing agencies, among other external entities. The SEC oversees the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB), the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).</p>
<p>Technology is rapidly transforming markets and business models. These changes range from electronic trading and the cloud to artificial intelligence and predictive data analytics, just to name a few. There has been dynamic change in communications to and among investors, from Reddit forums to celebrity influencers. Further, we&rsquo;ve seen the Wild West of the crypto markets, rife with noncompliance, where investors have put hard-earned assets at risk in a highly speculative asset class. Many of those investments have disappeared after a crypto platform or service went under due to fraud or mismanagement, leaving investors in line at bankruptcy court.</p>
<p>Today, there are more than 54 million separately managed accounts; in 2018, there were 37 million.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>&nbsp;Transaction volume in listed equities has doubled in the last five years and tripled in the last 17 years.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></p>
<p>Such growth and rapid change also mean more possibility for wrongdoing. We&rsquo;ve seen the number of tips, complaints, and referrals we get at the SEC climb from about 16,700 in 2019 to more than 40,000 in 2023. As the cop on the beat, we must be able to meet the match of bad actors.</p>
<p>Despite the increasing workload, the SEC staff again has rated us among the best places to work in the federal government; this year, we ranked third among midsized agencies.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>&nbsp;Our attrition this fiscal year is at historically low levels, so far averaging around 3 percent at an annualized rate.</p>
<h2>Budget Request</h2>
<p>I am pleased to support the President&rsquo;s FY 2025 request of $2.594 billion for SEC operations in support of 5,621 positions and 5,073 full-time equivalents (FTEs). In addition, we&rsquo;ve requested $8.4 million for needs supporting General Services Administration (GSA)-led real estate projects. As this Committee considers this request, it&rsquo;s worth noting the SEC&rsquo;s funding is deficit-neutral; our appropriations are offset by transaction fees.</p>
<p>In the face of significant growth in registrants, complexity, and individual investor engagement in markets, one may have thought that our agency would have grown over the last eight years. Unfortunately, the reverse was the case&mdash;the SEC actually shrank between 2016 and 2022. With Congress&rsquo;s help, we were authorized to hire 400 people in FY 2023 to bring us just modestly above where we were in 2016. &nbsp;</p>
<p>While our funding was kept flat for FY 2024, the growth in market activity was anything but flat. We are losing pace with the ever-increasing scale of the capital markets we oversee.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Allow me to put flat funding into the context of the SEC&rsquo;s overall budget. Approximately 70 percent of our budget is for staff, about 15 percent is for technology, 5 percent is for facilities, and 10 percent is for everything else. This agency doesn&rsquo;t give out grants or other programmatic money. Thus, given year-over-year price and wage increases, flat funding means cutting staffing, technology, and real estate. &nbsp;</p>
<p>At the start of FY 2024, we paused on nearly all job postings and backfilling for departing staff. As a result, we are currently more than 300 positions below the level authorized by Congress for both FY 2023 and FY 2024.</p>
<p>While the agency&rsquo;s rules get outsized attention in the media, it&rsquo;s worthwhile noting that the vast majority of the SEC&rsquo;s staff works on day-to-day oversight of the markets and responding to public and registrant inquiries. We collectively review tens of thousands of filings a year.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>&nbsp;More than 10 percent of the agency reviews disclosure documents, more than half of the agency is within the Divisions of Enforcement and Examinations, and 13 percent of the agency is in support operations. Shrinking any of these efforts will inevitably mean that the agency will be less responsive to the public and less able to protect the public.</p>
<p>As it relates to technology, we cut IT spending by roughly a quarter in FY 2024. These reductions in technology spending will delay transitions to the cloud, investments in data analytics, modernizations of key systems, and important enhancements to our technology infrastructure. As a result, we are scaling back our technology programs at a time when the markets we oversee are growing more technologically complex with each passing year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As it relates to facilities, in fiscal years 2021 to 2024, we will have shed 275,000 usable square feet from the SEC&rsquo;s real estate footprint. This includes vacating one of our three headquarters buildings in Washington, D.C., at the end of FY 2023, resulting in approximately $14 million per year in savings. Furthermore, the SEC announced it will close our Salt Lake City office early in FY 2025.</p>
<p>As it relates to other expenses, we also have reduced spending on contracts that support mission critical efforts. An example includes our ability to update and improve the Division of Enforcement&rsquo;s document management and review systems&mdash;tools that are critical to reviewing massive document productions during the course of investigations and litigations.</p>
<p>If we are again flat funded, there will be significant further implications on our ability to monitor the markets, maintain SEC programs, adequately resource technology, and meet the agency&rsquo;s critical mission.</p>
<p>Without additional resources, the oversight of markets is at risk. Our ability to find bad actors is at risk. Our responsiveness to market participants is at risk. American capital formation and innovation are at risk as issuers will have to wait longer to hear from us.</p>
<p>The SEC currently has 30 Divisions and Offices across our 11 regional locations<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a>&nbsp;and Washington, D.C., headquarters. I&rsquo;m summarizing below the budget requests for our six Divisions and will briefly touch on technology and real estate. For further details as well as a review of the other offices of the SEC, please reference the FY 2025 Congressional Budget Justification.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<h2>Enforcement and Examinations</h2>
<p>As I mentioned, the Divisions of Enforcement and Examinations account for more than half of the SEC&rsquo;s staff. Without examination of our registrants and enforcement of rules and laws when they are broken, we can&rsquo;t instill the trust necessary for our markets to thrive. Stamping out fraud, manipulation, and abuse lowers risk in the system. It means that fewer bad actors will get away with misconduct. It protects investors and reduces the cost of capital. The whole economy benefits from that.</p>
<h3>Division of Enforcement</h3>
<p>As I noted, in FY 2023, the SEC received more than 40,000 separate tips, complaints, and referrals from whistleblowers and others, a 13 percent increase over FY 2022.</p>
<p>Even with limited resources, the Division brought 784 enforcement actions in FY 2023, a three percent increase over fiscal year 2022. When looking only at the 501 original, or &ldquo;stand-alone,&rdquo; enforcement actions we file&mdash;whether settled or litigated&mdash;it&rsquo;s an 8 percent increase over the prior fiscal year. Our actions resulted in orders for $4.9 billion in penalties and disgorgement. The SEC distributed $930 million to harmed investors in FY 2023.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, rapid technological innovation in the financial markets has led to misconduct in emerging and new areas, not least in the crypto space. Further, the complexity of the frauds we are investigating&mdash;and the sophistication of the fraudsters&mdash;is ever increasing.</p>
<p>Addressing this requires new tools, expertise, and resources. When the cars become faster and the highways more congested, you want more cops, not fewer.</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s request would grow the team by 27 FTEs to 1,447. The additional staff will provide the Division with more capacity to meet these challenges, investigate misconduct on a larger scale, accelerate the pace of enforcement investigations to resolution, and represent the Commission and protect investors in increasingly complex litigations.</p>
<h3>Division of Examinations</h3>
<p>The Division of Examinations serves a critical role in helping to ensure firms comply with the law.</p>
<p>In FY 2023, we conducted more than 3,100 examinations across our tens of thousands of registrants. From investment advisers to broker-dealers to exchanges, the Division helps ensure that registrants are following their legal obligations to customers and clients, including seniors and other vulnerable investors.</p>
<p>Importantly, the Division is the first line of defense for the investing public relying on investment advisers. It is responsible for examining and overseeing a growing registrant population, including more than 15,400 investment advisers and approximately 800 investment company complexes.</p>
<p>Further, we work in parallel with SROs to examine the more than 3,300 broker-dealers with roughly 150,000 branch offices.</p>
<p>This stretches thin the limited resources of the Division.</p>
<p>Our FY 2025 request would help the Division grow 20 FTE to reach 1,156 FTEs.</p>
<p>These additional resources are the minimum just for the Division to stay abreast of the growth in market participants and make key investments to help protect the American public regarding emerging cyber and information security risks.</p>
<h2>Programmatic Divisions</h2>
<p>Next, I will turn to our three programmatic Divisions.</p>
<h3>Corporation Finance</h3>
<p>The Division of Corporation Finance oversees the disclosures of new issuers and public companies so that investors can make informed investment decisions. It&rsquo;s important for investors to receive useful, timely, and accurate disclosure. It&rsquo;s important that issuers can get timely feedback on their registration statements and other filings. Today, there are more than 7,400 active reporting companies, up from about 6,800 in 2020.</p>
<p>In FY 2023, the Division reviewed the filings of more than 3,700 reporting companies and new issuers.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 2025 budget request would grow the team to 447 FTEs. With this increase of 16 FTEs, the Division would still be 30 FTEs under the 2016 level.</p>
<p>Additional resources would allow the Division to serve investors and issuers more ably as markets grow and evolve.</p>
<h3>Investment Management</h3>
<p>The Division of Investment Management oversees the 13,000 registered funds and 15,400 investment advisers that steward nest eggs for 57 million clients. At the end of 2016, by comparison, 12,000 registered investment advisers advised 43 million clients.</p>
<p>As noted earlier, both the registered funds market and the private funds market are each bigger than the banking sector, and we&rsquo;ve seen significant growth in both. More than half of American households, representing more than 115 million individual investors, own registered funds. When I started on Wall Street 45 years ago, household penetration was less than 6 percent.</p>
<p>In FY 2023, the Division reviewed more than 4,200 annual and periodic reports as well as more than 8,600 total portfolios and insurance contracts.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a></p>
<p>Given this growth in the markets, we&rsquo;ve asked to grow the division by nine FTEs to a total of 237.</p>
<h3>Trading and Markets</h3>
<p>The Division of Trading and Markets serves on the front line for maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets. Market monitoring and supervision are essential parts of the Division&rsquo;s activity&mdash;especially during times of market stress.</p>
<p>The Division oversees 24 national securities exchanges, 103 alternative trading systems, more than 3,300 broker-dealers, 51 security-based swap dealers, six active registered clearing agencies, and more than 200 transfer agents, among other entities.</p>
<p>In FY 2023, the Division responded to more than 16,000 public inquiries. In FY 2023, the Division also reviewed more than 660 filings of broker-dealers as well as more than 1,700 SRO proposed rule changes and advance notices.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/gensler-testimony-061324?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a></p>
<p>As market centers, broker-dealers, and clearance and settlement systems continue to grow in size and activity, so does the need for robust supervision of these entities and intermediaries.</p>
<p>In FY 2025, we&rsquo;ve requested 14 additional FTEs, for a total of 293, to support this important function of the Commission.</p>
<h3>Economic and Risk Analysis</h3>
<p>Economic analysis is critical to all of the agency&rsquo;s work. The Division of Economic and Risk Analysis provides impartial economic analyses that consider the costs and benefits of our rules as well as their effects on efficiency, competition, and capital formation.</p>
<p>We get feedback from the public on these economic analyses, which benefits our rulemaking. Our economic analyses also benefit the markets broadly because making data available creates a public good.</p>
<p>In the Enforcement context, the Division&rsquo;s staff is instrumental in assisting Enforcement staff with identifying potential wrongdoing, assessing ill-gotten gains, and working to return funds to harmed investors.</p>
<p>DERA assists the Commission in its efforts to identify, analyze, and respond to economic and market issues, including those related to new financial products, investment and trading strategies, systemic risk, and fraud.</p>
<p>Given the critical nature of the Division&rsquo;s work, for FY 2025, we&rsquo;ve asked for funding to support 196 FTEs total, just one additional FTE.</p>
<h2>Additional Matters</h2>
<h3>Technology</h3>
<p>Technology and data continue to fuel rapid change in our markets. The rise of big data, algorithms, and AI in our markets has put more pressure than ever on the SEC to keep pace. For example, the data processing by the Division of Enforcement alone has grown 20 percent year over year for the last three years. Cyber threats represent an ever-increasing threat to the agency and our markets alike. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet, as I mentioned, the SEC is cutting its IT program by about a quarter this fiscal year because of budget pressures. We have had to delay technology upgrades, some migrations to the cloud, and enhancements in data analytics.&nbsp; For example, we cut back significantly our investments in Enforcement case management; Enforcement, Exams, and DERA analytics capabilities; implementation of the government-wide Zero Trust security program; and the workflow system supporting the Division of Corporation Finance&rsquo;s disclosure review program. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus, we have requested $457 million for information technology. This would help support the Commission&rsquo;s cybersecurity, migration to the cloud, modernization of key systems like EDGAR, implementation of the Financial Data Transparency Act, and other critical IT needs. This request assumes full use of an additional $50 million from the SEC Reserve Fund for multi-year IT projects and programs. To put these figures in context, this spending is dwarfed by what some of the biggest market participants spend in a month on technology.</p>
<h3>Facilities</h3>
<p>We currently have offices in Washington, D.C., and 11 regional offices. The total facilities cost in FY 2024 is only 5 percent of our budget. We continue to work with GSA to manage it prudently, significantly reducing our space footprint as I described earlier.</p>
<p>Part of the SEC&rsquo;s FY 2025 request is $8.4 million for lease procurements managed by GSA. This amount represents the additional funds needed for GSA&rsquo;s recompete of the lease for the SEC&rsquo;s Chicago Regional Office.</p>
<p>We will continue looking for opportunities to achieve cost savings across our leasing footprint in the years to come.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The U.S. capital markets are the deepest, most liquid in the world. We cannot, however, take this leadership for granted. The SEC needs to be funded to meet the match of the growing and evolving markets we oversee. I thank the Committee for providing me the opportunity to summarize this budget request.</p>
<p>I am pleased to take your questions.</p>

Summary: <div>
<p>Thank you, Chairman Van Hollen, Ranking Member Hagerty, and members of the Subcommittee.&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate the opportunity to testify before you today on the President&rsquo;s fiscal year 2025 budget request for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC or Commission).</p>
<p>For over a century, derivatives markets have played a key role in the U.S. economy, promoting economic growth and contributing to financial stability and the predictability of prices that impact the daily lives of all Americans.&nbsp;&nbsp;This October, the CFTC will commemorate its 50th&nbsp;anniversary as an independent agency with exclusive jurisdiction over futures trading in&nbsp;all<i>&nbsp;</i>commodities.&nbsp;&nbsp;This milestone provides a natural inflection point as we consider how the past 50 years will impact the next.</p>
<p>Over the last nearly 15 years, I have witnessed the massive expansion of the CFTC&rsquo;s jurisdiction through Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act, organic growth in our historic markets, the introduction of new products, including the digital commodity asset class, and the significant expansion of market participants, both institutional and retail as a result of technological disruption.&nbsp;&nbsp;To put a number on it, trading volumes in exchange-traded futures and options have more than doubled; and the swaps market is now over $350 trillion,<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam47?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;which is approximately half of the estimated $715 trillion global market.&nbsp;&nbsp;Given this exponential global growth, and working individually, through our operating divisions, and the Office of International Affairs (OIA), I have prioritized a collaborative working relationship with our domestic and international regulatory partners to ensure regulatory harmonization, market efficiency, and reducing unintended and negative consequences to U.S. derivatives markets.</p>
<p>As Chairman, I am focused on: identifying and addressing regulatory gaps and uncertainty; strengthening the agency organizationally so that we are an operationally effective, diverse, and competitively attractive employer; better understanding and incorporating the digital asset ecosystem and&nbsp;artificial intelligence (AI)&nbsp;into our decision making; and addressing the need for guidance regarding emerging product and market structures such as voluntary carbon credit (VCC) derivative contracts and vertical integration.</p>
<p>Today, technology is driving change in the financial markets, and the CFTC must keep pace in order to fulfill its mission and Congressional mandate.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our work centers on customer protection and market resiliency, while supporting continued growth and innovation that will take the agency into the next 50 years.</p>
<p>To date, and thanks to my fellow Commissioners and the incredibly hardworking staff of the CFTC, the agency has stayed on course following an agenda I outlined in early 2023 to consider and vote on roughly 30 new regulatory and policy matters in addition to all proposed rules and orders from the prior year.&nbsp;&nbsp;I bucketed these actions into themes that address:&nbsp;risk management and resilience; customer protections; efficiency and innovation; reporting and data policy; duplicative regulatory requirements; and international comity.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fundamental to&nbsp;all of these themes is the need to update our ruleset to address the derivatives industry&rsquo;s current course, which is driven by technology and seeks to both leverage and, in some instances, move away from traditional and familiar models.&nbsp;&nbsp;The dominant disruptors of our current era raise important questions about conflicts of interest, the strength of capital, margin, and segregation requirements, the role and responsibilities of self-regulatory organizations, affiliate risk management and customer protections.</p>
<p>As the CFTC&rsquo;s Chairman, I have made very conscious and intentional decisions aimed at ensuring that we not only exemplify good stewardship of taxpayer dollars, but also provide genuine organizational support for our valued employees.&nbsp;&nbsp;My first priority as Chairman included directing an agency-wide strategic approach to human capital management focused on rebalancing and upskilling our workforce through succession planning and building a bench of future expertise that brings diversity of thought, experience, and background.&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been over four years since our people left the confines of their offices and we assumed an expansive telework posture.&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that while we have been productive and achieved success in certain mission critical functions, we are keenly aware of the benefits of being together in person in the office.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, we have heard from some of our staff and supervisors their desire to return to the office.&nbsp;&nbsp;A resolution to the impasse in our negotiations will allow staff to plan their lives accordingly.&nbsp;&nbsp;The CFTC has always been a place that valued its peoples&rsquo; needs to balance work and home life, and we will continue to do so as we negotiate the next steps.</p>
<p>In addition, I have led reforms in how the Commission collects, interprets and reports on market data. This data connects our infrastructure, security, surveillance, analytical, and enforcement needs and duties, and will significantly impact how we meet our mission in the tech-driven future.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam47?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2">[2]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The CFTC has, under my direction, moved to the cloud, achieved significant advancement in cybersecurity protections, reorganized, increased the visibility of, and added new leaders to, our Division of Data (DOD)&mdash;including our first Chief Data Scientist who will lead our AI training and implementation-- and launched a CFTC-wide technical training initiative.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our goal is the long game: building capabilities over time towards organizational maturity and technical achievement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, I am proud to say that under my direction, the CFTC&rsquo;s new AI Task Force issued a request for comment (RFC) on the use of AI in CFTC-regulated markets.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam47?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3">[3]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The AI RFC is part of a greater vision to advance analytical capabilities through building talent, leveraging the cloud, and developing a forward-looking culture.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a process in place for exploring AI use cases to&nbsp;help the agency better monitor, regulate, surveil, identify pockets of stress, and enforce compliance.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are currently reviewing the RFC comments to better understand what, if any, policy changes are needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, the Office of Customer Education and Outreach (OCEO), the agency&rsquo;s education arm, issued a Customer Advisory in January warning the public about emerging AI-driven fraud and scams.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam47?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4">[4]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Consistent with mandates by the Administration and OMB guidance, I recently announced that our Chief Data Officer and DOD Director will serve as the CFTC&rsquo;s first Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer responsible for&nbsp;promoting the agency&rsquo;s use of AI and guide us in managing AI risks.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam47?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5">[5]</a></p>
<p>Said a bit differently, my goal is to modernize the CFTC to ensure our continued success well into the future. We are seeing changes in market structure and in the demographics of market participants.&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that institutions, products, and processes that prove valuable enough to producers, consumers, investors, and the general public&mdash;however such value is determined&mdash;will inevitably find a way to integrate with established regulatory systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is our role to ensure market safety and integrity by enforcing existing standards under our governing statute and regulations, and by determining new approaches when warranted and consistent with the law.</p>
<p>The proposed budget before you today reflects the minimum resources needed for the CFTC to perform its role as the primary regulator of the U.S. futures, swaps, and options markets, and to properly enforce the law to protect markets and market participants.&nbsp;&nbsp;It provides the resources we absolutely need to ensure that the agency has the appropriate and necessary capabilities to keep up with technological innovation shaping our markets in 2024 and beyond.&nbsp;&nbsp;It optimizes resources to ensure the protection of the market data we receive and keeps the agency&rsquo;s systems and infrastructure shielded from emerging risks and cyber threats. It funds oversight and surveillance responsibilities generated by an increasing number of derivatives exchanges offering products that require consideration of new and emerging risks.&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the budget&nbsp;ensures that our enforcement program continues its proactive approach in identifying and addressing misconduct within our ever expanding and transforming markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is especially critical in light of growing retail participation and the need for greater protections in the digital asset space.&nbsp;&nbsp;The planned prioritization in these areas will help the CFTC fulfill its mission in a rapidly changing marketplace.</p>
<p>The CFTC&rsquo;s Budget Request for Fiscal Year 2025</p>
<p>The Commission is requesting a total of $399 million and 725 FTE for FY 2025.&nbsp;&nbsp;The request for its operational budget was developed with the &ldquo;Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023&rdquo; in mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;With the understanding that the budgetary challenges we are currently addressing will likely bleed into the coming year, and that some difficult decisions will be made, we have sought to focus on the most critical areas to reach this number that represents about a 2.9 percent decrease below the FY 2024 budget request, and just over a nine percent increase above the FY 2023 and 2024 enacted budget.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Division of Enforcement (DOE)</p>
<p>The Commission requests $74 million and 163 FTE to protect the public and preserve market integrity by detecting, investigating, and prosecuting violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and Commission regulations through the activities of its Division of Enforcement. This is an increase of $5.5 million over the FY 2024 enacted budget.</p>
<p>The Commission&rsquo;s exercise of its enforcement authorities to address misconduct that has a direct impact on CFTC jurisdictional markets, affects the larger economy, causes public harm, or interferes with market integrity is one facet of our approach to innovation and the evolution of financial markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;This increase will, among other things, support the development of innovative approaches utilizing cutting edge technologies and upskilling of Commission staff with the goal of identifying misconduct earlier and addressing bad actors expediently.</p>
<p>A review of the filings for FY 2024 demonstrates that while digital asset related cases are rightfully demanding significant attention,<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam47?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6">[6]</a>&nbsp;DOE is ensuring that we take necessary action in all of our directly regulated markets and in the retail fraud space involving precious metals and forex (foreign exchange).&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also building even stronger networks and partnerships through cooperative enforcement efforts with other civil and criminal agencies domestically and internationally.&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the matters that have stood out this fiscal year, several in the agricultural, energy, and financial sectors exemplify our unwavering commitment to ensuring that registrants meet their regulatory obligations, that customers receive the protections they deserve, that our markets remain free from manipulation and fraud, and that misconduct in the digital asset space receives swift attention.</p>
<p>Nowhere have we been more active than in the digital asset space.&nbsp;&nbsp;In FY 2023, we&nbsp;brought 47 actions involving conduct related to digital commodities, representing more than 49 percent of all CFTC actions filed during that period.&nbsp;&nbsp;A staggering statistic given the fact that no federal agency retains any direct regulatory authority over the underlying (or cash) digital commodity asset market.&nbsp;&nbsp;We can only act on digital asset fraud or manipulation when we uncover or discover anomalies through regulated market surveillance and oversight, or through tips and complaints we can pursue. With many agency resources which are not considered in our budget appropriation being allocated to an unregulated market, I fear the current trajectory is unsustainable.&nbsp;&nbsp;Namely, we will continue to see rampant fraud and manipulation in the digital asset market that will hurt American customers, and possibly infect the traditional financial markets.</p>
<p>To date, FY 2024 is demonstrating a similar cadence.&nbsp;The lack of legislation addressing the regulatory gap over the digital commodity asset spot market has not hindered the public&rsquo;s enthusiasm for digital assets, and I continue to believe Congress must act, as the 2022 FSOC (Financial Stability Oversight Council) report highlighted<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam47?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7">[7]</a>, and as I have mentioned publicly on multiple occasions.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam47?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8">[8]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Until such time, the Commission will continue to use its expertise and the tools it has to protect our markets and the public.</p>
<p>Division of Market Oversight (DMO)</p>
<p>The Commission requests $36 million and 88 FTE for the Division of Market Oversight to continue its commitment to maintaining the integrity of the markets as it reviews new applications and monitors ongoing compliance with core principles and regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>DMO is expecting growth in 2024 and 2025 given the growing interest in offering novel, innovative, and increasingly complex products. Currently, there are seven exchange or DCM (designated contract market) applications in review.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each registration application requires both intra-divisional and inter-divisional teams of staff to review the application and the applicant&rsquo;s planned operations, and determine compliance with the CEA and Commission regulations.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Division will need to train and dedicate additional staff to registrations as the number and variability of applicants continues to grow.</p>
<p>In FY 2025, the Commission&rsquo;s system safeguards examinations&mdash;an essential component of the examination program for DCMs, SEFs (swap execution facilities), and SDRs (swap data repositories)&mdash;will remain crucial to economic stability. Effective cybersecurity practices and system safeguards of regulated entities requires increased direct surveillance and vigilance for the scope of examinations conducted each year.</p>
<p>With respect to rule and product filings, in FY 2023, the Commission continued to receive a diverse array of product filings from exchanges seeking to meet market participants&rsquo; varying needs, including many innovative products. The number of filings and the diversity of product offerings require additional resources to ensure Division staff can complete their reviews, and stay abreast of market developments and the technological advancements underlying these new products and attendant rules.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example,&nbsp;since 2021, there has been a significant uptick in the number of event contracts listed for trading by CFTC-registered exchanges.&nbsp;&nbsp;From 2006 through 2020, DCMs listed for trading an average of approximately five event contracts a year. In 2021, this number increased to 131, and the number of newly-listed event contracts per year has remained at a similar level in subsequent years.</p>
<p>With respect to rulemakings, in FY 2024 the Division continues to plan and undertake rulemakings to amend Commission rules, as appropriate, to address changes in the constantly evolving derivatives markets. The Division expects efforts in proposing, adopting, and implementing rules to ensure the Commission&rsquo;s regulatory framework keeps pace with recent market innovations, to continue in FY 2025.</p>
<p>Division of Clearing and Risk (DCR)</p>
<p>Market events and the volatility in the global financial markets linked to geopolitical issues, continued pandemic recovery and reformation, weather and climate-related risk, and monetary and fiscal policy consistently raise challenges related to liquidity and margin requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;These factors also fuel active debate on the need for additional tools and resources to manage risks, including collateral management.&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the importance of clearing to the financial system, and the role of U.S.-regulated central counterparties (CCPs) as among the strongest in the world, the Commission requests $35.6 million and 86 FTE for the Division of Clearing and Risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;These funds are necessary to maintain current capabilities and expand examination and surveillance of activities that will impact clearing markets, credit, liquidity, and modeling risks, enhance cyber and operational resilience, and support the safety and soundness of derivatives clearing organizations (DCOs).</p>
<p>Currently, the CFTC has ten registered DCOs in the United States, including two DCOs that have been designated as systemically important by FSOC. In addition, the Commission regulates five registered DCOs located outside the United States, including some that have a direct impact on U.S. markets, given the volume of swaps and futures cleared for U.S. entities.&nbsp;&nbsp;DCO examinations, which are time and staff resource intensive, help the Commission identify issues that may affect a DCO&rsquo;s ability to identify, manage, and monitor its risks. DCOs represent single critical points of managing risk in the global financial system where the failure or disruption to the functioning of these DCOs could create or increase the risk of liquidity or credit problems spreading among other financial institutions.</p>
<p>There are four DCOs outside the United States exempted from registration by the Commission that are permitted to clear proprietary swap transactions for U.S. entities. Although the CFTC relies principally on foreign authorities for oversight, it does engage in limited monitoring and surveillance of these exempt DCOs. The Commission maintains an active, data-driven quantitative risk surveillance function. It expects to continue investing additional resources in human capital, data, and technology to improve its current analytical capabilities and keep up with growth in both the scale and complexity of risk transmission in the derivatives markets - both cleared and uncleared.</p>
<p>Market Participants Division (MPD)</p>
<p>The Commission requests $28.5 million and 69 FTE&nbsp;for the Market Participants Division to maintain effective oversight of registered market participants using current delegated authorities and improved cooperative oversight policies.&nbsp;&nbsp;The CFTC oversees the registration and compliance of thousands of derivatives market participants, including swap dealers (SDs), major swap participants (MSPs), Futures Commissioners Merchants (FCMs), retail foreign exchange dealers (RFEDs), introducing brokers (IBs), commodity trading advisors (CTAs), commodity pool operators (CPOs), floor brokers, and floor traders. MPD also oversees the self-regulatory organizations (SROs), including the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the National Futures Association (NFA), by assessing whether the SROs&rsquo; compliance programs over member firms meet established regulatory standards.</p>
<p>Regulated market participants are a cornerstone of the Commission&rsquo;s regulatory framework. To date, 62 registered FCMs hold more than $474 billion in customer funds, and 106 registered SDs collectively transact hundreds of trillions in notional value swap contracts annually, serving as a vital source of liquidity for financial institutions and commercial end users seeking to hedge their risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, the CFTC directs its registration and compliance resources to provide critical policy and regulatory guidance to registered market participants, both directly and in coordination with the SROs. In addition, the Commission oversees the National Futures Association (NFA) in its role implementing delegated authorities to register and oversee compliance by registered market participants. The Commission ensures that registration rules, standards, and reporting requirements continue to be responsive to the needs of the evolving marketplace.</p>
<p>Division of Data</p>
<p>The Division of Data develops and implements the CFTC&rsquo;s enterprise data strategy, providing the specialized technical, analytical, and related services necessary for the Commission to standardize, acquire, process, examine, govern and exploit mission critical market and industry data.&nbsp;&nbsp;As the agency&rsquo;s designated authority on data issues, DOD provides CFTC regulatory and enforcement staff with the data and analytical capabilities needed to perform mission work, develops and oversees data sharing and protection agreements with external entities, and enables policymakers to make data-driven decisions for overseeing the U.S. derivative markets. In accordance with this mission, the responsibilities of DOD include establishing the Commission&rsquo;s data strategy, data standards, data architecture and governance, and building/maintaining the agency&rsquo;s core data infrastructure.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission requests $42.1 million and 41 FTE to continue leveraging cloud and other new technology to enhance and transform its ability to collect, analyze and draw informed conclusions from market data to both conduct and support effective enforcement actions, oversee rapidly evolving markets, and formulate sound regulatory policy.</p>
<p>Whistleblower Incentives and Protection</p>
<p>A key to the effectiveness of our enforcement division is the CFTC&rsquo;s whistleblower program.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dodd-Frank Act established the Customer Protection Fund<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam47?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9">[9]</a>&nbsp;that supports our Whistleblower Program<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam47?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10">[10]</a>&nbsp;and the OCEO.&nbsp;As of FY 2023, the Whistleblower program has issued 41 orders granting awards totaling almost $350 million since its inception in FY 2010.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam47?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11">[11]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;In fiscal year 2024, the program has, thus far, awarded $18 million to whistleblowers.&nbsp;&nbsp;The total sanctions ordered in all whistleblower-related enforcement actions has surpassed the $3 billion milestone.</p>
<p>As this Committee knows, the overwhelming success of the Whistleblower Program has unintentionally led to the potential for disruptions in these two vital offices due to their funding mechanisms.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the importance of a long-term fix to avoid depletions greater than the total balance of the fund,&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;believe Congress should amend the statutory provisions to clarify the permitted uses of the Customer Protection Fund by the OCEO.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam47?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12">[12]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;This change would allow the Commission to implement a host of new investor protection programs and provide information aimed at ensuring American families have the knowledge and tools to not only protect themselves from fraud and manipulation, but to more fully engage with the Commission and the markets we oversee.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>I know I speak for all the Commissioners when I thank CFTC staff for their commitment to the agency and its mission.&nbsp;&nbsp;My team and I are working closely with staff and their union representatives in order to find a suitable work posture, post-pandemic, that honors the importance of being present and together in the office with appropriate flexibility, and ensures our accountability as good stewards of taxpayer money.&nbsp;&nbsp;The agency&rsquo;s long-term health and success depend on it.</p>
<p>As we move through 2024, I am proud of the CFTC&rsquo;s undeniable record of using regulation, innovation, and collaboration to ensure our markets function well, and of providing risk management and transparency for all stakeholders, including, most notably, America&rsquo;s commercial end-users who rely on derivatives markets to manage risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;More than ever, in these uncertain times both domestically and internationally, we need thorough and thoughtful regulation to ensure confidence and accountability in the derivatives markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;To continue delivering results to the derivatives markets and American public, we need consistency and certainty so that we can allocate resources towards critical and multi-year investments.</p>
<p>Thank you again for the opportunity to appear before you today.&nbsp;&nbsp;I look forward to your questions.</p>

<div> municipal, corporate, CUSIP, issuance, volume
Summary: Municipal CUSIP issuance surged in May, while corporate volumes remained steady. International debt CUSIP requests saw a significant increase. <div>
<p align="left"><a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=8Y6jULk71JCJVWAHccbE23Hd8yr6H9OVDOO4qu1xfmOcFwR0IRnsdOQKRp2sDwWYBjqHD6gGFZW4UBqRidJGNeFLHJGnmAN6TK0q3KIK-k8NHQQW4HXreypGLgJ_QpaT" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="CUSIP Global Services">CUSIP Global Services</a>&nbsp;(CGS) today announced the release of its CUSIP Issuance Trends Report for May 2024. The report, which tracks the issuance of new security identifiers as an early indicator of debt and capital markets activity over the next quarter, found a fourth-consecutive monthly increase in request volume for new municipal identifiers, while corporate volumes were steady overall.</p>
<p>North American corporate requests totaled 7,362 in May, which is down 3.2% on a monthly basis. On a year-over-year basis, North American corporate requests closed the month up 10.2%. The monthly volume decline was driven by a decrease in issuance volume for medium term notes. Other key asset classes, such as U.S. corporate equity (13.5%), U.S. corporate debt (17.8%) and Canadian corporate securities (17.9%) all saw monthly request volume increases.</p>
<p>The aggregate total of identifier requests for new municipal securities &ndash; including municipal bonds, long-term and short-term notes, and commercial paper &ndash; rose 51.5% versus April totals.

Summary:
MarketAxess introduces portfolio trading tool for tax-exempt municipal bonds, allowing efficient negotiation and execution for up to 1,500 unique CUSIPs. Growing market share and automated execution suite. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>MarketAxess Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: MKTX), the operator of a leading electronic trading platform for fixed-income securities, today announced the platform&rsquo;s first ever portfolio trade for tax-exempt municipal bonds. The portfolio trade was executed earlier this month between a large bank and a large asset manager.</p>
<p>The new Portfolio Trading for Tax-Exempt Munis tool allows clients to send lists to multiple counter-parties or a single dealer, negotiating price improvements and trading discreetly on a diversified basket of Tax-Exempt Munis in one singular point of transaction. Clients can load portfolio trades manually or utilize straight-through-processing via their OMS. Once loaded, clients can see instantly the changes in portfolio metrics, any impact on the portfolio&rsquo;s overall market value and utilize MarketAxess&rsquo; technology to make split-second decisions on portfolio composition and pricing. During the portfolio negotiation process, clients also have the option to counter or remove individual line items for optimal execution.</p>
<p>Daniel Kelly, Head of Municipal Securities at MarketAxess, commented, &ldquo;The portfolio trading tool was among the most requested enhancements to our Municipal bond franchise. Now muni traders can finally experience the same efficiency their counterparts in the corporate bond market have enjoyed for years&mdash;the flexibility to negotiate on individual line items without sacrificing certainty of execution for up to 1,500 unique CUSIPs in a single transaction.</p>
<p>With the launch of our automated execution suite of tools for munis last year and now, portfolio trading&mdash;we are proud to be delivering the innovation municipal market participants have asked for, and needed, to effectively scale their businesses,&rdquo; he continued.</p>
<p>MarketAxess is one of the fastest growing electronic marketplaces for muni bonds. Last month, MarketAxess accounted for 8.1% estimated market share of municipal bonds&mdash;up from 5.6% the year prior&mdash;and representing $577 million in average daily volumes.</p>

<div> European Commission, Blockchain, Tokenization, Regulatory Sandbox, Coinbase
<br />
Brickken, a Barcelona-based startup, joins the European Commission's Regulatory Sandbox to collaborate with regulators, expand its market, and revolutionize tokenization.
<br /><br />Summary: Brickken, a Barcelona-based startup, is selected for the European Commission's Regulatory Sandbox to collaborate with regulators and expand its market. <div>
<ul>
<li>This regulatory sandbox, driven by the European Commission, fosters a secure and reliable environment where blockchain technology providers and regulators can collaborate and reach agreements.</li>
<li>The Spanish startup, which has already tokenized assets worth 200 million euro, continues to lead the tokenization path following its recent inclusion in PwC's digital assets program and its partnerships with industry leaders such as Chainlink, Psalion and Keyrock among others.</li>
<li>Coinbase will work with Brickken and each of the partners engaging the European Commission sandbox to help shape best practices for institutions to engage in products safely and securely onchain.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Brickken, a Barcelona-based startup pioneering in the tokenization of real-world assets, announced today its selection to participate in the European Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) Regulatory Sandbox. This regulatory sandbox will provide legal certainty for decentralized technological solutions, including blockchain, by identifying deployment obstacles from a legal and regulatory perspective. Additionally, it will offer legal advice, regulatory expertise, and guidance in a secure and confidential environment.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The program, driven by the European Commission, will enable regulators and supervisors to enhance their understanding of the latest blockchain technologies and share best practices through ongoing dialogue between public institutions and private entities such as Brickken.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>With its inclusion in the European Regulatory Sandbox, Brickken will be able to develop and optimize its solutions within a secure environment, boosting its acceptance among institutional clients, market operators, and bond issuers, thereby facilitating its entry into new markets. Brickken aims to become a strategic ally for various capital market players, maximizing their operational efficiency and fostering technological synergy in digital asset management.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Edwin Mata, CEO and co-founder of Brickken, expressed his enthusiasm about the selection, stating: "</span><span>This opportunity validates our innovative approach to asset tokenization and also allows us to collaborate with regulators and other industry leaders to build a stronger and more reliable blockchain ecosystem. The experience and knowledge we gain in this regulatory sandbox will be invaluable for our future growth and success</span><span>."</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Brickken&rsquo;s inclusion in this sandbox represents another milestone in its mission to revolutionize the tokenization industry. Just one week ago, the startup announced its selection for the Scale program for tokenization and digital assets by the international consultancy PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), marking another step towards the adoption of blockchain by institutional clients, banks, and capital m</span><span>arkets. Furthermore, the company has secured partnerships with industry giants&nbsp;</span><span>such as Psalion and Chainlink, the world's leading real-world asset tokenization technology, used by global financial institutions</span><span>.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Brickken and Coinbase will combine their expertise to advance best practices for infrastructure and market structure powering the tokenization of real-world assets. Brickken brings their know-how in tokenization and technology, and will build solutions on infrastructure supported by Coinbase such as Wallet and Base.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Founded in Barcelona in 2020 by Edwin Mata, Yassir Haouati, Bram Duindam, and Dario Lo Buglio, Brickken is experiencing rapid growth. It is now active in over 14 countries, has tokenized more than 200 million euro in assets, boasts over 50 clients, and has seen a growth rate of over 100% compared to the previous year. The company is now addressing new verticals that are open to the solutions offered by Brickken.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>This company's digital asset platform specializes in the tokenization of financial instruments like equity and debt, regardless of the company's size, asset type, or jurisdiction. It provides robust technological support for anyone looking to enter the market without the need to develop their technology, as they can rely on Brickken's infrastructure, which offers a frictionless entry. This enables them to serve a wide range of sectors, including real estate, startups, institutions, venture capital funds, and Family Offices, allowing them to efficiently digitize and manage their assets.</span></p>

<title>Retail Investors Bullish On Gold And Silver In May: Spectrum Markets</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li>Spectrum's European retail investor sentiment indicator shows bullish behaviour on gold and silver</li>
<li>Sentiment suggests retail investors saw a buying opportunity as gold prices dipped in May</li>
<li>Retail investor sentiment has remained bullish on silver since its introduction on Spectrum in December 2023</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spectrum Markets (&ldquo;Spectrum&rdquo;), the pan-European trading venue designed for retail investors, has published its SERIX sentiment data for European retail investors for May, revealing bullish trading behaviour for both available precious metal underlyings, gold and silver.</p>
<p>Gold prices fluctuated in May, peaking at $2,449 per ounce by 20<sup>th</sup> May before dropping to $2,325 towards the end of the month<a href="file://C:/Users/Herbie%20Skeete/Downloads/Spectrum%20Markets_European%20Retail%20Investors%20bullish%20on%20Gold%20and%20Silver%20in%20May.docx#_ftn1">[1]</a>. This dip created a buying opportunity for investors and was likely a key driver of the bullish SERIX sentiment of 104.</p>
<p>Silver also reached a record high of $32.391 per ounce by the end of May<a href="file://C:/Users/Herbie%20Skeete/Downloads/Spectrum%20Markets_European%20Retail%20Investors%20bullish%20on%20Gold%20and%20Silver%20in%20May.docx#_ftn2">[2]</a>. However, retail investors remained bullish, with the SERIX for silver closing at 108 points for the month. Since Spectrum introduced products with silver as an underlying asset to trade in December 2023 in response to investor demand, sentiment towards the precious metal has been consistently bullish, starting with a peak SERIX value of 125 points.</p>
<p>The SERIX value indicates retail investor sentiment, with a number above 100 marking bullish sentiment, and a number below 100 indicating bearish sentiment. (See below for more information on the methodology).</p>
<h4><b>Market opinion</b></h4>
<p>&ldquo;Despite the SERIX sentiment on gold indicating tactical buying behaviour from retail investors, the SERIX on silver tells a different story, aligning with its high market price,&rdquo; says Michael Hall, Head of Distribution at Spectrum Markets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While the performance of gold is strongly connected with currencies and interest rates, the SERIX sentiment indicator suggests European retail investors track the silver market based on rising demand patterns. This increasing demand is driven in part by the search for alternative energy solutions, as silver is essential in photovoltaic panels, which convert sunlight into electricity,&rdquo; adds Michael Hall.</p>
<h4><b>Spectrum&rsquo;s May data</b></h4>
<p>In May 2024, order book turnover on Spectrum was &euro;246.7 million, with 36% of trades taking place outside of traditional hours (i.e., between 17:30 and 9:00 CET).</p>
<p>70.5% of the order book turnover was on indices, 16.8% on commodities, 5.4% on equities, 3.6% on currency pairs, and 3.7% on cryptocurrencies, with the top three traded underlying markets being DAX 40 (25.1%), NASDAQ 100 (24.9%), and DOW 30 (9%).</p>
<p>Looking at the SERIX data for the top three underlying markets, the DAX 40 sentiment decreased from 101 to a bearish 98. Similarly, the NASDAQ 100 dropped from 101 to 99 and the DOW 30 fell from 103 to 99 this month.</p>

<div>
<p align="center"><b>Calculating SERIX data</b></p>
<p>The Spectrum European Retail Investor Index (SERIX), uses the trading venue&rsquo;s pan-European trading data to shed light on investor sentiment towards current development in financial markets.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The index is calculated on a monthly basis by analysing retail investor trades placed and subtracting the proportion of bearish trades from the proportion of bullish trades, to give a single figure (rebased at 100) that indicates the strength and direction of sentiment:</p>
<p align="center"><i>SERIX = (% bullish trades - % bearish trades) + 100</i></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;<span>Trades where long instruments are bought and trades where short instruments are sold are both considered bullish trades, while trades where long instruments are sold and trades where short instruments are bought are considered bearish trades. Trades that are matched by retail clients are disregarded.

<p>The VC and PE are important components of the alternative financing ecosystem in the Malaysian capital market.

<p>This initiative aligns with the SC&rsquo;s broader efforts to deepen market-based financing avenues for MSMEs and mid-tier companies (MTCs).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Guide also supports the national KL20 agenda to establish Malaysia as a leading startup ecosystem globally by providing practical guidance for prospective fund managers and investors seeking to establish or expand their presence in Malaysia.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<title>Report: 65% Of Financial Institutions Struggle To Enforce Compliant Electronic Communications Policies - Annual Research From Global Relay Reveals That 79% Of Financial Services Firms Use Communication Surveillance Technology To Prevent Off-Channel Communications Violations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: WhatsApp bans, communication surveillance technology, compliance solutions, Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policies, AI in financial compliance
Summary:<br /><br />More firms use WhatsApp bans, surveillance technology, and compliance solutions. Difficulty in getting staff to comply persists. BYOD policies increase, AI adoption uncertain. North American firms cautious about AI. Regulatory scrutiny intensifies. <div>
<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.globalrelay.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Global Relay</a>, the&nbsp;leading provider of electronic communication compliance and archiving solutions,&nbsp;released its second annual&nbsp;<i>Industry Insights Report: Compliant Communication 2024</i>, discovering that despite a decrease of 15% year-over-year (YoY), WhatsApp bans prevail as the most-commonly used solution (43%) to marshal internal business communications. The report also revealed that four out of five firms (79%) are increasingly using communication surveillance technology to identify misconduct and culture risk.</p>
<p>The global survey examines how compliance, surveillance, and risk leaders in financial services are responding to intensified regulatory scrutiny surrounding recordkeeping and compliant communications, charting attitudes to WhatsApp, social media risks, monitoring and surveillance, sentiment around AI, and what the future might hold for compliance.&nbsp;Despite many firms noting that they ban the use of WhatsApp at work to mitigate the risk of non-compliant off-channel communications, only 50% of respondents said they thought that channel bans would withstand regulatory scrutiny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Asset managers, broker-dealers, and investment banks are all grappling with the WhatsApp conundrum,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<strong>Alex Viall, Chief Strategy Officer for Global Relay</strong>. &ldquo;We engineered Global Relay&rsquo;s unified platform to help institutions adapt to the fast-evolving business communications recordkeeping environment. It&rsquo;s significant progress that compliance solutions are more road-worthy than during the initial panic when the US Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission started their rolling enforcements. Many firms know they ultimately will have to enable this type of communication to stay competitive. We have worked hard to understand firms&rsquo; communications compliance needs and craft technology that addresses them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since the publication of last year&rsquo;s global&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Industry Insights Report</span>,&nbsp;U.S. regulators have continued to issue significant fines to firms that &ldquo;did not maintain or preserve the substantial majority of these off-channel communications,&rdquo; with three tranches of enforcements totalling&nbsp;nearly $450 million, most recently in February with the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2024-18" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SEC&rsquo;s $81 million in penalties against 16 firms</a>.</p>
<h4><b>Majority of firms encounter difficulty getting staff to comply with communication rules</b></h4>
<p>Global Relay&rsquo;s report also revealed that more firms &ndash; up 4% YoY &ndash; around the globe are facing difficulty getting staff to comply with rules around electronic communication channels, with nearly two-thirds (65%) citing this issue as part of their ongoing challenge around off-channel communications risk.&nbsp; Financial services firms are making progress toward monitoring business communications with significantly fewer respondents having difficulty monitoring all communication channels, down to 24% from 54% last year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Financial institutions are reacting in response to the substantial regulatory penalties,&rdquo; continued&nbsp;<strong>Viall</strong>. &ldquo;They have got the message and are implementing strategic compliant solutions that ensure the capture, storage, and monitoring of all essential business communication channels. This is no easy task. Compliance and risk officers are more aware that banning social media channels and forbidding the use of personal mobile devices are impractical measures that are difficult to enforce. Many are still in the planning phase but all are tackling this and prepared to show stakeholders and regulators how they best plan to manage off-channel communications.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Contrary to industry perception, the report revealed the number of financial institutions using Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policies has ballooned from 36% in 2023 to 53% in 2024. Considering continued enforcement for personal device usage, 45% of respondents have looked to clarify their BYOD policies, with 17% moving away from BYOD altogether.</p>
<h4><b>72% of global firms seek to introduce&nbsp;AI&nbsp;in the next year, but North American interest lags behind</b></h4>
<p>Respondents reported general uncertainty about AI in financial compliance, including whether it is a risk (17%), reward (10%) or both (32%). Despite this caution, 42% of global respondents said they would be looking to introduce AI to compliance workflows in the next 12 months, with 57% saying that they would not be. Leaders at North America firms demonstrated reticence compared to their European and Global counterparts, with 65% of North American firms noting they do not have plans to introduce AI within the next year.</p>
<p><i>Industry Insights Report: Compliant Communication 2024</i>&nbsp;serves as a litmus test for market responsiveness to regulatory action for recordkeeping and communications compliance. Regulators have taken steps to clarify expectations, including guidance from the&nbsp;SEC&nbsp;on when it will&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.globalrelay.com/resources/blog/fair-warning-sec-sets-out-trigger-factors-for-acting-against-ccos" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">enforce against Chief Compliance Officers</a>&nbsp;directly and the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.globalrelay.com/resources/blog/remediate-recordkeep-rinse-repeat" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">factors it considers</a>&nbsp;when imposing fines for recordkeeping violations.<span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<div> strategy, technology modernisation, regulatory commitments, expense management, capital expenditure
Summary:<br />ASX marks one year of progress on its five-year strategy, including technology modernization, regulatory achievements, expense and capital expenditure guidance, and continued business investment. <div>
<p>Today&rsquo;s Investor Forum marks one year since ASX announced its new five year strategy and Managing Director and CEO Helen Lofthouse will detail the progress made on strategic outcomes including the key focus areas of technology modernisation and regulatory commitments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The briefing today will also deliver further detail on the indicative technology roadmap and outline growth opportunities ASX is pursuing while maintaining its focus on executing Horizon 1 strategic outcomes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms Lofthouse said: &ldquo;Our five year strategy builds on the foundations of a high quality portfolio of businesses that deliver resilient revenue performance throughout market cycles. The key regulatory deliverables for FY24 were achieved within expected timelines, and we&rsquo;re pleased to share further detail on our major technology projects including CHESS replacement and the work underway to upgrade our trading and derivatives clearing platforms.&rdquo; Key highlights since the last investor briefing include:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>CHESS replacement in delivery phase following decision to progress with a product based solution to be delivered by global technology firm Tata Consultancy Services;</li>
<li>Commencement of program of industry consultation for CHESS replacement releases and for potential shortening of settlement cycle to T+1;</li>
<li>Delivery of three special reports to ASIC detailing roadmap for maintenance and supportability of CHESS, implementation of external review recommendations on aspects of CHESS replacement and further uplift of delivery capability;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Increase in stakeholder engagement and independent advice for cash market clearing and settlement with the formation of the Advisory Group and the appointment of an independent chair to the ASX Business Committee;</li>
<li>Launch of first ASX corporate bond, raising $275 million;</li>
<li>Targeted restructure in early 2024 delivering $11 million in annual savings;</li>
<li>Ongoing Listings activity which attracted total capital onto exchange of $73.6 billion for financial YTD (after delisted capital for the same period of $51.1 billion, this delivered net new capital of $22.5 billion);&nbsp;</li>
<li>Announcement of exploratory work with Clean Energy Regulator to develop an Australian Carbon Exchange.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Being able to deliver these key wins in the first year of our strategy gives us confidence in our ability to continue to execute strongly,&rdquo; Ms Lofthouse said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve made strong progress against our strategic goals but we have more to do and we&rsquo;ve prioritised investment into technology modernisation and regulatory commitments to support long term shareholder value.&rdquo;&nbsp; ASX continues to prioritise business efficiency and provides the following financial guidance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forecast FY24 total expense growth rate of ~15%, at the top end of guidance provided with 2H24 expenses expected to be lower than 1H24;</li>
<li>Guidance for FY25 total expense growth rate to be between 6% and 9% (when excluding depreciation and amortisation, the range is expected to be between 4% and 7%);</li>
<li>Forecast capital expenditure for FY24 of around $135 million which is within previous guidance range;</li>
<li>FY25 technology capital expenditure guidance of between $160 million and $180 million<a href="file://C:/Users/Herbie%20Skeete/Documents/27-13-june-2024-investor-forum-2024-market-release.pdf#_ftn1" style="font-size: 11px;"><sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup></a><span style="font-size: 11px;">, with this elevated range expected for the medium term (FY25 &ndash; FY27) before starting to reduce beyond this point; and</span></li>
<li>Intention to maintain capital management settings for dividend payout ratio of between 80% and 90% of underlying net profit after tax for the medium term, and to continue to operate the Dividend Reinvestment Plan.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FY25 expense growth rate set out above is primarily driven by ongoing technology related investment including software licensing, equipment costs and depreciation and amortisation. ASX will maintain focus on expense management initiatives in FY25 including optimising our workforce mix, process simplification and automation, and strategic procurement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Continuing to invest in our business is critical to our strategy. We have high quality businesses, a compelling value chain and structural tailwinds that will support us into the future, and I&rsquo;m confident we are building a clear path to our growth horizon,&rdquo; Ms Lofthouse said.&nbsp;</p>

<title>CalPERS To Vote Against Tesla CEO’s Multibillion-Dollar Pay Package</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> compensation, Tesla, CalPERS, CEO, vote<br />
Summary:<br />
CalPERS opposes Tesla CEO Elon Musk's $46 billion compensation package due to excessive dilution, lack of performance ties, and board independence concerns. Additionally, CalPERS opposes a shareholder lawsuit's proposed $5.6 billion attorneys' fees in Tesla stock. <div>
<p>CalPERS today announced that it will again vote against a multibillion-dollar compensation package that Tesla proposes to give its chief executive officer at the company&rsquo;s annual meeting on June 13. The package would allow Elon Musk to buy 304 million shares of Tesla stock at its 2018 value, which would be worth approximately $46 billion. CalPERS also opposed the deal when shareholders approved the measure in 2018.</p>
<p>"This exorbitant compensation package is at odds with CalPERS' longstanding views on executive pay," said CalPERS CEO Marcie Frost. "The compensation is excessive when compared to executives at peer companies, highly dilutive to shareholders, and isn&rsquo;t tied to the long-term profitability of Tesla."</p>
<p>CalPERS has developed an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.calpers.ca.gov/docs/executive-compensation-analysis-framework.pdf" target="_blank" title="opens in new window">Executive Compensation Analysis Framework (PDF)</a>&nbsp;to help guide decisions on "say on pay" votes. The framework helps CalPERS assess whether executive pay is aligned with company performance and is reasonable relative to peers.</p>
<p>"While we agree that Mr. Musk is entitled to be well compensated for his work, we also believe that a pay package should be commensurate to a company&rsquo;s performance with reasonable salary caps," Frost added. "These features are absent in the deal as structured."</p>
<p>Some data points highlight the excessive nature of the award:</p>
<ul>
<li>The value is approximately $46 billion, accounting for the cost to exercise the options, which is larger than the last four years of Tesla&rsquo;s aggregate net income of $33.8 billion (2020-2023).</li>
<li>The award would be highly dilutive to existing shareowners and reduce their ownership proportion.</li>
<li>While the award does have a five-year holding period, it is concentrated in a single individual.</li>
<li>Compared with other high-performing companies over the same period, the Tesla option award is nearly 140 times the annual pay opportunity for other high-performing CEOs.</li>
<li>The payout rewards short-term growth and not sustained profitability. Tesla&rsquo;s value has fallen by more than half from its peak in 2021.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"We do not think a payout based on short-term market exuberance is warranted without sustained performance," said CalPERS Global Equities Investment Director Drew Hambly. "Additionally, this deal concentrates power in a single shareholder and was negotiated by board members whose independence from Tesla's CEO is questionable. For these reasons, CalPERS could not support the deal in 2018 and remains opposed today."</p>
<p>In addition, CalPERS also announced that it&nbsp;<a href="https://secure.fileandservexpress.com/Document/Download/517b5336-476e-4385-adcf-7b97caa71bdc3" target="_blank" title="Opens in new window">filed an objection</a>&nbsp;in a related matter involving Tesla. Early this year, a judge nullified the 2018 pay package after a shareholder filed suit. The plaintiff&rsquo;s lawyers have asked the court to award them $5.6 billion in attorneys&rsquo; fees, taken in the form of Tesla stock. CalPERS believes this sum is also exorbitant and would dilute shareholders&rsquo; interests in Tesla. As a result, CalPERS is joining at least one other Tesla shareholder in protesting this proposed windfall.</p>
<p>CalPERS owned nearly 9.2 million Tesla shares as of June 7.</p>

<div> charge, fraud, investment, settlement, criminal <br />
<br />
The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Joshua Goltry and JAG Capital Advisors LLC with defrauding investors of at least $3 million through a three-year scheme. Goltry and JAG Advisors raised funds by lying about the fund's performance, investment activity, and risks. They used more than $1.1 million on personal expenses and lost over $1.7 million through high-risk trading and speculative investments. They falsified documents to conceal the trading losses. Goltry and JAG Advisors agreed to settle the charges against them, which includes a permanent injunction from violating the federal securities laws. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey announced criminal charges against Goltry. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Joshua Goltry and his investment management firm, JAG Capital Advisors LLC (JAG Advisors), in connection with a three-year scheme to defraud investors of at least $3 million.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, from 2020 to 2023, Goltry, the founder and Chief Investment Officer of a purported equity fund called JAG Cap, LLC, and JAG Advisors, the purported equity fund&rsquo;s investment manager, raised at least $3 million from approximately nine investors by lying about nearly every aspect of the fund, including its performance, investment activity, and investment risks. Goltry is the principal of JAG Advisors. As alleged, of the funds raised, Goltry and JAG Advisors used at least $1.1 million on personal expenses, including travel and jewelry, and lost more than $1.7 million through high-risk trading and speculative investments. The complaint further alleges that Goltry and JAG Advisors falsified documents, including expense invoices, to conceal the trading losses from investors. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As alleged in the complaint, Goltry and JAG Advisors repeatedly lied to investors to lure them into investing in the JAG Fund and then lost their money or stole it to pay for lavish personal expenses,&rdquo; said Nicholas P. Grippo, Regional Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Philadelphia Regional Office. &ldquo;We will continue to diligently hold accountable those who exploit investors&rsquo; trust for personal gain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint charges Goltry and JAG Advisors with violating antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. Goltry and JAG Advisors agreed to settle the charges against them. The settlement, which is subject to court approval, would permanently enjoin Goltry and JAG Advisors from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and allows the court to decide the amounts of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties at a later date.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the District of New Jersey announced criminal charges against Goltry.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Suzanne C. Abt and Michael Cuff and supervised by Julia C. Green, Scott A. Thompson, and Mr. Grippo, all of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Judson T. Mihok and supervised by Gregory R. Bockin.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<div> Securities, Research, Regulation, AI, Capital Markets
<br />
Investment research, regulation, and AI are discussed. SEC rules, including research regulations, and the impact of AI in the capital markets.
<br /><br />Summary: 
Investment research regulation, including SEC rules and global impact. The role of AI in the capital markets. <div>
<p>Thank you for the kind introduction. I&rsquo;m pleased to be at the International Bar Association&rsquo;s Asset Management Industry Conference on Global Challenges and Opportunities.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-intl-bar-assoc-asset-mngmtindustry-conference-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;For the participants attending from abroad, welcome to Boston. It is an exciting time to be in the city, with the Boston Celtics competing at this moment for the NBA championship.</p>
<p>I understand that this particular IBA committee focuses on the global fund industry. It is no small feat to navigate the maze of laws and regulations and to counsel clients on complex issues that cross jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Despite our differences around the world, one constant is that the effectiveness of capital markets depends on the quality of the information environment. Today, I will discuss investment research provided by sell-side firms to asset managers and the rules governing such research. I have followed with much interest the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority&rsquo;s (&ldquo;UK FCA&rdquo;) recent consultation on modifying certain research unbundling rules required by the UK Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (&ldquo;UK MiFID&rdquo;), which were derived from the European Union&rsquo;s MiFID II.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-intl-bar-assoc-asset-mngmtindustry-conference-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;I commend the UK FCA for taking up this important issue and believe it is past time to review how investment research is regulated, including in the United States.</p>
<p>Investment research serves an important role in the global capital markets. It promotes the efficient allocation of capital and risk, resulting in increased economic growth and market liquidity. Sell-side and independent investment research help contribute to the efficient market hypothesis, in which prices reflect publicly available information. By contrast, buy-side research is typically proprietary and often only becomes incorporated into market prices when reflected by a manager&rsquo;s buy and sell orders. The decline of third-party investment research runs the risk that social media and rumors may increase in outsized influence &ndash; as nature abhors a vacuum. The result might be less informed and less efficient markets that do not serve investors and increase the cost of capital.</p>
<p>Regulators are demanding more disclosure than ever from public companies. For example, in the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s (&ldquo;SEC&rdquo;) climate-related disclosure rule would require extensive new public company disclosure.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-intl-bar-assoc-asset-mngmtindustry-conference-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;Public companies are also now required to disclose material cybersecurity incidents and describe their approach to cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-intl-bar-assoc-asset-mngmtindustry-conference-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;The New York Stock Exchange (&ldquo;NYSE&rdquo;) and Nasdaq-listed companies must also adopt and file policies regarding the recovery or &ldquo;clawback&rdquo; of excessive incentive-based compensation from current and former executive officers in the event of an accounting restatement.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-intl-bar-assoc-asset-mngmtindustry-conference-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;Third-party research can be an important resource in helping investors and asset managers digest the increasing volume of public company disclosures mandated by regulators. After all, what good is disclosure if no one has time to read it?</p>
<p>Despite the role played by investment research in price discovery and market efficiency, sell-side investment research that is bundled with trade execution has been viewed with skepticism by regulators, including by the SEC, due to potential conflicts of interest. First, a brief history about sell-side research in the United States: until May 1, 1975, when the SEC adopted Rule 19b-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (&ldquo;Exchange Act&rdquo;), NYSE required brokers to charge a minimum brokerage rate.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-intl-bar-assoc-asset-mngmtindustry-conference-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p>Fixed commission rates meant that broker-dealers had to compete in other ways, such as by providing customers with bundled research. The elimination of fixed commission rates thus raised questions for investment managers and the capital markets: for example, would managers be required by their fiduciary duty to pay the lowest commission rate and forgo bundled research? If brokers decided to stop producing research and compete solely on execution costs and speed, would smaller companies receive less research coverage and be less successful in raising capital? Would fewer companies decide to go public due to a concern about research coverage?</p>
<p>Congress recognized these potential problems and enacted section 28(e) of the Exchange Act in 1975.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-intl-bar-assoc-asset-mngmtindustry-conference-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;Section 28(e) provides a safe harbor for investment managers to pay more than the lowest commission rate if the manager determines in good faith that the commission is reasonable in relation to the value of such services. This permitted investment managers to &ldquo;pay up&rdquo; for soft dollars (e.g., research) alongside execution services and continue to use client funds to do so. With this safe harbor, however, came difficult interpretative questions about whether a product or service could be paid with soft dollars. To this end, the Commission and its staff have studied and issued guidance over the years about certain services and practices that were remotely connected to the investment decision-making process and thus did not likely qualify to be paid with soft dollars.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-intl-bar-assoc-asset-mngmtindustry-conference-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p>However by its terms, section 28(e) expressly permits broker-dealers to continue bundling execution and research and recognized that research can benefit investors by promoting more informed decision making from asset managers. Section 28(e) also demonstrates Congress&rsquo;s view of the importance of the service that broker-dealers provide in producing research, and that it is acceptable for managers to use client funds to pay for bundled research and execution, subject to certain safeguards.</p>
<p>During the dot-com bubble of the late-1990s that eventually crashed, concerns were raised about the role played by sell-side investment research. It culminated in the global research analyst settlements, when the then-NASD (now FINRA), the SEC, the NYSE, the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA), and the New York State Attorney General settled with 12 major broker-dealer firms for conflicts of interest between their research analysts and investment bankers (&ldquo;Global Research Settlement&rdquo;).<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-intl-bar-assoc-asset-mngmtindustry-conference-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;Investment bankers also were alleged to have supervised and taken part in research analyst compensation decisions. The Global Research Settlement required these broker-dealers to wall off research analysts from investment banking due to allegations that analysts published research designed to attract investment banking business based on favorable company reports. The Global Research Settlement&rsquo;s terms were modified in 2010. Only specific 12 firms were subject to the Global Research Settlement, and two &ndash; Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers &ndash; are no longer in existence, and Credit Suisse has since been acquired by UBS.</p>
<p>In addition, Regulation AC &ndash; which stands for &ldquo;Analyst Certification&rdquo; &ndash; was adopted by the SEC in 2003. While the proposal predated the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (&ldquo;SOX&rdquo;), which required the SEC to adopt certain rules regarding research analysts, the SEC noted that it would abide by the SOX directives in adopting Regulation AC.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-intl-bar-assoc-asset-mngmtindustry-conference-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;Regulation AC generally requires research analysts to certify to the truthfulness of the views they express in research reports and public appearances, and to disclose whether they have received any compensation related to the specific recommendations or views expressed in those reports and appearances.</p>
<p>Regulators elsewhere in the world, notably the EU and the UK, have taken a different approach, viewing the bundling of execution and research as an inducement to asset managers and thus an investor protection issue. Accordingly, MiFID II generally requires managers to pay for research separately from execution services, charge clients a separate fee, or pay for research themselves. MiFID II&rsquo;s research rules may have intended for independent research and lower commissions to offset the reduction in sell-side research; however, it appears that this experiment may have not accomplished these goals and has had unintended results.</p>
<p>For example, due to concerns about MiFID II leading to a decline in research on small and medium companies, the French Authorit&eacute; de March&eacute;s Financiers has recommended that MiFID II&rsquo;s inducements regime should not apply to research on companies with market capitalizations of &euro;1 billion or less.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-intl-bar-assoc-asset-mngmtindustry-conference-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;Across the English Channel, the UK FCA has issued a consultation requesting input on re-bundling investment research with brokerage execution services. This consultation follows up other work by the UK FCA, including the concerns noted by an Independent Research Review (&ldquo;IRR&rdquo;) study.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-intl-bar-assoc-asset-mngmtindustry-conference-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;The IRR found that the UK MiFID unbundling requirements adversely affected the quality and coverage of investment research for UK companies, and the UK&rsquo;s economic growth as a result. In addition, UK asset managers were disadvantaged as compared to their international peers in accessing global investment research, making them less competitive. Finally, the IRR noted a possible decline in the quality of UK research due to a &ldquo;juniorization&rdquo; in the ranks of sell-side research analysts. The efforts of these regulators to take a hard look at whether their regulatory policies achieved their intended goals is commendable.</p>
<p>MiFID II&rsquo;s inducements regime also caused challenging conflicts of laws issues for U.S. broker-dealers: charging separately for research services implicated questions of whether U.S. broker-dealers could rely on the exclusion from the definition of an investment adviser if they complied with MiFID II.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-intl-bar-assoc-asset-mngmtindustry-conference-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>&nbsp;To that end, the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Investment Management issued temporary no-action letter relief to permit U.S. broker-dealers to comply with MiFID II&rsquo;s research requirements and continue their business models.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-intl-bar-assoc-asset-mngmtindustry-conference-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>&nbsp;This relief was left to expire in July 2023, which was most unfortunate. In my view, the no-action letter should have been extended for a modest period to accommodate potential changes in UK MiFID and MiFID II.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-intl-bar-assoc-asset-mngmtindustry-conference-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>&nbsp;With the UK FCA&rsquo;s consultation, it become even more apparent that allowing the letter to expire was premature.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the Global Settlement, the SEC&rsquo;s then-enforcement director stated that &ldquo;the full impact remains to be seen&rdquo; and others hoped that it would lead to &ldquo;more straight talk on Wall Street.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-intl-bar-assoc-asset-mngmtindustry-conference-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>&nbsp;The impact, unfortunately, has been a lot less research out of Wall Street, particularly for small and medium sized companies. I hope that the SEC can learn from our international colleagues and examine our own research rules, including the Global Research Settlement.</p>
<p>The SEC should further undertake a retrospective review of the similarly 20-year-old Regulation AC, which would be an exercise of good government and responsible regulation. In this regard, the SEC should take heed of the 2017 recommendation from the U.S. Department of the Treasury that the SEC should conduct a holistic review of the Global Research Settlement and the research analyst rules to determine which provisions should be retained, amended, or removed, with the objective of harmonizing a single set of rules for all financial institutions.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-intl-bar-assoc-asset-mngmtindustry-conference-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a></p>
<p>Turning to today, I noticed that the IBA is holding two discussions on artificial intelligence (&ldquo;AI&rdquo;). AI is a hot topic, as it touches many areas of financial services and the capital markets, including investment research. AI and machine learning can automate and analyze vast quantities of data, such as financial statements and other public company disclosures. With AI, the research analyst&rsquo;s role could change, perhaps focusing less on data collection and more on interpretation and qualitative analysis. AI also could increase the resources available for smaller company coverage. &nbsp;Of course, AI is fallible and if not properly constructed and monitored, it could miss patterns, correlations, and risks. Therefore, while I am not overly concerned about a dystopian future where we are ruled by AI, we should continue to evaluate its use.</p>
<p>Thank you again for the invitation to speak and for your continued commitment to the global rule of law.</p>

<div> indicators, economic activity, inflation, monetary policy, Committee
Summary: Economic activity remains solid with strong job gains and low unemployment. Inflation is elevated but easing. Committee maintains federal funds rate and is committed to achieving 2 percent inflation. <div>
<p>Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. Job gains have remained strong, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Inflation has eased over the past year but remains elevated. In recent months, there has been modest further progress toward the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective.</p>
<p>The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals have moved toward better balance over the past year. The economic outlook is uncertain, and the Committee remains highly attentive to inflation risks.</p>
<p>In support of its goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent. In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent. In addition, the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage‑backed securities. The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.</p>
<p>In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.</p>
<p>Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chair; John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Thomas I. Barkin; Michael S. Barr; Raphael W. Bostic; Michelle W. Bowman; Lisa D. Cook; Mary C. Daly; Philip N. Jefferson; Adriana D. Kugler; Loretta J. Mester; and Christopher J. Waller.</p>

<div> monitoring report, cross-zonal transmission capacities, EU electricity market, grid congestion, future-looking assessment<br />
Summary:<br />
ACER and JRC will present findings on 70% transmission capacity requirement, integration of EU electricity market, and future assessment of grid congestion. <br /> <div>
<p>ACER and the Joint Research Centre (JRC) are organising a joint webinar to present and discuss the key findings from their&nbsp;2024 publications, focusing on electricity grid congestion and transmission capacities for cross-border electricity trade:</p>
<ul>
<li>ACER&rsquo;s yearly monitoring report on cross-zonal transmission capacities and the progress of Member States in reaching the minimum 70% requirement (to be published on 3 July 2024);</li>
<li><a href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsCVAYABVIBV0wIDwFSHVZbAFIdCggIAxpTAVZWVlADBw5QDgIdUAVbU1tTVVcdVAAAVx0GXwQAGldSVgMZAVZRAFBXVFBUXFJQRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" target="_blank">JRC&rsquo;s future-looking assessment on the evolution of congestion management in the current EU electricity market design</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">When?</span></p>
<p>Wednesday, 10 July 2024, 14:30 - 15:30 CET, online</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tackling barriers in the EU&rsquo;s transition to net-zero</span></p>
<p>A successfully integrated EU electricity market is crucial for the EU&rsquo;s ambitions of achieving net-zero emissions while maintaining its global competitiveness. How efficiently the electricity market design addresses grid congestion is key to this effort.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Realising the 70% transmission capacity requirement helps further integrate markets</span></p>
<p>EU rules mandate that grid operators ensure at least 70% of transmission capacity is available for electricity trade with neighbouring countries by the end of 2025. Why? Making the required 70% of capacity available for cross-zonal trade better integrates markets, enhances security of supply, reduces price volatility and increases the flexibility of the system. ACER monitors annually the availability of cross-zonal capacities in the EU and the progress of Member States in reaching the 70% requirement.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Future-proofing the European electricity market</span></p>
<p>The European Commission&rsquo;s JRC has developed a future-looking assessment of the volume and cost of addressing congestion in the electricity grid for the target years 2030 and 2040, based on different grid expansion scenarios.</p>

<p>CanDeal Markets Inc. (CanDeal Markets), a leading institutional electronic marketplace for Canadian debt and derivatives, has set a new daily trading record of $67.8 billion on June 3, 2024.

<p>The CanDeal marketplace, which offers trading across Government of Canada, Provincials, CMBs, Municipals, Corporate Bonds, Treasury Bills, Canadian Money Market, Repo and Interest Rate Swaps, is on track for a record year of trading activity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;CanDeal offers a deep liquidity pool for Canadian debt securities through its tight-knit community of buy-side firms and sell-side dealers,&rdquo; said Jamie Grant, President of CanDeal Markets. &ldquo;As the Canadian fixed income market continues to deepen its use of electronic trading, new protocols such as buy-side automated rules-bound trading and deferred spotting, which reduces tracking error, are introducing much greater efficiency.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<title>DTCC’s FICC Launches CCLF Public Calculator To Support Expansion Of U.S. Treasury Clearing - In Anticipation Of The New SEC Requirements For Expanded U.S. Treasury Clearing, This New Tool Simulates Estimated CCLF Obligations Associated With FICC GSD Membership</title>

<div> DTCC, FICC, CCLF, liquidity obligations, transparency<br />
Summary:<br />
DTCC launches public-facing CCLF calculator for U.S. Treasury market participants to estimate liquidity obligations and understand GSD membership requirements. <div>
<p>DTCC, the premier post-trade market infrastructure for the global financial services industry, today announced the launch of FICC&rsquo;s interactive, public-facing&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.dtcc.com/managing-risk/stress-testing-and-liquidity-risk-management/ccfl-public-calculator" target="_blank">Capped Contingency Liquidity Facility (CCLF) Calculator</a></span>.</p>
<p>With the expansion of central clearing in U.S. Treasuries on the horizon and given the size of transactions in the U.S. Treasury market - now exceeding USD $7 trillion daily - CCLF is a critical risk management tool used for managing DTCC&rsquo;s Fixed Income Clearing Corporation&rsquo;s (FICC) liquidity risk arising from settlement activity. Market participants can input their current unique settlement activity into the calculator to estimate and understand the CCLF-related liquidity obligations that could arise from membership.</p>
<p>CCLF is a rules-based liquidity resource facility that would provide FICC with additional liquid financial resources to meet its cash settlement obligations in the event of a default of the largest GSD family of affiliated Netting Members. To anticipate this potential funding need, GSD Netting Members incorporate their individually determined CCLF obligation amounts into their own liquidity plans. While the CCLF obligation is a committed obligation for the Netting Members, FICC does not require pre-funding or deposits of the obligation amount. Instead, as an ongoing FICC membership requirement Netting Members provide up-front attestations regarding their ability to provide such CCLF amounts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By providing the public CCLF calculator, we continue to increase transparency into our financial risk management program, empowering potential members to understand their role and obligations as a FICC GSD member,&rdquo; Tim Hulse, Managing Director, Financial Risk &amp; Governance at DTCC. &ldquo;CCLF provides a critical backstop to address the financial impact of volatility and stress across repo markets while safeguarding the industry and individual members.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The new CCLF calculator, accessible on dtcc.com, requires a series of data points to be provided by users. Once entered on screen, the calculator processes the data points using the existing GSD CCLF engine logic, delivering an estimated individual CCLF obligation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;FICC recognizes that many firms are considering membership with GSD to comply with the final SEC rule on expanded clearing of U.S. Treasury activity,&rdquo; said Claire Lough, Executive Director, Financial Risk &amp; Governance at DTCC. &ldquo;This calculator will enable market participants to simulate their potential CCLF obligations to assist in understanding what is required of a GSD Netting Member.&rdquo;</p>
<p>FICC is the leading provider of trade comparison, netting and settlement for the Government Securities marketplace. As part of its commitment to the industry, DTCC continues to assess calculators, tools and enhanced access methods to best support the expansion of U.S. Treasury clearing activity.</p>

<div> MOU, TFEX, RAOT, rubber reference prices, Thailand
Summary:<br />TFEX and RAOT partner to establish standardized Rubber Reference Prices, benefiting the industry and enhancing transparency and confidence.<br /> <div>
<p class="BodyA">Thailand Futures Exchange PCL (TFEX) has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Rubber Authority of Thailand (RAOT) for collaboration to establish the standardized Rubber Reference Prices. These benchmarks will serve as references trading transactions for both domestic and international players and facilitate the development of related products.</p>
<p class="BodyA"><b>TFEX Managing Director Rinjai Chakornpipat </b>said that<b> </b>the initiative is aimed to develop a recognized Rubber Reference Prices for Thailand, which will benefit both the rubber and related industries.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BodyA">"TFEX and RAOT aim for the reference prices to be widely accepted and used in trading transactions domestically and internationally. TFEX will calculate and publish the reference prices. The methodology for established reference price will be published for general public to ensure transparency of the benchmark. TFEX and RAOT also have a plan to consult with the industry to explore the development of rubber reference prices that comply with the European Union Deforestation-Free Regulation (EUDR). Besides, TFEX will further explore to utilize these reference prices for Rubber Futures product development," said Rinjai.</p>
<p class="BodyA"><b>RAOT Governor Nakorn Tangavirapat</b> said that even though Thailand is the world's major rubber producer, the country had relied on international rubber market prices as reference for its export contracts. Development of its domestic reference prices will help reflect the costs of Thai rubber farmers and local producers. To address this issue, RAOT, the central agency overseeing the entire rubber industry including domestic and export markets, has partnered with TFEX to develop the reference price calculation methodology for trading Thai rubber with aims to ensure transparency and adhere to international standards. The established reference prices will be publicly published, enabling relevant stakeholders to use them as a basis for determining contract prices for rubber exports (FOB prices). This development is expected to enhance confidence among stakeholders in the rubber industry. Under the collaboration, RAOT will gather and provide data on trading volumes, product information for various types of rubber, and other necessary information from RAOT&rsquo;s central rubber markets in each province. TFEX will use such data to calculate reference prices. RAOT and TFEX will disseminate these reference prices.</p>
<p class="BodyA">"We firmly believe that this collaboration marks a significant step in establishing internationally accepted methodology to establish Thai rubber reference prices and will pave the way for Thailand to become a hub for the rubber product industry, ultimately benefiting rubber farmers and Thai rubber entrepreneurs by strengthening their livelihoods and ensuring career stability,&rdquo; added Nakorn.</p>
<p>The MOU signing ceremony was held on June 12, 2024. The rubber reference prices will be calculated and published twice daily as follows: the price for Ribbed Smoked Sheet Grade 3 (RSS3) will be released at 12:00 hrs. (planned to launch in July 2024), while the prices for concentrated latex and block rubber will be announced at 19:00 hrs. (planned to launch in September 2024). For information on the Rubber Reference Prices, please visit TFEX website (<a href="http://www.tfex.co.th/">www.TFEX.co.th</a>) and the RAOT website (www.raot.co.th).</p>

<title>Three Million 'Frankenstein' Identities Pose A Multi-Billion Pound Fraud Threat: LexisNexis Risk Solutions</title>

<div> fraud, synthetic identity, UK, businesses, credit checks
Summary:<br /><br />New research from LexisNexis Risk Solutions shows that synthetic identity fraud threatens UK businesses with potential losses of £4.2billion by 2027. Scammers are creating synthetic identities to bypass fraud defenses, leading to potential significant financial losses for organizations. Noreen Altaf, an Identity Fraud specialist at LexisNexis Risk Solutions, advises businesses to invest in tools capable of spotting synthetic identities and review existing portfolios for any synthetic identities that may have infiltrated before they result in financial losses. <div>
<p>The latest fraud threatening the UK could cost businesses at least &pound;4.2billion if appropriate steps are not taken, new research from&nbsp;LexisNexis Risk Solutions shows.</p>
<div class="PRN_ImbeddedAssetReference" id="DivAssetPlaceHolder1">
<p><img src="https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2436045/LexisNexis_Risk_Solutions.jpg" title="Hotspots showing the fast-growth of synthetic Frankenstein identities across the UK" /></p>
</div>
<p>A new study looked at over 72million consumer profiles and found 2.8million showing several signs of 'Frankenstein cloning', where fraudsters stitch real and made-up personal details together to create a 'new' synthetic identity to spoof credit checks and commit high-value fraud against banks and credit providers.</p>
<p>In the U.S. where synthetic fraud is already a major issue, businesses report an average $15k<sup>[1]</sup>&nbsp;loss to each confirmed synthetic fraud case. As a result, experts at LexisNexis Risk Solutions estimate that it could cost the UK economy around &pound;4.2billion by 2027, unless firms start properly screening now, for the threat.</p>
<p>Most organisations' existing fraud defences are ineffective against synthetic identities because they appear as normal, good customers until the fraud is committed. Once they 'bust out' with the funds, the lender is left to suffer the loss, as there's no 'real' person to pursue for the debt.</p>
<p>Noreen Altaf, Identity Fraud specialist at LexisNexis Risk Solutions, explains: "At first, a synthetic ID has little value to a fraudster, as it has no credit history, so they need to play the long game. Scammers nurture each false identity by building what appears to be a real credit profile over time, making the synthetic ID seem like a trustworthy customer &ndash; because of this the fraud threat is effectively invisible to firms' existing fraud defences, until it's too late.</p>
<p>"Once a fraudster thinks the synthetic ID has enough plausibility, they'll aim to max out available credit lines. This might be applying for a loan or credit card for thousands of pounds, taking a PCP contract for a new vehicle, or making a high-value purchase via a buy now pay later arrangement. The fraudster has no intention of repaying this, leaving organisations to foot the bill and chasing ghosts to recover the debt.</p>
<p>"There is still much businesses don't know about this fast-emerging threat, so it's difficult to predict the true potential cost of synthetic fraud to the UK. However, even a very conservative estimate of a &pound;1,500 loss per fraud attack amounts to &pound;4.2 billion in future credit write-offs for companies, with synthetic identities already hiding amongst their customer base &ndash; and it could be a lot higher."</p>
<p>The study found strong evidence of scammers up and down the country using 'synthetic farms' in rural locations and 'synthetic factories' in urban areas to build up the credit scores of new synthetic identities on an industrial scale, in readiness for fraud attacks.</p>
<p>In one example, rental cottages based on a farm in Chichester appeared to have 439 highly suspect identities 'living' there over the past seven years, only 22 of which showed any evidence of being real people. The identities were making hundreds of applications for credit, such as short-term and payday loans and some were also linked to a similar farm hundreds of miles away near Dundee, Scotland.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A heat map produced alongside the report shows similar activity is happening across the whole UK. Suspected synthetic farms can be seen in multiple locations across rural Wales and the Scottish Highlands.</p>
<p>Noreen continues: "A common characteristic of synthetic farms and factories is that they are properties where the mail can be easily intercepted by the fraudsters making credit applications. A farm, for example, might have a mailbox that's at the end of a track, while empty buildings or shared mailboxes in cities can be exploited in a similar way.</p>
<p>"Synthetic fraud has been around for a while, but with sophisticated fraud modelling, we can, for the first time, more accurately detect and put a figure on it.</p>
<p>"Businesses need to act fast to protect themselves by investing in tools capable of spotting synthetic identities at application or onboarding stage, before they become customers. Given the length of time fraudsters have already been creating and nurturing synthetic identities in the UK &ndash; as evidenced by our research &ndash; banks, lenders and credit providers, in particular, should take appropriate action to review their existing portfolios to ascertain the extent to which synthetic identities may have infiltrated their organisations over time, before those identities get a chance to cash out."</p>

<div> Blueprint, Climate risk platform, Financial authorities, Integration, Data

Summary:
- Project Viridis integrates regulatory and climate data
- Developed by BIS and MAS
- A platform to identify, monitor and manage climate risks
- Uses EDKP technology
- Demonstrates integration of regulatory and climate data<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<ul>
<li>Project Viridis explores how regulatory and climate data could be integrated to provide insights into climate-related financial risks.</li>
<li>The project&rsquo;s report outlines a blueprint for a climate risk platform that can be used to identify, monitor and manage climate risks in the financial system.</li>
<li>The platform uses technology architecture developed by the BIS Innovation Hub Singapore Centre and MAS, enhanced in collaboration with other financial authorities from around the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) have developed a blueprint for a platform that integrates regulatory and climate data to help financial authorities identify, monitor and manage climate risks in the financial system.</p>
<p>2&nbsp;<span> </span>Integrating climate risk analysis into financial stability surveillance is challenging due to the complex nature of climate change, notable data gaps and limited understanding of how to measure the associated risks. To help tackle this challenge, a blueprint of a climate risk platform has been developed at the BIS Innovation Hub Centre in Singapore through Project Viridis.</p>
<p>3&nbsp;<span> </span>The blueprint lays out the key features and metrics required for a climate risk platform. These incorporate data and information on financed emissions, physical risk exposure and forward-looking assessments under different climate scenarios.</p>
<p>4&nbsp;<span> </span>&ldquo;As the impact of climate change on the global financial landscape intensifies, the need for adaptive and forward-thinking strategies has never been more urgent. Project Viridis helps equip financial authorities with the insights needed to integrate emerging climate risks into their analysis &ndash; and thereby help promote global financial stability,&rdquo; said Maha El Dimachki, Head of the BIS Innovation Hub Singapore Centre.</p>
<p>5&nbsp;<span> </span>&ldquo;Project Viridis is an innovative, collaborative blueprint that leverages technology solutions to systematically track climate-related data and metrices, thereby augmenting regulators&rsquo; efforts in assessing physical and transition climate risk exposures of individual banks and the financial system. This project addresses a common need of global financial authorities, and we look forward to further collaboration to expand such toolkits,&rdquo; said Celine Sia, Assistant Managing Director (Economics &amp; Knowledge Management), MAS.</p>
<p>6&nbsp;<span> </span>Project Viridis demonstrates how regulatory data can be integrated with climate data, which are extracted from corporate disclosure documents using natural language processing techniques. This provides authorities with insights into climate-related financial risks, helping them form an initial view of financial institutions&rsquo; risk exposures, and to identify areas that may require deeper risk assessment.</p>
<p>7&nbsp;<span> </span>More information on the platform can be found in the Project Viridis final report published&nbsp;<a class="mas-link" href="https://www.bis.org/publ/othp85.htm" target="_blank"><span class="mas-link__text">here</span>&nbsp;<span class="mas-icon mas-glyphs-external--link">&nbsp;</span></a>.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p><span><span>Additional Information</span></span></p>
<p>Project Viridis was first announced during BIS Innovation Hub&rsquo;s workplan in January 2022. For more information, please refer to this&nbsp;<a class="mas-link" href="https://www.bis.org/press/p220125.htm" target="_blank"><span class="mas-link__text">link</span>&nbsp;<span class="mas-icon mas-glyphs-external--link">&nbsp;</span></a>. As its foundational architecture, the Viridis platform uses the Ellipse Data and Knowledge Platform (EDKP), which was developed by the BIS Innovation Hub Singapore Centre and MAS under&nbsp;<a class="mas-link" href="https://www.bis.org/about/bisih/topics/suptech_regtech/ellipse.htm" target="_blank"><span class="mas-link__text">Project Ellipse</span>&nbsp;<span class="mas-icon mas-glyphs-external--link"></span></a>. The EDKP enables the integration of structured and unstructured data from various sources, and is being collaboratively enhanced by more than 15 central banks and financial regulators around the world. More information on EDKP can be found&nbsp;<a class="mas-link" href="https://www.bis.org/innovation/bis_open_tech_ellipse.htm" target="_blank"><span class="mas-link__text">here</span>&nbsp;<span class="mas-icon mas-glyphs-external--link"></span></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<title>New Zealand Financial Markets Authority Files Civil Proceedings Against Booster Investment Management Ltd And Individual Directors And Senior Managers</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-files-civil-proceedings-against-booster/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-files-civil-proceedings-against-booster/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The FMA has filed civil proceedings against Booster Investment Management Limited (BIML), a wholly owned subsidiary of Booster Financial Services Limited. The proceedings allege breaches of the Financial Markets Conduct Act (FMCA) by BIML and the following directors and senior managers of BIML:&nbsp;Allan Yeo (director), Paul Foley (director), Brendon Doyle (former director), David Beattie (senior manager) and Nicholas Craven (senior manager).</p>
<p>The FMA proceedings allege that multiple breaches occurred through 2017-2022, arising from investments made by BIML into a related, limited partnership, the Booster Tahi Limited Partnership (Tahi), which in turn invested into a series of domestic wine businesses, later amalgamated into the Booster Wine Group (BWG).&nbsp;The investors referred to in this case are retail investors and the funds involved come from three Booster Schemes (the Booster KiwiSaver Scheme, Booster Super Scheme and Booster Investment Scheme, (the&nbsp;Schemes)).&nbsp;Booster has advised that as at 31 May 2024, 24 of the 61 retail funds Booster manages have exposure to BWG, including six KiwiSaver Funds. Those Funds&rsquo; exposure ranges from 0.77% to 3.83%.</p>
<p>The FMA alleges 75 causes of action that:</p>
<ul>
<li>BIML breached its duties and obligations as the manager of the Schemes when investing in the manner described above;</li>
<li>the individuals involved used their positions improperly as directors or senior managers, in circumstances where conflicts of interest and related party benefits were not properly managed, when making investments of Scheme funds to benefit Tahi and the BWG; and</li>
<li>failures to follow required processes meant that the relevant transactions were made in breach of the prohibition against related party transactions.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Relevant provisions of the FMCA</p>
<p>Managers&rsquo; Duties</p>
<p>The entity, BIML:</p>
<ul>
<li>section 143(1)(b)(i) - to act in best interests of scheme participants (six causes of action);</li>
<li>section 143(2) - to carry out the functions of a manager in accordance with the governing document (18 causes of action);</li>
<li>section 143(3) - to comply with the same duties and liabilities as those imposed on a trustee (one cause of action); and</li>
<li>section 144 - to exercise any powers, or perform any duties, with the care, diligence and skill that a prudent person engaged in that profession would exercise (14 causes of action).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Individuals:</p>
<ul>
<li>sections 145(1)(b) - duty to not make an improper use of their position to gain an advantage for another (17 causes of action); and</li>
<li>section 533(1)(c) - being knowingly concerned in a breach of s 143 (for Mr Yeo and Mr Doyle only) (one cause of action).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Related party transactions</p>
<ul>
<li>section 173(1) - general prohibition on transactions giving a related party benefit (18 causes of action).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The basis for the FMA filing a case for these alleged breaches is broadly as follows:</p>
<p>As the Manager of these schemes, BIML is responsible for selecting and managing the investment portfolios of Scheme funds in accordance with its governing documents (including the trust deed, Product Disclosure Statement and Statement of Investment Policy and Objectives). BIML&rsquo;s Investment Committee (BIML IC) is delegated to make specific investment decisions within the framework of those governing documents, and in accordance with BIML&rsquo;s Investment Charter.</p>
<p>The FMA alleges the relevant Tahi investments were made without any consideration by the BIML Investment Committee:</p>
<ul>
<li>where the specific circumstances of an investment suggest that it was not in the best interests of Scheme participants. These circumstances include the concerns of BWG's lenders (that were known to BIML), the purpose of advances, and the underperformance of the BWG;</li>
<li>where the specific investment was not made in accordance with Tahi's investment criteria (which BIML was obliged to monitor);</li>
<li>the size and timing of particular requests for funding, and the timeframe for responses; and where there were material changes in the underlying business or the broader circumstances of that underlying business, without any reassessment of the appropriateness of the ongoing investment.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Margot Gatland, FMA Head of Enforcement, said: &ldquo;The FMA considers the alleged breaches to be serious, and that civil proceedings are the proportionate response. The allegations are centred around important governance provisions of the FMCA, including fiduciary duties of managers and related party transactions. The Court&rsquo;s determination will provide guidance to the market about the application of these core FMCA investor protection provisions, that managers and directors are required to comply with when making investment decisions on behalf of others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The FMA will be seeking declarations of contravention, pecuniary penalties to be paid to the Crown, and an inquiry into damages. As the case is now before the courts, the FMA cannot comment further on these matters.</p>
<p>FMA&rsquo;s approach to supervision during a litigation process</p>
<p>The FMA's regulatory delivery team has increased engagement with BIML to ensure it is satisfied with aspects of BIML&rsquo;s governance and operations, with a focus on its direct investment activities. Booster is cooperating with the FMA&rsquo;s supervisory team. This work will continue in parallel with the proceedings and is focused on current and future compliance and investor outcomes.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Each contravention has a maximum penalty of $600,000 for the entity, and $200,000 for an individual.</p>
<p>A court directed inquiry into damages would determine, if agreed to by the court, what harm or loss any investors have suffered as a result of the alleged breaches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank Erica for her leadership and am pleased that she will continue to serve as Chairperson of the PCAOB,&rdquo; said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. &ldquo;I also thank the PCAOB staff and the Board for their diligent work to ensure that public company financial disclosures can be trusted by investors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>SEC Chief Accountant Paul Munter added, &ldquo;I look forward to continuing to work with Chairperson Williams to further the PCAOB&rsquo;s long-overdue plan to modernize standards and improve audit quality to promote investor protection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>"I am honored to have Chair Gensler and the Commission's confidence and grateful for the opportunity to continue working alongside my fellow Board Members and the talented and dedicated PCAOB staff to protect investors," said Chair Williams.

<title>SEC Charges Founder Of AI Hiring Startup Joonko With Fraud</title>

<div> charged, fraud, artificial intelligence, SEC, investor <br />
<br />
Ilit Raz, CEO of Joonko, charged by SEC for defrauding investors of $21M with false statements about company's clients, revenue, and AI capabilities. Criminal charges also filed. <br />
Summary: <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Ilit Raz, CEO and founder of the now-shuttered artificial intelligence recruitment startup Joonko, with defrauding investors of at least $21 million by making false and misleading statements about the quantity and quality of Joonko&rsquo;s customers, the number of candidates on its platform, and the company&rsquo;s revenue.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Joonko claimed to use artificial intelligence to help clients find diverse and underrepresented candidates to fulfill their diversity, equity, and inclusion hiring goals. To raise money for Joonko, the complaint alleges that Raz falsely told investors that Joonko had more than 100 customers, including Fortune 500 companies, and provided investors with fabricated testimonials from several companies expressing their appreciation for Joonko and praising its effectiveness. Raz also allegedly lied to investors that Joonko had earned more than $1 million in revenue and was working with more than 100,000 active job candidates. When an investor grew suspicious of Raz&rsquo;s claims, Raz allegedly provided the investor with falsified bank statements and forged contracts in an effort to conceal the fraud. According to the complaint, the scheme unraveled in mid-2023 when the investor confronted Raz, who admitted to forging bank statements and contracts and lying about Joonko&rsquo;s revenue and number of customers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We allege that Raz engaged in an old school fraud using new school buzzwords like &lsquo;artificial intelligence&rsquo; and &lsquo;automation,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;As more and more people seek out AI-related investment opportunities, we will continue to police the markets against AI-washing and the type of misconduct alleged in today&rsquo;s complaint. But at the same time, it is critical for investors to beware of companies exploiting the fanfare around artificial intelligence to raise funds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charges Raz with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and seeks a permanent injunction, civil money penalties, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and an officer-and-director bar against Raz.</p>
<p>In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Raz.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Alicia Guo, Ariel Atlas, Neil Hendelman, and Lindsay S. Moilanen and was supervised by Sheldon L. Pollock of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Guo and Ms. Atlas, and supervised by Daniel Loss and Mr. Pollock. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Southern District of New York and the FBI.</p>

<title>Prepared Remarks Before The 30th International Institute On Securities Market Growth And Development, SEC Chair Gary Gensler, Washington D.C., June 10, 2024</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> SEC, capital markets, securities laws, agency, international dialogue <br />
Summary:<br />
SEC Chair welcomes Class of 2024 to International Institute. Discusses capital markets, securities laws, and SEC's role. Emphasizes international cooperation. <div>
<p>Thank you, YJ, for that kind introduction.</p>
<p>As is customary, I&rsquo;d like to note that my views are my own as Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and I am not speaking on behalf of my fellow Commissioners or the staff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to welcome you&mdash;the nearly 120 members of the &ldquo;Class of 2024&rdquo; attending the SEC&rsquo;s International Institute on Securities Market Growth and Development.</p>
<p>Traveling from approximately 70 different countries and territories, and spending the next week and a half here, is a big commitment on your part.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re investing in your own human capital, taking time out of your busy lives, and learning about our securities markets, U.S. securities laws, and the SEC.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re also investing in your nation&rsquo;s capital by learning about how to promote your capital markets to the best they can be.</p>
<p>This is the 30<span>th</span>&nbsp;International Institute. It&rsquo;s also the 90<span>th</span>&nbsp;anniversary of this agency&rsquo;s formation. One of the SEC&rsquo;s founding principles is what President Roosevelt called &ldquo;complete and truthful disclosure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the spirit of disclosure, I will share that the SEC has a direct interest in sharing our expertise and experience with each of you.</p>
<p>First, robust regulatory frameworks across the globe limits opportunities for fraudsters to harm U.S. investors when investing overseas. It also limits opportunities for regulatory arbitrage.</p>
<p>Second, meeting the highest standards for international cooperation will ensure that you have the legal authority and tools to assist us on regulatory, enforcement, and supervisory matters, when needed.</p>
<h2>History of the Institute</h2>
<p>This program has its roots in post-World War II. President Truman envisioned a coordinated U.S. effort to assist its allies around the world and help them develop their own market-based economies.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-iismgd-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Then, just months before the Berlin Wall collapsed in 1989, SEC Chair Richard Breeden created the Office of International Affairs.</p>
<p>He crafted a global strategy to assist other countries in developing their capital markets, which began this very program. It&rsquo;s a great example of how this agency has continually responded to the unique challenges of the times.</p>
<p>Let me now turn to say a bit about our capital markets, our securities laws, and who we are as an agency.</p>
<h2>Capital markets</h2>
<p>First, the U.S. has the deepest, most liquid capital markets in the world. At over $110 trillion, we&rsquo;re over 40 percent of the world&rsquo;s capital markets, though we&rsquo;re only roughly 24 percent of the world&rsquo;s economy.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-iismgd-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Second, the U.S. capital markets benefit from significant engagement from everyday investors. Over half of American households, representing more than 115 million individual investors, own registered funds.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-iismgd-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>About 58 percent of U.S. households own stocks, up from 52 percent in 2016.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-iismgd-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p>Third, the U.S. has long benefitted from robust competition between nonbanks and banks. In fact, each of the registered funds and private funds sectors surpasses the size of the banking sector. Further, U.S. debt capital markets facilitate 75 percent of debt financing of non-financial corporations. In Europe, the U.K., and Asia, only 12-29 percent is raised in capital markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-iismgd-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p>Today, registered investment advisers advise 57 million clients with respect to $129 trillion in assets. Roughly speaking, that breaks down to advising on more than $32 trillion in registered funds, $30 trillion in private funds, and nearly $50 trillion in separately managed accounts.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-iismgd-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p>Let me put this in context. The entire U.S. banking system is $23 trillion.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-iismgd-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;Thus, the capital markets are nearly five times the size of our banking sector. Each of these sectors, in and of themselves, are larger than our banking sector.</p>
<p>Fourth, we also have robust competition between both public and private markets. Our public markets have approximately 7,400 actively reporting issuers, of which more than 4,000 companies listed on U.S. exchanges.</p>
<p>With the privileges of dollar and capital markets dominance also comes real responsibilities and challenges. Given how integrated our capital markets are into the world&rsquo;s capital markets, events in our capital markets can flow into others&mdash;and, events in yours can flow into ours.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen this time and again. For instance, in the 2008 mortgage crisis, we exported instability to the rest of the world, which then had further reverberations back into the United States.</p>
<p>In terms of challenges, foremost of course is that nothing stands still. The economies, rule of law, and capital markets of other countries will continue to evolve and compete for leadership.</p>
<p>Technology and business models continue to change. Further, nation states, including the United States, can be prone to policy mistakes.</p>
<h2>Our securities laws</h2>
<p>Our securities laws play a crucial role behind our success. After the 1929 market crash, President Roosevelt signed the first of the federal securities laws in 1933. He followed a year later with the passage of the Securities Exchange Act&mdash;making June 6, 1934, our birthday at the SEC.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-iismgd-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p>Roosevelt went on to work with Congress to enact five more securities laws, ending with the Investment Company Act and Investment Advisers Act of 1940.</p>
<p>Taken together, they formed the foundation of our capital markets. These laws were about protecting the investing public by ensuring they had what Roosevelt called, &ldquo;complete and truthful disclosure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC was created to ensure that the markets worked free of fraud and manipulation&mdash;and that investment advisers carried their duties to the clients they advised.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our laws have been updated over the years in response to changes in technology, markets, business models, and, from time to time, inevitable turmoil in the markets.</p>
<p>At its core, the SEC has a three-part mission: protect investors; maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and facilitate capital formation.</p>
<h2>Who we are as an agency</h2>
<p>That brings me back to who we, the SEC, are as an agency and as a Commission.</p>
<p>Our responsibility is vast. We oversee approximately 40,000 entities&mdash;including more than 13,000 registered funds, more than 15,400 investment advisers, more than 3,400 broker-dealers, 24 national securities exchanges, 103 alternative trading systems, 10 credit rating agencies, 33 self-regulatory organizations, and six active registered clearing agencies, among other entities.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re led by a five-member Commission appointed by the President&mdash;which, by law, requires that no more than three Commissioners can be from his or her party.</p>
<p>The SEC has nearly 5,000 staff here in Washington and in regional offices across the nation. Many may think of us as the largest group of securities lawyers in the world, with over 2,000 lawyers at the agency&mdash;but we do a lot more. Our work is organized across 6 main divisions and 25 offices.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-iismgd-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<p>The Divisions of Enforcement and Examinations account for about half of the SEC&rsquo;s staff. Without examination of compliance with and enforcement of our rules and laws, we can&rsquo;t instill the trust necessary for our markets to thrive.</p>
<p>Last year, we filed 784 enforcement actions and conducted approximately 3,000 examinations.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-iismgd-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;Stamping out fraud, manipulation, and abuse lowers risk in the system. It protects investors and reduces the cost of capital. The whole economy benefits from that.</p>
<p>Think about a football match without referees. It would quickly break down&mdash;it would start to look like rugby, and get worse from there.</p>
<p>Next, we have three programmatic divisions.</p>
<p>The Division of Corporation Finance oversees the disclosures of public companies so that investors can make informed investment decisions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Division of Investment Management oversees the funds and advisers that steward nest eggs for millions of American investors.</p>
<p>The Division of Trading and Markets serves on the front line for maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets. Market monitoring and supervision are essential parts of the Division&rsquo;s activity&mdash;especially during times of market stress.</p>
<p>Intertwined in everything we do is the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, which supports the Commission in every role, whether it&rsquo;s enforcement or examinations, monitoring the markets, or rulemaking.</p>
<p>As I said, we also have 25 other offices that contribute to our mission every day.</p>
<h2>Closing</h2>
<p>Finance knows no geographical boundaries. With a tap of a smart phone, money and risk can move across the globe in less than a second.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what makes it so important to foster international dialogue and coordination regarding global capital markets.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also why, with appropriate safeguards around confidentiality, that we&rsquo;ve come to collaborate on information sharing around our examination and enforcement efforts.</p>
<p>In the coming days, you&rsquo;ll hear from SEC staff about securities regulation, including building strong disclosure, examination, and enforcement programs.</p>
<p>They also will share lessons learned on oversight, creating an effective secondary market for securities, capital formation, and international cooperation.</p>
<p>Finally, they will cover new and emerging issues in data analytics, fintech, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that you all play an important role in our international capital markets. You were hand-selected by your agencies to represent your nations.</p>
<p>I encourage you to invest in the human capital in this room. Look around&mdash;there are likely future finance ministers and world leaders amongst you. Some of the alumni of this Institute have gone on to become Chairs of securities regulators and Ministers of Finance. Some have taken on leadership roles at the highest levels of their governments.</p>
<p>Finally, beyond all the technical skills and networking you take home with you, I hope you also remember the words of President Roosevelt&rsquo;s advisor, Felix Frankfurter, who would go on to be an Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p>90 years ago, when Roosevelt was first setting up the SEC, Frankfurter wrote: &ldquo;You need administrators who have stamina and do not weary of the fight, who are moved neither by blandishments nor fears, who in a word, unite public zeal with unusual capacity.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-iismgd-061124?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></p>
<p>I hope we can all answer Frankfurter&rsquo;s call. Thank you.</p>

<title>Cboe Announces Expanded Collaboration With FTSE Russell To Drive Innovation In Digital Asset Derivatives</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> collaboration, derivatives, digital assets, FTSE Russell, Cboe
<br />
Cboe and FTSE Russell are collaborating to develop new derivatives products for digital assets, beginning with options tied to the FTSE Bitcoin and Ethereum indices. They aim to provide trusted, transparent, and regulated trading options in response to growing investor demand for crypto exposure. Cboe is expanding its digital assets business, consolidating its US futures products onto one exchange and introducing new products to complement existing initiatives. The planned cash-settled index options on the FTSE Bitcoin and Ethereum indices will provide a more comprehensive product suite and foster greater liquidity and hedging opportunities in the digital asset markets. 
Summary: <div>
<p>Cboe Global Markets, Inc. (Cboe: CBOE), the world's leading derivatives and securities exchange network, today announced it is expanding its collaboration with FTSE Russell, a leading global index provider, to drive product innovation in the digital assets space. This new initiative builds on Cboe and FTSE Russell's longstanding relationship and will leverage their combined expertise to develop new derivatives products, potentially beginning with cash-settled index options tied to the FTSE&nbsp;<span>Bitcoin</span>&nbsp;Index and the FTSE&nbsp;<span>Ethereum</span>&nbsp;Index.</p>
<div class="dombanner"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The collaboration underscores the companies' shared commitment to growing the digital assets space and expanding investor access to the asset class. Cboe's plans to list cash-settled index options on FTSE's indices, subject to regulatory approvals, would help meet growing investor demand for exchange-traded derivatives to gain and manage&nbsp;<span>crypto</span>&nbsp;exposures in a trusted, transparent and U.S.-regulated trading environment.</p>
<p>"For many years, Cboe and FTSE Russell have worked together to offer index options based on FTSE Russell indices, which have grown into some of the world's most actively traded products," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Catherine Clay</span>, Global Head of Derivatives at Cboe. "Our expanded relationship today mirrors that successful model of collaboration, combining Cboe's unrivalled derivatives expertise with FTSE's world-class indexing capabilities to potentially bring new solutions to the digital assets space. Derivatives has long been an area where Cboe excels, and now we are strategically expanding our expertise into the digital assets space. As these two asset classes converge, we look forward to driving continued innovation and our relationship with FTSE Russell will be key to this strategy."</p>
<p>The FTSE&nbsp;<span>Bitcoin</span>&nbsp;Index and FTSE&nbsp;<span>Ethereum</span>&nbsp;Index are part of the FTSE Digital Asset Indices Series, which is developed in partnership with Digital Asset Research (DAR). These indices are designed to capture the performance of&nbsp;<span>bitcoin</span>&nbsp;and ether, as determined by the FTSE DAR Reference Price, and provide institutional-quality, liquidity-screened exposure to the digital asset market.</p>
<p>Talking about the expanded collaboration,&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Fiona Bassett</span>, CEO of FTSE Russell, said: "We are delighted to continue working alongside Cboe Global Markets, realizing our mutual commitment to enable new asset innovation in financial markets. Our indices are used by some of the largest&nbsp;<span>crypto</span>&nbsp;asset managers in the world for their best-in-class data and processes built to manage regulatory and trading risk &ndash; critical differentiators for the data in this asset class."</p>
<p><b>Cboe's Broader Digital Assets Franchise</b></p>
<p>Cboe's expanded collaboration with FTSE Russell follows the recent realignment of its digital assets business &ndash; a move that will consolidate all Cboe U.S. futures products, including digital asset futures, onto one exchange, subject to regulatory review, powered by Cboe's broader global derivatives franchise and technology platform.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the collaboration is expected to introduce new products that will complement Cboe's existing digital assets initiatives. These currently include the listing and trading of cash-settled&nbsp;<span>bitcoin</span>&nbsp;and ether margin futures, along with spot&nbsp;<span>bitcoin</span>&nbsp;ETFs, where Cboe BZX Equities Exchange lists six out of the 11 ETFs listed domestically. Additionally, Cboe submitted five of the eight recently SEC-approved rule filings to list ETFs tied to the price of ether.</p>
<p>"Our plans to develop&nbsp;<span>bitcoin</span>&nbsp;and ether index options come at an exciting time as more investors of all types enter the&nbsp;<span>crypto</span>&nbsp;markets and are increasingly seeking exchange-listed derivatives to manage their&nbsp;<span>crypto</span>&nbsp;exposures," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Rob Hocking</span>, Head of Product Innovation at Cboe. "Many of our customers are already trading Cboe-listed digital asset products, whether margin futures or ETFs, tied to&nbsp;<span>bitcoin</span>&nbsp;and ether. The launch of cash-settled index options will be additive &ndash; resulting in a more comprehensive product suite and helping to foster greater liquidity and hedging opportunities in these markets. We believe that derivatives will drive the next phase of the digital asset market's maturation, and we're excited about the potential benefits that cash-settled index options can bring to the space."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cboe intends to share more details about its plans for cash-settled index options on the FTSE&nbsp;<span>Bitcoin</span>&nbsp;Index and the FTSE&nbsp;<span>Ethereum</span>&nbsp;Index potentially later this year.</p>

<title>DTCC And Cboe Clear Europe To Introduce New Clearing Workflow For OTC Cash Equities Trades And Deliver Enhanced Efficiencies To The Industry</title>

<div> DTCC, Cboe Clear Europe, post-trade workflow, OTC cash equities, settlement efficiencies
Summary:
DTCC and Cboe Clear Europe collaborate to enhance post-trade workflow for OTC cash equities, increasing settlement efficiencies and reducing risks. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>DTCC, the premier post-trade market infrastructure for the global financial services industry, today announced it is working with Cboe Clear Europe to deliver an enhanced post-trade workflow for over-the-counter (OTC) cash equities trades to help increase settlement efficiencies across UK and European markets.</p>
<p>DTCC, the leading post-trade market infrastructure, will collaborate with Cboe Clear Europe, the largest and most-connected pan-European cash equities CCP, to increase post-trade efficiencies while providing clients with the benefits of an established risk management counterparty. The service will bring OTC cash equities trades into Cboe Clear Europe&rsquo;s cleared environment, which can then be netted against on-exchange transactions for settlement purposes, delivering potentially significant efficiencies.</p>
<p>As part of this initiative, DTCC and Cboe Clear Europe will develop a proof of concept that links DTCC CTM's tri-party trade matching workflow with Cboe Clear Europe. This connection will allow Prime Brokers to receive a golden copy of transaction details when a match is achieved between a Hedge Fund and Executing Broker via DTCC&rsquo;s CTM service. Once the Prime Broker enters into this tri-party match, CTM automatically sends those matched trades to the CCP, providing netting and clearing benefits to mutual clients.</p>
<p>The new workflow will help reduce operational and settlement risk, as well as post-trade friction as additional markets consider and prepare for accelerated settlement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are pleased to be working with Cboe Clear Europe on this important initiative to bring greater post-trade efficiencies to the industry as the global markets look to accelerate to a T+1 settlement cycle. Cboe Clear Europe&rsquo;s extensive venue coverage combined with CTM&rsquo;s large client base will deliver increased operational efficiency and netting opportunities across European trading venues,&rdquo; said Val Wotton, Managing Director and General Manager, DTCC Institutional Trade Processing. &ldquo;DTCC remains committed to bringing greater post-trade automation to increase efficiencies for global financial markets as they work toward implementing accelerated settlement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are excited to be the first CCP to connect to DTCC&rsquo;s CTM tri-party matching workflow,&rdquo; said Vikesh Patel, President, Cboe Clear Europe. &ldquo;This joint solution enables us to bring greater efficiencies to our clients, helping to optimise their current post-trade workflows and operational processes as the global financial markets look to accelerate settlement cycles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The benefits of this initiative include reductions in post-trade processing time, risks associated with OTC transactions and settlement costs between Executing Brokers and Prime Brokers. It is anticipated that the joint solution will also help facilitate a reduction of capital requirements when moving from OTC to CCP settlement as well as lower trade fails and defaults.</p>
<p>CTM is DTCC Institutional Trade Processing&rsquo;s (ITP&rsquo;s) central matching service for cross-border and domestic transactions across multiple asset classes, including OTC and on exchange cash equity transactions. Today, there are 6,000+ clients in more than 80 countries using CTM to streamline workflows.</p>
<p>Cboe Clear Europe is a pan-European Central Counterparty, the most connected CCP in Europe - offering clearing services to 46 trading venues. Cboe Clear Europe is approved to clear cash equities, depositary receipts, ETFs and equity derivatives (index futures and options and equity options) contracts.</p>
<p>The first effort in this initiative to link DTCC&rsquo;s CTM to Cboe Clear Europe&rsquo;s CCP is, subject to the satisfactory completion of regulatory procedures, projected to go live in Q2 2025.</p>

<title>The IFRS Foundation Monitoring Board Welcomes The Progress Of Standard-Setting Activities And Underscores The Importance Of The Oversight By The IFRS Foundation Trustees</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Trustees, IFRS Foundation, Monitoring Board, IASB, ISSB <br />
Summary: The IFRS Foundation Monitoring Board discussed sustainability standards, oversight of IASB and ISSB, and the development of new accounting standards. Effective governance and funding were also emphasized. <br /> <div>
<p>During last week&rsquo;s meeting of the IFRS Foundation Monitoring Board in Singapore, the Monitoring Board discussed the activities of the Trustees of the IFRS Foundation, including their oversight responsibilities in respect of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB). The meeting was joined by the members of the Trustees of the IFRS Foundation under the leadership of Erkki Liikanen, Chair of the Trustees, as well as Andreas Barckow, Chair of the IASB, and Emmanuel Faber, Chair of the ISSB.</p>
<p>Among other activities, the Monitoring Board welcomed the finalization of the&nbsp;<em>Inaugural Jurisdictional Guide for the adoption or other use of ISSB Standards</em>&nbsp;in May 2024. The Monitoring Board members shared their views on different ways to adopt, apply or make use of sustainability-related disclosures. They also acknowledged the usefulness of consistency, comparability and interoperability of sustainability-related information for the benefit of investors and the ISSB&rsquo;s capacity-building efforts as jurisdictions consider incorporation of climate-related and other disclosures in their corporate reporting regimes. In this context, effective functioning of a multi-location model<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;would be essential for close engagement with stakeholders in various regions in the ISSB&rsquo;s effort to promote the implementation of IFRS S1 and S2 around the globe.</p>
<p>The Monitoring Board noted the importance of rigorous due process in the development of high-quality IFRS Accounting Standards and the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards and that the Monitoring Board will continue to collaborate with the Trustees to ensure both sets of Standards are developed under robust governance, due process and oversight while ensuring independence in their individual standard setting activities. In this context, the Monitoring Board took particular note of the finalization of the two new IFRS Accounting Standards, IFRS 18&nbsp;<em>Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements</em>&nbsp;and IFRS 19&nbsp;<em>Subsidiaries without Public Accountability: Disclosures</em>&nbsp;by the IASB and the recent decision by the ISSB to commence research projects related to biodiversity, ecosystems and ecosystem services as well as human capital.</p>
<p>As for the broad strategies of the IFRS Foundation, the Monitoring Board reaffirmed that stable and diversified funding should be achieved in a transparent manner in support of both Standard Setting Boards&rsquo; activities. The Monitoring Board also noted the importance of connectivity between the two Boards under the &ldquo;Two Boards under One Foundation&rdquo; model.</p>
<p>Takashi Nagaoka, Chairman of the IFRS Monitoring Board and Deputy Commissioner for International Affairs of Japan Financial Services Agency said:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I am pleased to co-host a discussion between the IFRS Foundation Trustees and the Monitoring Board members at an important juncture where the ISSB finalized its &ldquo;Inaugural Jurisdictional Guide for the adoption or other use of ISSB Standards,&rdquo; providing much-awaited support to jurisdictional approaches, and the IASB released two new accounting standards, IFRS 18 and 19, which is the first such output of new accounting standards in over six years. The IFRS Foundation Trustees and the Monitoring Board members are aligned in support of good governance of the Foundation to promote sustainability-related disclosures and continuing development of high-quality financial reporting standards to serve the capital markets globally.&rdquo;</em></p>

<title>World Federation Of Exchanges: Demystifying Tokenisation: Dispelling Myths, Explaining The Muted Traction, And Setting Out The Starting Point For Regulation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Tokenisation, traditional assets, benefits, limitations, regulatory certainty
<br />
Tokenisation is a modern version of traditional finance with benefits such as fractional ownership and enhanced liquidity, but it has limitations and regulatory uncertainty.
<br /><br />Summary: 
Tokenisation offers new opportunities but faces limitations in technology, infrastructure, costs, and regulatory uncertainty. <div>
<p>As the European Commission today gathers stakeholders in Brussels to discuss the further tokenisation of assets, the WFE (the global industry association for exchanges and clearing houses) has published a paper, &ldquo;Demystifying Tokenisation: Embracing the Future&rdquo;, that provides a reality check: we shouldn&rsquo;t curtail the further development of tokenisation, nor should we run blindly towards it.<br /><br />Rather than a radical departure from the norm, tokenised traditional assets should be viewed as nothing more than a modernised and innovative iteration of traditional finance, providing new opportunities for investors and market participants. This is one of the many ways in which exchanges continue to invest serious effort and money in innovation.<br /><br />Tokenisation has many benefits that could make it a natural next step for financial markets. Fractional ownership, allowing multiple investors to own a share of an asset thereby lowering the capital requirement for individuals to invest in high-value assets; enhanced liquidity, which arises from fractionalisation enabling access to investments that may have been out of reach for many; and enhanced trust could all lead to greater financial inclusion, diversification and ultimately economic growth.&nbsp;<br /><br />Some of the supposed benefits are overexaggerated or frankly don&rsquo;t exist at all. Continuous 24/7 trading &ndash; if truly needed &ndash; can be achieved without tokenisation. Disintermediated models face conflicts of interest and instantaneous settlement in tokenised trading may have unpredictable timing, affecting market liquidity and trading costs, especially if assets and funding need to be blocked prior to execution.<br /><br />With over 15 years passed since the Bitcoin white paper, tokenisation has not &ldquo;taken off&rdquo; in traditional markets and there are several reasons why:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DLT has limitations</strong>, particularly in high transaction environments, as the technology is currently not fast enough to execute and settle all the trades running through a highly active exchange in any given moment. There are also other limitations such as storage problems caused by the distributed ledger.</li>
<li>The nature of different DLT creations means that there is a&nbsp;<strong>fragmented infrastructure&nbsp;</strong>with tokenised assets managed on different blockchains which are not interoperable. Financial institutions would have to build connections with each platform, leading to significant operational costs and challenges, meaning there are only marginal efficiency gains in certain markets, particularly those that are already liquid.</li>
<li>There are&nbsp;<strong>significant sunk costs</strong>&nbsp;involved in implementing DLT. It is a capital-intensive investment to move to the new technology and build the relevant infrastructure. These costs would be felt across the market, from infrastructure providers to market participants and end users. Even then, there may not be sufficient demand if customers do not have the correct infrastructure or capital to invest.</li>
<li>The lack of&nbsp;<strong>regulatory certainty</strong>, which is improving thanks to the efforts of regulators and industry, persists. Most jurisdictions&rsquo; bodies of law do not reflect the creation of tokenised assets, leaving firms apprehensive. Anything that is, in effect, a financial instrument, should be treated in the same way, regardless of whether it is tokenised.</li>
<li>The lack of adoption further inhibits tokenisation because, without widespread use, there are&nbsp;<strong>no network effects</strong>&nbsp;and there is little value to firms and exchanges to update their technology stacks to incorporate tokenised assets.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tokenisation should be seen as a creative and modern version of traditional finance that offers new possibilities to investors and market players. However, current limitations mean that it won&rsquo;t be right for every type of asset.<br /><br /><strong>James Auliffe, Manager, Regulatory Affairs at the WFE commented,</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;The fundamentals of tokenisation and the infrastructures these assets trade on need to be better understood. Regulation in this area should reflect that tokenisation is a natural evolution in the financial industry, rather than a drastic break from the norm. Its usage is suitable in particular environments and for particular assets, but in these cases, market participants can reap great benefits.&rdquo;<br /><br />The full paper can be read&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://world-exchanges.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=48ddcbc11eb58f141a51219ea&amp;id=10c6fc2baf&amp;e=979576350c" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<div> Eurobank Cyprus, Temenos, IT refresh, digital banking systems, agile platform <br />
Summary: Eurobank Cyprus completes a full IT refresh with Temenos, enhancing customer services and competitive position, achieving an agile, future-ready banking platform. Awards for sustainability and digital solutions acknowledge effective use of technology. <div>
<p>Temenos (SIX: TEMN) today announces that Eurobank Cyprus, the country&rsquo;s third largest bank with&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.eurobank.com.cy/Eurobank/media/docs/EurobankCY_Financial-Results-2023_FY_ENG.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">deposits exceeding &euro;7bn</a>, has gone live on Temenos, completing a full IT refresh of its core and digital banking systems. The move further strengthens the bank&rsquo;s customer services and competitive position as the primary bank of choice across affluent, international, corporate and wealth management segments.</p>
<p>The successful transformation program gives Eurobank Cyprus an agile, future-ready banking platform and forms a group wide IT blueprint for other subsidiaries in Eurobank Group. It involved replacing 85% of the bank&rsquo;s IT landscape and included Temenos Core and Digital (formerly Infinity) together with Wealth Management, Financial Crime Mitigation (FCM), Analytics and Payments.</p>
<p>Through this program, Eurobank Cyprus modernized completely its front-to-back operations, centralizing operations such as payments and wealth management back office and moving several transactional activities to digital channels for client self-service. The scope of the change impacts the entire bank&rsquo;s customer base, including individual and business customers served by its Corporate, Affluent, International and Private Banking divisions.</p>
<p><b>Michalis Louis, Chief Executive Officer, Eurobank Cyprus, commented:</b>&nbsp;&ldquo;The go-live with Temenos is a major milestone that allows us to transform the bank at a high level. This was a complex and challenging project, but it was expertly delivered by our internal teams and Temenos working closely together. The new Temenos platform gives us business&nbsp;agility&nbsp;to achieve our goals and opens the roadmap for further expansion, enhancements and growing the Bank&rsquo;s position as a market leader through the latest technology. We look forward to building on this success for customers in Cyprus and across the Eurobank Group&rdquo;.</p>
<p><b>Mark Yamin-Ali, Managing Director - Europe, Temenos, said:</b>&nbsp;&ldquo;I wish to congratulate Eurobank Cyprus for its vision and execution in transforming the bank for the modern digital age. Eurobank has always been a pioneer, and the move to Temenos including a full breadth of banking capabilities from digital and core banking to payments on an agile, open platform will enable the bank to continue to drive innovation, deliver an outstanding customer experience across all segments and grow sustainably. Temenos has enjoyed a long and successful partnership with Eurobank Group, and we are delighted to support the bank and its future success in Cyprus.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Eurobank Cyprus is now well positioned to advance its long-term business strategy of expanding its banking services in addition to ESG compliant banking and advancing sustainability through paperless and efficient banking operations. The Bank has also recently received four prestigious awards by Euromoney Magazine for Best International Private Bank in Cyprus as well as Best for Digital Solutions, Best for Sustainability and Best for High-Net-Worth Clients. These awards are a testament to the Bank&rsquo;s effective use of technology.</p>
<p>Focused on innovation and sustainability, Eurobank Group designs and implements initiatives using cutting-edge technology and following ESG rules.</p>

<div> monitoring, regional banks, securities investment, risk management, financial institutions
Summary: The FSA monitors regional banks' securities investment, targeting high-risk banks. It seeks to improve risk management and governance in financial institutions. <div>
<p class="indent mb0">The Financial Services Agency (FSA), from the perspective of maintaining the stability of the financial system in Japan, conducts intensive monitoring of regional banks' securities investment, targeting those with large risk-taking in securities investment.</p>
<p class="indent mt0">The report summarizes key points and observed cases during the monitoring process.</p>
<p class="indent">It is intended not only for the targeted financial institutions but also as a reference for risk management by other financial institutions (primarily those institutions with substantial risk exposure to securities investment).</p>
<p class="indent">The FSA will continue to encourage financial institutions&rsquo; enhancement of their securities investment management and risk management systems and demonstration of effective risk governance through monitoring focused on such issues in the future. We expect financial institutions to put effort into further improving their risk management practices.</p>

<div> Feedback, Derivative Issuer Licences, Leverage, Suitability, Monitoring

Summary:
The FMA seeks feedback on potential changes to Derivative Issuer licences, particularly regarding leverage and investor suitability. Changes aim to align with international norms.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW191560321 BCX8">The Financial Markets Authority (FMA) &ndash; Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko &ndash; is seeking feedback on potential changes to the standard conditions imposed on Derivative Issuer (DI) licences. The changes relate to leverage and the suitability of investors for derivative trading. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW191560321 BCX8">The proposed changes have been identified in the FMA&rsquo;s 2020 Derivatives Issuer Sector Risk Assessment (SRA) and subsequent monitoring of the sector. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Proposed leverage standard condition</span></p>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW191560321 BCX8">Investing with leverage amplifies the risk by enabling an investor to have much greater exposure to an increase and decrease in value. Currently, there is no limit to the amount of leverage a licensed DI can offer to retail investors in New Zealand. For example, while some licensed DIs limit contracts for difference (CFDs) leverage to 30:1, others offer up to 500:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW191560321 BCX8">The higher the level of leverage, the greater the financial impact felt from price volatility. For example, if a trade is leveraged 10:1, an investor with $1,000 in their account can control a position in an underlying asset valued at $10,000. When a position is leveraged 500:1, that same investor with $1,000 can control a $500,000 position. Leverage can enable efficient asset allocation, but highly leveraged derivatives mean retail investors may experience much higher losses. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="TextRun SCXW191560321 BCX8">The proposed standard condition is similar to those in the UK, Europe and Australia and varies depending on the underlying asset class of the derivative. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span class="TextRun SCXW191560321 BCX8">The SRA and subsequent monitoring indicated some licensed DIs were not always taking sufficient steps to determine suitability for the investor.

<div> Securities and Exchange Commission, 90th anniversary, Securities Exchange Act of 1934, market trust, economic welfare
Summary:
SEC celebrates 90th anniversary, highlighting the importance of Securities Exchange Act of 1934, market trust, and economic welfare for everyday Americans. <div>
<p>Good afternoon. As is customary, I&rsquo;d like to note that my views are my own as Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and I am not speaking on behalf of my fellow Chairs or the staff.</p>
<p>I want to welcome the public and thank you for tuning in as we celebrate the 90<span>th</span>&nbsp;anniversary of a milestone in American history.</p>
<p>In the depths of the Great Depression, President Roosevelt worked with Congress to enact the Securities Exchange Act of 1934&mdash;creating the SEC and making June 6 our official birthday.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-90thsec-060624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>It's just one of a handful of the original securities laws. But taken together, those laws and this agency put our markets on a path in which investors and issuers alike can have trust in the markets.</p>
<p>These time-tested laws have played an important part in boosting the economic welfare of everyday Americans.</p>
<p>For anyone who doubts the significance of these laws and regulations, think about the schemes and frauds throughout the 1920s that contributed to the Great Depression.</p>
<p>For the sports fans, imagine what would happen to teams, athletes, and fans without fair competition.</p>
<p>The SEC remains a steward of trust, efficiency, and competition within our markets. While the U.S. is roughly 24 percent of the world&rsquo;s economy, it represents over 40 percent of the world&rsquo;s capital markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-90thsec-060624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s part of why the U.S. dollar is the world&rsquo;s leading currency.</p>
<p>I want to close with two letters FDR received before he signed our founding document.</p>
<p>On April 12, 1934, Richard Whitney, then-President of the New York Stock Exchange, wrote to Roosevelt that he was &ldquo;sincerely disturbed as to what may happen if unsound legislation is enacted.&rdquo; He went on to write about Sam Rayburn&rsquo;s modified bill, saying, &ldquo;I am confident that its enactment would be a disaster.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-90thsec-060624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>A few months later, FDR received a letter from Felix Frankfurter, his adviser who later would become a Supreme Court justice. Frankfurter wrote regarding the &ldquo;effective administration&rdquo; the SEC would need to succeed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need administrators,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;who have stamina and do not weary of the fight, who are moved neither by blandishments nor fears, who in a word, unite public zeal with unusual capacity.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-90thsec-060624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p>90 years later, thousands of SEC staff and over 100 Commissioners and Chairs have answered Frankfurter&rsquo;s call. I thank them for their service. I thank them for their rectitude. Contrary to Whitney&rsquo;s belief, the SEC has made it work for investors, issuers, and the over $110 trillion markets we oversee today.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

- Highlighting importance of GMAC's work <div>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Good morning. It&rsquo;s great to convene another Global Markets Advisory Committee (GMAC) meeting in New York. I want to start by thanking everyone for taking the time to travel here&mdash;from all across the United States, and as far away as London, Frankfurt, Tokyo and more&mdash;to share your expertise with the GMAC. I know that a lot of time and work goes into preparing for these meetings, so I also want to thank the GMAC members and Subcommittee members for their service, and our presenters for joining us today. The GMAC&rsquo;s recommendations have real impact and add value to not only the Commission, but also to the international policy dialogue. I especially want to recognize the GMAC&rsquo;s leadership team for your continued stewardship of the GMAC, and all the Subcommittee workstream leads for their tireless efforts. We have a truly impressive group of leaders to examine the issues.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Of course, I want to acknowledge and thank my team: Harry Jung, the GMAC Designated Federal Officer, and Nicholas Elliot, the GMAC Alternate Designated Federal Officer, as well as Meghan Tente and Taylor Foy. And, as always, many thanks to all the CFTC staff in both the New York office and our DC headquarters who made the GMAC&rsquo;s meeting today possible.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>I will provide a brief update on the status of each of the GMAC&rsquo;s 11 recommendations to date and potential next steps. I will also recognize the new members of the GMAC and its Subcommittees, and then provide an overview of today&rsquo;s agenda and speakers.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The GMAC Continues to Deliver</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The GMAC continues to support the growth of liquid and efficient markets and make great progress developing thoughtful recommendations and insightful work product to aid the CFTC, both U.S. and non-U.S. authorities, and indeed, all stakeholders in global markets and financial services.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The GMAC was first created in 1998 to handle the issues associated with globalization and access to markets. These issues remain critically important given the interconnected market environment, everchanging geopolitical dynamics, and emerging and innovative products and tools. Accordingly, global collaboration and coordination amongst authorities is critical to promoting regulatory cohesion and financial stability, and mitigating market fragmentation and systemic risk. That is why the GMAC&rsquo;s mandate includes assessing and informing international standards.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Since it was relaunched, the GMAC has worked to ensure that global markets are well-functioning, promote market integrity and resilience, facilitate compliance, and foster innovation and growth. As the GMAC&rsquo;s sponsor, I&rsquo;m honored to help provide a public venue for preeminent industry experts and regulators to discuss and develop pragmatic solutions to global challenges. I hope we have built a union of minds brought together for a common purpose.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Status of GMAC Recommendations and Next Steps</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>First, I want to commend the GMAC for kicking off last year with a comprehensive stock-take of the most significant current and emerging issues in global markets and the financial system. This global stock-take informed the development of the GMAC&rsquo;s work program and included input from policymakers, dealers, asset managers, liquidity providers, exchanges, trading facilities, clearinghouses, technology service providers, and end users.&nbsp;</span>I particularly note that the GMAC&rsquo;s work is based on data and observations from the markets that will support better policy outcomes.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>In less than a year, the GMAC has adopted 11 recommendations to date on a variety of issues, including U.S. Treasury market liquidity, well-functioning repo and funding markets, exchange volatility controls, T+1 securities settlement, improved collateral management, central counterparty (CCP) default simulation, streamlining trade reporting data to monitor systemic risk, and a foundational digital asset taxonomy to facilitate alignment in regulation across jurisdictions.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>These recommendations have provided data-driven and transparent resources for the CFTC and our counterparts around the world. Just last week, I was honored to present the GMAC&rsquo;s recommendations at the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) 49<span>th</span>&nbsp;Annual Meeting, and I note Chairman Behnam serves as IOSCO Vice Chair. The CFTC has long been a leader in various international fora. The degree of interest in the GMAC&rsquo;s work speaks for itself.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><i><span><span>Global Market Structure Subcommittee (GMSS)</span></span></i></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/9606/GMAC_NewBlockCap110623/download"><i>GMSS Recommendation 1 &ndash; New Block and Cap Sizes</i></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>Appropriately calibrated block and cap sizes are vital to the proper functioning of derivatives markets, including price discovery and transparency. However, the CFTC&rsquo;s new post</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>‐</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>initial block and cap sizes that will require compliance starting July 1, 2024, may negatively affect market liquidity and could significantly raise trading and hedging costs for buy</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>‐</span></span></i><i><span><span>side market participants and end users such as pension and other retirement plans.</span></span></i></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The GMAC recommends extending the compliance date for the post</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>‐</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>initial block and cap sizes for all asset classes to at least December 4, 2024. The GMAC further recommends that, during the extension period, the Commission engages with market participants in discussions and analysis to ensure the post</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>‐</span></span></i><i><span><span>initial block and cap sizes are appropriately tailored, including with respect to current market and macroeconomic conditions.</span></span></i></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The CFTC recently issued a letter that will allow for further study including implications of decreased liquidity and access to markets. I believe that the GMAC&rsquo;s presentations and recommendations were key, especially the market data and observations. I appreciate the support of Commissioner Mersinger, and Chairman Behnam&rsquo;s pragmatic approach and consideration of this issue.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/9731/gmac_Rule1_25d2_110623/download"><i>GMSS Recommendation 2 &ndash; Proposal to Add CCPs as Permitted Counterparties</i></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>Further alignment of SEC and CFTC regulations would support critical risk management functions that will promote well-functioning repo and funding markets. While CFTC rules impose customer protection requirements and permit a futures commission merchant (FCM) or derivatives clearing organization (DCO) to utilize repos to manage customer funds, an SEC-registered clearing agency is not a permitted counterparty under Rule 1.25(d)(2).</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The GMAC recommends that the Commission allow a CCP that meets the definition of a &ldquo;covered clearing agency&rdquo; under SEC Rule 17-Ad-22(a)(5) to be designated a &ldquo;permitted counterparty&rdquo; pursuant to CFTC Rule 1.25(d)(2).</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>I&rsquo;m pleased to note that I have discussed this recommendation with Chairman Behnam, and it will be considered for CFTC rulemaking given that this recommendation will facilitate implementation of the SEC&rsquo;s Treasury clearing mandate.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/9591/gmac_FICC_CME110623/download"><i>GMSS Recommendation 3 &ndash; FICC-CME Customer Position Cross-Margining Structure</i></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>For two decades, the CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have approved cross-margining for Treasury securities transactions and Treasury futures, promoting the efficiency and well-functioning of the U.S. Treasury markets&mdash;the backbone of the global financial system.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The GMAC recommends the Commission make the benefits of cross-margining available to a broader range of sophisticated customers, including those customers that will be subject to the new SEC Treasury clearing requirements, as well as to all customers that voluntarily elect to clear Treasury transactions and will post margin.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>This GMAC recommendation is being actively considered as part of the implementation of the SEC&rsquo;s Treasury clearing mandate. I thank FICC and CME&rsquo;s leadership on this issue. Both are members of the GMAC&rsquo;s Global Market Structure Subcommittee and led this work.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/9736/gmac_FIAExecutiveSummary110623/download"><i>GMSS Recommendation 4 &ndash; Endorsement of Futures Industry Association (FIA) Volatility Controls Mechanism Paper</i></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The efficient management of financial market volatility is paramount. During recent crises in markets, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as in commodity markets, the Futures Industry Association (FIA) has noted the pivotal role volatility control mechanisms have played in preserving market integrity. Consequently, FIA engaged with global derivatives exchanges and market participants to explore the most effective ways to mitigate disruptions while ensuring transparent price discovery.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The GMAC recommends the Commission use the best practices as a tool for understanding exchange market risk controls and when engaging with global regulators and international standard setters.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>This GMAC recommendation has been a beneficial resource to ensuring market integrity during periods of high market volatility, market stress, or other disruptions through effective application of exchange market risk controls and other volatility control mechanisms and sharing best practices across jurisdictions.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/10331/CFTC_GMAC_GM_Structure_Subcommittee_Recommendation-UST_ETF_as_UMR_Collateral/download"><i>GMSS Recommendation 5 - Inclusion of U.S. Treasury ETFs as Eligible Initial Margin Collateral</i></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The use of exchange traded funds (ETFs) that invest in U.S. Treasury bonds has dramatically increased in recent years. While standalone U.S. Treasury bonds can be used as initial margin (IM) collateral for uncleared swaps, ETFs that invest in them are not similarly eligible as collateral, despite being more diversified which can mitigate idiosyncratic risk.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>During many historic volatile trading sessions, certain UST ETFs have acted globally as &ldquo;shock absorbers,&rdquo; providing real-time prices and liquidity. Most notably, during the bond market volatility in 2020, volatility increased in U.S. Treasury bonds as dealers&rsquo; balance sheets were constrained. During this time, many UST ETFs traded at tighter bid-ask spreads than their portfolio of underlying bonds. For example, dislocations in U.S. Treasuries caused the bid/ask spreads of &ldquo;off-the-run&rdquo; bonds with a maturity of 20+ years to widen to almost 20 times that of the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT).</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The inclusion of U.S. Treasury ETFs as eligible IM collateral under the CFTC Margin Rules for Covered Swap Entities would enhance the robustness and resilience of the collateral pipeline. This enhancement, driven by factors such as diversification, liquidity, efficiency, and market stability, could prove beneficial for end-users seeking a wider range of eligible IM, CSEs and the broader financial markets. Allowing UST ETFs as IM collateral could not only help safeguard CSEs from counterparty default, but also help reduce the overall risk in the financial system and limit the potential for contagion arising from uncleared swaps.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The GMAC recommends the CFTC expand the universe of liquid assets that can be posted as uncleared margin, specifically to include U.S. Treasury ETFs.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The CFTC has been considering various aspects of margin and eligible collateral requirements. This GMAC recommendation and associated market data and observations are timely given recent developments in Treasury markets, and have contributed to an informed analysis of appropriate collateral management practices.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><i><span><span>Technical Issues Subcommittee (TIS)</span></span></i></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/9576/gmac_TechnicalSubcommitteeRecommendationsDefault110623/download"><i>TISS Recommendation 1 - Global Default Simulation</i></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>In November 2023, CCP Global conducted a global default simulation across CCPs. Global regulator support of the exercise was critical to its success. The default simulation was arranged in consultation and with input from regulators. It is critical the CFTC continue its support and valuable input, alongside its role in convening regulators and market participants.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The GMAC recommends the CFTC consider inclusion of lessons learned and best practices arising from such simulations into its capacity building programs with, especially, some emerging market regulatory homologues.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The CFTC, through the work of the Office of International Affairs, actively provides technical assistance to many other jurisdictions in the development of effective derivatives markets. CCP resilience, recovery, and resolution has been a top financial stability priority, and the GMAC recommendation has supported ongoing efforts to identify and mitigate systemic risk.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/9721/gmac_TechnicalSubcommitteeRecommendationsMMF110623/download"><i>TIS Recommendation 2 &ndash; MMFs as Eligible Collateral</i></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The CFTC&rsquo;s proposed rule amendment to remove the asset transfer restriction from money market funds (MMFs) used as eligible collateral for non</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>‐</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>cleared margin will harmonize the parameters for MMF use with the UK and resolve one of the impediments to the use of MMFs between the U.S. and European Union (EU). The proposed rule will also allow the CFTC to self</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>‐</span></span></i><i><span><span>align MMFs with its eligible collateral requirements for cleared margin, per CFTC Rule 1.25, which governs the investment of customer money by FCMs without similar asset transfer restrictions.</span></span></i></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The GMAC recommends the Commission: (i) finalize the proposed rule amendment; (ii) encourage the U.S. Prudential Regulators to adopt a corresponding amendment to their non</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>‐</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>cleared margin rules, including allowing third country funds; and (iii) encourage European Union (EU) policy makers to remove the third country fund restriction for eligible collateral from their non</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>‐</span></span></i><i><span><span>cleared margin rules.</span></span></i></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The CFTC currently has a pending rulemaking proposal on MMFs as eligible collateral for non-cleared margin. The GMAC recommendation has provided a key perspective on cross-border harmonization of MMF treatment.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/9726/gmac_TIS_P42P45Streamlining110623/download"><i>TIS Recommendation 3 &ndash; Improve Trade Reporting for Market Oversight, Streamline Potential 40% Increase in CFTC Reportable Data Elements</i></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The Commission is currently amending its Part 43 and Part 45 swap data reporting requirements to potentially add nearly 50 additional reportable fields on top of the currently required 128 data elements that were just implemented in December 2022. The potential 40% increase in data reporting elements distracts from optimizing analysis and use of the recently expanded data set and creates further obstacles and uncertainty for meaningful global aggregation and analysis of trade repository data. Further, an ad hoc approach to additional data reporting elements unnecessarily increases costs.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The GMAC recommends several steps to improve data reporting elements which will (i) advance analytical tools to optimize use of the current, recently expanded, data set; and (ii) focus on impediments to data sharing, including the alignment of the validations and requirements for critical data elements (CDE) fields and global identifiers.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>This GMAC recommendation informed the CFTC&rsquo;s recent Part 43 and Part 45 rulemaking proposal, and was then submitted to the public comment file. The CFTC is working to finalize this proposal.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/9596/gmac_TIS_Recommendation_DataSharingAnalysis110623/download"><i>TIS Recommendation 4 &ndash; Improve Trade Reporting for Market Oversight and Improving Data Sharing and Systemic Risk Analysis</i></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>Regulators, including the CFTC, have implemented global trade reporting harmonization efforts to enable data amalgamation to facilitate regulatory data usage across jurisdictions. However, there are non</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>‐</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>data related impediments that could prevent data sharing, thus undermining the value of these significant projects.</span></span></i></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The GMAC recommends the Commission facilitate discussions with key regulators (market and prudential) on the desire to share data elements and agree upon the Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) needed to allow such activity, starting with U.S. and then prioritize other G20 regulators where there is significant overlap.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>There are several international, major trade reporting initiatives at the FSB and IOSCO, among others, to improve trade reporting for market oversight and improve data sharing and systemic risk analysis consistent with this GMAC recommendation. The CFTC is actively participating in these ongoing initiatives.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/10326/GMAC_T+1_Resources_030624/download"><i>TIS Recommendation 5 - Publication of Resource Document to Support Transition to T+1 Securities Settlement</i></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>As the United States prepares to transition to next-day trade settlement (T+1) for securities in May 2024, the Subcommittee crafted a resource document to support market participants. The document details products covered by the transition to T+1, timelines for transition in various markets, and the benefits to the transition. The document also highlights the implications T+1 has for various markets &ndash; particularly foreign exchange markets, and discusses its impacts on transaction processes for various products, including cross-border impacts. Further, it provides a list of resources to help firms prepare for the transition.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>This GMAC recommendation helped to prepare the U.S. securities markets, and other impacted asset classes and products, for a smooth T+1 securities settlement transition completed over the Memorial Day holiday weekend. It provided resources for aspects such as foreign exchange (FX) markets and cross-border transactions.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><i><span><span>Digital Asset Markets Subcommittee (DAMS)</span></span></i></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/10321/CFTC_GMAC_DAM_Classification_Approach_and_Taxonomy_for_Digital_Assets_030624/download"><i>DAMS Recommendation 1 - Adoption of an Approach for the Classification and Understanding of Digital Assets</i></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>A clear, consensus-driven approach to classifying assets and the functions they serve underpins robust markets and effective regulation. The evolving digital asset ecosystem has led many to develop proprietary taxonomies to classify digital assets and their related technology. In recognition of this progress, the Subcommittee has engaged digital asset stakeholders across the broader digital asset ecosystem to build a common approach for the classification and understanding of digital assets.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>This approach aims to set out consistent language for participants in the digital asset ecosystem to promote innovation, identify and address risk considerations, and enable effective regulatory understanding. With this objective in mind, the approach builds upon the considerable classification efforts of global prudential standard setters and regional authorities, including the Bank for International Settlements, the Financial Stability Board and others.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The GMAC recommends this approach be considered an initial basis for a consensus-driven, functional taxonomy. However, as the digital asset ecosystem continues to evolve, so too will the terminology used to classify it. The Subcommittee will reassess any future developments to provide further recommendations to this approach, based on the guidance of its members. The Subcommittee seeks to support effective rules and regulations for digital assets, and recommends continued collaboration between industry, standard-setting bodies, and the regulatory community.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The first-of-a-kind GMAC digital asset taxonomy&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span><span>framework provides valuable foundational guidelines to further advance the discussion and promote U.S. regulatory clarity, and was extensively vetted by stakeholders such as regulatory authorities, financial institutions, asset managers, market infrastructures, and service providers.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>New GMAC and Subcommittee Members</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>I also want to welcome a few new faces to the GMAC and our Subcommittees. We've added a few new experts to our ranks since we last met.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>On the GMAC, we&rsquo;ve added&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Chuck Mack, Head of Strategy for North American Markets at Nasdaq, and Derek Kleinbauer, President of Bloomberg SEF. On the Digital Asset Markets Subcommittee, we&rsquo;ve added Mo Shaikh, Co-Founder and CEO of Aptos Labs; Terrence Dempsey, Senior Vice President and Head of Product Strategy at Fidelity Digital Assets; Ian Grieves, Vice President for Product &amp; Strategy at Cboe</span></span></span><span><span>; and&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Chen Arad, Co-Founder &amp; Chief External Affairs Officer at Solidus Labs.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Welcome, and I look forward to your contributions to the GMAC.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Today&rsquo;s GMAC Meeting</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Today&rsquo;s meeting will continue to build on the significant progress we&rsquo;ve already made. We&rsquo;ll start with a presentation from the Global Market Structure Subcommittee on the impact the proposed U.S. implementation of Basel III endgame&rsquo;s bank capital requirements would have on end users who rely on cleared derivatives markets. Providing this timely presentation will be Kyle Glenn, Vice President for Government Relations at FIA, and Thane Twiggs, Chief Compliance Officer for Risk Management at Cargill.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>We&rsquo;ll then have a panel discussion on Swap Execution Facilities. Our esteemed panelists are:</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span><span>Thomas Pluta, President of Tradeweb;</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>Scott Fitzpatrick, CEO of Tradition SEF; and</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>Adam Lister, Interest Rate Swaps Electronic Trading Product Manager at Bloomberg</span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Tara Kruse will lead our Technical Issues Subcommittee&rsquo;s discussion on its proposed recommendation on Variation Margin Processes in Non-Centrally Cleared Markets. Tara is the Global Head of Infrastructure, Data, and Non-Cleared Margin at ISDA.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Following a brief break, we&rsquo;ll receive an update on global commodity markets from Derek Sammann, Senior Managing Director and Global Head of Commodities, Options &amp; International Markets at CME Group.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Finally, we&rsquo;ll receive a presentation on the CFTC&rsquo;s international engagement from Andrea Musalem, Associate Director of the Commission&rsquo;s Office of International Affairs. We&rsquo;ll close out today&rsquo;s meeting with updates from each of the Subcommittees on ongoing workstreams and future agenda items.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>I&rsquo;m very much looking forward to these timely presentations and the consideration of the latest round of recommendations. Once again, thanks to our speakers and all members for being here and making the GMAC such a success.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The GMAC and the CFTC&rsquo;s Mission</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Today highlights that the CFTC is first and foremost a market regulator, and I&rsquo;m pleased we&rsquo;re getting back to basics with very important presentations and discussion of market characteristics, trading activity, and market fundamentals driving both, as well as capital and margin requirements. I look forward to the insights that will be shared on ways to enhance liquidity in markets, which could be the basis for additional GMAC initiatives. This is the bread and butter of the CFTC&rsquo;s core mission to oversee derivatives markets and ensure they are well-functioning. This doesn&rsquo;t get the headlines, but it is absolutely our day job and I appreciate Chairman Behnam&rsquo;s focus on this. I especially thank the CFTC&rsquo;s Office of International Affairs for their presentation and international leadership. Thank you all.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<div> CDCC, SGC Notes, Canadian Dollar Offered Rate cessation, investment vehicle, money market instruments
<br />
Summary:<br />CDCC launches SGC Notes program to accommodate transition from CDOR and Bankers’ Acceptances, offer investment opportunities in Canadian money markets with strong investor protection. <div>
<p><span>The Canadian Derivatives Clearing Corporation (CDCC), Canada's national central clearing counterparty (CCP) for exchange-traded derivative products and repurchase agreements, today announced the launch of the new Secured General Collateral (SGC) Notes program.</span></p>
<p><span>SGC Notes are short-term discounted money market instruments developed by CDCC in collaboration with Canadian market participants and designed to meet the demand for the transition from Bankers&rsquo; Acceptances (BAs) as a result of the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR) cessation.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;​We are proud to bring this innovative​, customized ​​investment vehicle to market, designed to provide Canada's market participants with an effective funding solution and support the industry transition from CDOR and Bankers&rsquo; Acceptances,​"&nbsp;<strong>said George Kormas, President of CDCC</strong>.​ "​CDCC is grateful for the input of our valued stakeholders ​across Canada&rsquo;s money markets, including both sell and buy side participants​, in the launch of SGC Notes and we look forward to serving their needs as our markets continue to evolve into the future.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>SGC Notes provide an investment policy-friendly opportunity for Canadian money market institutional investors to roll their BA exposure into SGC Notes. SGC Notes are linked to the same highly-rated Canadian bank credit exposure as BAs, but are secured with a basket of high quality debt securities (SGC Securities) which are sold to a trust through repurchase agreements cleared through CDCC.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>SGC Notes represent an attractive investment option relative to available alternatives.</span></p>
<p><span>SGC Notes are designed to provide strong investor protection through active risk management by CDCC of the basket of SGC Securities securing the SGC Notes and to leverage TMX Group&rsquo;s infrastructure, including the recently announced&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.tmx.com%2Fnewsroom%2Fpress-releases%3Fid=1198/1/0102019002405f87-43999f98-e6ce-40fa-a3a9-d5090bd56623-000000/rvtVaflIpdY6crSZ4ofJY_MJ0o8=377" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>Canadian Collateral Management Service (CCMS)</span></a>, which allows for automated collateral movements.</span></p>
<p><span>For more information on the new SGC Notes, please visit&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.cdcc.ca%2Fen%2Fsgc-notes/1/0102019002405f87-43999f98-e6ce-40fa-a3a9-d5090bd56623-000000/0evjN4dvExAx65ubdu6vN8Dl25k=377" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>&nbsp;</span></a><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.cdcc.ca/en/sgc-notes" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.cdcc.ca/en/sgc-notes</a></span>&nbsp;to review the offering memorandum.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>SGC Notes will be issued by a special purpose vehicle formed as an Ontario trust (&ldquo;Trust&rdquo;), of which ComputerShare Trust Company of Canada is trustee and CDCC is promoter, administrative agent, custodian and paying agent.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The SGC Notes will be subscribed for by CIRO investment dealers and Canadian chartered banks that are eligible to clear repurchase transactions relating to SGC Securities through CDCC (the &ldquo;SGC Clearing Members&rdquo;). The SGC Clearing Members will purchase the SGC Notes, as principals, at a discount to face value and may offer the SGC Notes for sale to investors subject to prior sale, if, as and when issued by the Trust and accepted by the SGC Clearing Members on a private placement basis to investors which are &ldquo;accredited investors&rdquo; and &ldquo;permitted clients&rdquo; (other than individuals) as defined in securities legislation in reliance on exemptions from the prospectus requirements of applicable provincial securities laws. The resale of the SGC Notes will be restricted by applicable provincial securities laws.</span></p>
<p><span>The SGC Notes are obligations of the Trust and not obligations of or interests in CDCC, Computershare Trust Company of Canada, any member of the TMX Group, or any SGC Clearing Member. The SGC Notes will represent limited recourse obligations of the Trust. Only the SGC Securities (and other collateral listed in the offering memorandum describing the SBC Notes) will secure payment of the SGC Notes.</span></p>
<p><span>The SGC Notes have not been registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, or the &ldquo;U.S. Securities Act&rdquo; or under the securities laws of any state of the United States, and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to U.S. persons within the meaning of Regulation S under the U.S.&nbsp; Securities Act, or &ldquo;Regulation S&rdquo; unless the securities are registered under the U.S. Securities Act or an exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act is available.</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Trade surveillance, financial risk solutions, Validus platform, legacy providers, global expansion<br />
Summary:<br />
Eventus' Validus platform sees 25% client base increase, global expansion, high renewal rates, and multiple award wins for trade surveillance excellence. <div>
<p>Eventus, a leading provider of comprehensive, at-scale trade surveillance and financial risk solutions, announced that its Validus platform continues to capture business from firms seeking to move away from legacy trade surveillance providers, with a 25% increase in its client base over the past year. The announcement comes on the heels of another award win for excellence in trade surveillance, further global expansion with the signing of its first South African client &ndash; one of Africa&rsquo;s largest diversified financial groups &ndash; and a continued high renewal rate for existing clients globally. The company now has clients on six continents.</p>
<p>Eventus CEO Travis Schwab said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve never been in a better position as a company. Our retention rates remain close to 100%, we are growing across asset classes and geographies, our platform continues to perform at the highest levels with new functionality rolling out consistently, and we are profitable. We are especially excited about some new clients that include three tier-1 banks all now actively using Validus to meet a range of compliance and regulatory goals. Our existing clients are routinely adding more areas of coverage and our Eventus Services offering to their contracts too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Companies keep turning to us, particularly if they&rsquo;ve had experience with legacy providers, because our sole focus is our clients and the delivery of best-in-class trade surveillance and financial risk solutions, such as algo monitoring. In an extraordinarily competitive landscape, we have what I would argue is more markets and regulatory expertise and a more responsive approach than any provider in the market, along with the unique ability for clients to fully customize the platform and work with our team on solving compliance challenges they are facing in real time. Our experience as market practitioners give us the ability to partner with each and every client &ndash; whether they are a start-up exchange, global trading firm, broker/dealer or tier 1 bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eventus Global Head of Regulatory Affairs Joe Schifano said: &ldquo;For many years, those of us who built surveillance programs for our firms were frustrated with the lack of flexibility in legacy trade surveillance systems. But now, it is even more critical to keep pace with technology as regulators are no longer satisfied with compliance programs that just &lsquo;follow the pack.&rsquo; At Eventus, we offer a &rsquo;buy-to-build&rsquo; solution that clients can tailor and easily scale specific to their risk assessment and data requirements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eventus also announced that it was just named Best Trade Surveillance Solution at the TradingTech Insight USA Awards 2024, based on votes from market participants and the publication&rsquo;s global audience. In March, the company won the same category in the 2024 RegTech insight Awards APAC for its work in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
<p>Schwab said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re honored to see recognition of our hard work and results through votes by so many market participants selecting Validus as Best Trade Surveillance Solution, reflecting our focus on our clients, expert service and constant enhancements to the platform.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Enhancements to the Validus platform this year include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reports and visualizations to help clients ensure accurate and complete data coverage.</li>
<li>Introduction of a first-of-its-kind cross-product spoofing functionality to detect this type of market manipulation in real time for clients engaged in multiple asset classes. This includes a new visualization methodology to review activity across products and new technology that facilitates cross-product review across all accounts and all activity.</li>
<li>New large trader reporter functionality, built for a designated clearing organization (DCO) client and now available to all users.</li>
<li>Enhanced behavioral analytics, including changes in trader profiles identifying potential red flags for rogue trading and account takeovers.</li>
<li>Expanded market data coverage.</li>
<li>Testing of the firm&rsquo;s next-generation platform that enables performance speeds and scale commensurate with growth in the markets and client data requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A-Team Group&rsquo;s series of awards, including those from TradingTech Insight and RegTech Insight, recognize outstanding performance by the vendors of data and technology solutions to the financial industry. Eventus has now won six A-Team Group awards over the past five years, including two RegTech Insight Europe Awards. To date, the company and its Validus platform have earned more than 40 awards and honors in the past six years.</p>

<div> Partnership, Blue Carbon, Investments, Ocean Protection, Mangrove Conservation
<br />
XTCC, Lady Merle, and Logos Capital Group partner to create listed blue carbon investments supporting ocean protection and community benefits. Revolutionizing climate finance.
<br /><br />Summary:
XTCC, Lady Merle, and Logos Capital Group collaborate to create listed blue carbon investments, supporting ocean protection, community benefits, and revolutionizing climate finance. <div>
<ul>
<li><span>Collaboration with Lady Merle Liivand (the Eco Mermaid) and Logos Capital Group to generate liquidity in investments supporting vital ocean protection projects</span></li>
<li><span><em>Brings together the best thought leaders and deep expertise around Blue Carbon</em>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Stock market-listed blue carbon investments help bridge multi-trillion-dollar gap in climate finance</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>XTCC, the investment ecosystem specialising in high-integrity carbon based listed investments, celebrates World Ocean Day with the announcement of a partnership with Lady Merle, the Estonian swimming champion and ocean protection advocate acknowledged globally as the &lsquo;Eco Mermaid&rsquo;, and Silvio Pupo-Casco of Logos Capital Group, to scale</span></p>
<p><span>up investment opportunities and enable global access to this new asset class, providing support for projects including mangrove conservation and transparent fund distribution to adjacent communities.</span></p>
<p><span>Lady Merle and Silvio will work closely with XTCC to identify mangrove and other blue carbon projects that also directly benefit adjacent local communities. XTCC will mobilise Lady Merle&rsquo;s expertise in the science of blue carbon and Silvio&rsquo;s investment network and commitment to driving significant investment capital into more impactful asset classes in the creation of new Blue Carbon investments listed on global stock markets. XTCC creates a bridge between blue carbon projects and<br />the capital markets, enabling an asset class for the Beyond Net Zero world.</span><span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Blue carbon is carbon captured by the world's ocean and coastal ecosystems, including mangroves that can, through sequestration - taking carbon in - provide a natural way of reducing the impact of greenhouse gases on earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. Coastal systems such as mangroves sequester high amounts of carbon quickly and sustainably (over millions of years). In fact, mangroves are ten times more effective at sequestering carbon than any other type of forestry, with a multitude of associated benefits such as clean water, food security, and protection against extreme weather events.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Seth Elliot, XTCC CEO</span>&nbsp;said: &ldquo;To truly move beyond Net Zero, we must combat global warming via significant nature-based project investments in ocean protection. By introducing Blue Carbon based listed investments, we aim to stimulate interest and generate liquidity to support the funding of blue carbon projects, redefine trust in the carbon market, and stimulate climate investments crucial for saving the planet.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Lady Merle said:&nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;Our oceans are the lungs of the world, playing a crucial role in producing oxygen and absorbing carbon dioxide and waste. Thriving mangrove ecosystems not only sustain the natural world but also support and enrich the communities that live alongside. On the negative side, when these important coastal systems are damaged, they emit enormous amounts of carbon into the atmosphere, contributing to climate change. As such, it is essential to protect and conserve mangroves and other coastal habitats, for the benefit of the climate and as importantly, to protect the communities that depend on them to survive and thrive&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Silvio Pupo-Casco, Logos Capital Group said</strong>: "Investing in natural capital and purchasing high-integrity carbon credits can often be complex and opaque. Through our joint venture with XTCC, we aim to simplify and clarify this process, ensuring that investors know exactly what they are getting for their money. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies, we will restore trust in critical natural capital and ecosystem service investments, particularly in the realm of blue carbon." He continued, &ldquo;Our new blue carbon investment instrument is designed to exceed current market standards for transparency and reporting. By setting new benchmarks for accountability and integrity, we are committed to offering unparalleled clarity and reliability in the carbon credit markets. This next-generation investment vehicle is poised to revolutionize global capital markets, driving significant impact in blue finance."</span></p>

<div> Equity Hedge, Event-Driven, Cryptocurrency, Risk Parity, Performance Dispersion
Summary:
- Hedge funds gained in May, led by Equity Hedge and Event-Driven strategies.
- Cryptocurrency and Risk Parity indexes surged.
- Performance dispersion declined in May.
- Equity Hedge funds, driven by Energy and Technology exposures, led gains.
- Interest rate-sensitive strategies also advanced, while Macro strategies posted mixed performance. <div>
<p>Hedge funds gained in May as equities recovered the prior month&rsquo;s decline, and as inflationary pressures remained elevated, but investors positioned for interest rate reductions in 2H24. Led by directional Equity Hedge and Event-Driven strategies, the HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index advanced +1.3 percent in May, with additional positive contributions from Relative Value Arbitrage strategies offsetting a decline in Macro strategies. The HFRI Equity Hedge (Total) Index jumped +2.5 percent for the month, reversing the April decline and marking the fifth gain for this index in the trailing seven months, posting its strongest monthly return since February.</p>
<p>The HFR Cryptocurrency Index surged +13.6 percent in May, while the HFR Risk Parity Vol 15 Index jumped +3.0 percent for the month.</p>
<p>Performance dispersion declined in May, as the top decile of the HFRI FWC constituents advanced by an average of +7.6 percent, while the bottom decile fell by an average of -4.1 percent, representing a top/bottom dispersion of 11.7 percent for the month. By comparison, the top/bottom performance dispersion in April was 14.3 percent. In the trailing 12 months ending May 2024, the top decile of FWC constituents gained +42.9 percent, while the bottom decile declined -7.3 percent, representing a top/bottom dispersion of 50.2 percent. Approximately 70 percent of hedge funds produced positive performance in May.</p>
<p>Equity Hedge (EH) funds, which invest long and short across specialized sub-strategies, led gains in May, driven by advances in Energy and Technology exposures. The HFRI Equity Hedge (Total) Index gained +2.5 percent (estimated) for the month, improving the YTD 2024 return to +6.1 percent. EH sub-strategy gains were led by the HFRI EH: Sector-Energy Index, which surged an estimated +3.6 percent, while the HFRI EH: Sector-Technology Index added +3.2 percent. Other strong contributors in May were the HFRI EH: Multi-Strategy Index and the HFRI EH: Fundamental Value Index, each of which advanced +3.1 percent for the month. Through the first five months of the year, the HFRI EH: Quantitative Directional Index leads EH sub-strategy performance with a YTD return of +8.6 percent.</p>
<p>Event-Driven (ED) strategies, which often focus on out-of-favor, deep value equity exposures and speculation on M&amp;A situations, also advanced in May, driven by Multi-Strategy and Distressed exposures. The HFRI Event-Driven (Total) Index gained +1.6 percent for the month, led by the HFRI ED: Multi-Strategy Index, which jumped +2.35 percent, and the HFRI ED: Distressed Index, which added +1.7 percent for the month.</p>
<p>Fixed income-based, interest rate-sensitive strategies also advanced in May as investors positioned for interest rate cuts in 2H24 despite persistent inflation. The HFRI Relative Value (Total) Index added an estimated +0.6 percent for the month, increasing its YTD 2024 return to +3.3 percent. RVA performance was led by the HFRI RV: Asset Backed Index and HFRI RV: Convertible Arbitrage Index, each of which advanced +0.9 percent for the month.</p>
<p>Macro strategies posted mixed performance in May as interest rates and financial market volatility fell, and as investors positioned for interest rate cuts in 2H24. The HFRI Macro (Total) Index fell -0.65 percent in May, the<sup>&nbsp;</sup>first monthly decline since November 2023. Losses were driven by the HFRI Macro: Systematic Diversified Index, which declined -1.3 percent for the month but remains the leading area of sub-strategy performance over the first five months of the year, with a YTD return of +9.15 percent. Partially offsetting the May declines, the HFRI Macro: Active Trading Index jumped +2.7 percent for the month, bringing its YTD performance to +6.3 percent.</p>
<p>Liquid Alternative UCITS strategies posted gains in May, as the HFRX Global Index advanced +0.6 percent for the month, led by the HFRX Equity Hedge Index, which advanced +1.25 percent, and the HFRX Relative Value Index, which added +0.7 percent. The HFRX Market Directional Index also advanced in May, adding +1.7 percent for the month.</p>
<p>The HFRI Diversity Index advanced an estimated +1.8 percent in May, while the HFRI Women Index gained +1.9 percent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hedge funds posted strong gains in May, reversing April declines, with leadership from directional equity and credit strategies, as investors positioned for continued inflation, ECB and US Federal Reserve rate cuts, and an improving economic growth in 2H24. Uncorrelated Macro hedge funds, the leading strategy area of performance over the first four months of the year, posted its first monthly decline since November as financial market volatility fell in May,&rdquo; stated Kenneth J. Heinz, President of HFR. &ldquo;The primary risks for hedge funds and hedge fund positioning accelerated the shift from macroeconomic risks to geopolitical risks, with these comprising not only ongoing, active military conflicts but also potential for additional conflicts and risks associated with policy changes as a result of major political elections in the coming months. Hedge funds have effectively positioned portfolios in a tactical sense for these highly fluid and uncertain situations, including not only military threats, but possibilities for supply chain disruptions, outright trade embargoes or halts, and destabilizing dislocations and volatility associated with banking and broader financial market operation. Institutions interested in access to opportunities which may be created by this volatility, as well as portfolio protection from these risks, are likely to increase exposure to hedge funds which have demonstrated their strategy&rsquo;s robustness of navigating these building and evolving risks over recent months and years.&rdquo;</p>

<title>SEC Charges Three New Yorkers For Raising More Than $184 Million Through Pre-IPO Fraud Schemes - After Commission Shut Down Original Ploy, Defendants Started Another One</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-charges-three-new-yorkers-for-raising-more-than-184-million-through-pre-ipo/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-charges-three-new-yorkers-for-raising-more-than-184-million-through-pre-ipo/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> charged, fraud, unregistered, pre-IPO, SEC
Summary:
SEC charged individuals with fraud for selling unregistered pre-IPO shares, involving high-pressure sales tactics and undisclosed markups. U.S. Attorney's Office also filed charges. Ongoing investigation in the pre-IPO space. SEC prioritizes enforcement in the pre-IPO space, filing charges in various cases. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged three individuals with fraud for selling unregistered membership interests in LLCs that purported to invest in shares of pre-IPO companies, first on behalf of StraightPath Venture Partners LLC, the subject of the Commission&rsquo;s emergency&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-83">action</a>&nbsp;in May 2022, and, later, on behalf of Legend Venture Partners LLC, the subject of the Commission&rsquo;s emergency&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-119">action</a>&nbsp;in June 2023. Both&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr-25429">StraightPath</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr-25772">Legend</a>&nbsp;are now under court-ordered receiverships.</p>
<p>In this new action, the SEC alleges that New York residents Mario Gogliormella, Steven Lacaj, and Karim Ibrahim directed an unregistered sales force of more than 50 callers in boiler rooms to pressure investors into making investments without telling them that the shares had been substantially marked up&mdash;between approximately 19 and 105 percent on average above the prices that StraightPath or Legend had paid for the underlying shares. As a result of these tactics, the defendants and their sales force allegedly pocketed more than $45 million in fees from unsuspecting investors from 2019 to 2022.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We allege that the fraud in this case is like a Hollywood movie where the defendants ran boiler rooms using scripts they referred to as the &lsquo;Bible,&rsquo; engaged in high-pressure sales tactics, and employed outright falsehoods to defraud investors,&rdquo; said Sheldon L. Pollock, Associate Director of the New York Regional Office. &ldquo;After the SEC shut them down the first time, they simply rebranded their outfit, and today through our action we are seeking to ensure that they are held accountable for enticing and lying to investors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint charges the defendants with violating antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws. The complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, return of allegedly ill-gotten gains, and civil penalties. The SEC also charged Adam Ibrahim, Karim Ibrahim&rsquo;s brother, as a relief defendant.</p>
<p>The U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Southern District of New York today unsealed an indictment charging Gogliormella, Lacaj, and Karim Ibrahim with securities fraud, among other offenses, in connection with their work for StraightPath and Legend.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s ongoing investigation is being conducted by Joshua D. Tannen and Lee A. Greenwood of the Asset Management Unit and Sushila P. Rao, Suzanne M. Bettis, Megan Genet, Tiantong Wen, Douglas Smith, Kerri L. Palen, Patricia Schrage, Daniel Loss, Alistaire Bambach, and Steven G. Rawlings of the New York Regional Office. It is being supervised by Mr. Pollock. The litigation will be led by Ms. Rao, Mr. Tannen, and Ms. Bettis and supervised by Mr. Loss and Mr. Pollock.</p>
<p>The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Southern District of New York and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service.</p>

<p>The pre-IPO space remains a priority area for the Division of Enforcement and the New York Regional Office. In addition to the prior StraightPath and Legend actions, the New York Regional Office has also filed other charges in other matters, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>In December 2023, the Commission&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-245#:~:text=The%20Securities%20and%20Exchange%20Commission,and%20JL%20Rivera%20Enterprises%20Ltd.">charged</a>&nbsp;five individuals and four companies in a $528 million pre-IPO fraud.</li>
<li>In March 2023, the SEC&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-61">charged</a>&nbsp;three StraightPath sales agents with fraud and unregistered broker activity.</li>
<li>In December 2020, the SEC&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr-24972">charged</a>&nbsp;a boiler room operator with defrauding retail investors in the sale of pre-IPO shares.</li>

<p>The EACH General Assembly also agreed on the EACH Strategy for the 2024-2026 period. EACH will enhance its role as both the proactive voice of CCPs in Europe in front of public authorities and private stakeholders as well as acting as a dynamic forum to develop the CCP clearing industry through the agreed strategic priorities. The EACH community will continue to focus on fostering robust and efficient capital markets for companies to grow and investors to manage their risks.</p>
<p>The EACH Co-Chairs&nbsp;Julien Jardelot, Niels Brab and Tim Grange said: &lsquo;We are delighted to the trust European CCP and clearing houses are putting in us by renewing our mandate to represent the EACH community. We aim to increase the understating of how CCPs contribute to robust and more efficient capital markets for the benefit of businesses, investors and the economy as a whole. We welcome the efforts of different European jurisdictions to further diversify funding opportunities by strengthening capital markets and believe CCPs and clearing houses have a key role to play in supporting these efforts&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The EACH Secretary General Rafael Plata said: &lsquo;The next two years are likely crucial to plant the seeds of a new era of capital markets in Europe. Companies, investors and pensioners amongst other are likely to benefit from it. I look forward to continuing working with the capital markets ecosystem to make the dream of deeper and strong capital markets in Europe come true&rsquo;.</p>

<title>A New Class Of Trailblazers, Federal Reserve Governor Lisa D. Cook, At The Girls Global Academy 2024 Commencement Ceremony, Washington, D.C.</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Dr. O'Neal. It is an honor to be here to celebrate with you&mdash;the Girls Global Academy's first-ever graduating class. This is a momentous achievement and occasion. You are making history today! But, of course, you could not have done it alone. So let me start by acknowledging the teachers; administrators, staff, and board members of the Girls Global Academy; and the parents, grandparents, siblings, mentors, and friends who made today possible. Thank you and congratulations on a job well done.</p>
<p>And a very special congratulations to the Girls Global Academy Class of 2024! Soon you will embark on new journeys. I understand that many of you are going on to college in the fall, including one of you heading to my alma mater, Spelman College. (Be sure not to miss the 144th Founders Day celebration next year and the annual Spelman-Morehouse Christmas Carol concert in historic Sisters Chapel.) Others are off to start careers or to pursue vocational training. One of you will enter public service directly and become a member of the U.S. Air Force. That is a lot to be proud of and excited about. Whatever path you take next, I know the education and experience you gained here will guide you.</p>
<p>The Class of 2024 stands out. This is not only because you are the first, but also because you achieved so much all while overcoming extremely challenging circumstances by starting high school during the pandemic. Like you, I know what it is like to be the first to take a path, a path that was not always smooth and predictable. I will tell you more about that shortly.</p>
<p>Four years ago, all of you could have taken a more well-marked route. Instead, you had the courage to enroll at a brand new school during a global pandemic. You learned virtually during your first year. When you were able to attend your school in person for the first time, you did so with masks on, while social distancing. Forging new friendships is always challenging. It is even harder when you cannot sit next to a new classmate at the lunch table. But I know you worked hard to move your learning and your friendships beyond the screens and into real life. Now that those bonds have formed, I hope you hold on to them for many years to come, as I did with my classmates at a women's college.</p>
<p>As the inaugural class of the Girls Global Academy, your list of firsts is long and impressive. You formed the academy's first ever student government. You started a debate team and created cooking and DJ clubs, to name a few. You took the court and field as the first volleyball, basketball, softball, track, and cross-country teams. (I would have gone out for the softball and track teams. I was a catcher on my softball team in junior high and shot put was my event on the track team in high school.)</p>
<p>Everything was new, and probably a bit scary. Yet, you learned to become outspoken, you took on leadership roles, and you set an example for younger students. Through it all you grew, and you became the remarkable young women you are today.</p>
<p>With all those firsts, I was told that you sometimes call yourselves "the guinea pigs." I get that. However, I would like to offer a different moniker for this group: trailblazers. You bravely went where no one had gone before, and you accomplished great things through difficult challenges. To honor that, I want to tell you about a favorite trailblazer of mine and a girl who looked up to her.</p>
<p>The trailblazer I am thinking of is Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander. A little more than a century ago, she graduated from high school here in Washington, D.C., less than a mile away from your school. It was then called M Street High School. She went on to earn bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Pennsylvania. During her doctoral studies, she undertook research on the living standards of Black families that were migrating to Philadelphia during World War I. After completing that work, she became the second African American woman ever to earn a PhD and the first African American to earn a PhD in economics.</p>
<p>But in the 1920s, Dr. Alexander was actively denied entry into the economics profession on the basis of her race and sex. Some might have been crushed and deterred by the impediment. Not Dr. Alexander. Instead, she went on to blaze another trail. She became the first African American woman to earn a law degree from the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Alexander was also the first African American woman to pass the bar and practice law in the state of Pennsylvania. She continued to think and write about economic issues in her legal work and public service. She went on to be a top attorney for the city of Philadelphia and served the public in many other ways, including being asked by two U.S. presidents to serve on important committees.</p>
<p>Dr. Alexander was also the first national president of Delta Sigma Theta, a public service sorority. My mother helped to start a Delta Sigma Theta chapter at Georgia College and State University. That is how I first learned about Dr. Alexander. In fact, when I was in seventh grade, I entered my county social science fair with a project inspired by her work: identifying the major causes of unemployment among Black Americans. I did not realize it then, but that turned out to be my first foray into economic research, which became the cornerstone of my career.</p>
<p>It was helpful to have trailblazers to look up to, including Dr. Alexander, but also my aunts, uncles, parents, and other relatives and family friends who played important roles in the Civil Rights Movement. They instilled in me the confidence to blaze trails of my own. I was among the first African American students to desegregate one of the schools I attended in my hometown of Milledgeville, Georgia. Although some of the students and others in the community did not welcome us, I drew strength from the example set by my family and others in the Civil Rights Movement, and from their conviction in the hope and promise of a world that could and would continually improve.</p>
<p>While I had an interest in economics even before I entered high school, that profession was not the first path I choose. I started Spelman as a physics and philosophy major. It was not until after my undergraduate years, when I was literally on a trail&mdash;one climbing Mount Kilimanjaro&mdash;that I discovered economics was the path for me. I was hiking alongside a British economist. By the end of that journey, he had convinced me that studying economics would provide me the tools to address some big and important questions I had pondered for a long time&mdash;as far back as when Dr. Alexander inspired my submission to the county social science fair.</p>
<p>Following in her footsteps, I went on to earn my PhD in economics from the University of California, Berkeley. The path of an economist led me many places, including to Moscow to research banking in pre- and post-Soviet Russia and to the White House as an economist for President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers. In 2022, President Biden nominated me to serve on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. I am proud to say that I am the first African American woman and first woman of color to serve on the Board of Governors, a body that makes decisions affecting the entire economy and the well-being of every American.</p>
<p>I hope that my story, and Dr. Alexander's story, might inspire you to see that even when you encounter roadblocks, you can chart your own path and achieve great things. I know you can do that, because you established a strong foundation here at the Girls Global Academy, starting with the four pillars of sisterhood, scholarship, service, and safety.</p>
<p>I can see you have the spirit of sisterhood today as you celebrate all your achievements. You established a sisterhood as the first Girls Global Academy alumnae, and you also joined a broader sisterhood of strong, courageous, trailblazing women. You are scholars, earning your diploma and going on to college and onto various career paths. You worked in service to your community by each completing at least 50 service hours. The scholarship and service pillars show that you are already like Dr. Alexander, who highly valued education and used her education to improve the world. And you certainly learned the importance of safety as you started high school in the pandemic&mdash;and the importance of creating a safe environment of belonging where you can learn, be challenged, and grow, while comfortably being yourself. Holding these four pillars close will serve you well as you take the next step in your journeys.</p>
<p>As I conclude, I would like to thank you for allowing me to add another first&mdash;the first Girls Global Academy commencement speaker. I am deeply humbled by this honor. Once again, congratulations to the very first Girls Global Academy graduating class&mdash;the Class of 2024! We are all so proud of you and cannot wait to see what you will do.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Nigerian Exchange (NGX) Limited has urged investors to leverage on its new USSD platform for enhanced capital market access.</p>
<p>NGX stated this at its Investor Education Series, partnered with Meristem via a zoom meeting held on Thursday, June 6, 2024 with the theme, &lsquo;Unlocking Potential: Leveraging USSD For Enhanced Capital Market Access&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Speaking at the event, Head, Trading &amp; Products of NGX, Abimbola Babalola stated that the NGX USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) platform is a technology that allows mobile phone users to access a variety of services by dialing a short code (*5474#) on their phone keypad, saying that the NGX USSD platform is a new and innovative way for investors to access real-time stock market information and connect with a stockbroker.</p>
<p>According to him, the product is designed to boost financial inclusion and market participation in Nigeria by providing investors easy access to price information of listed companies and connecting them with Trading License Holders.</p>
<p>He further said that &ldquo;what we are doing at the exchange is to put investors at the driver&rsquo;s seat of their investment. Gone are those days when you buy securities and you go to sleep, or you have to start reading the newspaper or wait for news to know what is happening to the stocks. So, this time around, you have a device that you can use to monitor your stock at any time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Babalola added that investors' education is key, and this is what the products will address.</p>
<p>The Head, Investment Advisory at Meristem Stockbrokers Limited, Temitope Oludimu said that Meristem Securities has been in the industry for over two decades, growing her clients&rsquo; wealth and enhancing their financial wellbeing.</p>
<p>She noted that the Stockbrokers subsidiary of the Group provides easy access to online brokerage accounts allowing clients to monitor trades in real-time via MeriTrade and the first online stock trading platform in Nigeria commenced in 2014.</p>
<p>Oludimu added that &ldquo;MeriTrade allows users to buy and sell stocks online through the Nigerian Stock Exchange from the comfort of their home, office, car and even on the go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The platform defines stock broking in an entirely different language and creates a world class experience, bringing your broker (electronically) to the comfort of your home and office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The panel session speaking on the theme for the event emphasized the importance of investors' education in the capital market.</p>
<p>Afeez Ramoni, Head, Data and Digital Innovation, NGX stated that the public can now conveniently receive market information and commence account opening processes through their mobile phones by dialing *5474#. This marks a significant stride in NGX&rsquo;s commitment to democratizing access to investment opportunities and promoting retail investors participation through digital channels for accessing the capital market.</p>
<p>He anticipates that the USSD short code *5474# will enhance market accessibility and contribute significantly to the broader financial inclusion landscape in Nigeria.</p>
<p>Martha Ibrahim of NGX Group said that financial inclusion is really about inclusivity and creating access to financial services to investors.</p>
<p>She stated that this is really important for a vibrant capital market and also the country&rsquo;s economic development in general.</p>
<p>According to her, with the coming up of this initiative, integrating USSD with NGX, we also understand the importance of technology as a key financial enabler for financial inclusion. We are simplifying access to the stock markets and reducing barriers to entry. This would also promote a significant increase in the level of financial inclusion we have currently within the capital markets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By leveraging on this investor education and simplifying access to the markets, this validates that NGX is on the right step towards driving financial inclusion within the Nigerian capital markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Also, Oluwatobi Adesanya of Meristem added that &ldquo;we cannot overemphasize the need for financial literacy in the Nigerian capital market.&rdquo;</p>
