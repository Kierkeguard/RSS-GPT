<div> Meeting, Global Markets Advisory Committee, GMAC, recommendations, Subcommittee
Summary:
- Thanking attendees for participation
- Update on status of GMAC recommendations
- Welcome new members
- Overview of today's agenda
- Recognition of impactful work of GMAC
- Highlighting importance of GMAC's work <div>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Good morning. It&rsquo;s great to convene another Global Markets Advisory Committee (GMAC) meeting in New York. I want to start by thanking everyone for taking the time to travel here&mdash;from all across the United States, and as far away as London, Frankfurt, Tokyo and more&mdash;to share your expertise with the GMAC. I know that a lot of time and work goes into preparing for these meetings, so I also want to thank the GMAC members and Subcommittee members for their service, and our presenters for joining us today. The GMAC&rsquo;s recommendations have real impact and add value to not only the Commission, but also to the international policy dialogue. I especially want to recognize the GMAC&rsquo;s leadership team for your continued stewardship of the GMAC, and all the Subcommittee workstream leads for their tireless efforts. We have a truly impressive group of leaders to examine the issues.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Of course, I want to acknowledge and thank my team: Harry Jung, the GMAC Designated Federal Officer, and Nicholas Elliot, the GMAC Alternate Designated Federal Officer, as well as Meghan Tente and Taylor Foy. And, as always, many thanks to all the CFTC staff in both the New York office and our DC headquarters who made the GMAC&rsquo;s meeting today possible.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>I will provide a brief update on the status of each of the GMAC&rsquo;s 11 recommendations to date and potential next steps. I will also recognize the new members of the GMAC and its Subcommittees, and then provide an overview of today&rsquo;s agenda and speakers.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The GMAC Continues to Deliver</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The GMAC continues to support the growth of liquid and efficient markets and make great progress developing thoughtful recommendations and insightful work product to aid the CFTC, both U.S. and non-U.S. authorities, and indeed, all stakeholders in global markets and financial services.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The GMAC was first created in 1998 to handle the issues associated with globalization and access to markets. These issues remain critically important given the interconnected market environment, everchanging geopolitical dynamics, and emerging and innovative products and tools. Accordingly, global collaboration and coordination amongst authorities is critical to promoting regulatory cohesion and financial stability, and mitigating market fragmentation and systemic risk. That is why the GMAC&rsquo;s mandate includes assessing and informing international standards.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Since it was relaunched, the GMAC has worked to ensure that global markets are well-functioning, promote market integrity and resilience, facilitate compliance, and foster innovation and growth. As the GMAC&rsquo;s sponsor, I&rsquo;m honored to help provide a public venue for preeminent industry experts and regulators to discuss and develop pragmatic solutions to global challenges. I hope we have built a union of minds brought together for a common purpose.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Status of GMAC Recommendations and Next Steps</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>First, I want to commend the GMAC for kicking off last year with a comprehensive stock-take of the most significant current and emerging issues in global markets and the financial system. This global stock-take informed the development of the GMAC&rsquo;s work program and included input from policymakers, dealers, asset managers, liquidity providers, exchanges, trading facilities, clearinghouses, technology service providers, and end users.&nbsp;</span>I particularly note that the GMAC&rsquo;s work is based on data and observations from the markets that will support better policy outcomes.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>In less than a year, the GMAC has adopted 11 recommendations to date on a variety of issues, including U.S. Treasury market liquidity, well-functioning repo and funding markets, exchange volatility controls, T+1 securities settlement, improved collateral management, central counterparty (CCP) default simulation, streamlining trade reporting data to monitor systemic risk, and a foundational digital asset taxonomy to facilitate alignment in regulation across jurisdictions.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>These recommendations have provided data-driven and transparent resources for the CFTC and our counterparts around the world. Just last week, I was honored to present the GMAC&rsquo;s recommendations at the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) 49<span>th</span>&nbsp;Annual Meeting, and I note Chairman Behnam serves as IOSCO Vice Chair. The CFTC has long been a leader in various international fora. The degree of interest in the GMAC&rsquo;s work speaks for itself.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><i><span><span>Global Market Structure Subcommittee (GMSS)</span></span></i></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/9606/GMAC_NewBlockCap110623/download"><i>GMSS Recommendation 1 &ndash; New Block and Cap Sizes</i></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>Appropriately calibrated block and cap sizes are vital to the proper functioning of derivatives markets, including price discovery and transparency. However, the CFTC&rsquo;s new post</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>‐</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>initial block and cap sizes that will require compliance starting July 1, 2024, may negatively affect market liquidity and could significantly raise trading and hedging costs for buy</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>‐</span></span></i><i><span><span>side market participants and end users such as pension and other retirement plans.</span></span></i></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The GMAC recommends extending the compliance date for the post</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>‐</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>initial block and cap sizes for all asset classes to at least December 4, 2024. The GMAC further recommends that, during the extension period, the Commission engages with market participants in discussions and analysis to ensure the post</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>‐</span></span></i><i><span><span>initial block and cap sizes are appropriately tailored, including with respect to current market and macroeconomic conditions.</span></span></i></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The CFTC recently issued a letter that will allow for further study including implications of decreased liquidity and access to markets. I believe that the GMAC&rsquo;s presentations and recommendations were key, especially the market data and observations. I appreciate the support of Commissioner Mersinger, and Chairman Behnam&rsquo;s pragmatic approach and consideration of this issue.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/9731/gmac_Rule1_25d2_110623/download"><i>GMSS Recommendation 2 &ndash; Proposal to Add CCPs as Permitted Counterparties</i></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>Further alignment of SEC and CFTC regulations would support critical risk management functions that will promote well-functioning repo and funding markets. While CFTC rules impose customer protection requirements and permit a futures commission merchant (FCM) or derivatives clearing organization (DCO) to utilize repos to manage customer funds, an SEC-registered clearing agency is not a permitted counterparty under Rule 1.25(d)(2).</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The GMAC recommends that the Commission allow a CCP that meets the definition of a &ldquo;covered clearing agency&rdquo; under SEC Rule 17-Ad-22(a)(5) to be designated a &ldquo;permitted counterparty&rdquo; pursuant to CFTC Rule 1.25(d)(2).</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>I&rsquo;m pleased to note that I have discussed this recommendation with Chairman Behnam, and it will be considered for CFTC rulemaking given that this recommendation will facilitate implementation of the SEC&rsquo;s Treasury clearing mandate.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/9591/gmac_FICC_CME110623/download"><i>GMSS Recommendation 3 &ndash; FICC-CME Customer Position Cross-Margining Structure</i></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>For two decades, the CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have approved cross-margining for Treasury securities transactions and Treasury futures, promoting the efficiency and well-functioning of the U.S. Treasury markets&mdash;the backbone of the global financial system.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The GMAC recommends the Commission make the benefits of cross-margining available to a broader range of sophisticated customers, including those customers that will be subject to the new SEC Treasury clearing requirements, as well as to all customers that voluntarily elect to clear Treasury transactions and will post margin.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>This GMAC recommendation is being actively considered as part of the implementation of the SEC&rsquo;s Treasury clearing mandate. I thank FICC and CME&rsquo;s leadership on this issue. Both are members of the GMAC&rsquo;s Global Market Structure Subcommittee and led this work.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/9736/gmac_FIAExecutiveSummary110623/download"><i>GMSS Recommendation 4 &ndash; Endorsement of Futures Industry Association (FIA) Volatility Controls Mechanism Paper</i></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The efficient management of financial market volatility is paramount. During recent crises in markets, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as in commodity markets, the Futures Industry Association (FIA) has noted the pivotal role volatility control mechanisms have played in preserving market integrity. Consequently, FIA engaged with global derivatives exchanges and market participants to explore the most effective ways to mitigate disruptions while ensuring transparent price discovery.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The GMAC recommends the Commission use the best practices as a tool for understanding exchange market risk controls and when engaging with global regulators and international standard setters.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>This GMAC recommendation has been a beneficial resource to ensuring market integrity during periods of high market volatility, market stress, or other disruptions through effective application of exchange market risk controls and other volatility control mechanisms and sharing best practices across jurisdictions.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/10331/CFTC_GMAC_GM_Structure_Subcommittee_Recommendation-UST_ETF_as_UMR_Collateral/download"><i>GMSS Recommendation 5 - Inclusion of U.S. Treasury ETFs as Eligible Initial Margin Collateral</i></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The use of exchange traded funds (ETFs) that invest in U.S. Treasury bonds has dramatically increased in recent years. While standalone U.S. Treasury bonds can be used as initial margin (IM) collateral for uncleared swaps, ETFs that invest in them are not similarly eligible as collateral, despite being more diversified which can mitigate idiosyncratic risk.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>During many historic volatile trading sessions, certain UST ETFs have acted globally as &ldquo;shock absorbers,&rdquo; providing real-time prices and liquidity. Most notably, during the bond market volatility in 2020, volatility increased in U.S. Treasury bonds as dealers&rsquo; balance sheets were constrained. During this time, many UST ETFs traded at tighter bid-ask spreads than their portfolio of underlying bonds. For example, dislocations in U.S. Treasuries caused the bid/ask spreads of &ldquo;off-the-run&rdquo; bonds with a maturity of 20+ years to widen to almost 20 times that of the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT).</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The inclusion of U.S. Treasury ETFs as eligible IM collateral under the CFTC Margin Rules for Covered Swap Entities would enhance the robustness and resilience of the collateral pipeline. This enhancement, driven by factors such as diversification, liquidity, efficiency, and market stability, could prove beneficial for end-users seeking a wider range of eligible IM, CSEs and the broader financial markets. Allowing UST ETFs as IM collateral could not only help safeguard CSEs from counterparty default, but also help reduce the overall risk in the financial system and limit the potential for contagion arising from uncleared swaps.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The GMAC recommends the CFTC expand the universe of liquid assets that can be posted as uncleared margin, specifically to include U.S. Treasury ETFs.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The CFTC has been considering various aspects of margin and eligible collateral requirements. This GMAC recommendation and associated market data and observations are timely given recent developments in Treasury markets, and have contributed to an informed analysis of appropriate collateral management practices.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><i><span><span>Technical Issues Subcommittee (TIS)</span></span></i></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/9576/gmac_TechnicalSubcommitteeRecommendationsDefault110623/download"><i>TISS Recommendation 1 - Global Default Simulation</i></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>In November 2023, CCP Global conducted a global default simulation across CCPs. Global regulator support of the exercise was critical to its success. The default simulation was arranged in consultation and with input from regulators. It is critical the CFTC continue its support and valuable input, alongside its role in convening regulators and market participants.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The GMAC recommends the CFTC consider inclusion of lessons learned and best practices arising from such simulations into its capacity building programs with, especially, some emerging market regulatory homologues.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The CFTC, through the work of the Office of International Affairs, actively provides technical assistance to many other jurisdictions in the development of effective derivatives markets. CCP resilience, recovery, and resolution has been a top financial stability priority, and the GMAC recommendation has supported ongoing efforts to identify and mitigate systemic risk.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/9721/gmac_TechnicalSubcommitteeRecommendationsMMF110623/download"><i>TIS Recommendation 2 &ndash; MMFs as Eligible Collateral</i></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The CFTC&rsquo;s proposed rule amendment to remove the asset transfer restriction from money market funds (MMFs) used as eligible collateral for non</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>‐</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>cleared margin will harmonize the parameters for MMF use with the UK and resolve one of the impediments to the use of MMFs between the U.S. and European Union (EU). The proposed rule will also allow the CFTC to self</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>‐</span></span></i><i><span><span>align MMFs with its eligible collateral requirements for cleared margin, per CFTC Rule 1.25, which governs the investment of customer money by FCMs without similar asset transfer restrictions.</span></span></i></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The GMAC recommends the Commission: (i) finalize the proposed rule amendment; (ii) encourage the U.S. Prudential Regulators to adopt a corresponding amendment to their non</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>‐</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>cleared margin rules, including allowing third country funds; and (iii) encourage European Union (EU) policy makers to remove the third country fund restriction for eligible collateral from their non</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>‐</span></span></i><i><span><span>cleared margin rules.</span></span></i></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The CFTC currently has a pending rulemaking proposal on MMFs as eligible collateral for non-cleared margin. The GMAC recommendation has provided a key perspective on cross-border harmonization of MMF treatment.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/9726/gmac_TIS_P42P45Streamlining110623/download"><i>TIS Recommendation 3 &ndash; Improve Trade Reporting for Market Oversight, Streamline Potential 40% Increase in CFTC Reportable Data Elements</i></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The Commission is currently amending its Part 43 and Part 45 swap data reporting requirements to potentially add nearly 50 additional reportable fields on top of the currently required 128 data elements that were just implemented in December 2022. The potential 40% increase in data reporting elements distracts from optimizing analysis and use of the recently expanded data set and creates further obstacles and uncertainty for meaningful global aggregation and analysis of trade repository data. Further, an ad hoc approach to additional data reporting elements unnecessarily increases costs.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The GMAC recommends several steps to improve data reporting elements which will (i) advance analytical tools to optimize use of the current, recently expanded, data set; and (ii) focus on impediments to data sharing, including the alignment of the validations and requirements for critical data elements (CDE) fields and global identifiers.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>This GMAC recommendation informed the CFTC&rsquo;s recent Part 43 and Part 45 rulemaking proposal, and was then submitted to the public comment file. The CFTC is working to finalize this proposal.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/9596/gmac_TIS_Recommendation_DataSharingAnalysis110623/download"><i>TIS Recommendation 4 &ndash; Improve Trade Reporting for Market Oversight and Improving Data Sharing and Systemic Risk Analysis</i></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>Regulators, including the CFTC, have implemented global trade reporting harmonization efforts to enable data amalgamation to facilitate regulatory data usage across jurisdictions. However, there are non</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>‐</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>data related impediments that could prevent data sharing, thus undermining the value of these significant projects.</span></span></i></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The GMAC recommends the Commission facilitate discussions with key regulators (market and prudential) on the desire to share data elements and agree upon the Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) needed to allow such activity, starting with U.S. and then prioritize other G20 regulators where there is significant overlap.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>There are several international, major trade reporting initiatives at the FSB and IOSCO, among others, to improve trade reporting for market oversight and improve data sharing and systemic risk analysis consistent with this GMAC recommendation. The CFTC is actively participating in these ongoing initiatives.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/10326/GMAC_T+1_Resources_030624/download"><i>TIS Recommendation 5 - Publication of Resource Document to Support Transition to T+1 Securities Settlement</i></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>As the United States prepares to transition to next-day trade settlement (T+1) for securities in May 2024, the Subcommittee crafted a resource document to support market participants. The document details products covered by the transition to T+1, timelines for transition in various markets, and the benefits to the transition. The document also highlights the implications T+1 has for various markets &ndash; particularly foreign exchange markets, and discusses its impacts on transaction processes for various products, including cross-border impacts. Further, it provides a list of resources to help firms prepare for the transition.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>This GMAC recommendation helped to prepare the U.S. securities markets, and other impacted asset classes and products, for a smooth T+1 securities settlement transition completed over the Memorial Day holiday weekend. It provided resources for aspects such as foreign exchange (FX) markets and cross-border transactions.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><i><span><span>Digital Asset Markets Subcommittee (DAMS)</span></span></i></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/10321/CFTC_GMAC_DAM_Classification_Approach_and_Taxonomy_for_Digital_Assets_030624/download"><i>DAMS Recommendation 1 - Adoption of an Approach for the Classification and Understanding of Digital Assets</i></a></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>A clear, consensus-driven approach to classifying assets and the functions they serve underpins robust markets and effective regulation. The evolving digital asset ecosystem has led many to develop proprietary taxonomies to classify digital assets and their related technology. In recognition of this progress, the Subcommittee has engaged digital asset stakeholders across the broader digital asset ecosystem to build a common approach for the classification and understanding of digital assets.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>This approach aims to set out consistent language for participants in the digital asset ecosystem to promote innovation, identify and address risk considerations, and enable effective regulatory understanding. With this objective in mind, the approach builds upon the considerable classification efforts of global prudential standard setters and regional authorities, including the Bank for International Settlements, the Financial Stability Board and others.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>The GMAC recommends this approach be considered an initial basis for a consensus-driven, functional taxonomy. However, as the digital asset ecosystem continues to evolve, so too will the terminology used to classify it. The Subcommittee will reassess any future developments to provide further recommendations to this approach, based on the guidance of its members. The Subcommittee seeks to support effective rules and regulations for digital assets, and recommends continued collaboration between industry, standard-setting bodies, and the regulatory community.</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The first-of-a-kind GMAC digital asset taxonomy&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span><span>framework provides valuable foundational guidelines to further advance the discussion and promote U.S. regulatory clarity, and was extensively vetted by stakeholders such as regulatory authorities, financial institutions, asset managers, market infrastructures, and service providers.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>New GMAC and Subcommittee Members</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>I also want to welcome a few new faces to the GMAC and our Subcommittees. We've added a few new experts to our ranks since we last met.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>On the GMAC, we&rsquo;ve added&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Chuck Mack, Head of Strategy for North American Markets at Nasdaq, and Derek Kleinbauer, President of Bloomberg SEF. On the Digital Asset Markets Subcommittee, we&rsquo;ve added Mo Shaikh, Co-Founder and CEO of Aptos Labs; Terrence Dempsey, Senior Vice President and Head of Product Strategy at Fidelity Digital Assets; Ian Grieves, Vice President for Product &amp; Strategy at Cboe</span></span></span><span><span>; and&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Chen Arad, Co-Founder &amp; Chief External Affairs Officer at Solidus Labs.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Welcome, and I look forward to your contributions to the GMAC.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Today&rsquo;s GMAC Meeting</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Today&rsquo;s meeting will continue to build on the significant progress we&rsquo;ve already made. We&rsquo;ll start with a presentation from the Global Market Structure Subcommittee on the impact the proposed U.S. implementation of Basel III endgame&rsquo;s bank capital requirements would have on end users who rely on cleared derivatives markets. Providing this timely presentation will be Kyle Glenn, Vice President for Government Relations at FIA, and Thane Twiggs, Chief Compliance Officer for Risk Management at Cargill.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>We&rsquo;ll then have a panel discussion on Swap Execution Facilities. Our esteemed panelists are:</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span><span>Thomas Pluta, President of Tradeweb;</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>Scott Fitzpatrick, CEO of Tradition SEF; and</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>Adam Lister, Interest Rate Swaps Electronic Trading Product Manager at Bloomberg</span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Tara Kruse will lead our Technical Issues Subcommittee&rsquo;s discussion on its proposed recommendation on Variation Margin Processes in Non-Centrally Cleared Markets. Tara is the Global Head of Infrastructure, Data, and Non-Cleared Margin at ISDA.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Following a brief break, we&rsquo;ll receive an update on global commodity markets from Derek Sammann, Senior Managing Director and Global Head of Commodities, Options &amp; International Markets at CME Group.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Finally, we&rsquo;ll receive a presentation on the CFTC&rsquo;s international engagement from Andrea Musalem, Associate Director of the Commission&rsquo;s Office of International Affairs. We&rsquo;ll close out today&rsquo;s meeting with updates from each of the Subcommittees on ongoing workstreams and future agenda items.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>I&rsquo;m very much looking forward to these timely presentations and the consideration of the latest round of recommendations. Once again, thanks to our speakers and all members for being here and making the GMAC such a success.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The GMAC and the CFTC&rsquo;s Mission</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Today highlights that the CFTC is first and foremost a market regulator, and I&rsquo;m pleased we&rsquo;re getting back to basics with very important presentations and discussion of market characteristics, trading activity, and market fundamentals driving both, as well as capital and margin requirements. I look forward to the insights that will be shared on ways to enhance liquidity in markets, which could be the basis for additional GMAC initiatives. This is the bread and butter of the CFTC&rsquo;s core mission to oversee derivatives markets and ensure they are well-functioning. This doesn&rsquo;t get the headlines, but it is absolutely our day job and I appreciate Chairman Behnam&rsquo;s focus on this. I especially thank the CFTC&rsquo;s Office of International Affairs for their presentation and international leadership. Thank you all.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<div> CDCC, SGC Notes, Canadian Dollar Offered Rate cessation, investment vehicle, money market instruments
<br />
Summary:<br />CDCC launches SGC Notes program to accommodate transition from CDOR and Bankers’ Acceptances, offer investment opportunities in Canadian money markets with strong investor protection. <div>
<p><span>The Canadian Derivatives Clearing Corporation (CDCC), Canada's national central clearing counterparty (CCP) for exchange-traded derivative products and repurchase agreements, today announced the launch of the new Secured General Collateral (SGC) Notes program.</span></p>
<p><span>SGC Notes are short-term discounted money market instruments developed by CDCC in collaboration with Canadian market participants and designed to meet the demand for the transition from Bankers&rsquo; Acceptances (BAs) as a result of the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR) cessation.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;​We are proud to bring this innovative​, customized ​​investment vehicle to market, designed to provide Canada's market participants with an effective funding solution and support the industry transition from CDOR and Bankers&rsquo; Acceptances,​"&nbsp;<strong>said George Kormas, President of CDCC</strong>.​ "​CDCC is grateful for the input of our valued stakeholders ​across Canada&rsquo;s money markets, including both sell and buy side participants​, in the launch of SGC Notes and we look forward to serving their needs as our markets continue to evolve into the future.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>SGC Notes provide an investment policy-friendly opportunity for Canadian money market institutional investors to roll their BA exposure into SGC Notes. SGC Notes are linked to the same highly-rated Canadian bank credit exposure as BAs, but are secured with a basket of high quality debt securities (SGC Securities) which are sold to a trust through repurchase agreements cleared through CDCC.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>SGC Notes represent an attractive investment option relative to available alternatives.</span></p>
<p><span>SGC Notes are designed to provide strong investor protection through active risk management by CDCC of the basket of SGC Securities securing the SGC Notes and to leverage TMX Group&rsquo;s infrastructure, including the recently announced&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.tmx.com%2Fnewsroom%2Fpress-releases%3Fid=1198/1/0102019002405f87-43999f98-e6ce-40fa-a3a9-d5090bd56623-000000/rvtVaflIpdY6crSZ4ofJY_MJ0o8=377" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>Canadian Collateral Management Service (CCMS)</span></a>, which allows for automated collateral movements.</span></p>
<p><span>For more information on the new SGC Notes, please visit&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.cdcc.ca%2Fen%2Fsgc-notes/1/0102019002405f87-43999f98-e6ce-40fa-a3a9-d5090bd56623-000000/0evjN4dvExAx65ubdu6vN8Dl25k=377" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>&nbsp;</span></a><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.cdcc.ca/en/sgc-notes" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.cdcc.ca/en/sgc-notes</a></span>&nbsp;to review the offering memorandum.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>SGC Notes will be issued by a special purpose vehicle formed as an Ontario trust (&ldquo;Trust&rdquo;), of which ComputerShare Trust Company of Canada is trustee and CDCC is promoter, administrative agent, custodian and paying agent.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The SGC Notes will be subscribed for by CIRO investment dealers and Canadian chartered banks that are eligible to clear repurchase transactions relating to SGC Securities through CDCC (the &ldquo;SGC Clearing Members&rdquo;). The SGC Clearing Members will purchase the SGC Notes, as principals, at a discount to face value and may offer the SGC Notes for sale to investors subject to prior sale, if, as and when issued by the Trust and accepted by the SGC Clearing Members on a private placement basis to investors which are &ldquo;accredited investors&rdquo; and &ldquo;permitted clients&rdquo; (other than individuals) as defined in securities legislation in reliance on exemptions from the prospectus requirements of applicable provincial securities laws. The resale of the SGC Notes will be restricted by applicable provincial securities laws.</span></p>
<p><span>The SGC Notes are obligations of the Trust and not obligations of or interests in CDCC, Computershare Trust Company of Canada, any member of the TMX Group, or any SGC Clearing Member. The SGC Notes will represent limited recourse obligations of the Trust. Only the SGC Securities (and other collateral listed in the offering memorandum describing the SBC Notes) will secure payment of the SGC Notes.</span></p>
<p><span>The SGC Notes have not been registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, or the &ldquo;U.S. Securities Act&rdquo; or under the securities laws of any state of the United States, and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to U.S. persons within the meaning of Regulation S under the U.S.&nbsp; Securities Act, or &ldquo;Regulation S&rdquo; unless the securities are registered under the U.S. Securities Act or an exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act is available.</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Trade surveillance, financial risk solutions, Validus platform, legacy providers, global expansion<br />
Summary:<br />
Eventus' Validus platform sees 25% client base increase, global expansion, high renewal rates, and multiple award wins for trade surveillance excellence. <div>
<p>Eventus, a leading provider of comprehensive, at-scale trade surveillance and financial risk solutions, announced that its Validus platform continues to capture business from firms seeking to move away from legacy trade surveillance providers, with a 25% increase in its client base over the past year. The announcement comes on the heels of another award win for excellence in trade surveillance, further global expansion with the signing of its first South African client &ndash; one of Africa&rsquo;s largest diversified financial groups &ndash; and a continued high renewal rate for existing clients globally. The company now has clients on six continents.</p>
<p>Eventus CEO Travis Schwab said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve never been in a better position as a company. Our retention rates remain close to 100%, we are growing across asset classes and geographies, our platform continues to perform at the highest levels with new functionality rolling out consistently, and we are profitable. We are especially excited about some new clients that include three tier-1 banks all now actively using Validus to meet a range of compliance and regulatory goals. Our existing clients are routinely adding more areas of coverage and our Eventus Services offering to their contracts too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Companies keep turning to us, particularly if they&rsquo;ve had experience with legacy providers, because our sole focus is our clients and the delivery of best-in-class trade surveillance and financial risk solutions, such as algo monitoring. In an extraordinarily competitive landscape, we have what I would argue is more markets and regulatory expertise and a more responsive approach than any provider in the market, along with the unique ability for clients to fully customize the platform and work with our team on solving compliance challenges they are facing in real time. Our experience as market practitioners give us the ability to partner with each and every client &ndash; whether they are a start-up exchange, global trading firm, broker/dealer or tier 1 bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eventus Global Head of Regulatory Affairs Joe Schifano said: &ldquo;For many years, those of us who built surveillance programs for our firms were frustrated with the lack of flexibility in legacy trade surveillance systems. But now, it is even more critical to keep pace with technology as regulators are no longer satisfied with compliance programs that just &lsquo;follow the pack.&rsquo; At Eventus, we offer a &rsquo;buy-to-build&rsquo; solution that clients can tailor and easily scale specific to their risk assessment and data requirements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eventus also announced that it was just named Best Trade Surveillance Solution at the TradingTech Insight USA Awards 2024, based on votes from market participants and the publication&rsquo;s global audience. In March, the company won the same category in the 2024 RegTech insight Awards APAC for its work in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
<p>Schwab said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re honored to see recognition of our hard work and results through votes by so many market participants selecting Validus as Best Trade Surveillance Solution, reflecting our focus on our clients, expert service and constant enhancements to the platform.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Enhancements to the Validus platform this year include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reports and visualizations to help clients ensure accurate and complete data coverage.</li>
<li>Introduction of a first-of-its-kind cross-product spoofing functionality to detect this type of market manipulation in real time for clients engaged in multiple asset classes. This includes a new visualization methodology to review activity across products and new technology that facilitates cross-product review across all accounts and all activity.</li>
<li>New large trader reporter functionality, built for a designated clearing organization (DCO) client and now available to all users.</li>
<li>Enhanced behavioral analytics, including changes in trader profiles identifying potential red flags for rogue trading and account takeovers.</li>
<li>Expanded market data coverage.</li>
<li>Testing of the firm&rsquo;s next-generation platform that enables performance speeds and scale commensurate with growth in the markets and client data requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A-Team Group&rsquo;s series of awards, including those from TradingTech Insight and RegTech Insight, recognize outstanding performance by the vendors of data and technology solutions to the financial industry. Eventus has now won six A-Team Group awards over the past five years, including two RegTech Insight Europe Awards. To date, the company and its Validus platform have earned more than 40 awards and honors in the past six years.</p>

<div> Partnership, Blue Carbon, Investments, Ocean Protection, Mangrove Conservation
<br />
XTCC, Lady Merle, and Logos Capital Group partner to create listed blue carbon investments supporting ocean protection and community benefits. Revolutionizing climate finance.
<br /><br />Summary:
XTCC, Lady Merle, and Logos Capital Group collaborate to create listed blue carbon investments, supporting ocean protection, community benefits, and revolutionizing climate finance. <div>
<ul>
<li><span>Collaboration with Lady Merle Liivand (the Eco Mermaid) and Logos Capital Group to generate liquidity in investments supporting vital ocean protection projects</span></li>
<li><span><em>Brings together the best thought leaders and deep expertise around Blue Carbon</em>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Stock market-listed blue carbon investments help bridge multi-trillion-dollar gap in climate finance</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>XTCC, the investment ecosystem specialising in high-integrity carbon based listed investments, celebrates World Ocean Day with the announcement of a partnership with Lady Merle, the Estonian swimming champion and ocean protection advocate acknowledged globally as the &lsquo;Eco Mermaid&rsquo;, and Silvio Pupo-Casco of Logos Capital Group, to scale</span></p>
<p><span>up investment opportunities and enable global access to this new asset class, providing support for projects including mangrove conservation and transparent fund distribution to adjacent communities.</span></p>
<p><span>Lady Merle and Silvio will work closely with XTCC to identify mangrove and other blue carbon projects that also directly benefit adjacent local communities. XTCC will mobilise Lady Merle&rsquo;s expertise in the science of blue carbon and Silvio&rsquo;s investment network and commitment to driving significant investment capital into more impactful asset classes in the creation of new Blue Carbon investments listed on global stock markets. XTCC creates a bridge between blue carbon projects and<br />the capital markets, enabling an asset class for the Beyond Net Zero world.</span><span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Blue carbon is carbon captured by the world's ocean and coastal ecosystems, including mangroves that can, through sequestration - taking carbon in - provide a natural way of reducing the impact of greenhouse gases on earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. Coastal systems such as mangroves sequester high amounts of carbon quickly and sustainably (over millions of years). In fact, mangroves are ten times more effective at sequestering carbon than any other type of forestry, with a multitude of associated benefits such as clean water, food security, and protection against extreme weather events.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Seth Elliot, XTCC CEO</span>&nbsp;said: &ldquo;To truly move beyond Net Zero, we must combat global warming via significant nature-based project investments in ocean protection. By introducing Blue Carbon based listed investments, we aim to stimulate interest and generate liquidity to support the funding of blue carbon projects, redefine trust in the carbon market, and stimulate climate investments crucial for saving the planet.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Lady Merle said:&nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;Our oceans are the lungs of the world, playing a crucial role in producing oxygen and absorbing carbon dioxide and waste. Thriving mangrove ecosystems not only sustain the natural world but also support and enrich the communities that live alongside. On the negative side, when these important coastal systems are damaged, they emit enormous amounts of carbon into the atmosphere, contributing to climate change. As such, it is essential to protect and conserve mangroves and other coastal habitats, for the benefit of the climate and as importantly, to protect the communities that depend on them to survive and thrive&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Silvio Pupo-Casco, Logos Capital Group said</strong>: "Investing in natural capital and purchasing high-integrity carbon credits can often be complex and opaque. Through our joint venture with XTCC, we aim to simplify and clarify this process, ensuring that investors know exactly what they are getting for their money. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies, we will restore trust in critical natural capital and ecosystem service investments, particularly in the realm of blue carbon." He continued, &ldquo;Our new blue carbon investment instrument is designed to exceed current market standards for transparency and reporting. By setting new benchmarks for accountability and integrity, we are committed to offering unparalleled clarity and reliability in the carbon credit markets. This next-generation investment vehicle is poised to revolutionize global capital markets, driving significant impact in blue finance."</span></p>

Summary:
- Hedge funds gained in May, led by Equity Hedge and Event-Driven strategies.
- Cryptocurrency and Risk Parity indexes surged.
- Performance dispersion declined in May.
- Equity Hedge funds, driven by Energy and Technology exposures, led gains.
- Interest rate-sensitive strategies also advanced, while Macro strategies posted mixed performance. <div>
<p>Hedge funds gained in May as equities recovered the prior month&rsquo;s decline, and as inflationary pressures remained elevated, but investors positioned for interest rate reductions in 2H24. Led by directional Equity Hedge and Event-Driven strategies, the HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index advanced +1.3 percent in May, with additional positive contributions from Relative Value Arbitrage strategies offsetting a decline in Macro strategies. The HFRI Equity Hedge (Total) Index jumped +2.5 percent for the month, reversing the April decline and marking the fifth gain for this index in the trailing seven months, posting its strongest monthly return since February.</p>
<p>The HFR Cryptocurrency Index surged +13.6 percent in May, while the HFR Risk Parity Vol 15 Index jumped +3.0 percent for the month.</p>
<p>Performance dispersion declined in May, as the top decile of the HFRI FWC constituents advanced by an average of +7.6 percent, while the bottom decile fell by an average of -4.1 percent, representing a top/bottom dispersion of 11.7 percent for the month. By comparison, the top/bottom performance dispersion in April was 14.3 percent. In the trailing 12 months ending May 2024, the top decile of FWC constituents gained +42.9 percent, while the bottom decile declined -7.3 percent, representing a top/bottom dispersion of 50.2 percent. Approximately 70 percent of hedge funds produced positive performance in May.</p>
<p>Equity Hedge (EH) funds, which invest long and short across specialized sub-strategies, led gains in May, driven by advances in Energy and Technology exposures. The HFRI Equity Hedge (Total) Index gained +2.5 percent (estimated) for the month, improving the YTD 2024 return to +6.1 percent. EH sub-strategy gains were led by the HFRI EH: Sector-Energy Index, which surged an estimated +3.6 percent, while the HFRI EH: Sector-Technology Index added +3.2 percent. Other strong contributors in May were the HFRI EH: Multi-Strategy Index and the HFRI EH: Fundamental Value Index, each of which advanced +3.1 percent for the month. Through the first five months of the year, the HFRI EH: Quantitative Directional Index leads EH sub-strategy performance with a YTD return of +8.6 percent.</p>
<p>Event-Driven (ED) strategies, which often focus on out-of-favor, deep value equity exposures and speculation on M&amp;A situations, also advanced in May, driven by Multi-Strategy and Distressed exposures. The HFRI Event-Driven (Total) Index gained +1.6 percent for the month, led by the HFRI ED: Multi-Strategy Index, which jumped +2.35 percent, and the HFRI ED: Distressed Index, which added +1.7 percent for the month.</p>
<p>Fixed income-based, interest rate-sensitive strategies also advanced in May as investors positioned for interest rate cuts in 2H24 despite persistent inflation. The HFRI Relative Value (Total) Index added an estimated +0.6 percent for the month, increasing its YTD 2024 return to +3.3 percent. RVA performance was led by the HFRI RV: Asset Backed Index and HFRI RV: Convertible Arbitrage Index, each of which advanced +0.9 percent for the month.</p>
<p>Macro strategies posted mixed performance in May as interest rates and financial market volatility fell, and as investors positioned for interest rate cuts in 2H24. The HFRI Macro (Total) Index fell -0.65 percent in May, the<sup>&nbsp;</sup>first monthly decline since November 2023. Losses were driven by the HFRI Macro: Systematic Diversified Index, which declined -1.3 percent for the month but remains the leading area of sub-strategy performance over the first five months of the year, with a YTD return of +9.15 percent. Partially offsetting the May declines, the HFRI Macro: Active Trading Index jumped +2.7 percent for the month, bringing its YTD performance to +6.3 percent.</p>
<p>Liquid Alternative UCITS strategies posted gains in May, as the HFRX Global Index advanced +0.6 percent for the month, led by the HFRX Equity Hedge Index, which advanced +1.25 percent, and the HFRX Relative Value Index, which added +0.7 percent. The HFRX Market Directional Index also advanced in May, adding +1.7 percent for the month.</p>
<p>The HFRI Diversity Index advanced an estimated +1.8 percent in May, while the HFRI Women Index gained +1.9 percent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hedge funds posted strong gains in May, reversing April declines, with leadership from directional equity and credit strategies, as investors positioned for continued inflation, ECB and US Federal Reserve rate cuts, and an improving economic growth in 2H24. Uncorrelated Macro hedge funds, the leading strategy area of performance over the first four months of the year, posted its first monthly decline since November as financial market volatility fell in May,&rdquo; stated Kenneth J. Heinz, President of HFR. &ldquo;The primary risks for hedge funds and hedge fund positioning accelerated the shift from macroeconomic risks to geopolitical risks, with these comprising not only ongoing, active military conflicts but also potential for additional conflicts and risks associated with policy changes as a result of major political elections in the coming months. Hedge funds have effectively positioned portfolios in a tactical sense for these highly fluid and uncertain situations, including not only military threats, but possibilities for supply chain disruptions, outright trade embargoes or halts, and destabilizing dislocations and volatility associated with banking and broader financial market operation. Institutions interested in access to opportunities which may be created by this volatility, as well as portfolio protection from these risks, are likely to increase exposure to hedge funds which have demonstrated their strategy&rsquo;s robustness of navigating these building and evolving risks over recent months and years.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>NOTE: May 2024 index performance figures are estimated as of June 7, 2024</i></p>

<title>SEC Charges Three New Yorkers For Raising More Than $184 Million Through Pre-IPO Fraud Schemes - After Commission Shut Down Original Ploy, Defendants Started Another One</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-charges-three-new-yorkers-for-raising-more-than-184-million-through-pre-ipo/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-charges-three-new-yorkers-for-raising-more-than-184-million-through-pre-ipo/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> charged, fraud, unregistered, pre-IPO, SEC
Summary:
SEC charged individuals with fraud for selling unregistered pre-IPO shares, involving high-pressure sales tactics and undisclosed markups. U.S. Attorney's Office also filed charges. Ongoing investigation in the pre-IPO space. SEC prioritizes enforcement in the pre-IPO space, filing charges in various cases. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged three individuals with fraud for selling unregistered membership interests in LLCs that purported to invest in shares of pre-IPO companies, first on behalf of StraightPath Venture Partners LLC, the subject of the Commission&rsquo;s emergency&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-83">action</a>&nbsp;in May 2022, and, later, on behalf of Legend Venture Partners LLC, the subject of the Commission&rsquo;s emergency&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-119">action</a>&nbsp;in June 2023. Both&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr-25429">StraightPath</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr-25772">Legend</a>&nbsp;are now under court-ordered receiverships.</p>
<p>In this new action, the SEC alleges that New York residents Mario Gogliormella, Steven Lacaj, and Karim Ibrahim directed an unregistered sales force of more than 50 callers in boiler rooms to pressure investors into making investments without telling them that the shares had been substantially marked up&mdash;between approximately 19 and 105 percent on average above the prices that StraightPath or Legend had paid for the underlying shares. As a result of these tactics, the defendants and their sales force allegedly pocketed more than $45 million in fees from unsuspecting investors from 2019 to 2022.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We allege that the fraud in this case is like a Hollywood movie where the defendants ran boiler rooms using scripts they referred to as the &lsquo;Bible,&rsquo; engaged in high-pressure sales tactics, and employed outright falsehoods to defraud investors,&rdquo; said Sheldon L. Pollock, Associate Director of the New York Regional Office. &ldquo;After the SEC shut them down the first time, they simply rebranded their outfit, and today through our action we are seeking to ensure that they are held accountable for enticing and lying to investors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint charges the defendants with violating antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws. The complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, return of allegedly ill-gotten gains, and civil penalties. The SEC also charged Adam Ibrahim, Karim Ibrahim&rsquo;s brother, as a relief defendant.</p>
<p>The U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Southern District of New York today unsealed an indictment charging Gogliormella, Lacaj, and Karim Ibrahim with securities fraud, among other offenses, in connection with their work for StraightPath and Legend.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s ongoing investigation is being conducted by Joshua D. Tannen and Lee A. Greenwood of the Asset Management Unit and Sushila P. Rao, Suzanne M. Bettis, Megan Genet, Tiantong Wen, Douglas Smith, Kerri L. Palen, Patricia Schrage, Daniel Loss, Alistaire Bambach, and Steven G. Rawlings of the New York Regional Office. It is being supervised by Mr. Pollock. The litigation will be led by Ms. Rao, Mr. Tannen, and Ms. Bettis and supervised by Mr. Loss and Mr. Pollock.</p>
<p>The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Southern District of New York and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service.</p>

<p>The pre-IPO space remains a priority area for the Division of Enforcement and the New York Regional Office. In addition to the prior StraightPath and Legend actions, the New York Regional Office has also filed other charges in other matters, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>In December 2023, the Commission&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-245#:~:text=The%20Securities%20and%20Exchange%20Commission,and%20JL%20Rivera%20Enterprises%20Ltd.">charged</a>&nbsp;five individuals and four companies in a $528 million pre-IPO fraud.</li>
<li>In March 2023, the SEC&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-61">charged</a>&nbsp;three StraightPath sales agents with fraud and unregistered broker activity.</li>
<li>In December 2020, the SEC&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr-24972">charged</a>&nbsp;a boiler room operator with defrauding retail investors in the sale of pre-IPO shares.</li>

<p>The EACH General Assembly also agreed on the EACH Strategy for the 2024-2026 period. EACH will enhance its role as both the proactive voice of CCPs in Europe in front of public authorities and private stakeholders as well as acting as a dynamic forum to develop the CCP clearing industry through the agreed strategic priorities. The EACH community will continue to focus on fostering robust and efficient capital markets for companies to grow and investors to manage their risks.</p>
<p>The EACH Co-Chairs&nbsp;Julien Jardelot, Niels Brab and Tim Grange said: &lsquo;We are delighted to the trust European CCP and clearing houses are putting in us by renewing our mandate to represent the EACH community. We aim to increase the understating of how CCPs contribute to robust and more efficient capital markets for the benefit of businesses, investors and the economy as a whole. We welcome the efforts of different European jurisdictions to further diversify funding opportunities by strengthening capital markets and believe CCPs and clearing houses have a key role to play in supporting these efforts&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The EACH Secretary General Rafael Plata said: &lsquo;The next two years are likely crucial to plant the seeds of a new era of capital markets in Europe. Companies, investors and pensioners amongst other are likely to benefit from it. I look forward to continuing working with the capital markets ecosystem to make the dream of deeper and strong capital markets in Europe come true&rsquo;.</p>

<title>A New Class Of Trailblazers, Federal Reserve Governor Lisa D. Cook, At The Girls Global Academy 2024 Commencement Ceremony, Washington, D.C.</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Dr. O'Neal. It is an honor to be here to celebrate with you&mdash;the Girls Global Academy's first-ever graduating class. This is a momentous achievement and occasion. You are making history today! But, of course, you could not have done it alone. So let me start by acknowledging the teachers; administrators, staff, and board members of the Girls Global Academy; and the parents, grandparents, siblings, mentors, and friends who made today possible. Thank you and congratulations on a job well done.</p>
<p>And a very special congratulations to the Girls Global Academy Class of 2024! Soon you will embark on new journeys. I understand that many of you are going on to college in the fall, including one of you heading to my alma mater, Spelman College. (Be sure not to miss the 144th Founders Day celebration next year and the annual Spelman-Morehouse Christmas Carol concert in historic Sisters Chapel.) Others are off to start careers or to pursue vocational training. One of you will enter public service directly and become a member of the U.S. Air Force. That is a lot to be proud of and excited about. Whatever path you take next, I know the education and experience you gained here will guide you.</p>
<p>The Class of 2024 stands out. This is not only because you are the first, but also because you achieved so much all while overcoming extremely challenging circumstances by starting high school during the pandemic. Like you, I know what it is like to be the first to take a path, a path that was not always smooth and predictable. I will tell you more about that shortly.</p>
<p>Four years ago, all of you could have taken a more well-marked route. Instead, you had the courage to enroll at a brand new school during a global pandemic. You learned virtually during your first year. When you were able to attend your school in person for the first time, you did so with masks on, while social distancing. Forging new friendships is always challenging. It is even harder when you cannot sit next to a new classmate at the lunch table. But I know you worked hard to move your learning and your friendships beyond the screens and into real life. Now that those bonds have formed, I hope you hold on to them for many years to come, as I did with my classmates at a women's college.</p>
<p>As the inaugural class of the Girls Global Academy, your list of firsts is long and impressive. You formed the academy's first ever student government. You started a debate team and created cooking and DJ clubs, to name a few. You took the court and field as the first volleyball, basketball, softball, track, and cross-country teams. (I would have gone out for the softball and track teams. I was a catcher on my softball team in junior high and shot put was my event on the track team in high school.)</p>
<p>Everything was new, and probably a bit scary. Yet, you learned to become outspoken, you took on leadership roles, and you set an example for younger students. Through it all you grew, and you became the remarkable young women you are today.</p>
<p>With all those firsts, I was told that you sometimes call yourselves "the guinea pigs." I get that. However, I would like to offer a different moniker for this group: trailblazers. You bravely went where no one had gone before, and you accomplished great things through difficult challenges. To honor that, I want to tell you about a favorite trailblazer of mine and a girl who looked up to her.</p>
<p>The trailblazer I am thinking of is Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander. A little more than a century ago, she graduated from high school here in Washington, D.C., less than a mile away from your school. It was then called M Street High School. She went on to earn bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Pennsylvania. During her doctoral studies, she undertook research on the living standards of Black families that were migrating to Philadelphia during World War I. After completing that work, she became the second African American woman ever to earn a PhD and the first African American to earn a PhD in economics.</p>
<p>But in the 1920s, Dr. Alexander was actively denied entry into the economics profession on the basis of her race and sex. Some might have been crushed and deterred by the impediment. Not Dr. Alexander. Instead, she went on to blaze another trail. She became the first African American woman to earn a law degree from the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Alexander was also the first African American woman to pass the bar and practice law in the state of Pennsylvania. She continued to think and write about economic issues in her legal work and public service. She went on to be a top attorney for the city of Philadelphia and served the public in many other ways, including being asked by two U.S. presidents to serve on important committees.</p>
<p>Dr. Alexander was also the first national president of Delta Sigma Theta, a public service sorority. My mother helped to start a Delta Sigma Theta chapter at Georgia College and State University. That is how I first learned about Dr. Alexander. In fact, when I was in seventh grade, I entered my county social science fair with a project inspired by her work: identifying the major causes of unemployment among Black Americans. I did not realize it then, but that turned out to be my first foray into economic research, which became the cornerstone of my career.</p>
<p>It was helpful to have trailblazers to look up to, including Dr. Alexander, but also my aunts, uncles, parents, and other relatives and family friends who played important roles in the Civil Rights Movement. They instilled in me the confidence to blaze trails of my own. I was among the first African American students to desegregate one of the schools I attended in my hometown of Milledgeville, Georgia. Although some of the students and others in the community did not welcome us, I drew strength from the example set by my family and others in the Civil Rights Movement, and from their conviction in the hope and promise of a world that could and would continually improve.</p>
<p>While I had an interest in economics even before I entered high school, that profession was not the first path I choose. I started Spelman as a physics and philosophy major. It was not until after my undergraduate years, when I was literally on a trail&mdash;one climbing Mount Kilimanjaro&mdash;that I discovered economics was the path for me. I was hiking alongside a British economist. By the end of that journey, he had convinced me that studying economics would provide me the tools to address some big and important questions I had pondered for a long time&mdash;as far back as when Dr. Alexander inspired my submission to the county social science fair.</p>
<p>Following in her footsteps, I went on to earn my PhD in economics from the University of California, Berkeley. The path of an economist led me many places, including to Moscow to research banking in pre- and post-Soviet Russia and to the White House as an economist for President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers. In 2022, President Biden nominated me to serve on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. I am proud to say that I am the first African American woman and first woman of color to serve on the Board of Governors, a body that makes decisions affecting the entire economy and the well-being of every American.</p>
<p>I hope that my story, and Dr. Alexander's story, might inspire you to see that even when you encounter roadblocks, you can chart your own path and achieve great things. I know you can do that, because you established a strong foundation here at the Girls Global Academy, starting with the four pillars of sisterhood, scholarship, service, and safety.</p>
<p>I can see you have the spirit of sisterhood today as you celebrate all your achievements. You established a sisterhood as the first Girls Global Academy alumnae, and you also joined a broader sisterhood of strong, courageous, trailblazing women. You are scholars, earning your diploma and going on to college and onto various career paths. You worked in service to your community by each completing at least 50 service hours. The scholarship and service pillars show that you are already like Dr. Alexander, who highly valued education and used her education to improve the world. And you certainly learned the importance of safety as you started high school in the pandemic&mdash;and the importance of creating a safe environment of belonging where you can learn, be challenged, and grow, while comfortably being yourself. Holding these four pillars close will serve you well as you take the next step in your journeys.</p>
<p>As I conclude, I would like to thank you for allowing me to add another first&mdash;the first Girls Global Academy commencement speaker. I am deeply humbled by this honor. Once again, congratulations to the very first Girls Global Academy graduating class&mdash;the Class of 2024! We are all so proud of you and cannot wait to see what you will do.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Nigerian Exchange (NGX) Limited has urged investors to leverage on its new USSD platform for enhanced capital market access.</p>
<p>NGX stated this at its Investor Education Series, partnered with Meristem via a zoom meeting held on Thursday, June 6, 2024 with the theme, &lsquo;Unlocking Potential: Leveraging USSD For Enhanced Capital Market Access&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Speaking at the event, Head, Trading &amp; Products of NGX, Abimbola Babalola stated that the NGX USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) platform is a technology that allows mobile phone users to access a variety of services by dialing a short code (*5474#) on their phone keypad, saying that the NGX USSD platform is a new and innovative way for investors to access real-time stock market information and connect with a stockbroker.</p>
<p>According to him, the product is designed to boost financial inclusion and market participation in Nigeria by providing investors easy access to price information of listed companies and connecting them with Trading License Holders.</p>
<p>He further said that &ldquo;what we are doing at the exchange is to put investors at the driver&rsquo;s seat of their investment. Gone are those days when you buy securities and you go to sleep, or you have to start reading the newspaper or wait for news to know what is happening to the stocks. So, this time around, you have a device that you can use to monitor your stock at any time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Babalola added that investors' education is key, and this is what the products will address.</p>
<p>The Head, Investment Advisory at Meristem Stockbrokers Limited, Temitope Oludimu said that Meristem Securities has been in the industry for over two decades, growing her clients&rsquo; wealth and enhancing their financial wellbeing.</p>
<p>She noted that the Stockbrokers subsidiary of the Group provides easy access to online brokerage accounts allowing clients to monitor trades in real-time via MeriTrade and the first online stock trading platform in Nigeria commenced in 2014.</p>
<p>Oludimu added that &ldquo;MeriTrade allows users to buy and sell stocks online through the Nigerian Stock Exchange from the comfort of their home, office, car and even on the go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The platform defines stock broking in an entirely different language and creates a world class experience, bringing your broker (electronically) to the comfort of your home and office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The panel session speaking on the theme for the event emphasized the importance of investors' education in the capital market.</p>
<p>Afeez Ramoni, Head, Data and Digital Innovation, NGX stated that the public can now conveniently receive market information and commence account opening processes through their mobile phones by dialing *5474#. This marks a significant stride in NGX&rsquo;s commitment to democratizing access to investment opportunities and promoting retail investors participation through digital channels for accessing the capital market.</p>
<p>He anticipates that the USSD short code *5474# will enhance market accessibility and contribute significantly to the broader financial inclusion landscape in Nigeria.</p>
<p>Martha Ibrahim of NGX Group said that financial inclusion is really about inclusivity and creating access to financial services to investors.</p>
<p>She stated that this is really important for a vibrant capital market and also the country&rsquo;s economic development in general.</p>
<p>According to her, with the coming up of this initiative, integrating USSD with NGX, we also understand the importance of technology as a key financial enabler for financial inclusion. We are simplifying access to the stock markets and reducing barriers to entry. This would also promote a significant increase in the level of financial inclusion we have currently within the capital markets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By leveraging on this investor education and simplifying access to the markets, this validates that NGX is on the right step towards driving financial inclusion within the Nigerian capital markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Also, Oluwatobi Adesanya of Meristem added that &ldquo;we cannot overemphasize the need for financial literacy in the Nigerian capital market.&rdquo;</p>
