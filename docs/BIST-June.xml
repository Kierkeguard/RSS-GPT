<div> Partnership, Blue Carbon, Investments, Ocean Protection, Mangrove Conservation
<br />
XTCC, Lady Merle, and Logos Capital Group partner to create listed blue carbon investments supporting ocean protection and community benefits. Revolutionizing climate finance.
<br /><br />Summary:
XTCC, Lady Merle, and Logos Capital Group collaborate to create listed blue carbon investments, supporting ocean protection, community benefits, and revolutionizing climate finance. <div>
<ul>
<li><span>Collaboration with Lady Merle Liivand (the Eco Mermaid) and Logos Capital Group to generate liquidity in investments supporting vital ocean protection projects</span></li>
<li><span><em>Brings together the best thought leaders and deep expertise around Blue Carbon</em>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Stock market-listed blue carbon investments help bridge multi-trillion-dollar gap in climate finance</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>XTCC, the investment ecosystem specialising in high-integrity carbon based listed investments, celebrates World Ocean Day with the announcement of a partnership with Lady Merle, the Estonian swimming champion and ocean protection advocate acknowledged globally as the &lsquo;Eco Mermaid&rsquo;, and Silvio Pupo-Casco of Logos Capital Group, to scale</span></p>
<p><span>up investment opportunities and enable global access to this new asset class, providing support for projects including mangrove conservation and transparent fund distribution to adjacent communities.</span></p>
<p><span>Lady Merle and Silvio will work closely with XTCC to identify mangrove and other blue carbon projects that also directly benefit adjacent local communities. XTCC will mobilise Lady Merle&rsquo;s expertise in the science of blue carbon and Silvio&rsquo;s investment network and commitment to driving significant investment capital into more impactful asset classes in the creation of new Blue Carbon investments listed on global stock markets. XTCC creates a bridge between blue carbon projects and<br />the capital markets, enabling an asset class for the Beyond Net Zero world.</span><span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Blue carbon is carbon captured by the world's ocean and coastal ecosystems, including mangroves that can, through sequestration - taking carbon in - provide a natural way of reducing the impact of greenhouse gases on earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. Coastal systems such as mangroves sequester high amounts of carbon quickly and sustainably (over millions of years). In fact, mangroves are ten times more effective at sequestering carbon than any other type of forestry, with a multitude of associated benefits such as clean water, food security, and protection against extreme weather events.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Seth Elliot, XTCC CEO</span>&nbsp;said: &ldquo;To truly move beyond Net Zero, we must combat global warming via significant nature-based project investments in ocean protection. By introducing Blue Carbon based listed investments, we aim to stimulate interest and generate liquidity to support the funding of blue carbon projects, redefine trust in the carbon market, and stimulate climate investments crucial for saving the planet.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Lady Merle said:&nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;Our oceans are the lungs of the world, playing a crucial role in producing oxygen and absorbing carbon dioxide and waste. Thriving mangrove ecosystems not only sustain the natural world but also support and enrich the communities that live alongside. On the negative side, when these important coastal systems are damaged, they emit enormous amounts of carbon into the atmosphere, contributing to climate change. As such, it is essential to protect and conserve mangroves and other coastal habitats, for the benefit of the climate and as importantly, to protect the communities that depend on them to survive and thrive&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Silvio Pupo-Casco, Logos Capital Group said</strong>: "Investing in natural capital and purchasing high-integrity carbon credits can often be complex and opaque. Through our joint venture with XTCC, we aim to simplify and clarify this process, ensuring that investors know exactly what they are getting for their money. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies, we will restore trust in critical natural capital and ecosystem service investments, particularly in the realm of blue carbon." He continued, &ldquo;Our new blue carbon investment instrument is designed to exceed current market standards for transparency and reporting. By setting new benchmarks for accountability and integrity, we are committed to offering unparalleled clarity and reliability in the carbon credit markets. This next-generation investment vehicle is poised to revolutionize global capital markets, driving significant impact in blue finance."</span></p>

<div> Equity Hedge, Event-Driven, Cryptocurrency, Risk Parity, Performance Dispersion
Summary:
- Hedge funds gained in May, led by Equity Hedge and Event-Driven strategies.
- Cryptocurrency and Risk Parity indexes surged.
- Performance dispersion declined in May.
- Equity Hedge funds, driven by Energy and Technology exposures, led gains.
- Interest rate-sensitive strategies also advanced, while Macro strategies posted mixed performance. <div>
<p>Hedge funds gained in May as equities recovered the prior month&rsquo;s decline, and as inflationary pressures remained elevated, but investors positioned for interest rate reductions in 2H24. Led by directional Equity Hedge and Event-Driven strategies, the HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index advanced +1.3 percent in May, with additional positive contributions from Relative Value Arbitrage strategies offsetting a decline in Macro strategies. The HFRI Equity Hedge (Total) Index jumped +2.5 percent for the month, reversing the April decline and marking the fifth gain for this index in the trailing seven months, posting its strongest monthly return since February.</p>
<p>The HFR Cryptocurrency Index surged +13.6 percent in May, while the HFR Risk Parity Vol 15 Index jumped +3.0 percent for the month.</p>
<p>Performance dispersion declined in May, as the top decile of the HFRI FWC constituents advanced by an average of +7.6 percent, while the bottom decile fell by an average of -4.1 percent, representing a top/bottom dispersion of 11.7 percent for the month. By comparison, the top/bottom performance dispersion in April was 14.3 percent. In the trailing 12 months ending May 2024, the top decile of FWC constituents gained +42.9 percent, while the bottom decile declined -7.3 percent, representing a top/bottom dispersion of 50.2 percent. Approximately 70 percent of hedge funds produced positive performance in May.</p>
<p>Equity Hedge (EH) funds, which invest long and short across specialized sub-strategies, led gains in May, driven by advances in Energy and Technology exposures. The HFRI Equity Hedge (Total) Index gained +2.5 percent (estimated) for the month, improving the YTD 2024 return to +6.1 percent. EH sub-strategy gains were led by the HFRI EH: Sector-Energy Index, which surged an estimated +3.6 percent, while the HFRI EH: Sector-Technology Index added +3.2 percent. Other strong contributors in May were the HFRI EH: Multi-Strategy Index and the HFRI EH: Fundamental Value Index, each of which advanced +3.1 percent for the month. Through the first five months of the year, the HFRI EH: Quantitative Directional Index leads EH sub-strategy performance with a YTD return of +8.6 percent.</p>
<p>Event-Driven (ED) strategies, which often focus on out-of-favor, deep value equity exposures and speculation on M&amp;A situations, also advanced in May, driven by Multi-Strategy and Distressed exposures. The HFRI Event-Driven (Total) Index gained +1.6 percent for the month, led by the HFRI ED: Multi-Strategy Index, which jumped +2.35 percent, and the HFRI ED: Distressed Index, which added +1.7 percent for the month.</p>
<p>Fixed income-based, interest rate-sensitive strategies also advanced in May as investors positioned for interest rate cuts in 2H24 despite persistent inflation. The HFRI Relative Value (Total) Index added an estimated +0.6 percent for the month, increasing its YTD 2024 return to +3.3 percent. RVA performance was led by the HFRI RV: Asset Backed Index and HFRI RV: Convertible Arbitrage Index, each of which advanced +0.9 percent for the month.</p>
<p>Macro strategies posted mixed performance in May as interest rates and financial market volatility fell, and as investors positioned for interest rate cuts in 2H24. The HFRI Macro (Total) Index fell -0.65 percent in May, the<sup>&nbsp;</sup>first monthly decline since November 2023. Losses were driven by the HFRI Macro: Systematic Diversified Index, which declined -1.3 percent for the month but remains the leading area of sub-strategy performance over the first five months of the year, with a YTD return of +9.15 percent. Partially offsetting the May declines, the HFRI Macro: Active Trading Index jumped +2.7 percent for the month, bringing its YTD performance to +6.3 percent.</p>
<p>Liquid Alternative UCITS strategies posted gains in May, as the HFRX Global Index advanced +0.6 percent for the month, led by the HFRX Equity Hedge Index, which advanced +1.25 percent, and the HFRX Relative Value Index, which added +0.7 percent. The HFRX Market Directional Index also advanced in May, adding +1.7 percent for the month.</p>
<p>The HFRI Diversity Index advanced an estimated +1.8 percent in May, while the HFRI Women Index gained +1.9 percent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hedge funds posted strong gains in May, reversing April declines, with leadership from directional equity and credit strategies, as investors positioned for continued inflation, ECB and US Federal Reserve rate cuts, and an improving economic growth in 2H24. Uncorrelated Macro hedge funds, the leading strategy area of performance over the first four months of the year, posted its first monthly decline since November as financial market volatility fell in May,&rdquo; stated Kenneth J. Heinz, President of HFR. &ldquo;The primary risks for hedge funds and hedge fund positioning accelerated the shift from macroeconomic risks to geopolitical risks, with these comprising not only ongoing, active military conflicts but also potential for additional conflicts and risks associated with policy changes as a result of major political elections in the coming months. Hedge funds have effectively positioned portfolios in a tactical sense for these highly fluid and uncertain situations, including not only military threats, but possibilities for supply chain disruptions, outright trade embargoes or halts, and destabilizing dislocations and volatility associated with banking and broader financial market operation. Institutions interested in access to opportunities which may be created by this volatility, as well as portfolio protection from these risks, are likely to increase exposure to hedge funds which have demonstrated their strategy&rsquo;s robustness of navigating these building and evolving risks over recent months and years.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>NOTE: May 2024 index performance figures are estimated as of June 7, 2024</i></p>

<title>SEC Charges Three New Yorkers For Raising More Than $184 Million Through Pre-IPO Fraud Schemes - After Commission Shut Down Original Ploy, Defendants Started Another One</title>

<div> charged, fraud, unregistered, pre-IPO, SEC
Summary:
SEC charged individuals with fraud for selling unregistered pre-IPO shares, involving high-pressure sales tactics and undisclosed markups. U.S. Attorney's Office also filed charges. Ongoing investigation in the pre-IPO space. SEC prioritizes enforcement in the pre-IPO space, filing charges in various cases. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged three individuals with fraud for selling unregistered membership interests in LLCs that purported to invest in shares of pre-IPO companies, first on behalf of StraightPath Venture Partners LLC, the subject of the Commission&rsquo;s emergency&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-83">action</a>&nbsp;in May 2022, and, later, on behalf of Legend Venture Partners LLC, the subject of the Commission&rsquo;s emergency&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-119">action</a>&nbsp;in June 2023. Both&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr-25429">StraightPath</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr-25772">Legend</a>&nbsp;are now under court-ordered receiverships.</p>
<p>In this new action, the SEC alleges that New York residents Mario Gogliormella, Steven Lacaj, and Karim Ibrahim directed an unregistered sales force of more than 50 callers in boiler rooms to pressure investors into making investments without telling them that the shares had been substantially marked up&mdash;between approximately 19 and 105 percent on average above the prices that StraightPath or Legend had paid for the underlying shares. As a result of these tactics, the defendants and their sales force allegedly pocketed more than $45 million in fees from unsuspecting investors from 2019 to 2022.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We allege that the fraud in this case is like a Hollywood movie where the defendants ran boiler rooms using scripts they referred to as the &lsquo;Bible,&rsquo; engaged in high-pressure sales tactics, and employed outright falsehoods to defraud investors,&rdquo; said Sheldon L. Pollock, Associate Director of the New York Regional Office. &ldquo;After the SEC shut them down the first time, they simply rebranded their outfit, and today through our action we are seeking to ensure that they are held accountable for enticing and lying to investors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint charges the defendants with violating antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws. The complaint seeks permanent injunctive relief, return of allegedly ill-gotten gains, and civil penalties. The SEC also charged Adam Ibrahim, Karim Ibrahim&rsquo;s brother, as a relief defendant.</p>
<p>The U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Southern District of New York today unsealed an indictment charging Gogliormella, Lacaj, and Karim Ibrahim with securities fraud, among other offenses, in connection with their work for StraightPath and Legend.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s ongoing investigation is being conducted by Joshua D. Tannen and Lee A. Greenwood of the Asset Management Unit and Sushila P. Rao, Suzanne M. Bettis, Megan Genet, Tiantong Wen, Douglas Smith, Kerri L. Palen, Patricia Schrage, Daniel Loss, Alistaire Bambach, and Steven G. Rawlings of the New York Regional Office. It is being supervised by Mr. Pollock. The litigation will be led by Ms. Rao, Mr. Tannen, and Ms. Bettis and supervised by Mr. Loss and Mr. Pollock.</p>
<p>The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Southern District of New York and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service.</p>

<p>The EACH Co-Chairs&nbsp;Julien Jardelot, Niels Brab and Tim Grange said: &lsquo;We are delighted to the trust European CCP and clearing houses are putting in us by renewing our mandate to represent the EACH community. We aim to increase the understating of how CCPs contribute to robust and more efficient capital markets for the benefit of businesses, investors and the economy as a whole. We welcome the efforts of different European jurisdictions to further diversify funding opportunities by strengthening capital markets and believe CCPs and clearing houses have a key role to play in supporting these efforts&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The EACH Secretary General Rafael Plata said: &lsquo;The next two years are likely crucial to plant the seeds of a new era of capital markets in Europe. Companies, investors and pensioners amongst other are likely to benefit from it. I look forward to continuing working with the capital markets ecosystem to make the dream of deeper and strong capital markets in Europe come true&rsquo;.</p>

<title>A New Class Of Trailblazers, Federal Reserve Governor Lisa D. Cook, At The Girls Global Academy 2024 Commencement Ceremony, Washington, D.C.</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/a-new-class-of-trailblazers-federal-reserve-governor-lisa-d-cook-at-the-girls/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/a-new-class-of-trailblazers-federal-reserve-governor-lisa-d-cook-at-the-girls/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Dr. O'Neal. It is an honor to be here to celebrate with you&mdash;the Girls Global Academy's first-ever graduating class. This is a momentous achievement and occasion. You are making history today! But, of course, you could not have done it alone. So let me start by acknowledging the teachers; administrators, staff, and board members of the Girls Global Academy; and the parents, grandparents, siblings, mentors, and friends who made today possible. Thank you and congratulations on a job well done.</p>
<p>And a very special congratulations to the Girls Global Academy Class of 2024! Soon you will embark on new journeys. I understand that many of you are going on to college in the fall, including one of you heading to my alma mater, Spelman College. (Be sure not to miss the 144th Founders Day celebration next year and the annual Spelman-Morehouse Christmas Carol concert in historic Sisters Chapel.) Others are off to start careers or to pursue vocational training. One of you will enter public service directly and become a member of the U.S. Air Force. That is a lot to be proud of and excited about. Whatever path you take next, I know the education and experience you gained here will guide you.</p>
<p>The Class of 2024 stands out. This is not only because you are the first, but also because you achieved so much all while overcoming extremely challenging circumstances by starting high school during the pandemic. Like you, I know what it is like to be the first to take a path, a path that was not always smooth and predictable. I will tell you more about that shortly.</p>
<p>Four years ago, all of you could have taken a more well-marked route. Instead, you had the courage to enroll at a brand new school during a global pandemic. You learned virtually during your first year. When you were able to attend your school in person for the first time, you did so with masks on, while social distancing. Forging new friendships is always challenging. It is even harder when you cannot sit next to a new classmate at the lunch table. But I know you worked hard to move your learning and your friendships beyond the screens and into real life. Now that those bonds have formed, I hope you hold on to them for many years to come, as I did with my classmates at a women's college.</p>
<p>As the inaugural class of the Girls Global Academy, your list of firsts is long and impressive. You formed the academy's first ever student government. You started a debate team and created cooking and DJ clubs, to name a few. You took the court and field as the first volleyball, basketball, softball, track, and cross-country teams. (I would have gone out for the softball and track teams. I was a catcher on my softball team in junior high and shot put was my event on the track team in high school.)</p>
<p>Everything was new, and probably a bit scary. Yet, you learned to become outspoken, you took on leadership roles, and you set an example for younger students. Through it all you grew, and you became the remarkable young women you are today.</p>
<p>With all those firsts, I was told that you sometimes call yourselves "the guinea pigs." I get that. However, I would like to offer a different moniker for this group: trailblazers. You bravely went where no one had gone before, and you accomplished great things through difficult challenges. To honor that, I want to tell you about a favorite trailblazer of mine and a girl who looked up to her.</p>
<p>The trailblazer I am thinking of is Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander. A little more than a century ago, she graduated from high school here in Washington, D.C., less than a mile away from your school. It was then called M Street High School. She went on to earn bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Pennsylvania. During her doctoral studies, she undertook research on the living standards of Black families that were migrating to Philadelphia during World War I. After completing that work, she became the second African American woman ever to earn a PhD and the first African American to earn a PhD in economics.</p>
<p>But in the 1920s, Dr. Alexander was actively denied entry into the economics profession on the basis of her race and sex. Some might have been crushed and deterred by the impediment. Not Dr. Alexander. Instead, she went on to blaze another trail. She became the first African American woman to earn a law degree from the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Alexander was also the first African American woman to pass the bar and practice law in the state of Pennsylvania. She continued to think and write about economic issues in her legal work and public service. She went on to be a top attorney for the city of Philadelphia and served the public in many other ways, including being asked by two U.S. presidents to serve on important committees.</p>
<p>Dr. Alexander was also the first national president of Delta Sigma Theta, a public service sorority. My mother helped to start a Delta Sigma Theta chapter at Georgia College and State University. That is how I first learned about Dr. Alexander. In fact, when I was in seventh grade, I entered my county social science fair with a project inspired by her work: identifying the major causes of unemployment among Black Americans. I did not realize it then, but that turned out to be my first foray into economic research, which became the cornerstone of my career.</p>
<p>It was helpful to have trailblazers to look up to, including Dr. Alexander, but also my aunts, uncles, parents, and other relatives and family friends who played important roles in the Civil Rights Movement. They instilled in me the confidence to blaze trails of my own. I was among the first African American students to desegregate one of the schools I attended in my hometown of Milledgeville, Georgia. Although some of the students and others in the community did not welcome us, I drew strength from the example set by my family and others in the Civil Rights Movement, and from their conviction in the hope and promise of a world that could and would continually improve.</p>
<p>While I had an interest in economics even before I entered high school, that profession was not the first path I choose. I started Spelman as a physics and philosophy major. It was not until after my undergraduate years, when I was literally on a trail&mdash;one climbing Mount Kilimanjaro&mdash;that I discovered economics was the path for me. I was hiking alongside a British economist. By the end of that journey, he had convinced me that studying economics would provide me the tools to address some big and important questions I had pondered for a long time&mdash;as far back as when Dr. Alexander inspired my submission to the county social science fair.</p>
<p>Following in her footsteps, I went on to earn my PhD in economics from the University of California, Berkeley. The path of an economist led me many places, including to Moscow to research banking in pre- and post-Soviet Russia and to the White House as an economist for President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers. In 2022, President Biden nominated me to serve on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. I am proud to say that I am the first African American woman and first woman of color to serve on the Board of Governors, a body that makes decisions affecting the entire economy and the well-being of every American.</p>
<p>I hope that my story, and Dr. Alexander's story, might inspire you to see that even when you encounter roadblocks, you can chart your own path and achieve great things. I know you can do that, because you established a strong foundation here at the Girls Global Academy, starting with the four pillars of sisterhood, scholarship, service, and safety.</p>
<p>I can see you have the spirit of sisterhood today as you celebrate all your achievements. You established a sisterhood as the first Girls Global Academy alumnae, and you also joined a broader sisterhood of strong, courageous, trailblazing women. You are scholars, earning your diploma and going on to college and onto various career paths. You worked in service to your community by each completing at least 50 service hours. The scholarship and service pillars show that you are already like Dr. Alexander, who highly valued education and used her education to improve the world. And you certainly learned the importance of safety as you started high school in the pandemic&mdash;and the importance of creating a safe environment of belonging where you can learn, be challenged, and grow, while comfortably being yourself. Holding these four pillars close will serve you well as you take the next step in your journeys.</p>
<p>As I conclude, I would like to thank you for allowing me to add another first&mdash;the first Girls Global Academy commencement speaker. I am deeply humbled by this honor. Once again, congratulations to the very first Girls Global Academy graduating class&mdash;the Class of 2024! We are all so proud of you and cannot wait to see what you will do.</p>

<title>NGX Launches New USSD To Enhance Capital Market Access</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ngx-launches-new-ussd-to-enhance-capital-market-access/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ngx-launches-new-ussd-to-enhance-capital-market-access/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Nigerian Exchange (NGX) Limited has urged investors to leverage on its new USSD platform for enhanced capital market access.</p>
<p>NGX stated this at its Investor Education Series, partnered with Meristem via a zoom meeting held on Thursday, June 6, 2024 with the theme, &lsquo;Unlocking Potential: Leveraging USSD For Enhanced Capital Market Access&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Speaking at the event, Head, Trading &amp; Products of NGX, Abimbola Babalola stated that the NGX USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) platform is a technology that allows mobile phone users to access a variety of services by dialing a short code (*5474#) on their phone keypad, saying that the NGX USSD platform is a new and innovative way for investors to access real-time stock market information and connect with a stockbroker.</p>
<p>According to him, the product is designed to boost financial inclusion and market participation in Nigeria by providing investors easy access to price information of listed companies and connecting them with Trading License Holders.</p>
<p>He further said that &ldquo;what we are doing at the exchange is to put investors at the driver&rsquo;s seat of their investment. Gone are those days when you buy securities and you go to sleep, or you have to start reading the newspaper or wait for news to know what is happening to the stocks. So, this time around, you have a device that you can use to monitor your stock at any time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Babalola added that investors' education is key, and this is what the products will address.</p>
<p>The Head, Investment Advisory at Meristem Stockbrokers Limited, Temitope Oludimu said that Meristem Securities has been in the industry for over two decades, growing her clients&rsquo; wealth and enhancing their financial wellbeing.</p>
<p>She noted that the Stockbrokers subsidiary of the Group provides easy access to online brokerage accounts allowing clients to monitor trades in real-time via MeriTrade and the first online stock trading platform in Nigeria commenced in 2014.</p>
<p>Oludimu added that &ldquo;MeriTrade allows users to buy and sell stocks online through the Nigerian Stock Exchange from the comfort of their home, office, car and even on the go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The platform defines stock broking in an entirely different language and creates a world class experience, bringing your broker (electronically) to the comfort of your home and office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The panel session speaking on the theme for the event emphasized the importance of investors' education in the capital market.</p>
<p>Afeez Ramoni, Head, Data and Digital Innovation, NGX stated that the public can now conveniently receive market information and commence account opening processes through their mobile phones by dialing *5474#. This marks a significant stride in NGX&rsquo;s commitment to democratizing access to investment opportunities and promoting retail investors participation through digital channels for accessing the capital market.</p>
<p>He anticipates that the USSD short code *5474# will enhance market accessibility and contribute significantly to the broader financial inclusion landscape in Nigeria.</p>
<p>Martha Ibrahim of NGX Group said that financial inclusion is really about inclusivity and creating access to financial services to investors.</p>
<p>She stated that this is really important for a vibrant capital market and also the country&rsquo;s economic development in general.</p>
<p>According to her, with the coming up of this initiative, integrating USSD with NGX, we also understand the importance of technology as a key financial enabler for financial inclusion. We are simplifying access to the stock markets and reducing barriers to entry. This would also promote a significant increase in the level of financial inclusion we have currently within the capital markets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By leveraging on this investor education and simplifying access to the markets, this validates that NGX is on the right step towards driving financial inclusion within the Nigerian capital markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Also, Oluwatobi Adesanya of Meristem added that &ldquo;we cannot overemphasize the need for financial literacy in the Nigerian capital market.&rdquo;</p>
