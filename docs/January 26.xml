<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>The California Public Employees&rsquo; Retirement System announced Monday that it has hired Shari Slate as its new Chief Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Officer.</p>
<p>Slate, a Sacramento area resident, has spent nearly two decades helping large companies work toward a purpose-driven culture that considers the needs and experiences of all employees, customers, and other stakeholders. Most recently, she served as Senior Vice President and Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer at CVS Health, whose businesses include not only CVS drugstores but also pharmacy benefits management and Aetna health insurance.</p>
<p>Prior to joining CVS, Slate was Chief Inclusion and Collaboration Officer and Senior Vice President at Silicon Valley giant Cisco Systems Inc., where she helped launch the Office of Inclusion and Collaboration in 2015.</p>
<p>During Slate&rsquo;s tenure at Cisco, she helped the company build a pipeline of talent across the full spectrum of diversity. Fortune Magazine recognized Cisco as No. 1 of the &ldquo;World&rsquo;s 25 Best Places to Work&rdquo; in 2019 and 2020 and Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For&reg; in the U.S. for three consecutive years: 2021, 2022, and 2023.</p>
<p>At CalPERS, Slate will drive the ongoing effort to integrate diversity, equity, and inclusion across the organization and beyond with suppliers, contractors, and investment partners. She will be a member of the Executive Team and report directly to CEO Marcie Frost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shari brings the kind of leadership this moment calls for &ndash; connecting diversity, inclusion, and equity to trust, governance and our core values,&rdquo; Frost said. &ldquo;She will help CalPERS continue to lead with our purpose, which is to deliver the best outcomes for the millions of people who depend on us for their retirement and health care benefits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slate said she joined CalPERS because of &ldquo;its clarity of purpose and the responsibility it carries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;CalPERS shows up for people at one of the most important moments of their lives, when work ends and trust matters most,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I hope to ensure that CalPERS works for all the people it was built to serve &ndash; beginning with our people and extending to every member who depends on this system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A graduate of Mills College, Slate began her career in sales and was an award-winning manager for Xerox Corp. before being hired at Sun Microsystems as one of the youngest diversity officers at a Fortune 500 company.</p>
<p>She has served on numerous boards and councils, including the California State University Foundation Board of Governors and the World Economic Forum&rsquo;s Global Future Council on Systemic Inequalities and Social Cohesion.</p>
<p>Slate represented Cisco on the Business Roundtable&rsquo;s Diversity &amp; Inclusion Working Group after 181 CEOs redefined the purpose of a corporation to serve all stakeholders. She contributed to shaping the group&rsquo;s view of DEI not as a standalone goal, but the connective tissue linking employee well-being, business performance, customer trust, supplier inclusion, and community impact.</p>

<title>Office Of The Comptroller Of The US Currency Announces Enforcement Actions For January 2026</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) today released enforcement actions for January 2026.</p>
<p>The OCC uses enforcement actions against an institution-affiliated party (IAP) to deter, encourage correction of, or prevent violations, unsafe or unsound practices, or breaches of fiduciary duty. Enforcement actions against IAPs reinforce the accountability of individuals for their conduct regarding the affairs of a bank. The term &ldquo;institution-affiliated party,&rdquo; or IAP, is defined in 12 USC 1813(u) and includes bank directors, officers, employees, and controlling shareholders. Orders of Prohibition prohibit an individual from any participation in the affairs of a bank or other institution as defined in 12 USC 1818(e)(7). The OCC has taken the following actions against IAPs:</p>
<ul>
<li><span><a href="https://www.occ.gov/static/enforcement-actions/eaAA-ENF-2024-80.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Order of Prohibition</a></span>&nbsp;against Tamim Haidar, Branch Operations Associate Manager at a Union City, California, branch of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Sioux Falls, South Dakota, for embezzling over $800,000 in bank funds and falsifying bank records. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2024-80)</li>
</ul>
<p>The OCC terminates enforcement actions when a bank has demonstrated compliance with all articles of an enforcement action; or when the OCC determines that articles deemed &ldquo;not in compliance&rdquo; have become outdated or irrelevant to the bank&rsquo;s current circumstances; or when the OCC incorporates the articles deemed &ldquo;not in compliance&rdquo; into a new action. Termination actions include:</p>

<title>UK Prudential Regulation Authority To Streamline Supervision As Part Of 2026 Priorities</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) has today published its supervisory priorities for 2026, outlining in a letter its sector-specific priorities for the coming year to all banks, building societies, insurers and other PRA-regulated firms.</p>
<p>These include important plans to streamline the supervisory process by moving some supervisory activity, including Periodic Summary Meetings (PSMs), to a two-year cycle.</p>
<p>These meetings are an internal, formal review led by the PRA to consider potential risks posed by a regulated firm to the PRA&rsquo;s objectives, and to set the supervisory strategy for the coming period.</p>
<p>Over recent years, the PRA has transitioned some firms to biennial review cycles, reflecting the longer-term nature of supervisory workplans and allowing firms and supervisors to focus resources more efficiently on identifying and remediating key risks.</p>
<p>From 1 March larger firms will begin to move to this two-year cycle, while maintaining a regular cadence for discussion of important matters, alongside ad hoc supervisory meetings. This will result in firms having a more proportionate and efficient set of engagements with the PRA.</p>
<p>The Priorities letters are designed to help firms understand the main areas of supervisory focus over the next year, addressing key risks in each sector while setting out the PRA&rsquo;s priorities to support competition, competitiveness and growth. Other streamlining measures include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accelerating timelines for reviewing senior manager applications, new firm authorisations and internal ratings-based model change pre-approval applications;</li>
<li>Developing the new UK captive regime for insurers, through a summer 2026 consultation with a view to launch the new regime in 2027;</li>
<li>And streamlining and modernising reporting requirements through the Future Banking Data project.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sam Woods, Deputy Governor for Prudential Regulation and Chief Executive Officer of the PRA, said:</p>
<p>'As we set out our priorities for 2026, we are also updating our approach by moving from an annual to a two-year supervisory cycle for firms. This will allow us to make our operations more efficient and help streamline firms&rsquo; interactions with the PRA.'</p>
<p>These priorities build on the PRA&rsquo;s extensive work to maintain stability and promote growth and competitiveness in the financial sector. Recent changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The removal of the Building Societies Sourcebook alongside&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2025/december/regulators-announce-plans-to-support-growth-of-mutuals-sector">new measures</a>&nbsp;to support the growth of the mutuals sector;</li>

<li>Supporting increased and rapid investment by insurance firms through the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2025/april/pra-launches-consultation-to-help-insurers-accelerate-investment-in-the-uk">Matching Adjustment Investment Accelerator</a>;</li>

<li>Supervisors will engage individually with firms in due course on what this means for the timing of each firm&rsquo;s next PSM.</li>
<li>The PSM process typically involves the PRA internally setting out the forward-looking supervisory strategy for individual firms, before a letter is shared with the firm&rsquo;s board and management to outline its assessment of key risks, as well as any areas of focus, and request mitigating actions be taken where necessary.</li>

<title>Lingfeng Capital Announce Launch Of The Digital Venture Fund With Archax, Bridging Institutional Finance And Digital Markets</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/lingfeng-capital-announce-launch-of-the-digital-venture-fund-with-archax-bridgi-2026115/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Lingfeng Capital today announced the forthcoming launch of the&nbsp;Digital Venture Fund (DVF). DVF delivers a regulated, multi-chain tokenised venture fund providing institutional-level access to early-stage fintech and digital infrastructure opportunities. The fund will be launched on&nbsp;<span>LSEG&rsquo;s Digital Markets Infrastructure (DMI)</span>&nbsp;platform during a&nbsp;<span>London Stock Exchange market opening ceremony in March</span>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Designed as a next-generation venture product, DVF combines Lingfeng Capital&rsquo;s established investment capability with LSEG&rsquo;s digital markets infrastructure and Archax&rsquo;s digital exchange and custody framework. Together, this creates an environment where traditional and digital-native investors can participate in the same venture strategy through modernised access rails enabled by distributed ledger technology.</p>
<p>&ldquo;DVF exists to prove that high-quality venture investing can be expanded by tokenised access,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span>Brian McNulty, Partner, DVF at Lingfeng Capital</span>. &ldquo;Investors want diversification, they want innovation&nbsp;and they want regulated structures they can trust. We are now able to offer a product that stays firmly institutional while opening the door to new forms of participation and liquidity. This collaboration is an important milestone in connecting global capital to digital markets infrastructure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;LSEG is pleased that Lingfeng Capital and DVF has chosen to use LSEG&rsquo;s Digital Markets Infrastructure&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span>Darko Hajdukovic, Head of Digital Markets Infrastructure</span>. "We&rsquo;re excited to be working with such an innovative firm, offering professional investors access to exciting new investment opportunities through LSEG&rsquo;s independent, trusted and scaled network.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Archax will provide regulated digital issuance, secondary-market connectivity and custody services, enabling DVF to offer optional token-based access while remaining fully compliant with institutional standards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the first FCA-regulated digital securities exchange, broker and custodian, we are uniquely positioned to provide compliant token issuance, secondary trading and custody within a single regulated environment. DVF showcases how real-world assets and digital rails can operate together to open new markets for investors without sacrificing oversight or trust.&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span>Graham Rodford, CEO and co-founder of Archax</span>.</p>
<p>DVF invests in fintech and digital-infrastructure companies through a traditional venture strategy, with the tokenised structure enabling modern distribution, improved efficiency and offers optional future liquidity. Digital-native investors will also be able to diversify into a fundamentals-driven venture fund through traditional channels.</p>
<p>DVF represents the first institutional-grade venture product designed for cross-participation between traditional investors, digital-asset holders and blockchain foundations, with future phases enabling deeper network integration and expanded investor access.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Transaction Network Services (TNS) has expanded its global market data and infrastructure footprint in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region by adding connectivity to the Japan Alternative Market (JAX). This new connection provides TNS customers with direct, managed access to JAX&rsquo;s market data feeds, delivered across TNS&rsquo; extensive global network.</span><br /><br /><span>JAX began operations in December 2024, adding a new trading venue to Japan&rsquo;s equities market. Through TNS&rsquo; connectivity, global firms can access JAX market data and incorporate it into their trading and analytics workflows.</span><br /><br /><span>&ldquo;The rise of alternative trading venues like JAX represents a significant shift in the Asian financial landscape,&rdquo; said Jeff Mezger, Vice President of Product Management, TNS. &ldquo;JAX is a compelling success story, and by making its market data available to our global customer base, we are helping to lower the barriers to entry for firms looking to capitalize on this competitive shift.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span>While Asian exchanges often require bespoke broker connections for order routing and clearing, TNS simplifies market data access. Firms can leverage TNS&rsquo; expansive extranet, consisting of over 5,000 endpoints for local broker access, and can view JAX market data alongside other major exchanges via TNS&rsquo; low latency&nbsp;</span><a href="https://tnsi.com/solutions/financial/network-maps-global-access/">managed global network</a><span>.</span><br /><br /><span>&ldquo;Partnering with TNS provides JAX with a direct link to a broad, international community of market participants,&rdquo; said a JAX spokesperson. &ldquo;Their global infrastructure and deep experience in market connectivity supports JAX&rsquo;s continued growth as we build a more competitive trading environment in Japan.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span>The JAX integration reinforces TNS&rsquo; continued investment in expanding its APAC footprint and delivering reliable,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://tnsi.com/solutions/financial/market-data/">low-latency market data</a><span>&nbsp;to customers worldwide. TNS&rsquo; Japanese exchange portfolio also includes Japannext, Tokyo Financial Exchange (TFX) and the Japan Exchange Group (JPX), which encompasses the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE), Osaka Exchange (OSE), and Tokyo Commodity Exchange (TOCOM).</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Agentic commerce is accelerating rapidly, reshaping how consumers discover, decide, and buy products and services online. Industry leaders forecast that a significant share of digital commerce will soon be agent-assisted:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-agentic-commerce-opportunity-how-ai-agents-are-ushering-in-a-new-era-for-consumers-and-merchants" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">McKinsey projects that by 2030, agentic commerce could see between $3 trillion and $5 trillion in global retail value.</a>&nbsp;As agentic commerce evolves, it faces a key challenge: securely integrating AI with complex payment systems simply.<b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<h4>New assets to power agentic commerce</h4>
<p><a href="https://docs.connect.worldline-solutions.com/documentation/ConnectAI/worldline-model-context-protocol-mcp-server" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Worldline&rsquo;s Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers</a>&nbsp;on the Global Collect platform address this by acting as a secure bridge and translation layer between LLMs and Worldline&rsquo;s APIs, enabling AI agents to initiate payment actions via natural language. For merchants, the MCP server unlocks innovation avenues and supports agent-initiated actions such as payment creation, refunds, status checks, and payment captures. It also enables AI-driven shopping by allowing agents to share secure payment links while maintaining security and compliance.</p>
<p>The second capability is&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.connect.worldline-solutions.com/documentation/ConnectAI/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="ConnectAI">ConnectAI</a>, a dedicated hub on its&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.connect.worldline-solutions.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Documentation Site">Documentation Site</a>&nbsp;for developers and merchants to explore, build, test, and prepare for agentic commerce. ConnectAI brings together tools, documentation, and guidance for emerging agentic payment protocols.</p>
<p><b>Stijn Gasthuys, Head of Global Commerce at Worldline</b>,<b>&nbsp;</b>commented: &ldquo;Agentic commerce will unlock new waves of innovation, helping merchants deliver better customer experiences. Our investments in this area position Worldline to capture a growing global market for AI-powered transactions, delivering secure, scalable infrastructure that empowers merchants and developers to innovate with confidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Gertjan Dewaele, VP of Product &amp; Technology at Worldline</b>,<b>&nbsp;</b>commented: &ldquo;The shift to agentic commerce is underway, and MCP servers are the first building block for moving merchants from experimentation to real-world deployment. By providing secure, simple access to Worldline&rsquo;s payment capabilities for AI agents, we enable the next generation of agentic commerce and streamline internal operations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Worldline is actively shaping the future of agentic commerce by collaborating across the broader ecosystem with networks, tech leaders, AI platforms, and partners, laying the groundwork for secure, scalable agent-initiated payments.

<title>LSEG Launches Digital Settlement House</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/lseg-launches-digital-settlement-house-2026115/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/lseg-launches-digital-settlement-house-2026115/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>LSEG today announces the launch of a new digital settlement service, Digital Settlement House (LSEG DiSH), an open-access platform which enables programmatic and instantaneous settlement between independent payment networks, both on and off chain. Through commercial bank deposits held on the DiSH ledger (DiSH Cash), the service will enable the 24/7 instantaneous movement of commercial bank money in multiple currencies and jurisdictions, PVP and DVP, providing a real cash leg for FX and digital asset transactions and settlements.</p>
<p>With LSEG DiSH, market participants will be able to conduct PvP or DvP and settlements using any asset, orchestrating payments on any connected network, digital and traditional. DiSH Cash, LSEG DiSH's ledger enabled commercial bank money solution, will operate accounts at commercial banks, providing members with instant ownership of a commercial bank deposit at any bank within the LSEG DiSH network, and a mechanism for the 24/7 movement of commercial bank money. LSEG DiSH can facilitate settlement on its own ledger, or act as notary to facilitate settlement in other networks and assets.</p>
<p>By using LSEG DiSH, users can unlock trapped assets, enabling instantaneous use of cash, securities and digital assets 24/7. They will also be able to optimise liquidity through new tools that enable intraday borrowing and lending to better manage assets and obligations. The service also enables users to reduce settlement risk through reduced settlement timelines, synchronised settlement, and increased collateral availability.</p>
<p>The launch follows a successful Proof of Concept (PoC) in collaboration with Digital Asset and a consortium of leading financial institutions, completing transactions on the Canton Network. Executed across multiple assets and currencies, the transactions leveraged commercial bank deposits at leading commercial banks, with ownership recorded on the LSEG DiSH ledger, enabling the PoC participants to instantaneously transfer commercial bank deposits. The deposits were tokenised on the Canton Network for use as a true cash leg of the transactions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>LSEG DiSH will operate through LSEG&rsquo;s Post Trade Solutions business, utilising a trusted rulebook framework and account structure, supporting a broad network of members across multiple commercial banks and currencies. Instantaneous settlement of cash means that LSEG DiSH can offer dynamic management of intraday liquidity and funding, as well as 24/7 management of settlements and margin.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Daniel Maguire, Group Head, LSEG Markets and CEO, LCH Group</span>, said: &ldquo;LSEG DiSH expands the tokenised cash and cash like solutions available to the market, and for the first time, offers a real cash solution tokenised on the blockchain utilising cash in multiple currencies held at commercial banks. This innovative service will enable users to reduce settlement risk, and integrate existing cash, securities and digital assets across new and existing market infrastructure. We look forward to developing this service in partnership with the market.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<ul class="pr-top-bullets">
<li>Kristi Tange appointed as Group Chief Risk Officer</li>
<li>Clare Weaver MBA, becomes Chief Legal Officer</li>
</ul>
<p>ClearToken, the digital financial market infrastructure firm, today announces two senior appointments to enhance its Senior Leadership Team and further strengthen its legal and risk functions.</p>
<p><span>Kristi Tange has been appointed Group Chief Risk Officer,</span>&nbsp;to lead governance, risk, and strategic oversight, including compliance, communications, and regulatory relations. She brings nearly three decades of experience at Goldman Sachs across operations, risk, and finance in the US, UK, and Japan.</p>
<p>Most recently, Kristi served as Global Head of Operational Risk and Resilience at Goldman Sachs, where she led a strategic uplift of operational risk and UK resilience programmes. Previously, she headed Recovery and Resolution Planning, successfully filing two US Title I resolution plans. Her experience also includes enterprise risk, where she led risk identification, and senior leadership roles in operations across liquidity and collateral, client onboarding (including financial crimes), client assets, data, regulatory reporting, tax, derivatives, and treasury.</p>
<p><span>Clare Weaver, MBA, has become Chief Legal Officer,</span>&nbsp;where she will lead the Legal &amp; Regulatory function for the Group, providing strategic legal and regulatory advisory support to the CEO and Boards and managing the Group&rsquo;s legal affairs. Clare has been ClearToken&rsquo;s legal counsel and Head of Legal &amp; Regulatory and Company Secretary since inception in 2023.</p>
<p>Clare brings over 20 years of experience across specialist Corporate, Commercial, M&amp;A, fintech, and financial regulatory matters both in private practice and in industry, for more than 15 years deeply covering &ldquo;general counsel&rdquo; roles spanning all legal matters (including employment, commercial, corporate and finance). Clare previously established the Nomura Digital Office legal function and was founding interim CLO of Laser Digital (part of Nomura), before joining ClearToken in 2023.</p>
<p class="pr-subheading">Maintaining developmental momentum</p>
<p>These recent appointments are the latest milestones in ClearToken&rsquo;s growth, as the company seeks to unlock the full potential of 24/7 digital markets by offering horizontal post-trade services with the legal certainty offered by a regulated financial market infrastructure (FMI). They are also important steps towards the company&rsquo;s ambition to provide clearing and settlement services across digital asset markets for securities, derivatives and financing transactions.</p>
<p>In 2025, ClearToken achieved&nbsp;<a href="https://cleartoken.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CLEARTOKEN-November-2025-FCA-Authorisation-Press-Release.pdf" target="_blank">FCA Authorisation</a>&nbsp;to launch its delivery-versus-payment (DvP) settlement platform,&nbsp;<a href="https://cleartoken.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ClearToken-Adopts-Nasdaq-Eqlipse-Clearing-Press-Release.pdf" target="_blank">selected Nasdaq</a>&nbsp;as its technology partner, and&nbsp;<a href="https://cleartoken.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/CT-Settle-Go-Live-press-release-6.12.2025.pdf" target="_blank">launched CT Settle</a>, its DvP settlement platform for digital assets. ClearToken is now proceeding with its formal application for authorisation from the Bank of England as a Central Counterparty (CCP).</p>
<p><span>Benjamin Santos-Stephens, CEO of ClearToken, said:</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;We are delighted to welcome Kristi to ClearToken and congratulate Clare on her new role with us. These appointments build on the momentum we achieved in 2025 and are important milestones for us as we continue to build for the future. Such high calibre appointments bring with them a wealth of relevant experience and expertise and are welcome enhancements to our senior leadership team, as we continue with our strategy to create the world&rsquo;s first clearing house and settlement depository for both tokenised traditional and digitally native assets.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Kristi Tange, Chief Risk Officer of ClearToken, commented:</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;It is a very exciting time to join ClearToken, which is well positioned to unify the traditional finance and digital assets worlds and unlock the massive potential of tokenisation. I am looking forward to working with the energetic and visionary team here to build the financial market infrastructure which will underpin the future of global, 24/7 markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Clare Weaver, Chief Legal Officer at ClearToken said:</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Having worked with ClearToken well before joining full time in 2023, I&rsquo;m extremely proud of what we have achieved together so far. As the legislative landscape, and therefore opportunities, for digital assets continues to develop across the globe, I look forward to helping our strong, diverse team deliver on our growth ambitions in 2026 and beyond, and at the same time ensuring that legal certainty and compliance remains at the core of what we do.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization Update Regarding Unauthorized Access To Some Canadian Investors’ Data</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/canadian-investment-regulatory-organization-update-regarding-unauthorized-access-2026114/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/canadian-investment-regulatory-organization-update-regarding-unauthorized-access-2026114/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) confirms that as a result of a sophisticated phishing attack, first disclosed in August 2025, approximately 750,000 Canadian investors have been impacted.</p>
<p>We deeply regret this occurred and apologize for any inconvenience or concern.</p>
<p>CIRO is reaching out to affected investors to alert them of the incident and offering credit monitoring as an added precaution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are intent on doing right by those who are personally affected,&rdquo; said Andrew Kriegler President and Chief Executive Officer of CIRO. &ldquo;We take our public interest role very seriously. Matters of privacy and security are extremely important to us, as are our guiding organizational values of transparency and accountability. That&rsquo;s why we remain committed to further strengthening our own cybersecurity defences and data security practices and supporting the ongoing efforts of the broader investment industry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following information may have been impacted: dates of birth, phone numbers, annual income, social insurance numbers, government issued ID numbers, investment account numbers and account statements. CIRO does not collect account login detail, such as passwords, security questions and PINs and therefore that information was not at risk.</p>
<p>CIRO received this information in the normal course of carrying out its regulatory mandate to protect investors from improper investment conduct and practices, and through its investigative, compliance assessment and market regulation work.</p>
<p><em>Protecting Canadian Investors</em></p>
<p>CIRO quickly contained the incident and took immediate steps to secure our systems and protect the information in our care. We notified law enforcement and all relevant authorities, including privacy commissioners. A leading third-party forensic IT investigator was retained to determine what information was impacted.</p>
<p>CIRO launched a thorough investigation with the support of external cybersecurity experts. Our preliminary investigation revealed that registration information for member firms and registered individuals had been affected. We immediately shared those findings publicly and directly with our members and impacted registrants. At that time, we noted the investigation was ongoing, and we committed to sharing the final findings of the e-discovery process once the review was complete. After more than 9,000 hours of examination, we can now confirm the full extent of the incident.</p>
<p>There is currently no evidence that the information has been misused. We continue to monitor for malicious activity and have not identified any threat activity or exposure on the dark web.</p>
<p>As a precaution and in order to help detect possible misuse of information, CIRO is providing affected investors two-years of credit monitoring and identity theft protection with both of the major credit agencies. Step by step instructions detailing how to activate protection services will be communicated to those impacted, directly.</p>
<p><em>Additional Information</em></p>
<p>Only some clients or former clients of CIRO dealer members were impacted by the cybersecurity breach. Clients impacted by the cyber incident will be sent a notification letter by CIRO starting on January 14, 2026. If you did not receive a notification letter from CIRO but want to confirm whether you were impacted and should have received a notification letter, you can request this information from CIRO in writing using the contact form available in the cyber incident section of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ciro.ca/ciro-cybersecurity-incident" target="_self" title="CIRO cybersecurity incident">CIRO&rsquo;s website</a>&nbsp;(ciro.ca).</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Madame Ambassador, for the introduction and the opportunity to speak today. My topic is the implications of deregulation for monetary policy, an appropriate one for this setting.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;Greece's recovery from the crisis that began in 2009 was only possible after the Greek people implemented substantial and painful reforms, including alleviating suffocating over-regulation in many sectors. In addition to the other reforms embraced by Greece, deregulation freed businesses to compete domestically and internationally, and promoted individuals' access to the economy. The range of reforms has included liberalizing product and service markets, easing licensing and administrative burdens, opening previously restricted professions, and increasing labor market flexibility. The government liberalized electricity and gas utilities; privatized airports, ports, and utilities; and reformed bankruptcy procedures and other business laws.</p>
<p>While it is challenging to quantify how these deregulatory actions have affected the economy, there is little doubt that these reforms have supported a remarkable return to economic growth and higher living standards. Macroeconomic stability has returned to Greece. Unemployment has fallen to its lowest level since the Global Financial Crisis, and investment and exports have rebounded. Product and labor market reforms helped restore competitiveness, reduce unit labor costs, and encourage firm entry. By easing the ability of supply to respond to prices, these reforms have improved the transmission of monetary policy. While monetary policy is set by the ECB, its transmission varies in part with how national governments manage their economies. Long-term Greek borrowing rates narrowed their spread to Germany's, below 1 percent, compared with 6 percent a decade ago. Greece has a come a long way, impressing the whole world with its recovery.</p>
<p><span>Regulation and the Economy's Supply Side</span><br />For all the conversation around Mario Draghi's report,<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;Greece shows that well-targeted deregulatory reforms can help lay the foundation for more sustained and robust economic growth by expanding the productive capacity of the economy, known as the supply side. Such sustainable increases in actual and potential growth have different implications for monetary policy than purely cyclical growth spurts, which boost growth in the near term without raising economic potential. These jolts can create substantial inflation, undermining growth in the medium term by forcing central banks to raise interest rates, and also in the long term by causing a misallocation of resources.</p>
<p>Recent experiences have reinforced the need for central bankers to fully consider the broad range of nonmonetary factors that could affect the appropriate stance of monetary policy. One such factor that is especially important at this juncture is the regulatory burden borne by businesses and individuals, which has begun to recede in the past year.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;I believe that the sweeping deregulation underway in the United States will significantly boost competition, productivity, and potential growth, allowing faster economic growth without putting upward pressure on inflation. This would support continued easing of restrictive monetary policy, but ignoring these effects would result in monetary policy that is needlessly contractionary.</p>
<p>One challenge for central bankers in fully incorporating deregulation into their economic outlooks is that it is difficult to measure in aggregate. Economists are inclined to study things when there are quantitative data to illuminate their work&mdash;a version of the famous "lamppost problem" of only looking where the lamppost shines. This may have contributed to a tendency to give short shrift to regulation in judging the economic outlook. Quantitatively measuring regulations is more difficult than taxes, subsidies, or interest rates. Regulations that businesses face can vary enormously based on the sector, size, and sometimes even the age of a company. Some regulations ban activities altogether. Some regulations impose fixed or variable costs for complying. Some regulations affect consumption decisions and some affect production. Regulations can vary enormously across jurisdictions and sometimes within jurisdictions. Additionally, enforcement determines how binding regulations are in practice, and enforcement can be even harder to measure than the effects of regulations themselves.</p>
<p>These measurement challenges are evident in the abundance of economic studies on specific regulations but the much smaller volume of work that tries to comprehensively measure the aggregate effects of the accumulation of regulations on the macroeconomy.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;From the perspective of an individual firm, it may be easy to adjust behavior in response to one regulation, known as a "margin of adjustment," but compounding regulations can constrain the ability to shift costs by hitting multiple margins of adjustment.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;One pebble doesn't stop a stream, water can flow around it; but enough pebbles will.</p>
<p>A common approach to quantifying the effects of regulations is to count the number of pages of new regulations, though this does not account for varying economic significance across pages. Another approach is to count the number of work hours required to comply, as reported under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA). However, there is wide variation in how different regulatory agencies produce these costs estimates, even sometimes variation within agencies, and more importantly, the counting of work hours related to the PRA does not capture the full opportunity cost of the regulations&mdash;that is, how that lost hour of work could have been used more productively&mdash;or the firms and industries that don't exist because of the regulation.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;If a firm needs to hire a person to comply with some new regulation and can't hire a sales associate who could generate new business or can't engage in a productive activity at all, then the foregone opportunity can be significantly larger than the wage for compliance hours.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a></p>
<p>There has been some progress in measuring regulation through advances in natural language processing and artificial intelligence, and I expect more of this to come. For instance, Patrick McLaughlin's QuantGov project at Stanford University's Hoover Institution uses computational tools to move beyond regulation page counts toward counting restrictions and obligations imposed by the text and quantifying regulations by industry.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a>&nbsp;In other work, Joseph Kalmenovitz uses machine learning methods to count and separate regulations that are relevant for a firm's core businesses from those that are not relevant.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;These measures show a substantial drop in the number of rules in 2025.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a></p>
<p>Among other deregulatory efforts is the current U.S. Administration's "one-in-ten-out policy" revoking 10 old regulations for every new one adopted.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a>&nbsp;Based on the pace of the Administration's deregulatory efforts in the first part of 2025, I estimate that 30 percent of the regulatory restrictions in the Code of Federal Regulations will be eliminated by 2030, though this may prove an underestimate.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a></p>
<p>Regulations can have far larger consequences for the supply side than, for example, taxes, because they can amount to outright prohibitions and thus function as infinite taxes. Quantity controls are usually far more damaging than those that directly affect prices.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a>&nbsp;Consider agglomeration, when a group of firms in the same general industry benefit from proximity, such as R&amp;D labs and production plants, or clients and customers. An auto parts producer benefits from being close to an automaker.</p>
<p>Environmental or other restrictions that restrict co-location can affect the entire economy's supply side by preventing the agglomeration necessary for an industry to be profitable. Take one piece of an industrial ecosystem away because of a regulation and the rest become harder to sustain. Supply chain ecosystems exist&mdash;or don't&mdash;because of regulations determining what activity can take place and where. I think it is hard to argue that, say, the excess burden of going from a 30 percent to a 33 percent marginal tax rate has the same effect as a regulation preventing an entire industry from existing domestically. Regulations, particularly those that affect physical production, can force the economy from high-productivity sectors to low-productivity sectors by encouraging capital-intensive production to move to less regulated places, such as China.</p>
<p>Research on the effects of regulation on the supply side of the economy has developed along two major lines of inquiry. The first studies regulation's effect on total factor productivity (TFP) and growth by making production more expensive.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn14" title="footnote 14"><span>14</span></a><a name="f14"></a>&nbsp;If regulations make, say, electricity or manufactured goods more expensive to produce, they lower TFP.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn15" title="footnote 15"><span>15</span></a><a name="f15"></a>&nbsp;Regulations can also distort investment decisions across sectors or impede innovation, leading to an economy-wide misallocation of resources with commensurate effects on aggregate productivity levels.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn16" title="footnote 16"><span>16</span></a><a name="f16"></a></p>
<p>An alternative way of modeling regulation is via its effects on free entry and markups. Regulatory costs that appear marginal from an industry perspective often originate as fixed costs from a firm perspective. An existing homebuilder building one more house may be marginal, but for a new entrant to build it, they would have to invest in vast compliance infrastructure. In many jurisdictions, they'd have to learn how to measure carbon emissions, decipher labor regulations, pass various inspections at different stages, and pay other fixed costs. The barriers to building a house have become so burdensome that many builders exit entire markets, leaving numerous large metro areas without desperately needed supply. As such, regulations often serve as barriers to entry, with all the attendant consequences: reduced competition, artificially high returns to scale, higher markups, reduced innovation, and reduced productivity growth. Let's call these "markup regulations."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn17" title="footnote 17"><span>17</span></a><a name="f17"></a></p>
<p>There is abundant evidence both within and across countries that increased regulation causes reduced firm entry, decreased competition, and lower investment, all consistent with elevated fixed costs.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn18" title="footnote 18"><span>18</span></a><a name="f18"></a>&nbsp;Decreased firm entry, competition, and innovation lead to a malaise familiar to many: Formerly dynamic industries calcify, flagship businesses choose to move elsewhere or shutter completely, and communities feel cheated out of their way of life.</p>
<p><span>Implications for Monetary Policy</span><br />Now let me discuss the implications of regulation and deregulation for monetary policy. Most theory and research suggest that increasing the regulatory burden reduces productivity and thus puts upward pressure on prices. This is intuitive: Regulations impede production, and deregulation removes those impediments. More production means lower prices, and vice versa. But gauging the magnitudes of these effects is more difficult.</p>
<p>Work by Dustin Chambers, Courtney A. Collins, and Alan Krause found that a 1 percent increase in U.S. federal regulations in a particular industry is associated with a roughly 10 basis point increase in consumer prices in that industry, and that is only in the near term.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn19" title="footnote 19"><span>19</span></a><a name="f19"></a>&nbsp;Longer-term effects and effects from more substantial changes in regulations are, in my view, likely to be substantially larger, since firm entry and the effects of increased competition develop over time. Supply chain ecosystems can take years to rise or fall. I'd also expect cross-industry spillovers to boost aggregate effects above this level. But even these modest within-industry, short-term effects would be substantial in the context of the potential 30 percent decline in the regulatory code that I projected earlier. This implies a cumulative drag of roughly 3 percent on the consumer price level through 2030, a little over half a percent per year.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn20" title="footnote 20"><span>20</span></a><a name="f20"></a></p>
<p>What happens in the short term depends on various factors&mdash;the types of regulations involved, the way these regulations affect firms and households, and the manner of enforcement. On balance, I believe the substantial deregulation that has occurred in 2025 will continue over at least the next three years and be a large positive shock to productivity that will put downward pressure on prices. On net, this supports a more accommodative stance of monetary policy.</p>
<p>As I have argued, I think the primary effects of deregulation are on the supply side of the economy and have the effect of increasing potential output more than they increase actual output. For example, if the number of goods I can produce is effectively limited by regulation, and that cap is removed, this means I can produce more. If demand increases and production is limited by regulation or some other factor, then prices increase. If demand rises and these shackles have been removed, then output grows and pressure on prices is much smaller.</p>
<p>While I think of regulation as primarily a supply-side factor, it can also affect demand. For instance, the news of planned deregulatory action can stimulate investment now for future production, increasing aggregate demand and prices in the short run, before prices adjust to the lower level that would prevail over the longer run. However, I see little reason to expect the short-run effect on demand will exceed potential. In my earlier speech, I assumed that deregulation immediately increases actual output half as much as potential output, and then the two converge over a few years. While some approaches assume TFP shocks increase actual and potential output by the same amount, work by Olivier Coibion, Yuriy Gorodnichenko, and Mauricio Ulate shows that a structural approach to modeling the supply-side results in potential output overshooting actual output in response to a TFP shock.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn21" title="footnote 21"><span>21</span></a><a name="f21"></a></p>
<p>Of course, this matters because the output gap is a primary input into calculating the appropriate setting for monetary policy. If actual output falls below potential output, there is slack in the economy that could be accommodated by looser monetary policy. If deregulation boosts potential output above actual, the correct response is to cut rates. At the same time, by increasing the marginal product of capital, deregulation may raise the so-called neutral rate of interest at which monetary policy is neither accommodative nor restrictive. I addressed this in my first speech as a member of the Federal Reserve Board.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn22" title="footnote 22"><span>22</span></a><a name="f22"></a></p>
<p>Turning to markups, the second channel for the effects of regulation on the supply side, models indicate that if monetary policy ignores the deflationary effects of deregulation, then we risk causing an unnecessary contraction in the economy. That is the implication of an important 2014 paper by Gauti Eggertsson, Andrea Ferrero, and Andrea Raffo, which models deregulation as a reduction in markups&mdash;increased competition&mdash;in a standard New Keynesian model.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn23" title="footnote 23"><span>23</span></a><a name="f23"></a>&nbsp;They find that the appropriate response of monetary policy is to reduce interest rates in response to this type of deregulation shock and offset its consequent deflation. If for some reason monetary policy fails to do so, then deflation and economic contraction needlessly result. This model implies that, if the Federal Reserve fails to reduce policy rates in response to deregulation, there will be adverse consequences. Greece's experience testifies to this. Had the ECB not implemented exceptionally loose monetary policy and effectively accommodated Greece's structural reforms, the outcome could have been quite different.</p>
<p>I believe that central bankers should be paying close attention to the effects of regulation on productivity, output, and prices. In recent quarters, policy has been tighter than it should have been to reflect significant deregulation lifting potential growth and reducing inflation. Going forward, I expect that the ambitious deregulation underway in the United States will boost growth without boosting inflation and be one factor supporting a further easing of monetary policy. In this regard, Greece and the ECB have lit the path. I have raised this point with my Federal Open Market Committee colleagues and expect to continue to do so in our deliberations.</p>

<p><a name="fn1"></a>1. The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee. I am deeply indebted to Casey Mulligan for many conversations about the economics of regulation, but again, the ideas here reflect only my own views.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn2"></a>2. Mario Draghi (2024),&nbsp;<a href="https://commission.europa.eu/topics/competitiveness/draghi-report_en">The Future of European Competitiveness</a>, September 9.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn3"></a>3. In this speech, I am focusing on general economic regulations, not regulations on the banking sector, which are implemented by the Federal Reserve in conjunction with other regulatory agencies. For more on banking regulations, see Stephen I. Miran (2025),&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20251119a.htm">"Regulatory Dominance of the Federal Reserve Balance Sheet,"</a>&nbsp;speech delivered at the Bank Policy Institute and Small Business &amp; Entrepreneurship Council, Washington, November 19.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn4"></a>4. For example, lots of papers show very clear implications for productivity and "dynamism" of regulations that inhibit labor adjustment (see Steven J. Davis and John Haltiwanger (2014), "Labor Market Fluidity and Economic Performance," paper presented at "Re-Evaluating Labor Market Dynamics," a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, held in Jackson Hole, Wyo., August 22; and David H. Autor, William R. Kerr, and Adriana D. Kugler (2007), "Does Employment Protection Reduce Productivity? Evidence from US States,"&nbsp;<em>The Economic Journal</em>, vol. 117 (June), pp. F189&ndash;217). For a theory approach, Hopenhayn and Rogerson (1993) is a classic&mdash;a tax on firing is a tax on hiring (see Hugo Hopenhayn and Richard Rogerson (1993), "Job Turnover and Policy Evaluation: A General Equilibrium Analysis,"&nbsp;<em>Journal of Political Economy</em>, vol. 101 (5). For land use regulation literature, see Leonardo D'Amico, Edward L. Glaeser, Joseph Gyourko, William R. Kerr, and Giacomo A.M. Ponzetto (2024),&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w33188">"Why Has Construction Productivity Stagnated? The Role of Land-Use Regulation,"</a>&nbsp;NBER Working Paper Series 33188 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, November).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn5"></a>5. For example, a regulation that raises input costs might incent a firm to cut costs by reducing headcount, but the firm may find that response problematic as well because of other regulations.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn6"></a>6. For instance, the Small Business Administration and General Services Administration measure PRA paperwork burdens in dollars, whereas other agencies like FinCEN and parts of the Department of Agriculture measure these burdens in hours. Variation within agencies is usually across units, like the Food and Drug Administration relative to the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services within the Department of Health and Human Services.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn7"></a>7. Standard economics would suggest that, if the compliance associate is seen as a fixed cost but a new salesperson is seen as a variable cost, the optimality condition would ignore the fixed cost and have the firm hire the sales associate anyway. This is well and good for large firms that generate abundant cashflow or have easy access to liquidity, but many smaller firms face more binding cashflow and liquidity constraints and will be unable to hire that salesperson. Moreover, even for large firms, the compliance associate may be a variable cost for expanding an existing line of business, or he or she may be a fixed cost that impedes the firm's expansion into a new line of business or market. See the discussion that follows of "markup regulations" and competition.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="fn12"></a>12. McLaughlin (2025) estimates 2,404 deregulatory actions from the Spring 2025 Unified Agenda of Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions. If the average deregulatory action removes 25.6 restrictions from the CFR, which was the average through July 1 of this year, then 61,542 restrictions will be removed per year. Five years at this rate will remove 28 percent of a total of 1.1 million restrictions. I rounded up to 30 percent because I expect the pace of deregulation to accelerate with the accelerated pace of Senate confirmations due to the Senate's recent adoption of&nbsp;<em>en bloc</em>&nbsp;confirmation; with more personnel, deregulation will be much quicker than it was in the first few months of a fresh administration. Indeed, I think 30 percent will ultimately prove to be an underestimate. As McLaughlin notes, we will soon get the Fall 2025 Unified Agenda, which will allow me to update this calculation. I used McLaughlin's analysis rather than Kalmenovitz's for this exercise because, as of January 5, Kalmenovitz's measure showed a nearly 25 percent reduction in overall federal regulatory burden over the course of 2025, and as optimistic as I am regarding the coming deregulatory trend, that magnitude seems aggressive to me at present. Moreover, Kalmenovitz's measure is prone to revision.

<p><a name="fn20"></a>20. Of course, this predicted decline is relative to what consumer prices would have done in the absence of the deregulatory actions and not a prediction about an absolute change.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn21"></a>21. See Olivier Coibion, Yuriy Gorodnichenko, and Mauricio Ulate (2018),&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Coibion-et-al_final-draft.pdf">"The Cyclical Sensitivity in Estimates of Potential Output," (PDF)</a>&nbsp;Brookings Paper on Econonomic Activity, Fall, pp. 343&ndash;441. Coibion et al. show that in a Blanchard-Quah (BQ) approach to estimating potential output, TFP shocks increase potential output much more rapidly than actual output (figure 12). The BQ approach relies on the uncontroversial theoretical assumption that supply-side shocks affecting potential output are those which have permanent effects on the level of output while demand shocks are restricted to having no permanent effects. It provides a more structural economic grounding for estimating potential output than various filter-based approaches.</p>
<p>The case for actual and potential output moving up the same amount in response to a TFP shock seems more plausible if the TFP shock is driven by a new technology, which requires investment to implement. But not all TFP shocks are the same, and regulations are quite different. If today a regulation limits the amount of carbon a factory can emit, but tomorrow the factory can emit more carbon, it does not require the same amount of new investment as would be required to, say, implement new computer technologies. Letting an existing smokestack run for 24 instead of 8 hours is quite different from having to buy graphical processing units to develop a large language model. In other words, it may be appropriate to consider regulatory TFP shocks as having different consequences for output gaps than technological TFP shocks have. See also Boivin, Kiley, and Mishkin (2011), who observe that the response of actual output to a TFP shock depends crucially on the monetary response, underlining that it is crucial for the Fed to stay abreast of TFP shocks in formulating the appropriate stance of policy (Jean Boivin, Michael Kiley, and Frederic Mishkin (2011), "How Has the Monetary Transmission Mechanism Evolved Over Time?" in Benjmain M. Friedman and Michael Woodford, eds.,&nbsp;<em>Handbook of Monetary Economics, Vol. 3</em>. (Amsterdam: Elsevier), pp. 369&ndash;422).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn22"></a>22. In that speech, I included a boost to neutral rates from deregulation (which was offset by reductions in neutral rates from other sources like reduced population growth and smaller fiscal deficits). I also included a wider output gap because of potential growth increasing faster than actual growth as a result of deregulation. In that speech, I did&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;model an explicit deregulation-driven reduction in prices, either from a TFP boost or a reduction in markups, an oversight partially addressed here.&nbsp;</p>

Lack of transparency when using these terms poses a notable greenwashing risk to investors.

<p class="text-align-justify"><span>The European Supervisory Authorities (EBA, EIOPA and ESMA &ndash; the ESAs) have today signed a&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2026-01/MoU_DORA_oversight_ICT_CTPPs__EU-UK.pdf">Memorandum of Understanding</a><span>&nbsp;(MoU) with the Bank of England (BoE), the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). This agreement enhances the cooperation between the authorities to oversee critical ICT third-party service providers (CTPPs) as required by the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA).</span></p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>The MoU establishes clear principles and procedures for cooperation, information sharing and coordination of oversight activities between the relevant authorities responsible for EU CTPPs/UK CTPs oversight. The&nbsp;MoU aims at enhancing third-party risk management and contributing to the overall operational resilience of the financial sector in the EU and UK through strong cross-border cooperation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span><span>​​Legal basis and background</span></span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>The MoU has been prepared in accordance with DORA Articles 36, 44, and 49, which cover the ESAs&rsquo; oversight powers, international cooperation, and financial cross-sector exercises, communication and cooperation.</span></p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>​To exchange information with a third-country authority, the ESAs must ensure that the confidentiality and professional secrecy regime in the third country is equivalent to that in the EU. Therefore, before signing this MoU, the ESAs conducted an assessment that confirmed the UK confidentiality and professional secrecy regime&rsquo;s equivalence with that in DORA.</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p dir="LTR">TASE publishes today the list of companies that entered the &ldquo;TASE 100 Club&rdquo;, which includes companies with a market cap exceeding NIS 200 million, that have achieved a share yield of at least 100% in 2025. For the third consecutive year, TASE publishes the &ldquo;TASE 100 Club&rdquo; constituents, this as part of its efforts to improve the public&rsquo;s acquaintance with the TASE-listed companies.</p>
<p dir="LTR">According to TASE&rsquo;s Research Unit, 45 companies achieved a yield of more than 100% in 2025, as compared to only 35 companies in 2024. The highest share yield in 2025 was achieved by Aryt Industries, operating in the defense-military sector, with a price gain of more than 400%. Investment houses, More and Meitav, achieved a yield of 300%, and an additional eight companies achieved a yield in excess of 200%.</p>
<p dir="LTR">Out of the 45 companies included in the &ldquo;TASE 100 Club&rdquo;, 20 companies were awarded 5 stars, having achieved a positive yield in each of the past three years, as compared to only five companies awarded the 5-star top rating in 2024.</p>
<p dir="LTR">25 companies were awarded four starts, having achieved a cumulative positive yield over the past 3 years, as compared to 23 companies in 2024.</p>
<p dir="LTR">The 2025 list includes many major companies, including 29 companies with a market cap in excess of NIS 2 billion. The list comprises 24 companies included in the TA-125 index, as compared to 10 companies in 2024.</p>
<p dir="LTR">The list contains companies from a wide range of sectors, the most prominent</p>
<ul>
<li><span>14 technology sector companies, including 6 defense companies.</span></li>
<li>8 insurance companies.</li>
<li>6 financial services companies.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="LTR">Despite multiple challenges over the past year, the companies exhibited business resilience that was also reflected in the capital market. TASE's leading indices recorded outstanding yields compared to leading global indices: the TA-35 index increased by 51.6% and the TA-90 index increased by 46.6%.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Rating System of the &ldquo;TASE 100 Club&rdquo;</h4>
<p dir="LTR">The TASE staff applies a star system (3-5 stars) to rate the companies that achieved a yield exceeding 100% in 2025, which awards 5 stars to companies that achieved a positive yield in each of the past 3 years, 4 stars to companies that achieved a cumulative positive yield over the past 3 years, and 3 stars to other club members with a yield of more than 100% in the past year.</p>
<p dir="LTR">During the month of January, TASE will host the management of the &ldquo;TASE 100 Club&rdquo; constituents in a special Opening Bell Ceremony.&nbsp;</p>

<title>ClearBid Global Markets Selects Archax As Partner For UK And EU Expansion - Extends Cross-Border Reach For Its Digital Bond Trading And Data Platform Into New Core Regions</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ClearBid Global Markets (CBGM) today announced it has selected Archax as its regulated digital asset partner to expand the reach of its cross-border digital bond trading and data platform into the UK and EU regions.</p>
<p>CBGM is a full-service electronic trading platform and complete securities and data source, that effectively connects global bond markets utilising a digital Dutch Auction. This results in real-time, transparent and market-driven price discovery. It is an innovative substitute for traditional &lsquo;over the counter&rsquo; (OTC) methods, with a direct focus on capital markets-based financing for infrastructure, corporate and asset-backed borrowers.</p>
<p>Archax is a regulated digital asset exchange, broker and custodian, based in the UK, EU, US and UAE. Targeted at professionals and institutions, Archax supports all types of digital assets &ndash; from unregulated cryptocurrencies through to regulated tokenised real-world assets (RWAs).</p>
<p>By selecting Archax as a strategic partner for cross-border expansion, CBGM will initially leverage Archax&rsquo;s FCA regulations in the UK to offer its digital bond pre-issuance, trading and data platform to investors based there. Moving forwards, CBGM then plans to do the same in the EU region by leveraging Archax&rsquo;s permissions there too.</p>
<p><span>Robert Novembre, Founder and CEO of ClearBid Global Markets, comments:&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Our partnership with Archax marks a significant milestone for CBGM as we expand into the UK and advance our global mission to redefine capital markets. By combining our vision for transparent, data‑driven markets with Archax&rsquo;s fully regulated digital infrastructure, we are delivering institutional clients unprecedented visibility and liquidity across global bond markets. This collaboration empowers market participants to navigate complex environments through a single, seamless digital gateway&rdquo;.<span>&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p><span>Nick Donovan, Chief Revenue Officer of Archax, adds:</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Archax is all about being the most credible, institutional and regulated, digital asset solution in the marketplace. We are always on the look-out for potential partners who can leverage our regulatory stack and together expand our digital offerings in the space. As such, we are excited to be working with ClearBid Global Markets with their innovative digital approach for providing access to bonds for capital markets participants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>CBGM&rsquo;s digital bond marketplace is designed to revolutionise how capital is raised and invested by addressing the current market&rsquo;s lack of transparency due to manual, antiquated pricing processes, as well as the lack of efficient accessibility and connectivity between markets, which limits global capital flows and growth for emerging markets.</p>

<title>UK And EU Regulators Sign Memorandum Of Understanding To Strengthen Oversight Of Critical Third Parties</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The FCA, Bank of England and Prudential Regulation Authority have together signed a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/mou/mou-fca-boe-pra-esa-critical-third-parties.pdf" title="mou-fca-boe-pra-esa-critical-third-parties.pdf">Memorandum of Understanding</a>&nbsp;(MoU) with the European Supervisory Authorities to enhance cooperation and oversight of critical third parties (CTPs) that fall under the UK&rsquo;s CTP regime.</p>
<p>The MoU establishes a framework for coordinating and sharing information on the oversight of CTPs under the UK regime and critical third party providers (CTPPs) under the EU&rsquo;s Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), including during incidents such as power outages or cyber-attacks.</p>
<p>The MoU aims to manage potential risks to financial stability and market confidence, as well as strengthen international cooperation. It will also help reduce duplication and regulatory burden on CTPs and CTPPs.</p>
<p>The UK&rsquo;s CTP regime complements similar international standards and is designed to be compatible with DORA. The agreement demonstrates UK regulators&rsquo; commitment to cross-border cooperation and strengthening operational resilience to support growth and promote market stability.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ul>
<li>In 2024, UK regulators introduced&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/policy-statements/ps24-16-operational-resilience-critical-third-parties-uk-financial-sector" title="PS24/16: Operational resilience: Critical third parties to the UK financial sector">new rules</a>&nbsp;to bolster the resilience of critical third parties providing key services to the financial sector.</li>
<li>These rules came into effect on 1 January 2025 and apply once a CTP is designated by the Treasury.</li>
<li>The Treasury is responsible for deciding which third party service providers should fall under the new CTP regime. The rules will require designated CTPs to provide regular assurance, undertake resilience testing and report major incidents.</li>
<li>The designation process has begun and the regulators will continue to work with the Treasury throughout the designation process.</li>
<li>The regime does not reduce the responsibility of financial firms and Financial Market Infrastructures (FMIs) to manage their own operational resilience and third-party risks in line with existing outsourcing rules.</li>
</ul>

<title>The WFE Calls On Regulators To Balance Quantum Computing Risks Against More Immediate Operational Challenges</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The World Federation of Exchanges (&ldquo;WFE&rdquo;), the global industry association for exchange groups and CCPs, has warned of a substantial gap between regulatory expectations and industry expectations around quantum computing risk preparedness.</span><br /><br /><span>Major public authorities, standards bodies, and cross-border policy groups have begun issuing guidance, calling for early preparation and coordinated migration to post-quantum cryptography (PQC). This is driven by two core concerns:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Long lead times required to upgrade cryptographic systems; and&nbsp;</li>
<li>The &ldquo;harvest now, decrypt later&rdquo; threat where attackers steal encrypted data today to unlock it in future once more powerful technologies become available to break the encryption.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /><span>The WFE Global Cybersecurity Working Group recently conducted a preliminary survey on the Quantum Computing Preparedness, the results of which highlight the importance of other competing priorities. In particular, Generative AI risks are viewed as far more urgent and immediate, consuming most organisational attention and investment. Quantum Computing is seen as a longer-term threat, with many firms hesitant to commit too many resources until clearer timelines or stable standards emerge.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>Most WFE members estimate a 5&ndash;10+ year window before cryptographically relevant quantum computers (CRQCs) emerge, in line with NIST FAQs. Consequently, resourcing remains proportionate to a long-term risk, not an imminent one, and shouldn&rsquo;t be prioritised at the expense of more immediate operational concerns such as AI-driven threats and Cyber Resiliency.

<ul>
<li>Actively monitoring regulatory guidance, vendor progress, and developments in NIST standardisation. Several are incorporating Quantum Computing discussions into risk committees and cyber governance forums.</li>
<li>Preliminary quantum risk assessments.</li>
<li>Including quantum-safe encryption criteria in procurement and vendor evaluation cycles.</li>
<li>Considering projects to map existing cryptographic assets, as the first step in any migration roadmap.</li>
<li>Working with the WFE to develop a best-practice guide on quantum transition, and a structured roadmap for market infrastructures.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /><strong>Nandini Sukumar, CEO of the World Federation of Exchanges</strong><span>, said, &ldquo;While Quantum Computing readiness is undoubtedly important, the migration to post-quantum cryptography remains a long-term undertaking, and the practical groundwork - planning, asset mapping, and vendor coordination - should be paced appropriately. Whilst exchanges recognise that Quantum Computing is a meaningful risk, regulators must understand that preparation should not deflect from more imminent risks related to AI and Cyber Resilience.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span>Read the full paper&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://world-exchanges.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=48ddcbc11eb58f141a51219ea&amp;id=81015be5c0&amp;e=979576350c" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a><span>.</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The inaugural edition of Dubai&nbsp;Future Finance Week (DFFW) will take place from 11 to 15 May 2026, convening&nbsp;international leaders from the finance, policy, technology and investment sectors through a&nbsp;coordinated programme of high-level forums held across the emirate. As global financial&nbsp;markets undergo accelerated structural change, the Week will provide a strategic platform&nbsp;for dialogue, collaboration and the exchange of insights on the future of the global financial&nbsp;ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organised under the directives and patronage of&nbsp;<span>His Highness Sheikh Maktoum bin&nbsp;Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, First Deputy Ruler of Dubai, Deputy Prime Minister&nbsp;and Minister of Finance of the UAE, and President of the Dubai International Financial&nbsp;Centre (DIFC)</span>, the Week underscores Dubai&rsquo;s role in advancing dialogue on the evolving&nbsp;dynamics of capital markets, innovation, sustainability and governance.</p>
<p>His Highness Sheikh Maktoum bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum said the event reflects&nbsp;Dubai&rsquo;s commitment to playing a key role in shaping a smart and sustainable global economy.&nbsp;The participation of leading decision-makers, thinkers and innovators from the financial&nbsp;services sector in the event provides an important opportunity to bring perspectives closer together, align efforts to address shared global challenges, and support dialogue on the future&nbsp;of the global financial sector, His Highness said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>HH Sheikh Maktoum added that the event also opens new avenues for cooperation and&nbsp;supports innovation. He noted that the gathering encourages effective participation that&nbsp;enables markets to achieve greater growth and prosperity, while supporting the objectives of&nbsp;the Dubai Economic Agenda D33, particularly positioning Dubai among the world&rsquo;s top four&nbsp;global financial centres and building a smart, diversified economy that keeps pace with future&nbsp;requirements.</p>
<p>Designed as an integrated, citywide platform and led by DIFC, Dubai Future Finance Week&nbsp;brings together several major industry forums under a single, cohesive agenda, themed&nbsp;&lsquo;Finance Reimagined: Where innovation meets policy and purpose&rsquo;. At its core is the Dubai&nbsp;FinTech Summit (DFS) with the theme of Connecting Markets &ndash; Transforming Economies,&nbsp;held under the patronage of His Highness Sheikh Maktoum bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al&nbsp;Maktoum, which serves as the Week&rsquo;s main event, shaping its momentum and convening&nbsp;global leaders to advance dialogue on the future of finance.</p>
<p>Over five days, venues across Dubai will host discussions spanning the full spectrum of&nbsp;modern finance, from capital markets, private wealth and institutional investment to digital&nbsp;assets and sustainability-led finance. Each event within the programme explores a distinct&nbsp;area of financial transformation, enabling participants to engage directly with global&nbsp;institutions, industry leaders and policymakers through a set of complementary forums.&nbsp;Together, they provide a structured environment for cross-sector insight and practical&nbsp;engagement on emerging areas of opportunity.<br /><br />By situating these discussions within a single, coordinated week, Dubai Future Financial Week&nbsp;will enable participants to connect themes that are often addressed in isolation. This&nbsp;integrated approach will allow attendees to examine how developments in one area influence&nbsp;progress in another and engage on priorities that cut across traditional boundaries.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>His Excellency Essa Kazim, Governor of DIFC</span>, said: &ldquo;Dubai&rsquo;s vision is to shape the global economy, and Dubai Future Finance Week is a natural extension of that ambition. It highlights the emirate&rsquo;s role as a catalyst for ideas, collaboration and forward-looking growth across international markets, and it underscores our determination here at DIFC to help set the pace for global financial and economic progress. The Week will strengthen this position by enabling engagement across finance, technology, regulation and investment, in support of the ambitions set out under the Dubai Economic Agenda D33.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>His Excellency Arif Amiri, Chief Executive Officer of DIFC Authority,</span>&nbsp;said: &ldquo;Dubai Future&nbsp;Finance Week reflects our commitment to providing platforms that bring the global financial&nbsp;community together to navigate change and identify new opportunities. As the region&rsquo;s&nbsp;leading global financial centre, DIFC is well positioned to offer a unified and focused&nbsp;environment for senior decision-makers to engage on priority issues. As global markets&nbsp;continue to evolve, Dubai plays a key role in shaping the future of finance through the depth&nbsp;of its ecosystem and its international connectivity.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Programme highlights</span><br />A central pillar of the programme, the Dubai FinTech Summit will return to Madinat Jumeirah&nbsp;with an expanded format designed to accelerate global collaboration and growth&nbsp;opportunities for FinTechs, scale-ups and investors. The summit will convene more than&nbsp;10,000 delegates from over 150 countries, alongside more than 1,000 investors, and over 300&nbsp;regional and international speakers, and over 250 sponsors, spanning over more than 25&nbsp;industry verticals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 2026 edition will feature a dedicated Investors&rsquo; Lounge and Deal Hub, new country&nbsp;pavilions to enhance cross-border partnerships, and curated content streams examining&nbsp;emerging trends in digital finance, AI-driven technologies and regulatory innovation. These&nbsp;developments build on the Summit&rsquo;s continued momentum and its contribution to the region&rsquo;s&nbsp;financial innovation landscape, supported by DIFC&rsquo;s ongoing growth as a global hub for&nbsp;financial innovation.</p>
<p>The Week will feature platforms that examine the systems and standards underpinning the&nbsp;future of financial services. Seamless FinTech Middle East will feature discussions on digital&nbsp;commerce, payments and financial infrastructure, while the Reg3 Forum will bring together&nbsp;regulators, policymakers and market participants to explore supervisory innovation and the&nbsp;evolution of cross-border regulatory frameworks. Together, these forums provide a&nbsp;foundation for addressing how global financial systems can remain connected, efficient and&nbsp;forward-looking.</p>
<p>There will also be leading gatherings focused on long-term capital allocation and sustainable&nbsp;economic growth. The DIFC Family Wealth Centre Summit will examine the priorities of family&nbsp;enterprises and the expanding role of private markets, while the Future Sustainability Forum&nbsp;will explore the growing importance of sustainability-led finance and climate-aligned&nbsp;investment. In parallel, the Islamic Finance Forum will highlight developments across Sharia-aligned markets, reflecting Dubai&rsquo;s established role as a global centre for Islamic finance.<br /><br />Additional platforms within the programme will provide perspective on wider sector&nbsp;performance, emerging economic models and venture activity across the region. Highlights&nbsp;include the MENA Banking Excellence Awards, which recognise transformation within the&nbsp;banking sector; the Solana Economic Zone, offering insights into decentralised technologies&nbsp;and digital economic models; IPEM Future Dubai, convening private-market leaders to assess&nbsp;capital flows and investment trends; and the Dubai Future District Fund annual meeting,&nbsp;showcasing developments from the emirate&rsquo;s venture and innovation ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Collectively, the programme represents the broadest and most comprehensive gathering of&nbsp;finance and future-focused events in the region, offering institutions, innovators and&nbsp;policymakers a single platform through which to engage on shared priorities, explore new&nbsp;areas of opportunity and contribute to the sector&rsquo;s long-term development.<br /><br />Organisations and partners wishing to participate in the Week or contribute to its wider&nbsp;programme can register at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.difc.com/whats-on/news/www.dubaifuturefinanceweek.com">www.dubaifuturefinanceweek.com</a>.</p>
