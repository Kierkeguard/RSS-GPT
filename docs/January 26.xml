<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>Scila, the leading independent provider of trade surveillance and risk management technology, today reports a significant expansion in the energy and commodities sector. During the second half of 2025, the company achieved a combined total of more than 10 new contract wins and successful deployments, reinforcing its position as a preferred partner for complex energy market participants.<br /><br />The surge in demand in this customer segment is largely driven by the implementation of the REMIT II regulation, a comprehensive EU framework designed to increase market integrity and transparency. As this regulation demands more sophisticated monitoring of algorithmic trading and order book data, energy players are increasingly seeking Scila&rsquo;s robust, engineering-first platform to ensure full domain specific adherence to the new standards.<br /><br />Scila&rsquo;s recent successes span the entire energy value chain, from commodity trading houses and international producers to major utilities and prominent interdealer brokers (IDBs). The company&rsquo;s solutions also continue to serve as the benchmark for leading energy exchanges and regulators worldwide.<br /><br /><em>&ldquo;This high volume of commercial activity and successful go-lives is a clear validation from the market on our ongoing more than decade-long commitment to providing world-class technology to the energy sector,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;says Mikko Andersson, CEO of Scila.&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Energy market participants realize that navigating the complexities of REMIT II and modern trading requires an organization that is as robust and scalable as the systems we deliver. With nearly 90% of our staff dedicated to R&amp;D and delivery, we provide a level of direct technical expertise that is unique in this industry.&rdquo;</em><br /><br />Scila has a long-standing history of attracting and retaining the world&rsquo;s largest and most influential trading organizations. Originally established as a pioneer in trade and market surveillance, the company has successfully expanded its offering to include innovative and high-performance solutions within risk management, capable of handling massive data volumes across regional and global markets in real-time with true multi-asset capabilities.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Regarding our recent inflow of energy-focused customers and the REMIT II driver, we are seeing a distinct trend where organizations that initially utilized rudimentary solutions are now turning to Scila after encountering operational limitations,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;says Lars Gr&auml;ns Rohde, Chief Revenue Officer at Scila.&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Our ability to deliver unified, high-performance solutions to global supermajors and the most demanding commodity traders proves that our technology is built for the deepest challenges of the global energy markets.&rdquo;</em></p>

This change reflects the firm&rsquo;s ongoing growth across jurisdictions and the continued development of its senior partner model. The new name aligns with how MKI operates today, supporting institutional investors and listed companies in complex, event-driven situations shaped by stakeholder behaviour and judgement.</span><br id="isPasted" /><br /><span>MKI&rsquo;s work increasingly spans multiple geographies, with a presence in both Europe and the United States. The advisory group&rsquo;s approach is grounded in experience, accountability, and independent judgement, delivered by a team of senior partners.</span><br id="isPasted" /><br /><span>"I&rsquo;m delighted that we are now operating as MKI Global Partners. The name reflects how the business has evolved and the international nature of our work,&rdquo; said&nbsp;</span><span>Mark Kelly, CEO of MKI Global Partners.</span><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Our industry is full of opinions. We focus on fact-based intelligence. Our clients don&rsquo;t need more noise; they need relevant, connected and genuinely new information that helps them make better decisions in complex situations.&rdquo;</span><br id="isPasted" /><br /><span>MKI applies a consistent discipline when gathering and delivering intelligence. Insights must be relevant, connected to the client&rsquo;s priorities, and not already understood by the client.</span><br id="isPasted" /><br /><span>This approach supports investors who face rapidly changing event-driven scenarios. It also benefits corporates, where boards and leadership teams need quality intelligence to understand likely responses from key parties and therefore connect perspectives across advisory disciplines.</span><br id="isPasted" /><br /><span>The firm&rsquo;s remit increasingly extends beyond shareholders to include a broader set of stakeholders such as creditors, regulators, governments, unions, professional services firms and other influencers whose motivations can be decisive in high-stakes situations.</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced the following enforcement updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>CFTC Obtains Federal Court Order Imposing Civil Monetary Penalties and Trading Bans on Precious Metals Spoofers&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois entered two consent orders against&nbsp;<strong>Gregg Smith&nbsp;</strong>of New York and&nbsp;<strong>Michael Nowak&nbsp;</strong>of New Jersey for spoofing in the precious metals futures markets while employed at a major bank.</p>
<p>Under the orders, Smith must pay a $200,000 civil monetary penalty and is barred from trading in CFTC markets or registering with the CFTC for three years. Nowak must pay a $150,000 civil monetary penalty and is barred from trading and registration for six months. Both defendants are also required to cease and desist from further violating the spoofing prohibition in the Commodity Exchange Act.</p>
<p>The consent order resolves a CFTC enforcement action filed in September 2019 [<em>See</em>&nbsp;CFTC Press Release No.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8013-19">8013-19</a>].</p>
<p><span>In a related criminal case, Smith and Nowak were convicted of fraud, attempted price manipulation, and spoofing. In August 2023, Smith was sentenced to two years in prison and ordered to pay a $50,000 fine, and Nowak was sentenced to one year and a day in prison and ordered to pay a $35,000 fine.&nbsp;</span><em>United States v. Smith</em><span>, No. 19 Cr. 669 (N.D. Ill.).</span></p>
<p><span>See&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/12886/ENFSmithConsentOrder122225/download"><span>Smith Order</span></a><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/12881/ENFNowakConsentOrder122225/download"><span>Nowak Order</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><strong>CFTC Secures Federal Court Order Requiring Florida Resident, Firm to Pay Over $335,000 for Misappropriating Confidential Information, Fictitious Trading</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas entered a consent order imposing permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement, and civil monetary penalties against&nbsp;<strong>Peter Miller&nbsp;</strong>of Miami, and his firm&nbsp;<strong>Omerta Capital LLC</strong>.</p>
<p>Under the order, the defendants, jointly and severally, must pay $135,788 in disgorgement, representing their unlawful gains, and a $200,000 civil monetary penalty. The order also bans the defendants from registration and all trading for 18 months and from block trading for five years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The consent order resolves all claims the CFTC brought against the defendants in the complaint filed in December 2021 and amended in December 2022 [See CFTC Press Release Nos.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8468-21">8468-21</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8634-22">8634-22</a>].</p>
<p>In a related criminal case, the Department of Justice charged Miller in December 2021, with one count of conspiracy to commit commodities fraud based on conduct alleged in the CFTC&rsquo;s complaint. [United States v. Peter Miller, No. 4:21-cr-00570 (S.D. Tex. Dec. 10, 2021)]. Miller pleaded guilty and was sentenced in June 2024 to five months in prison and five months of home confinement. He was also ordered to pay $135,788 in criminal forfeiture.&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, President Hasner, for the kind introduction. It is an honor to speak at Florida Atlantic University, and I am glad to have the chance to talk with those here from the American Institute for Economic Research and the Shadow Open Market Committee.</p>
<p>I especially appreciate the opportunity to discuss my economic outlook at the start of the new year. It is a task made considerably easier with the gradual return of federal government data, which was disrupted by last year's lapse in funding. The lack of data reinforced two long-held beliefs for me. One, how grateful I am for the dedicated service of the statistical agencies to keep policymakers, businesses, and the public informed about the state of the economy. And, two, how important it is to have access to an array of data beyond what those agencies provide. That includes data produced by the Federal Reserve System, state governments, and a wide variety of private-sector sources. All of those data sources inform my view of the economy and help me make monetary policy decisions.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-slide2-20260116.jpg" id="fig2">Today</a>, I will start by sharing my outlook for the economy at the start of 2026. Next, I will discuss the implications of that outlook for the path of monetary policy. And, finally, I will discuss some recent developments in monetary policy implementation, which I know is of interest to many of you in this room. As a reminder, these views are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues.</p>
<p><span>Economic Outlook</span><br />I am starting 2026 with a cautiously optimistic point of view. Conditions in the labor market appear to be stabilizing, and I see the economy as well positioned to continue to grow while inflation returns to a pathway toward our 2 percent objective. The most recent data indicate that economic activity has remained strong. In the third quarter of 2025, gross domestic product rose at an annual rate of 4.3 percent. As you can see in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-slide3-20260116.jpg" id="fig3">figure 1</a>, that was a sharp acceleration from the first half of last year, mostly reflecting strong consumer spending and an upward swing in net exports, which can be volatile. Business investment grew at a solid rate in the third quarter, while residential investment continued to be soft. Fourth-quarter growth is likely to be restrained due to the effects of the government shutdown. Still, excluding those effects, I see the economy expanding at a solid pace of about 2 percent in the near term.</p>
<p>Looking at the labor market, job growth moderated last year, and the unemployment rate edged higher. In November and December, employers added about 50,000 jobs to payrolls each month, as you can see in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-slide4-20260116.jpg" id="fig4">figure 2</a>. This came after payrolls declined in October, largely due to an unusually large number of separations from the federal government. However, even setting aside October, the broader trend last year showed slower job creation than in 2024. At least part of the slowdown in the job market reflects a decline in the growth of the labor force due to lower immigration and labor force participation. However, labor demand has softened as well. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate, shown in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-slide5-20260116.jpg" id="fig5">figure 3</a>, ended the year at 4.4 percent, up modestly from 4.1 percent at the end of the previous year.</p>
<p>That said, the labor market is not deteriorating rapidly, as layoffs remain low; however, hiring remains low as well.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-slide6-20260116.jpg" id="fig6">Figure 4</a>&nbsp;shows that there were 0.9 available jobs in November for every unemployed American seeking work. While that level is normally consistent with a solid labor market, the ratio is considerably lower than a few years ago, when labor market conditions were much tighter early in the pandemic recovery. In this less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market, the downside risks to employment appear to have risen. My baseline, however, is for the unemployment rate to hold steady throughout this year.</p>
<p>Considering the other part of our dual mandate, inflation remains somewhat elevated from our 2 percent goal. As you know, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) targets the rate of increase in the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index; however, due to the government shutdown, the most recent available PCE price data are for September 2025. For this reason, I find it informative to review consumer price index (CPI) data to get a timelier sense of the direction of inflation, even if it does not directly translate to our inflation target. Over the longer term, both CPI and PCE measures tell a similar story. Data released earlier this week showed that the CPI rose 2.7 percent over the 12 months ending in December, the same rate as November. Core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, rose 2.6 percent, also matching November's reading. You can see in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-slide7-20260116.jpg" id="fig7">figure 5</a>&nbsp;that both headline and core measures of inflation have eased significantly from their highs in mid-2022. However, that progress slowed over the past year or so, and inflation remains at a level that is above readings consistent with our inflation target.</p>
<p>Looking at the subcomponents of core CPI, shown in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-slide8-20260116.jpg" id="fig8">figure 6</a>, we can see why there has been a slowdown in the pace of disinflation. Over the past year, we have seen further notable declines in services inflation&mdash;rent of shelter as well as other non-energy services&mdash;but these have been offset by an increase in core goods price inflation. Looking at the three buckets separately, shelter inflation, shown by the black dot-dashed line, has continued to decline, and core services inflation excluding shelter, the red dashed line, has also been on a downward trend, albeit on a somewhat bumpier path. Those readings are consistent with overall inflation moving back toward our target. What is inconsistent with a return to 2 percent inflation is the rise in core good prices. Following very high readings during the pandemic, goods inflation fell sharply, reaching its pre-pandemic range in 2023, and fluctuated roughly in that range until 2025. Last year, core goods price inflation picked up markedly, to 1.4 percent over the 12 months ending in December 2025, at least in part reflecting increased tariffs filtering through to certain goods prices.</p>
<p>While some upside risks remain, moving forward I expect to see inflation return to a sustainable path back to our 2 percent target. It is a reasonable base case that the effects of tariffs on inflation will not be long-lasting&mdash;effectively, a one-time shift in the price level. My view that inflation will resume a path toward our goal is consistent with near-term measures of inflation expectations declining from their peaks last year, as reflected in both market- and survey-based measures. And most measures of longer-term expectations remain consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal.</p>
<p><span>Monetary Policy</span><br />Although I am cautiously optimistic about the path ahead, as a monetary policymaker, I do confront a challenging situation. With the downside risks to employment having risen last year, I viewed the balance of risks as having shifted. As a result, I supported the FOMC's decisions to reduce the policy interest rate last year. I viewed that as the right step to balance the upside risk of persistent above-target inflation and the downside risk of a deteriorating labor market. This policy stance puts the economy in a good position moving forward.</p>
<p>As shown in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-slide9-20260116.jpg" id="fig9">figure 7</a>, since the middle of 2024, the Committee has reduced the policy rate by 1.75 percentage points. In my view, those moves have brought the federal funds rate into a range consistent with the neutral rate &mdash; a rate that neither stimulates nor restricts economic activity. I look forward to our upcoming policy meeting, which will be held in less than two weeks. While I do not want to prejudge the decision that will take place there, in my view, the current policy stance leaves us well positioned to determine the extent and timing of additional adjustments to our policy rate based on the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.</p>
<p><span>Monetary Policy Implementation</span><br />Now, let me turn to monetary policy implementation. I'll begin with a bit of history to provide a backdrop for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-slide10-20260116.jpg" id="fig10">recent developments</a>.</p>
<p>In January 2019, following many years of successful implementation along with extensive deliberations, the FOMC formally adopted its ample-reserves implementation framework.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20260116a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;Some key advantages of this framework include successful control of the policy rate in a variety of conditions and effective transmission to other money market rates and broader financial conditions. The FOMC defined this framework as one where "control over the level of the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates is exercised primarily through the setting of the Federal Reserve's administered rates, and in which active management of the supply of reserves is not required."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20260116a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;Therefore, the supply of reserves needs to be sufficiently large to meet the demand for reserves on most days.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, I'll now discuss recent developments in monetary policy implementation. As of December 2025, the FOMC concluded the process of reducing the size of the Fed's balance sheet that began in mid-2022 by halting the reduction of the Fed's asset holdings. During this process, we successfully reduced our securities holdings by about $2.2 trillion. This asset runoff affected not only our assets, but also our liabilities such as the reserves in the banking system and the level of overnight reverse repurchase agreement (repo) operation balances.</p>
<p>At the beginning of balance sheet runoff in 2022, reserves were at an abundant level of around $3.5 trillion. As the balance sheet shrank over the next few years, the federal funds rate remained about 7 basis points below the interest on reserve balances (IORB) rate for most of this period. The decline in the level of reserves from an abundant level toward an ample level exerted upward pressure on money market rates in recent months. As the level of reserves declined, repo rates started to increase and became more volatile. We began to see intensified rate pressures, especially on tax payment days and Treasury securities settlement days, when large flows into the Treasury General Account (TGA), another liability of the Fed, led to corresponding declines in the amount of reserves in the banking system. The federal funds rate started to move up steadily in its target range, and it now stands at 1 basis point below the IORB rate. These and other indicators of tightening money market conditions were what we expected to see as reserves declined toward the range of ample reserves.</p>
<p>It is important to note that while ending the asset runoff slows down the decline in reserves, it does not completely halt this process. Even when the Fed's assets remain constant, trend growth in non-reserve liabilities, particularly currency in circulation, will continue to absorb reserves over time. There is also significant cyclical variation in the supply of reserve balances, reflecting seasonal changes in the TGA and other factors. Furthermore, the demand for reserves is not static but rather dynamic, influenced by various factors including economic growth and changes in the financial system. Consequently, to maintain an ample reserves level&mdash;a key operational objective of our current monetary policy implementation framework&mdash;the FOMC must expand its balance sheet commensurately with the public's demand for its liabilities. This necessitates a nuanced and forward-looking approach to balance sheet management that considers both cyclical and structural factors affecting the demand for and supply of reserves.</p>
<p>With the level of bank reserves judged to have declined to an ample level, the FOMC initiated reserve management purchases in December 2025. This was the crucial next step in balance sheet management to maintain ample reserves and ensure effective interest rate control, as consistent with the plan we adopted in May 2022.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20260116a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a></p>
<p>It is important to note that reserve management purchases are not quantitative easing (QE). Each process has a distinct purpose, with different goals and economic implications. QE represents a monetary policy tool deployed when the federal funds rate is constrained by the effective lower bound. The primary objective of QE is to provide economic stimulus by exerting downward pressure on long-term interest rates. This has been achieved typically through large-scale purchases of longer-term Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities. These purchases are intended to influence the yield curve and broader financial conditions by removing duration risk held by the public for a given setting of short-term interest rate policy.</p>
<p>In contrast, reserve management purchases involve the acquisition of Treasury bills and other short-term Treasury securities in a manner that further normalizes the average maturity of the Federal Reserve's asset holdings. They help implement the short-term interest rate policy decided on by the Committee but do not alter broader financial conditions. These routine purchases are conducted to maintain ample reserves and ensure effective control over short-term interest rates. The pace and size of these purchases are calibrated to meet demand for reserve balances and to adjust reserve supply as other items on the liabilities side of our balance sheet grow over time. These purchases do not have any implications for the stance of monetary policy.</p>
<p>As detailed in the statement released by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at the conclusion of our December 2025 FOMC meeting, reserve management purchases will be front-loaded for the first few months to alleviate potential near-term pressures in money markets.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20260116a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;Thereafter, we expect the pace of reserve management purchases to decline, though the actual size will depend on seasonal fluctuations in non-reserve liabilities and market conditions. In the end, the size of our balance sheet will be determined by the public's demand for our liabilities in our ample-reserves regime.</p>
<p>Before concluding, let me also emphasize that in our ample-reserves regime, standing repo operations are a critical tool that helps provide a ceiling on money market rates. By doing so, these operations ensure that the federal funds rate remains within its target range, even on days of elevated pressures in money markets. Consistent with this view, the FOMC eliminated the aggregate limit on standing repo operations in December 2025.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20260116a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;These operations are intended to support monetary policy implementation and smooth market functioning, and they should be used by our counterparties when deemed economically sensible. This is indeed what we saw over the 2025 year-end period. There was notable upward pressure on repo rates amid substantial net Treasury settlements, as widely expected. Usage increased at the Fed's standing repo operations on year-end as market repo rates increased substantially. Despite the elevated levels of repo rates, trading conditions remained orderly in money markets. I am pleased to see increased usage of our standing repo operations when it becomes economically sensible to do so.</p>
<p><span>Conclusion</span><br />To conclude, I will reiterate that I am cautiously optimistic about the path of the economy while acknowledging that we face risks to both sides of our dual mandate. Consequently, I will continue to watch incoming data carefully so that we can set policy to achieve our mandated goals: maximum employment and stable prices. A critical aspect of achieving these goals is ensuring that the Fed can efficiently and smoothly implement monetary policy decisions. We have taken the necessary steps to ensure that capability and will continue to do so.</p>
<p>Once again, it has been an honor to be here. Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you, and I look forward to our discussion.</p>

<title>Remarks At The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, Paul S. Atkins, SEC Chairman, Tel Aviv-Yafo, Israel, Jan. 16, 2026</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/remarks-at-the-tel-aviv-stock-exchange-paul-s-atkins-sec-chairman-tel-aviv-y-2026116/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Sivan, thank you for that generous introduction. Chairman Zinger, Governor Yaron, and Itai, I am honored to stand alongside each of you this morning and to bring greetings from Washington. Before I share a few reflections, I should like to begin by noting that this marks my first visit to Israel, and that I have been struck both by the beauty of your culture and the strength of your people. Thank you all for the warmth with which you have welcomed me.</p>
<p>Today, we commemorate a new trading week whose benefits, I believe, could be transformative. By moving to Monday through Friday trading, the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange has brought Israel&rsquo;s capital markets into closer alignment with those of its global counterparts. And that alignment, I suspect, will enhance liquidity, encourage greater investment, and send a clear signal to the world that Israel is open for business. Yet even as you take this step to further conform with international markets, I encourage you to preserve the spirit that distinguishes your own. A spirit that has astonishingly produced GDP growth in the middle of a war.</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the State of Israel has punched far above its weight in ways that defy easy explanation. A country with fewer residents than my native state of North Carolina, Israel is short on natural resources, surrounded by uncertainty, yet remarkably rich in resilience and resolve. Home to more startups per capita than anywhere around the world. Second globally in venture capital raised per capita. Among the most companies listed on Nasdaq after the United States. Birthplace of breakthroughs like the USB and drip irrigation. Yours is a nation that has never waited for ideal conditions to pursue prosperity.</p>
<p>Which of course brings us to the broader context in which we assemble today. In recent years especially, Israelis have lived with a level of strain that few societies are asked to endure. While children learned to adapt to the wail of sirens; while reservists fled their desks at work and dinner tables at home; while each of you bore the weight of Israel&rsquo;s longest war, your spirit did not dim. You did not close your markets, permit innovation to pause, nor investment to retreat. In short, you did not allow fear to dictate your future. Instead, Israeli indices soared to new highs. The shekel strengthened against major global currencies. Growth rebounded with force. And projections point to continued investment over the coming year. Crisis seems only to have catalyzed the very progress that it could have constrained.</p>
<p>Of course, this kind of resilience has a name:&nbsp;<em>Hatikvah</em>. Hope. After all, it is hope that has helped to make a barren&nbsp;desert bloom. To turn an ancient land into a hub of high-tech. To bend adversity toward prosperity. It is precisely this ethos that has also made our partnership so strong, for the United States and Israel have long shared more than diplomatic ties and billions in bilateral trade. We are bound by a deep and abiding belief in free enterprise; by the conviction that fair and efficient markets are a force for human flourishing. I am confident that cooperation between our two countries will only deepen in the years ahead because the partnership between our markets and our people only makes both stronger.</p>
<p>So thank you for welcoming me so warmly on my first visit to Israel. Thank you for your leadership, your friendship, and resolve. And congratulations once again on attaining this important milestone. As Israel aligns more closely with the world, may you continue to transform it.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<title>Outlook For The Economy And Monetary Policy, Federal Reserve Vice Chair For Supervision Michelle W. Bowman, At Outlook 26: The New England Economic Forum, Foxborough, Massachusetts</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good morning and thank you for the invitation to join you today.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20260116a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;It is a pleasure to be with you here in Boston at the New England Economic Forum to share my outlook on the economy and monetary policy, and I would like to thank Kathleen Murphy, the CEO of the Massachusetts Bankers Association, for inviting me to speak at your first economic forum.</p>
<p>I am also grateful for the kind introduction from Susan Collins. I greatly value her perspective, and I appreciate the opportunity to work closely with her as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and as a fellow member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).</p>
<p>It is good to see so many bank and business leaders from across the Northeast here at Gillette Stadium. Throughout my time at the Federal Reserve&mdash;and earlier in my career as a community banker&mdash;I have made it a priority to engage directly with bankers and business leaders to better understand how economic conditions affect local communities. These conversations provide important context for my views on the economy and monetary policy.</p>
<p>With the FOMC having concluded its final meeting of 2025 a little over a month ago, and with our next meeting at the end of this month, today I will share my perspective on recent policy decisions, discuss how my assessment of the economy evolved over the past year, review current economic conditions, and then outline my outlook for the economy and monetary policy.</p>
<p>As we enter 2026, the economy has continued to grow, and I see inflation moving closer to our goal. But beneath the surface, the labor market has become more fragile. My focus today is why that fragility poses the greater risk and what that means for the path of policy.</p>
<p><span>Update on Recent Monetary Policy Decisions</span><br />At our September meeting last year, the Committee resumed the process of gradually removing policy restraint and bringing the federal funds rate closer to its neutral level. At that meeting, and again at our meetings in October and December, the Committee voted to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, bringing the range to 3-1/2 to 3-3/4 percent.</p>
<p>These decisions were intended to proactively limit the risk of greater and more persistent damage to the labor market, while inflation continued to show signs that it is on a sustained downward trajectory toward our 2 percent objective. The policy rate now reflects a total of 75 basis points of cuts since September and is closer to my estimate of its neutral level.</p>
<p>I voted in favor of each of these actions in light of the weakening in labor market conditions and my expectation that inflation, excluding the effects of tariffs, would soon be within close range of our 2 percent goal. Looking ahead, as we gather additional evidence on economic activity, labor market conditions, and inflation, it will be important to continue assessing the appropriate path of policy and the timing of further adjustments.</p>
<p><span>How My Views on the Economy Evolved over the Past Year</span><br />Before turning to current economic conditions, I would like to spend a few minutes explaining how my views on the economy and monetary policy evolved over the past year. I believe this context is important, particularly at a time when the balance of risks around our dual mandate has been shifting.</p>
<p>At the December 2024 FOMC meeting, my projections for 2025 anticipated that real gross domestic product (GDP) would rise in the mid&ndash;2 percent range, that core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation would slow by a bit less than one-half percentage point, and that the unemployment rate would increase moderately to about its longer-run level. Those projections also included three quarter-point reductions in the federal funds rate over the course of 2025. In hindsight, the economy seems to have evolved largely in line with those expectations, especially if we consider inflation excluding the estimated effect of tariffs.</p>
<p>Throughout much of last year, I reserved judgment on the effects of new policy initiatives and instead maintained an overall optimistic view of the economy. In particular, I did not assume that changes in trade or immigration policy would necessarily lead to persistent inflationary pressures or large negative effects on economic activity. I also considered the potential for positive supply-side effects from other policy developments, including regulatory changes, tax policy, and a business-friendly approach.</p>
<p>With respect to trade policy, I expected that initial tariff proposals would likely be scaled back over time, that there would be little retaliation from trade partners, and that foreign producers, importers, and consumers would adjust in ways that would help limit pass-through to inflation. Substitution across goods and suppliers appeared to play an important role in moderating the effects of tariffs on both economic activity and prices.</p>
<p>On immigration, I anticipated that a reduced inflow of new immigrants would restrain demand for rental and affordable housing and ease upward pressure on housing inflation in the near term. While changes in population affect both supply and demand, I viewed the near-term demand effects as particularly relevant for inflation dynamics. I also expected relatively small effects on GDP growth from lower immigration, despite reduced labor supply and employment growth, as these new immigrants tend to have lower income and be less productive than the overall U.S. workforce.</p>
<p>Although inflation remained a concern for me early in the year, my assessment shifted as I began to see clearer signs of slowing economic growth and increasing fragility in the labor market. I became more confident that the inflationary effects of tariffs would largely be one-off, as I observed growing evidence that businesses were less able to pass through higher costs to consumers. I saw this as a sign of weakness in demand and consistent with the cooling labor market. These developments led me to place increasing weight on risks to employment and to signal a shift in my balance of risks in June, after which I dissented at the July meeting favoring a 25-basis point reduction to reflect this shift.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20260116a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a></p>
<p>Economic activity seems to have been supported by a surge in equity prices and investment activity related to artificial intelligence (AI). Although stock market valuations may appear stretched, expected earnings growth for AI-related companies has been high, and, so far, a substantial part of the investment has been self-financed. I am concerned that disappointing news on AI investment returns could lead to a sharp correction in equity prices, but the economy continues to show elevated productivity growth likely due, in part, to increased adoption of AI technologies.</p>
<p>Higher productivity gains have helped ease inflationary pressures and encouraged me to support cutting the policy rate last year, especially since we have not seen consistent signs that the labor market is stabilizing.</p>
<p><span>Current Economic Conditions</span><br />Turning to current economic conditions, the U.S. economy has been resilient and has continued to expand at a solid pace, but I remain concerned about signs of fragility in the labor market. I am also increasingly confident that inflation will come down toward 2 percent as tariff effects on goods inflation continue to wane in coming months.</p>
<p>Real GDP growth appears to have exceeded 2 percent last year. Although growth was somewhat volatile, it still averaged close to its pace in 2024 despite the drag from lower immigration, especially if we consider the effects of the government shutdown. Growth was supported by strength in business investment, including data center projects and a surge in high-tech AI investment. These types of projects tend to be relatively insensitive to interest rates and have the potential to significantly raise productivity.</p>
<p>At the same time, other areas of demand softened last year. Consumer spending and residential investment weakened, as slower growth in real disposable income and house prices weighed on demand. The weakness in housing activity and prices over the past year likely reflected some pullback in housing demand. Elevated mortgage rates may have exerted a more persistent drag as income growth expectations declined and house prices remained high relative to rents. Given very low housing affordability, existing home sales have remained depressed since 2023 and at levels only comparable with the early 2010s following the financial crisis. But the recent firming in house prices and home sales seems encouraging, suggesting less restraint on housing demand following the decline in mortgage rates since the middle of last year.</p>
<p>The latest data releases show that GDP significantly increased in the third quarter, as consumer spending accelerated, but likely slowed in the fourth quarter, reflecting a drag from the government shutdown and softer momentum in retail sales through November, consistent with recent weakness in personal income. Disappointingly, residential investment seems on track to decline again in the fourth quarter. Although home sales are rising in response to lower mortgage rates, residential improvements and new construction activity have remained slow.</p>
<p><em>Labor Market Conditions</em><br />Over the past year, as unemployment rose and payroll employment flattened out, we saw labor market conditions gradually weaken. During that time, the unemployment rate increased substantially to 4.4 percent in December, reflecting a decline in hiring rather than a sharp increase in layoffs, as many firms appeared focused on retaining workers rather than expanding payrolls. Payroll employment growth slowed significantly, and job gains became increasingly concentrated in a relatively small number of nonbusiness service industries. Private job gains averaged only about 30,000 per month in the fourth quarter, well below what is needed to keep the unemployment rate from rising, with job gains more than accounted for by the health-care and social services industries, suggesting that labor demand has continued to gradually soften since early last year. Wage growth has slowed to a pace consistent with 2 percent inflation, reflecting both easing labor demand and strong productivity growth, and the labor market is no longer a significant source of inflationary pressure.</p>
<p>Although the labor market is still near full employment, it has become increasingly more fragile and could continue to deteriorate in the coming months. The rise in unemployment has been experienced mostly by demographic groups that tend to be more affected by the business cycle. The share of those working part time for economic reasons, meaning not by choice, has increased considerably over the past two months. This has coincided with a rise in the share of multiple job holders, suggesting that an increasing number of workers struggle to make ends meet.</p>
<p>Job gains have been concentrated in just a few services industries that tend to be less affected by the business cycle. The share of industries with positive job growth over the past six months has been hovering around historically low levels. Private payroll employment may have started to fall in recent months, as the sizable upward bias in the published data implied by the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages seems to have persisted at least through the second quarter.</p>
<p>Although initial claims for unemployment insurance have remained low, there are signs that layoffs may have increased as Challenger private job cut announcements have reached their highest 12‑month level since 2010, outside of the pandemic. We could see layoffs rise quickly since job openings have softened and hiring rates are already low. The share of long-term unemployed workers reached 26 percent in December, the highest since early 2022, reflecting a less dynamic, low-hiring, low-firing labor market that some have said is giving rise to a jobless expansion.</p>
<p>All of these indicators point to growing labor market fragility, and this configuration of the labor market raises the risk that conditions could deteriorate further if demand does not strengthen. With hiring rates already low, layoffs could rise more quickly if firms begin to reassess their staffing needs in response to weaker activity.</p>
<p><em>Inflation Developments</em><br />On inflation, we have seen considerable progress in lowering the underlying trend, considering that still-elevated inflation mostly reflects tariff effects that I expect will fade this year. When those effects are taken into account, core PCE inflation appears to be much closer to 2 percent.</p>
<p>Based on the latest consumer and producer price reports, 12‑month core PCE inflation likely stood at 2.9 percent in December. However, after removing estimated tariff effects, core PCE inflation would have hovered close to 2 percent in recent months, well below the 3 percent reading at the end of 2024. This progress in the underlying trend of inflation reflects a considerable slowing in core services inflation, consistent with the easing in labor market pressures and housing inflation given the weakness in market rents.</p>
<p>The underlying trend in core PCE inflation appears to be moving much closer to our 2 percent target than is currently showing in the data. Core services inflation is already roughly consistent with our target, and only core goods inflation remains elevated, but I expect it to start moving down in coming months as the effects of earlier price increases and one-time tariff-related adjustments fade.</p>
<p><span>Economic Outlook and Risks</span><br />Looking ahead, my baseline expectation is that economic activity will continue to expand at a solid pace and the labor market will stabilize near full employment as monetary policy becomes less restrictive. Less restrictive regulations, lower business taxes, and a more favorable business environment will continue to boost supply&mdash;largely due to higher productivity&mdash;and more than offset any negative effects on economic activity and inflation from tariffs. As the tariff effects continue to wane, these supply-side policies, along with strength in AI-related investment, will continue to boost productivity gains and help ensure that inflation remains on a downward path.</p>
<p>That said, the outlook is subject to risks on both sides of our mandate, and those risks are not symmetric. On the inflation side, potential upside risks include renewed pressures in services prices, a change in firms' pricing behavior, or disruptions to global supply chains stemming from trade or geopolitical developments. This could include changes to oil prices based on reactions to recent events in Venezuela and in the Middle East.</p>
<p>While the risks merit close monitoring, I currently view them as less likely to materialize in a sustained way. First, there has been willingness to negotiate trade policy, and supply chains have largely been unaffected thus far. Second, foreign suppliers and importers have been adjusting to the new tariffs, and there are many anecdotes of businesses being unwilling to raise prices because of higher consumer price sensitivity, especially among low-income consumers. Reduced immigration will also continue to lessen demand, especially for housing, and will be a drag on inflation.</p>
<p>On the employment side, I continue to see downside risks. Continued softness in hiring, combined with already low hiring rates, means that even a small decline in demand could translate into a larger increase in unemployment. Once firms begin to shift from slowing hiring to reducing head count, labor market conditions could quickly deteriorate.</p>
<p>Memories of pandemic worker shortages are still fresh, and, so far, businesses have mostly maintained, rather than reduced, their workforce. They also seem to be more willing to compress profit margins, since consumers are less willing to accept higher prices. Without a broad improvement in demand conditions, businesses may need to begin to lay off workers, recognizing that it will not be as difficult to rehire given the shift in labor market conditions.</p>
<p><span>The Path Forward for Monetary Policy</span><br />With inflation on a sustained trajectory toward 2 percent and signs of fragility in the labor market, my view is that we should continue to focus on risks to our employment mandate and preemptively stabilize and support labor market conditions. Over the second half of last year, I frequently pointed to a shift in economic conditions and in the balance of risks to our employment and inflation goals. I also noted the signs of weakening labor market conditions shown in the flattening of payroll employment gains and the rise in the unemployment rate. But with a rising unemployment rate and inflation remaining slightly above target, our maximum-employment and price-stability goals have been in tension. With our goals in tension, our framework calls for a balanced approach&mdash;taking into account not only the size of deviations from our goals, but also the likelihood that those deviations could become persistent.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20260116a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a></p>
<p>In considering the appropriate path for monetary policy, my approach remains intentionally proactive and forward looking. It takes time to see the full effects of monetary policy on the economy. Placing too much weight on the most recent data can result in an inherently backward-looking assessment of economic conditions. In my view, that approach increases the risk of falling behind the curve and ultimately requiring more abrupt and larger policy adjustments than would otherwise be necessary.</p>
<p>Instead, we should rely on forecasts that are informed by a broad set of indicators and by ongoing engagement with businesses and communities across the country. In my view, this approach is more likely to capture how the economy will evolve over time. Acting in a timely and measured way, based on how we expect the economy to evolve, can help support employment and price stability while limiting the risk of unnecessary volatility.</p>
<p>With inflation pressures easing&mdash;after excluding one-off tariff effects&mdash;and with the risk that labor market conditions could weaken further, I see policy as moderately restrictive. The labor market can appear to be stable right up until it doesn't. Absent a clear and sustained improvement in labor market conditions, we should remain ready to adjust policy to bring it closer to neutral. We should also avoid signaling that we will pause without identifying that conditions have changed. Doing so will indicate that we are not attentive or responsive to the recent and expected path of the labor market.</p>
<p>At the same time, I want to emphasize that monetary policy is not on a preset course. At each FOMC meeting, my colleagues and I will evaluate incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks to our dual-mandated goals of maximum employment and price stability. I will also continue to meet with a broad range of contacts to inform my assessment of economic conditions and the appropriate stance of policy.</p>
<p><span>Supervisory and Regulatory Priorities</span><br />Before I conclude my remarks today, I would like to briefly touch on the Federal Reserve's supervisory and regulatory agenda, which I know is of particular interest to many of you here today.</p>
<p>While monetary policy often takes center stage, effective supervision and regulation are essential to maintaining a safe, sound, and resilient banking system&mdash;one that supports economic growth and serves communities across the country.</p>
<p>Since the President appointed me as Vice Chair for Supervision last June, we have made meaningful progress on several priorities that will improve transparency, efficiency, and focus within our supervisory and regulatory framework. My objective is to ensure that supervision and regulation are appropriately tailored, risk focused, and grounded in our statutory responsibilities.</p>
<p>Congress has also taken several steps in this regard. The passage of the GENIUS Act (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act), along with ongoing consideration of banking and other digital assets legislation, underscores the importance of regulatory clarity as innovation enables the banking and financial systems to continue to evolve. We are actively working to implement the Federal Reserve's responsibilities under this new law.</p>
<p>Last week, I shared my agenda and provided an update on our work to modernize bank supervision and regulation.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20260116a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;I will highlight a few of these and the concrete steps we have taken since last June to enhance supervision and regulation. We have</p>
<ul>
<li>finalized changes to rationalize the large financial institution ratings framework, to better reflect a firm's condition based on material financial risks</li>
<li>finalized revisions to the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio, returning it to its traditional role as a capital backstop and helping to reduce the risk of market disruptions</li>
<li>proposed recalibration of the community bank leverage ratio to the statutory minimum, providing greater flexibility for eligible community banks</li>
<li>removed reputational risk from the examination toolkit, allowing examiners to focus on material financial risks</li>
<li>issued, for the first time, a set of supervisory operating principles to enhance transparency, accountability, and consistency in examinations&mdash;to benefit both examination staff and the banks we supervise</li>
<li>published a request for information on payments fraud to support a more coordinated and effective response</li>
<li>proposed improvements to reduce volatility in supervisory stress tests and enhance the transparency and public accountability of the stress testing framework</li>
<li>withdrawn climate-related supervisory guidance that diverted supervisory resources away from risks that are material to the safety and soundness of banks</li>
<li>issued a new policy statement to facilitate responsible innovation by Board-supervised banks</li>
<li>initiated a review of regulatory reporting requirements to ensure the data we collect are useful and necessary for supervisory and regulatory purposes</li>
</ul>
<p>While we have made progress, there is more work ahead. We will continue to focus on improving the mergers and acquisitions review process, assessing the appropriateness of capital requirements across the banking system, addressing payments and check fraud, and strengthening examiner training and development.</p>
<p><span>Closing</span><br />As the economy continues to evolve, policy must evolve with it. My focus will remain on acting early enough to preserve both price stability and a strong labor market. Thank you again for the invitation to share my views with you today. It is a pleasure to join you for this forum.</p>

<title>Spain Investors Day Marks The Start Of 2026 For Spanish Markets</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/spain-investors-day-marks-the-start-of-2026-for-spanish-markets-2026116/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/spain-investors-day-marks-the-start-of-2026-for-spanish-markets-2026116/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The 16th edition of Spain Investors Day (SID) showed that the stock market is back in vogue. BME has participated in SID since its inception, whose objective is to promote Spain as an investment destination, and this year, with the IBEX 35 at record highs and attractive stock market multiples, this is more justified than ever. King Felipe VI presided over the opening ceremony, and Prime Minister, Pedro S&aacute;nchez, made the closing</p>
<p>Spain has established itself as one of the most attractive investment destinations in Europe in a complex international context. The Spanish economy has shown high resilience, combining sustained growth, inflation control, record job creation, and improved public finances with a notable reduction in the risk premium and a recovery in international confidence.</p>
<p>In this context, Spanish companies are doing very well. The IBEX 35 is at historic highs and valuations remain clearly attractive: the P/E ratio (times that the profit is reflected in the share price) is 13 times, 2.3 points below its average for the last 37 years and the lowest in Europe (the US is above 28 times). &ldquo;Our average dividend yield of 4.1% is among the highest in the world, and national and international managers indicate that Spain will continue to attract investment after several years off the radar. In short, the stock market is in vogue.&rdquo; With these words, Juan Flames, CEO of BME, referred to the favorable moment for the Spanish stock market during the official SID dinner. Also participating in the opening ceremony were Jos&eacute; Manuel Albares, Minister of Foreign Affairs; Carlos San Basilio, Chairman of the CNMV; and Juan Pablo Garc&iacute;a-Lliber&oacute;s, CCO of AON Spain.</p>
<p>BME has supported this initiative since its inception and, at its 16th edition, had the opportunity to promote the attractiveness of the Spanish market through Bjorn Sibbern, CEO of SIX and Chairman of BME. Sibbern took part in the group photo at the opening ceremony presided over by the King and attended the closing ceremony with the Prime Minister, Pedro S&aacute;nchez.</p>
<p>He also took part in one of the main panels of the meeting: &ldquo;The role of large investors in the development of the Spanish economy.&rdquo; The debate was attended by Manuel de la Rocha, Secretary of State and Director of the Office of Economic Affairs and G20 for the Presidency of the Government; Davies of Abersoch, former UK Minister of Trade and Investment and Chairman of Letterone; Joseph Oughourlian, Chairman of Amber Capital and Grupo PRISA; and Javier Valle, Senior Managing Director of Apollo Global Management. The panel was moderated by Lara Hemzaoui, partner at Linklaters.</p>
<p>In his speech, Bjorn Sibbern highlighted Spain's appeal as an investment destination. "At the last SID, I was optimistic about Spain, but I did not foresee that the IBEX 35 would exceed a 49% increase in value. Trading volume has increased, share prices have risen, and the outlook for 2026 is favorable. I am proud to lead one of the most attractive stock exchanges in Europe.&ldquo; He concluded by saying that &rdquo;we must encourage retail participation so that they can be part of this fantastic market."</p>
<p><span>International context</span></p>
<p>During the various panels, it was identified that institutional stability, commitment to multilateralism, a stronger and more integrated Europe, openness to international trade, and Spain's strategic role as a bridge to Latin America, reinforced by the agreement with Mercosur, are key factors that explain the country's attractiveness. Added to this are the strength of the business fabric, sectoral and geographical diversification, and, notably, the talent of Spanish human capital, considered an essential competitive advantage for attracting productive and long-term investment.</p>
<p>Alongside this positive diagnosis, the debates also identified the main challenges facing the Spanish economy in order to consolidate this favorable cycle. These include the need to accelerate the reduction of public debt, close the productivity gap with Europe and the United States, boost growth, and increase the size of companies. They also include simplifying regulation and improving access to housing. Likewise, the importance of strengthening energy self-sufficiency, advancing investment in defense and innovation, and deepening European integration&mdash;especially in the union of capital markets&mdash;was noted in order to better channel savings toward investment. The final consensus was that Spain is starting from a solid and attractive position, but must take advantage of this moment to continue with structural reforms that guarantee sustainable and competitive growth in the long term.</p>
<p>During the closing ceremony of the SID, Prime Minister Pedro S&aacute;nchez highlighted the solid prospects for the Spanish economy, which is on track to achieve six years of growth and job creation. Finally, he reaffirmed Spain's openness to productive investment, the importance of the agreement with Mercosur, and announced the creation of the &ldquo;Espa&ntilde;a Crece&rdquo; Sovereign Fund to maintain the momentum of the European Next Generation funds, which end this year, and to continue supporting investment in strategic sectors. The Fund will have a base of &euro;10.5 billion and aims to mobilize a further &euro;120 billion through private debt and national and international investments.</p>

<h2>Speech</h2>
<p>Can I start by extending my welcome to all participants in the Bellagio Group, and congratulate the organisers on a timely and highly relevant choice of subject. My role today is some scene setting. I am going to cover three points. First, a reminder of the benefits of open economies and why they need to be supported by an international&nbsp;rules-based system which gives important roles to multilateral institutions. Second, I will set out some of the conditions that help to make this system work. And, finally I will highlight a number of the specific big challenges we face today and must take on.</p>
<p>The benefits of trade and openness in terms of specialisation and larger markets are very well known. So, too, is the need to have rules of the game and some form of commitment and co-ordination device to put these rules into effect and protect legitimate national interests. This may sound reasonable enough, but defining exactly such national interests has been hard, not least because their precise nature and force can change over time. Bretton Woods was a defining moment in terms of institution creation, but it was, of course, context specific &ndash; in the context of beggar my neighbour policies in the inter-war period when the institutional fabric of the gold standard broke down, and then a global war.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of the international rules-based system has a number of key general dependencies.</p>
<p>First, it depends on domestic national support and license&nbsp;<a id="_Hlk219108797"></a>&ndash; it cannot operate in isolation. The goals of international co-operation must sit alongside domestic national policy objectives, but there also must be scope for the international goals to shape those domestic objectives. It cannot be a one-way street and this principle must apply to all participants.</p>
<p>It follows that there is a natural tension between economic globalisation and domestic objectives and economic welfare. We cannot assume this away. Take the case of global imbalances. Our shared objective should be to tackle persistent and excessive imbalances. Effective cooperation should focus on policies that are demonstrably welfare‑improving at home and that, in turn, help to rebalance the global economy. We may not reach the first‑best global outcome (the rarely attainable &lsquo;global planner&rsquo;s optimum&rsquo;), but this approach should bring us materially closer to a mutually beneficial result.</p>
<p>Second, the system must be robust to all states of the world. I will come back to this later in some thoughts on the current context. This requires a considerable degree of flexibility in the design and operation of the institutions and thus the system. In fact, the IFIs I would argue have been pretty good at inventing and re-inventing themselves.</p>
<p>This flexibility of re-invention depends critically on the collective leadership of member countries &ndash; which takes us back to the inbuilt national versus international tension. And, today, we face the challenge of re-invention in a multi-polar world, and one where the nature of the poles is shifting with the revealed tensions. One of the lessons of economic history, going back at least to the nineteenth century and probably further, is that such shifts in polarity invariably strain the operation of the system.</p>
<p>My third point here is that the focus of attention, and tensions, has shifted over time. The outcome of Bretton Woods was more designed around international monetary relations, and that was the focus of the initial decades<sup>1</sup>. I don&rsquo;t want to trivialise the importance of monetary relations today, but the focus of disagreement is now much more on trade. Trade I would argue is more susceptible to domestic pressures than international monetary relations. Why? It raises issues of fairness and equality in domestic political economy much more directly, and thus there is likewise a much more direct link to domestic well-being and domestic interest groups. Trade is more directly blameable &ndash; for instance for changes in relative wages between groups in national economies.</p>
<p>So, I take three points from this opening description of the international system: it depends on domestic license; it must be robust to changing states of the world, and we are seeing change happening; and it is for the moment more about trade, though as a central bank governor I can&rsquo;t wash my hands and say &ldquo;trade doesn&rsquo;t affect my world&rdquo;, it does.</p>
<p>I will now turn to the second theme, namely a number of important conditions which shape the operation of the international system, and how they look in the current setting. I will focus on four such conditions.</p>
<p>The first is that &ndash; put simply &ndash; it is easier to operate the international system during conditions of strong growth in a critical number of the member countries, and more so strong productivity growth which feeds directly living standards. It is easier to liberalise trade and resist protectionism in conditions of more rapid growth, and where that growth acts to alleviate redistributive tensions &ndash; in other words, the growth is inclusive. Broadly speaking, this assisted the relative success of the GATT system of trade agreements<br />post-war.</p>
<p>Today, slower growth, and headwinds to that growth, complicate achieving domestic consensus to support international co-operation and free trade. While it is true that openness supports growth and has reduced global poverty, it can have, and has had, distributional consequences in economies, and there has been an undermining of social capital so-called and domestic cohesion. And, in turn, this creates opposition to openness.</p>
<p>I mentioned headwinds which operate to restrict growth. Today, I see four such headwinds, which is a high number and thus a strong counter&ndash;current to growth. The first is that in terms of productivity cycles &ndash; and to borrow Schumpeter&rsquo;s phraseology &ndash;industrial development involves changes that &ldquo;occurs in discrete rushes&rdquo; separated from each other by spans of comparative quiet<sup>2</sup>. Today, in terms of technology, we have been between such discrete rushes for around the last 15 years. My assumption is that AI and robotics will be the next &ldquo;rush&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The second headwind is that most countries are facing populations that are on average ageing, and this contributes to lower growth and increased demands on fiscal resources.</p>
<p>The third headwind is that for many countries the demands for defence expenditure are increasing. This can contribute to growth, but also adds to fiscal pressures.</p>
<p>And, the fourth headwind comes from Climate-related economic shocks and the consequences of the policies chosen to tackle these shocks.</p>
<p>Taken together, these headwinds to growth are a powerful force to complicate the operation of the international system.</p>
<p>The second contextual issue for the operation of the international system concerns domestic industrial policies. Industrial policy went out of favour in the 1980s, or at least so did the form that was tagged as picking winners and thus anti-competitive. That was then as it were.</p>
<p>Industrial policy is now back with us as an issue &ndash; it has grown in use. But it has &ndash; at least in some of its more modern forms &ndash; also changed in nature. As an example, it can be a response to the headwinds I discussed earlier.</p>
<p>Industrial policy has become a focus of dispute as a potential driver of persistent global imbalances. Preliminary Bank of England Staff work suggests that macro factors remain the dominant drivers, but that industrial policy applied at scale over an extended period &ndash; particularly alongside a relatively closed capital account &ndash; can have material short-to-medium-term effects. Staff are also developing a theoretical framework to clarify the channels through which these effects can arise: industrial policy expands what a country produces, but if domestic absorption is simultaneously suppressed, the excess flows abroad as a current account surplus. Meanwhile, absorbing countries see employment drawn away from tradables into lower-productivity sectors.</p>
<p>In sum, we have to accept that in our assessment of imbalances and their causes, we need to embed both macro and microeconomic perspectives. Surveillance has to keep pace with these changes. The Bank Staff work which we plan to publish this spring, represents an important, if modest, first step in this direction, and we hope it will serve as a call for more empirical analysis on this issue.</p>
<p>This brings me to the third contextual issue. The tension around the assessment and surveillance of imbalances is running high &ndash; that&rsquo;s a statement of the obvious, but has to be said nonetheless. The assessment has to be without fear or favour, and thus has to be objective, and seen to be so. Seeking truth from facts sounds easier than it is in practice. Theory alone will not get us there. Practice is necessary for achievement, and that practice has to be backed up by our support. Part of the purpose of international agencies is that from time to time they have to tell us what we don&rsquo;t want to hear, let alone act upon. Of course, they have to be accountable for the accuracy and quality of the assessment. But, accepting that, we have to call out messenger shooting.</p>
<p>This brings me to the fourth and final contextual issue. The rise of so-called populism makes the whole task harder. Three features of populism stand out in this respect. First, a tendency to emphasise domestic production and wealth distribution as in opposition to international openness rather than as complementary. Second, a tendency to attribute unfavourable conditions to outside forces, rather than to point to shared challenges. And, third, encouraging a decline in trust such that institutions &ndash; domestic and international &ndash; are viewed as distant, unresponsive and acting for the benefit of powerful and uncontrollable interests.</p>
<p>For those of us who are institutionalised, the answer is that we have to challenge back, in deeds more than just words. But, we have to ensure our houses are in order too.</p>
<p>This brings me to the end &ndash; all that is left is to point to four things that we have to assert and demonstrate continually.</p>
<p>First, to emphasise the benefits of robust economic openness for growth and well-being. Now is not the time to close the world to the benefits of trade. But to do this, we have to be realistic and assertive in defining and achieving robust openness.</p>
<p>Second, recognise the importance of, and invest in the broadest sense, in the multilateral institutions. We should not pretend that all has been perfect, and we must be prepared to make changes where they are called for, as was done in the past. But we must be clear and agreed that a world without effective institutions is unlikely to be stable.</p>
<p>Third, we should seek to enable the next major contribution to global productivity growth &ndash; the next discrete rush &ndash; likely to be AI and robotics &ndash; but to do so in a way that is sensitive to managing the consequences, and particularly invest in developing skills.</p>
<p>Fourth, I am going take a free shot because I also chair an international organisation, the Financial Stability Board. Financial Stability is a condition of growth. Acceptance of this, and interpretation of and agreement on what it means, is not as well grounded as it needs to be. But that would be another speech, or alternatively I can recommend the 88 page assessment of bank capital requirements that the Bank of England published in December.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I would like to thank Sarah Breeden, Ambrogio Cesa-Bianchi, Dan Christen, Peter Denton, Mark Joy, Karen Jude, Clare Lombardelli, Martin Seneca, James Talbot and Matt Trott for their comments and help in the preparation of these remarks.</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Fines Oil Rig Consultant £309,843 For Insider Dealing</title>

<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA has fined Russel Gerrity &pound;309,843 for using inside information to net himself &pound;128,765.</p>
</div>
</section></p>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>As a consultant, Mr Gerrity had access to information about whether oil and gas had been discovered during the drilling of wells. Between October 2018 and January 2022, he took advantage of this and used inside information to buy shares in Chariot Oil &amp; Gas Limited and Eco (Atlantic) Oil and Gas Plc ahead of announcements that increased their price. &nbsp;</p>
<p>On another occasion, he used inside information to avoid a loss. He sold shares that he already owned ahead of an announcement that no oil or gas had been found, which then resulted in a price fall. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The FCA was initially notified of some of Mr Gerrity&rsquo;s trading through Suspicious Transaction and Order Reports (STORs) submitted by a firm, showing the vital role of industry in uncovering market abuse. &nbsp;</p>
<p>During its subsequent investigation, the FCA&rsquo;s systems detected further suspicious trades placed by Mr Gerrity, over multiple accounts with different brokers, while he was based outside of the UK. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Steve Smart, executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said:</p>
<p>'Mr Gerrity abused his position to line his own pockets. We will take action against those who damage the integrity of our markets, and seek to recover any ill-gotten gains.&rsquo;&nbsp;</p>

<li>Mr Gerrity engaged in insider dealing in breach of Article 14(a) of the UK Market Abuse Regulations. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Mr Gerrity agreed to solve this matter and qualified for a 30% (stage 1) discount under the FCA&rsquo;s settlement procedures. Were it not for this discount, the FCA would have imposed a financial penalty of &pound;387,448.</li>

<title>Speech By Mr Loh Boon Chye, CEO SGX Group, At The Launch Of SID Chairpersons Guild</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Mr Chee Hong Tat, Minister for National Development and Deputy Chairman of MAS<br />Mr Yeoh Oon Jin, Chairman of SID<br />Board chairs from SGX-listed companies<br />Distinguished guests<br />Ladies and Gentlemen</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good morning, and thank you for joining us at the SGX IPO Arena.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This venue is where many entrepreneurs have struck the gong to mark their companies&rsquo; entry into the public markets.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as we all know, the IPO is not the finish line; it is the starting point of a much longer journey.</p>
<p><strong>Why the Guild Matters</strong></p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, as we launch the SID Chairpersons&rsquo; Guild, we recognise that listed companies exist not just for their controlling shareholders, but for their entire investor base.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These investors expect companies to create sustainable value, and that requires strong leadership at the very top.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the CEO of a listed company, I can attest to the difference that wise counsel makes.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At SGX, I have been fortunate to learn from three very distinguished chairmen &ndash; Mr Chew Choon Seng, Mr Kwa Chong Seng and our current chairman, Mr Koh Boon Hwee, all of whom have provided invaluable perspectives to my management team and me.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not every board or CEO has access to such guidance. That is why this Guild matters: it creates a trusted space for chairs to share insights, exchange ideas, and mentor one another, so that every company can benefit from leadership excellence.</p>
<p><strong>Connecting to the National Agenda</strong></p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This initiative aligns closely with the broader Value Unlock agenda that Minister Chee announced in November.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a national effort to strengthen governance, sharpen strategy, and enhance investor confidence. The Guild is a cornerstone of this vision.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By uplifting board leadership, we reinforce Singapore&rsquo;s reputation for trusted, forward-looking companies.</p>
<p><strong>Looking Ahead</strong></p>
<p>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the Guild&rsquo;s forums and peer-learning opportunities, chairs will be able to engage with global experts, regulators and investors &ndash; building the capabilities needed to navigate complexity and unlock long-term value.</p>
<p>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is how we move from compliance to true competitiveness, from meeting expectations to shaping the future.</p>
<p><strong>Closing</strong></p>
<p>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, I congratulate SID for driving this initiative and thank all of you for being part of this journey.</p>
<p>15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together, let&rsquo;s make the Chairpersons&rsquo; Guild not just a network, but a force for excellence &ndash; one that complements national efforts and sets new benchmarks for governance and value creation.</p>
<p>16.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you.</p>

<title>Treasury International Capital Data For November</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/treasury-international-capital-data-for-november-2026115/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/treasury-international-capital-data-for-november-2026115/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The U.S. Department of the Treasury today released Treasury International Capital (TIC) data for November 2025.&nbsp; The next release, which will report on data for December 2025, is scheduled for February 18, 2026.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sum total in November of all net foreign acquisitions of long-term securities, short-term U.S. securities, and banking flows was a net TIC inflow of $212.0 billion. &nbsp;Of this, net foreign private inflows were $167.2 billion, and net foreign official inflows were $44.9 billion.</p>
<p>Foreign residents increased their holdings of long-term U.S. securities in November; their net purchases were $221.8 billion.&nbsp; Net purchases by private foreign investors were $157.8 billion, and net purchases by foreign official institutions were $64.0 billion.</p>
<p>U.S. residents increased their holdings of long-term foreign securities, with net purchases of $1.6 billion.</p>
<p>After including adjustments, such as estimated foreign portfolio acquisitions of U.S. stocks through stock swaps, overall net foreign purchases of long-term securities are estimated to have been $220.2 billion in November.</p>
<p>Foreign residents increased their holdings of U.S. Treasury bills by $0.4 billion.&nbsp; Foreign resident holdings of all dollar-denominated short-term U.S. securities and other custody liabilities decreased by $6.5 billion.</p>
<p>Banks&rsquo; own net dollar-denominated liabilities to foreign residents decreased&nbsp;by $1.7 billion.</p>
<p>Complete data are available on the Treasury website&nbsp;<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/data/treasury-international-capital-tic-system">here</a>.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-center">###</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About TIC Data</p>
<p>The monthly data on holdings of long-term securities, as well as the monthly table on Major Foreign Holders of Treasury Securities, reflect foreign holdings of U.S. securities collected primarily on the basis of custodial data.&nbsp; These data help provide a window into foreign ownership of U.S. securities, but they cannot attribute holdings of U.S. securities with complete accuracy.&nbsp; For example, if a U.S. Treasury security purchased by a foreign resident is held in a custodial account in a third country, the true ownership of the security will not be reflected in the data.&nbsp; The custodial data will also not properly attribute U.S. Treasury securities managed by foreign private portfolio managers who invest on behalf of residents of other countries.&nbsp; In addition, foreign countries may hold dollars and other U.S. assets that are not captured in the TIC data.&nbsp; For these reasons, it is difficult to draw precise conclusions from TIC data about changes in the foreign holdings of U.S. financial assets by individual countries.</p>

<title>CalPERS Hires Shari Slate As Chief Diversity, Equity, And Inclusion Officer</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The California Public Employees&rsquo; Retirement System announced Monday that it has hired Shari Slate as its new Chief Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Officer.</p>
<p>Slate, a Sacramento area resident, has spent nearly two decades helping large companies work toward a purpose-driven culture that considers the needs and experiences of all employees, customers, and other stakeholders. Most recently, she served as Senior Vice President and Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer at CVS Health, whose businesses include not only CVS drugstores but also pharmacy benefits management and Aetna health insurance.</p>
<p>Prior to joining CVS, Slate was Chief Inclusion and Collaboration Officer and Senior Vice President at Silicon Valley giant Cisco Systems Inc., where she helped launch the Office of Inclusion and Collaboration in 2015.</p>
<p>During Slate&rsquo;s tenure at Cisco, she helped the company build a pipeline of talent across the full spectrum of diversity. Fortune Magazine recognized Cisco as No. 1 of the &ldquo;World&rsquo;s 25 Best Places to Work&rdquo; in 2019 and 2020 and Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For&reg; in the U.S. for three consecutive years: 2021, 2022, and 2023.</p>
<p>At CalPERS, Slate will drive the ongoing effort to integrate diversity, equity, and inclusion across the organization and beyond with suppliers, contractors, and investment partners. She will be a member of the Executive Team and report directly to CEO Marcie Frost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shari brings the kind of leadership this moment calls for &ndash; connecting diversity, inclusion, and equity to trust, governance and our core values,&rdquo; Frost said. &ldquo;She will help CalPERS continue to lead with our purpose, which is to deliver the best outcomes for the millions of people who depend on us for their retirement and health care benefits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slate said she joined CalPERS because of &ldquo;its clarity of purpose and the responsibility it carries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;CalPERS shows up for people at one of the most important moments of their lives, when work ends and trust matters most,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I hope to ensure that CalPERS works for all the people it was built to serve &ndash; beginning with our people and extending to every member who depends on this system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A graduate of Mills College, Slate began her career in sales and was an award-winning manager for Xerox Corp. before being hired at Sun Microsystems as one of the youngest diversity officers at a Fortune 500 company.</p>
<p>She has served on numerous boards and councils, including the California State University Foundation Board of Governors and the World Economic Forum&rsquo;s Global Future Council on Systemic Inequalities and Social Cohesion.</p>
<p>Slate represented Cisco on the Business Roundtable&rsquo;s Diversity &amp; Inclusion Working Group after 181 CEOs redefined the purpose of a corporation to serve all stakeholders. She contributed to shaping the group&rsquo;s view of DEI not as a standalone goal, but the connective tissue linking employee well-being, business performance, customer trust, supplier inclusion, and community impact.</p>

<title>Office Of The Comptroller Of The US Currency Announces Enforcement Actions For January 2026</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/office-of-t0he-comptroller-of-the-us-currency-announces-enforcement-actions-for-2026115/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) today released enforcement actions for January 2026.</p>
<p>The OCC uses enforcement actions against an institution-affiliated party (IAP) to deter, encourage correction of, or prevent violations, unsafe or unsound practices, or breaches of fiduciary duty. Enforcement actions against IAPs reinforce the accountability of individuals for their conduct regarding the affairs of a bank. The term &ldquo;institution-affiliated party,&rdquo; or IAP, is defined in 12 USC 1813(u) and includes bank directors, officers, employees, and controlling shareholders. Orders of Prohibition prohibit an individual from any participation in the affairs of a bank or other institution as defined in 12 USC 1818(e)(7). The OCC has taken the following actions against IAPs:</p>
<ul>
<li><span><a href="https://www.occ.gov/static/enforcement-actions/eaAA-ENF-2024-80.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Order of Prohibition</a></span>&nbsp;against Tamim Haidar, Branch Operations Associate Manager at a Union City, California, branch of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Sioux Falls, South Dakota, for embezzling over $800,000 in bank funds and falsifying bank records. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2024-80)</li>
</ul>
<p>The OCC terminates enforcement actions when a bank has demonstrated compliance with all articles of an enforcement action; or when the OCC determines that articles deemed &ldquo;not in compliance&rdquo; have become outdated or irrelevant to the bank&rsquo;s current circumstances; or when the OCC incorporates the articles deemed &ldquo;not in compliance&rdquo; into a new action. Termination actions include:</p>
<ul>
<li><span><a href="https://www.occ.gov/static/enforcement-actions/eaAA-SO-2025-66.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Order Terminating the Cease and Desist Order</a>&nbsp;against Clear Fork Bank, N.A.</span>, Albany, Texas, dated October 8, 2024 (Docket No.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.occ.gov/static/enforcement-actions/eaAA-ENF-2024-82.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">AA-ENF-2024-82</a>).

<title>UK Prudential Regulation Authority To Streamline Supervision As Part Of 2026 Priorities</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-prudential-regulation-authority-to-streamline-supervision-as-part-of-2026-pri-2026115/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-prudential-regulation-authority-to-streamline-supervision-as-part-of-2026-pri-2026115/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) has today published its supervisory priorities for 2026, outlining in a letter its sector-specific priorities for the coming year to all banks, building societies, insurers and other PRA-regulated firms.</p>
<p>These include important plans to streamline the supervisory process by moving some supervisory activity, including Periodic Summary Meetings (PSMs), to a two-year cycle.</p>
<p>These meetings are an internal, formal review led by the PRA to consider potential risks posed by a regulated firm to the PRA&rsquo;s objectives, and to set the supervisory strategy for the coming period.</p>
<p>Over recent years, the PRA has transitioned some firms to biennial review cycles, reflecting the longer-term nature of supervisory workplans and allowing firms and supervisors to focus resources more efficiently on identifying and remediating key risks.</p>
<p>From 1 March larger firms will begin to move to this two-year cycle, while maintaining a regular cadence for discussion of important matters, alongside ad hoc supervisory meetings. This will result in firms having a more proportionate and efficient set of engagements with the PRA.</p>
<p>The Priorities letters are designed to help firms understand the main areas of supervisory focus over the next year, addressing key risks in each sector while setting out the PRA&rsquo;s priorities to support competition, competitiveness and growth. Other streamlining measures include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accelerating timelines for reviewing senior manager applications, new firm authorisations and internal ratings-based model change pre-approval applications;</li>
<li>Developing the new UK captive regime for insurers, through a summer 2026 consultation with a view to launch the new regime in 2027;</li>
<li>And streamlining and modernising reporting requirements through the Future Banking Data project.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sam Woods, Deputy Governor for Prudential Regulation and Chief Executive Officer of the PRA, said:</p>
<p>'As we set out our priorities for 2026, we are also updating our approach by moving from an annual to a two-year supervisory cycle for firms. This will allow us to make our operations more efficient and help streamline firms&rsquo; interactions with the PRA.'</p>
<p>These priorities build on the PRA&rsquo;s extensive work to maintain stability and promote growth and competitiveness in the financial sector. Recent changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The removal of the Building Societies Sourcebook alongside&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2025/december/regulators-announce-plans-to-support-growth-of-mutuals-sector">new measures</a>&nbsp;to support the growth of the mutuals sector;</li>

<li>Supporting increased and rapid investment by insurance firms through the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2025/april/pra-launches-consultation-to-help-insurers-accelerate-investment-in-the-uk">Matching Adjustment Investment Accelerator</a>;</li>

<li>Supervisors will engage individually with firms in due course on what this means for the timing of each firm&rsquo;s next PSM.</li>
<li>The PSM process typically involves the PRA internally setting out the forward-looking supervisory strategy for individual firms, before a letter is shared with the firm&rsquo;s board and management to outline its assessment of key risks, as well as any areas of focus, and request mitigating actions be taken where necessary.</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Lingfeng Capital today announced the forthcoming launch of the&nbsp;Digital Venture Fund (DVF). DVF delivers a regulated, multi-chain tokenised venture fund providing institutional-level access to early-stage fintech and digital infrastructure opportunities. The fund will be launched on&nbsp;<span>LSEG&rsquo;s Digital Markets Infrastructure (DMI)</span>&nbsp;platform during a&nbsp;<span>London Stock Exchange market opening ceremony in March</span>.&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Transaction Network Services (TNS) has expanded its global market data and infrastructure footprint in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region by adding connectivity to the Japan Alternative Market (JAX). This new connection provides TNS customers with direct, managed access to JAX&rsquo;s market data feeds, delivered across TNS&rsquo; extensive global network.</span><br /><br /><span>JAX began operations in December 2024, adding a new trading venue to Japan&rsquo;s equities market. Through TNS&rsquo; connectivity, global firms can access JAX market data and incorporate it into their trading and analytics workflows.</span><br /><br /><span>&ldquo;The rise of alternative trading venues like JAX represents a significant shift in the Asian financial landscape,&rdquo; said Jeff Mezger, Vice President of Product Management, TNS. &ldquo;JAX is a compelling success story, and by making its market data available to our global customer base, we are helping to lower the barriers to entry for firms looking to capitalize on this competitive shift.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span>While Asian exchanges often require bespoke broker connections for order routing and clearing, TNS simplifies market data access. Firms can leverage TNS&rsquo; expansive extranet, consisting of over 5,000 endpoints for local broker access, and can view JAX market data alongside other major exchanges via TNS&rsquo; low latency&nbsp;</span><a href="https://tnsi.com/solutions/financial/network-maps-global-access/">managed global network</a><span>.</span><br /><br /><span>&ldquo;Partnering with TNS provides JAX with a direct link to a broad, international community of market participants,&rdquo; said a JAX spokesperson. &ldquo;Their global infrastructure and deep experience in market connectivity supports JAX&rsquo;s continued growth as we build a more competitive trading environment in Japan.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span>The JAX integration reinforces TNS&rsquo; continued investment in expanding its APAC footprint and delivering reliable,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://tnsi.com/solutions/financial/market-data/">low-latency market data</a><span>&nbsp;to customers worldwide. TNS&rsquo; Japanese exchange portfolio also includes Japannext, Tokyo Financial Exchange (TFX) and the Japan Exchange Group (JPX), which encompasses the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE), Osaka Exchange (OSE), and Tokyo Commodity Exchange (TOCOM).</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Agentic commerce is accelerating rapidly, reshaping how consumers discover, decide, and buy products and services online. Industry leaders forecast that a significant share of digital commerce will soon be agent-assisted:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-agentic-commerce-opportunity-how-ai-agents-are-ushering-in-a-new-era-for-consumers-and-merchants" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">McKinsey projects that by 2030, agentic commerce could see between $3 trillion and $5 trillion in global retail value.</a>&nbsp;As agentic commerce evolves, it faces a key challenge: securely integrating AI with complex payment systems simply.<b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<h4>New assets to power agentic commerce</h4>
<p><a href="https://docs.connect.worldline-solutions.com/documentation/ConnectAI/worldline-model-context-protocol-mcp-server" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Worldline&rsquo;s Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers</a>&nbsp;on the Global Collect platform address this by acting as a secure bridge and translation layer between LLMs and Worldline&rsquo;s APIs, enabling AI agents to initiate payment actions via natural language. For merchants, the MCP server unlocks innovation avenues and supports agent-initiated actions such as payment creation, refunds, status checks, and payment captures. It also enables AI-driven shopping by allowing agents to share secure payment links while maintaining security and compliance.</p>
<p>The second capability is&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.connect.worldline-solutions.com/documentation/ConnectAI/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="ConnectAI">ConnectAI</a>, a dedicated hub on its&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.connect.worldline-solutions.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Documentation Site">Documentation Site</a>&nbsp;for developers and merchants to explore, build, test, and prepare for agentic commerce. ConnectAI brings together tools, documentation, and guidance for emerging agentic payment protocols.</p>
<p><b>Stijn Gasthuys, Head of Global Commerce at Worldline</b>,<b>&nbsp;</b>commented: &ldquo;Agentic commerce will unlock new waves of innovation, helping merchants deliver better customer experiences. Our investments in this area position Worldline to capture a growing global market for AI-powered transactions, delivering secure, scalable infrastructure that empowers merchants and developers to innovate with confidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Gertjan Dewaele, VP of Product &amp; Technology at Worldline</b>,<b>&nbsp;</b>commented: &ldquo;The shift to agentic commerce is underway, and MCP servers are the first building block for moving merchants from experimentation to real-world deployment. By providing secure, simple access to Worldline&rsquo;s payment capabilities for AI agents, we enable the next generation of agentic commerce and streamline internal operations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Worldline is actively shaping the future of agentic commerce by collaborating across the broader ecosystem with networks, tech leaders, AI platforms, and partners, laying the groundwork for secure, scalable agent-initiated payments. This includes active support for emerging standards such as&nbsp;<a href="https://worldline.com/en/home/main-navigation/resources/blogs/2025/worldline-collaborates-with-google-cloud-on-the-agents-payments-protocol-for-users-merchants-and-payment-providers-to-transact-with-confidence">Google&rsquo;s Agent Payments Protocol (AP2)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/under-the-hood-universal-commerce-protocol-ucp/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP)">Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP)</a>, with a strong focus on European regulatory and trusted requirements.</p>

<title>LSEG Launches Digital Settlement House</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/lseg-launches-digital-settlement-house-2026115/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/lseg-launches-digital-settlement-house-2026115/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>LSEG today announces the launch of a new digital settlement service, Digital Settlement House (LSEG DiSH), an open-access platform which enables programmatic and instantaneous settlement between independent payment networks, both on and off chain. Through commercial bank deposits held on the DiSH ledger (DiSH Cash), the service will enable the 24/7 instantaneous movement of commercial bank money in multiple currencies and jurisdictions, PVP and DVP, providing a real cash leg for FX and digital asset transactions and settlements.</p>
<p>With LSEG DiSH, market participants will be able to conduct PvP or DvP and settlements using any asset, orchestrating payments on any connected network, digital and traditional. DiSH Cash, LSEG DiSH's ledger enabled commercial bank money solution, will operate accounts at commercial banks, providing members with instant ownership of a commercial bank deposit at any bank within the LSEG DiSH network, and a mechanism for the 24/7 movement of commercial bank money. LSEG DiSH can facilitate settlement on its own ledger, or act as notary to facilitate settlement in other networks and assets.</p>
<p>By using LSEG DiSH, users can unlock trapped assets, enabling instantaneous use of cash, securities and digital assets 24/7. They will also be able to optimise liquidity through new tools that enable intraday borrowing and lending to better manage assets and obligations. The service also enables users to reduce settlement risk through reduced settlement timelines, synchronised settlement, and increased collateral availability.</p>
<p>The launch follows a successful Proof of Concept (PoC) in collaboration with Digital Asset and a consortium of leading financial institutions, completing transactions on the Canton Network. Executed across multiple assets and currencies, the transactions leveraged commercial bank deposits at leading commercial banks, with ownership recorded on the LSEG DiSH ledger, enabling the PoC participants to instantaneously transfer commercial bank deposits. The deposits were tokenised on the Canton Network for use as a true cash leg of the transactions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>LSEG DiSH will operate through LSEG&rsquo;s Post Trade Solutions business, utilising a trusted rulebook framework and account structure, supporting a broad network of members across multiple commercial banks and currencies. Instantaneous settlement of cash means that LSEG DiSH can offer dynamic management of intraday liquidity and funding, as well as 24/7 management of settlements and margin.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Daniel Maguire, Group Head, LSEG Markets and CEO, LCH Group</span>, said: &ldquo;LSEG DiSH expands the tokenised cash and cash like solutions available to the market, and for the first time, offers a real cash solution tokenised on the blockchain utilising cash in multiple currencies held at commercial banks. This innovative service will enable users to reduce settlement risk, and integrate existing cash, securities and digital assets across new and existing market infrastructure. We look forward to developing this service in partnership with the market.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<ul class="pr-top-bullets">
<li>Kristi Tange appointed as Group Chief Risk Officer</li>
<li>Clare Weaver MBA, becomes Chief Legal Officer</li>
</ul>
<p>ClearToken, the digital financial market infrastructure firm, today announces two senior appointments to enhance its Senior Leadership Team and further strengthen its legal and risk functions.</p>
<p><span>Kristi Tange has been appointed Group Chief Risk Officer,</span>&nbsp;to lead governance, risk, and strategic oversight, including compliance, communications, and regulatory relations. She brings nearly three decades of experience at Goldman Sachs across operations, risk, and finance in the US, UK, and Japan.</p>
<p>Most recently, Kristi served as Global Head of Operational Risk and Resilience at Goldman Sachs, where she led a strategic uplift of operational risk and UK resilience programmes. Previously, she headed Recovery and Resolution Planning, successfully filing two US Title I resolution plans. Her experience also includes enterprise risk, where she led risk identification, and senior leadership roles in operations across liquidity and collateral, client onboarding (including financial crimes), client assets, data, regulatory reporting, tax, derivatives, and treasury.</p>
<p><span>Clare Weaver, MBA, has become Chief Legal Officer,</span>&nbsp;where she will lead the Legal &amp; Regulatory function for the Group, providing strategic legal and regulatory advisory support to the CEO and Boards and managing the Group&rsquo;s legal affairs. Clare has been ClearToken&rsquo;s legal counsel and Head of Legal &amp; Regulatory and Company Secretary since inception in 2023.</p>
<p>Clare brings over 20 years of experience across specialist Corporate, Commercial, M&amp;A, fintech, and financial regulatory matters both in private practice and in industry, for more than 15 years deeply covering &ldquo;general counsel&rdquo; roles spanning all legal matters (including employment, commercial, corporate and finance). Clare previously established the Nomura Digital Office legal function and was founding interim CLO of Laser Digital (part of Nomura), before joining ClearToken in 2023.</p>
<p class="pr-subheading">Maintaining developmental momentum</p>
<p>These recent appointments are the latest milestones in ClearToken&rsquo;s growth, as the company seeks to unlock the full potential of 24/7 digital markets by offering horizontal post-trade services with the legal certainty offered by a regulated financial market infrastructure (FMI). They are also important steps towards the company&rsquo;s ambition to provide clearing and settlement services across digital asset markets for securities, derivatives and financing transactions.</p>
<p>In 2025, ClearToken achieved&nbsp;<a href="https://cleartoken.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CLEARTOKEN-November-2025-FCA-Authorisation-Press-Release.pdf" target="_blank">FCA Authorisation</a>&nbsp;to launch its delivery-versus-payment (DvP) settlement platform,&nbsp;<a href="https://cleartoken.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ClearToken-Adopts-Nasdaq-Eqlipse-Clearing-Press-Release.pdf" target="_blank">selected Nasdaq</a>&nbsp;as its technology partner, and&nbsp;<a href="https://cleartoken.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/CT-Settle-Go-Live-press-release-6.12.2025.pdf" target="_blank">launched CT Settle</a>, its DvP settlement platform for digital assets. ClearToken is now proceeding with its formal application for authorisation from the Bank of England as a Central Counterparty (CCP).</p>
<p><span>Benjamin Santos-Stephens, CEO of ClearToken, said:</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;We are delighted to welcome Kristi to ClearToken and congratulate Clare on her new role with us. These appointments build on the momentum we achieved in 2025 and are important milestones for us as we continue to build for the future. Such high calibre appointments bring with them a wealth of relevant experience and expertise and are welcome enhancements to our senior leadership team, as we continue with our strategy to create the world&rsquo;s first clearing house and settlement depository for both tokenised traditional and digitally native assets.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Kristi Tange, Chief Risk Officer of ClearToken, commented:</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;It is a very exciting time to join ClearToken, which is well positioned to unify the traditional finance and digital assets worlds and unlock the massive potential of tokenisation. I am looking forward to working with the energetic and visionary team here to build the financial market infrastructure which will underpin the future of global, 24/7 markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Clare Weaver, Chief Legal Officer at ClearToken said:</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Having worked with ClearToken well before joining full time in 2023, I&rsquo;m extremely proud of what we have achieved together so far. As the legislative landscape, and therefore opportunities, for digital assets continues to develop across the globe, I look forward to helping our strong, diverse team deliver on our growth ambitions in 2026 and beyond, and at the same time ensuring that legal certainty and compliance remains at the core of what we do.&rdquo;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) confirms that as a result of a sophisticated phishing attack, first disclosed in August 2025, approximately 750,000 Canadian investors have been impacted.</p>
<p>We deeply regret this occurred and apologize for any inconvenience or concern.</p>
<p>CIRO is reaching out to affected investors to alert them of the incident and offering credit monitoring as an added precaution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are intent on doing right by those who are personally affected,&rdquo; said Andrew Kriegler President and Chief Executive Officer of CIRO. &ldquo;We take our public interest role very seriously. Matters of privacy and security are extremely important to us, as are our guiding organizational values of transparency and accountability. That&rsquo;s why we remain committed to further strengthening our own cybersecurity defences and data security practices and supporting the ongoing efforts of the broader investment industry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following information may have been impacted: dates of birth, phone numbers, annual income, social insurance numbers, government issued ID numbers, investment account numbers and account statements. CIRO does not collect account login detail, such as passwords, security questions and PINs and therefore that information was not at risk.</p>
<p>CIRO received this information in the normal course of carrying out its regulatory mandate to protect investors from improper investment conduct and practices, and through its investigative, compliance assessment and market regulation work.</p>
<p><em>Protecting Canadian Investors</em></p>
<p>CIRO quickly contained the incident and took immediate steps to secure our systems and protect the information in our care. We notified law enforcement and all relevant authorities, including privacy commissioners. A leading third-party forensic IT investigator was retained to determine what information was impacted.</p>
<p>CIRO launched a thorough investigation with the support of external cybersecurity experts. Our preliminary investigation revealed that registration information for member firms and registered individuals had been affected. We immediately shared those findings publicly and directly with our members and impacted registrants. At that time, we noted the investigation was ongoing, and we committed to sharing the final findings of the e-discovery process once the review was complete. After more than 9,000 hours of examination, we can now confirm the full extent of the incident.</p>
<p>There is currently no evidence that the information has been misused. We continue to monitor for malicious activity and have not identified any threat activity or exposure on the dark web.</p>
<p>As a precaution and in order to help detect possible misuse of information, CIRO is providing affected investors two-years of credit monitoring and identity theft protection with both of the major credit agencies. Step by step instructions detailing how to activate protection services will be communicated to those impacted, directly.</p>
<p><em>Additional Information</em></p>
<p>Only some clients or former clients of CIRO dealer members were impacted by the cybersecurity breach. Clients impacted by the cyber incident will be sent a notification letter by CIRO starting on January 14, 2026. If you did not receive a notification letter from CIRO but want to confirm whether you were impacted and should have received a notification letter, you can request this information from CIRO in writing using the contact form available in the cyber incident section of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ciro.ca/ciro-cybersecurity-incident" target="_self" title="CIRO cybersecurity incident">CIRO&rsquo;s website</a>&nbsp;(ciro.ca).</p>

<title>Regulations, The Supply Side, And Monetary Policy, Federal Reserve Governor Stephen I. Miran, At The Delphi Economic Forum, National Gallery – Alexandros Soutsos Museum, Athens, Greece</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/regulations-the-supply-side-and-monetary-policy-federal-reserve-governor-step-2026114/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Madame Ambassador, for the introduction and the opportunity to speak today. My topic is the implications of deregulation for monetary policy, an appropriate one for this setting.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;Greece's recovery from the crisis that began in 2009 was only possible after the Greek people implemented substantial and painful reforms, including alleviating suffocating over-regulation in many sectors. In addition to the other reforms embraced by Greece, deregulation freed businesses to compete domestically and internationally, and promoted individuals' access to the economy. The range of reforms has included liberalizing product and service markets, easing licensing and administrative burdens, opening previously restricted professions, and increasing labor market flexibility. The government liberalized electricity and gas utilities; privatized airports, ports, and utilities; and reformed bankruptcy procedures and other business laws.</p>
<p>While it is challenging to quantify how these deregulatory actions have affected the economy, there is little doubt that these reforms have supported a remarkable return to economic growth and higher living standards. Macroeconomic stability has returned to Greece. Unemployment has fallen to its lowest level since the Global Financial Crisis, and investment and exports have rebounded. Product and labor market reforms helped restore competitiveness, reduce unit labor costs, and encourage firm entry. By easing the ability of supply to respond to prices, these reforms have improved the transmission of monetary policy. While monetary policy is set by the ECB, its transmission varies in part with how national governments manage their economies. Long-term Greek borrowing rates narrowed their spread to Germany's, below 1 percent, compared with 6 percent a decade ago. Greece has a come a long way, impressing the whole world with its recovery.</p>
<p><span>Regulation and the Economy's Supply Side</span><br />For all the conversation around Mario Draghi's report,<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;Greece shows that well-targeted deregulatory reforms can help lay the foundation for more sustained and robust economic growth by expanding the productive capacity of the economy, known as the supply side. Such sustainable increases in actual and potential growth have different implications for monetary policy than purely cyclical growth spurts, which boost growth in the near term without raising economic potential. These jolts can create substantial inflation, undermining growth in the medium term by forcing central banks to raise interest rates, and also in the long term by causing a misallocation of resources.</p>
<p>Recent experiences have reinforced the need for central bankers to fully consider the broad range of nonmonetary factors that could affect the appropriate stance of monetary policy. One such factor that is especially important at this juncture is the regulatory burden borne by businesses and individuals, which has begun to recede in the past year.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;I believe that the sweeping deregulation underway in the United States will significantly boost competition, productivity, and potential growth, allowing faster economic growth without putting upward pressure on inflation. This would support continued easing of restrictive monetary policy, but ignoring these effects would result in monetary policy that is needlessly contractionary.</p>
<p>One challenge for central bankers in fully incorporating deregulation into their economic outlooks is that it is difficult to measure in aggregate. Economists are inclined to study things when there are quantitative data to illuminate their work&mdash;a version of the famous "lamppost problem" of only looking where the lamppost shines. This may have contributed to a tendency to give short shrift to regulation in judging the economic outlook. Quantitatively measuring regulations is more difficult than taxes, subsidies, or interest rates. Regulations that businesses face can vary enormously based on the sector, size, and sometimes even the age of a company. Some regulations ban activities altogether. Some regulations impose fixed or variable costs for complying. Some regulations affect consumption decisions and some affect production. Regulations can vary enormously across jurisdictions and sometimes within jurisdictions. Additionally, enforcement determines how binding regulations are in practice, and enforcement can be even harder to measure than the effects of regulations themselves.</p>
<p>These measurement challenges are evident in the abundance of economic studies on specific regulations but the much smaller volume of work that tries to comprehensively measure the aggregate effects of the accumulation of regulations on the macroeconomy.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;From the perspective of an individual firm, it may be easy to adjust behavior in response to one regulation, known as a "margin of adjustment," but compounding regulations can constrain the ability to shift costs by hitting multiple margins of adjustment.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;One pebble doesn't stop a stream, water can flow around it; but enough pebbles will.</p>
<p>A common approach to quantifying the effects of regulations is to count the number of pages of new regulations, though this does not account for varying economic significance across pages. Another approach is to count the number of work hours required to comply, as reported under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA). However, there is wide variation in how different regulatory agencies produce these costs estimates, even sometimes variation within agencies, and more importantly, the counting of work hours related to the PRA does not capture the full opportunity cost of the regulations&mdash;that is, how that lost hour of work could have been used more productively&mdash;or the firms and industries that don't exist because of the regulation.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;If a firm needs to hire a person to comply with some new regulation and can't hire a sales associate who could generate new business or can't engage in a productive activity at all, then the foregone opportunity can be significantly larger than the wage for compliance hours.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a></p>
<p>There has been some progress in measuring regulation through advances in natural language processing and artificial intelligence, and I expect more of this to come. For instance, Patrick McLaughlin's QuantGov project at Stanford University's Hoover Institution uses computational tools to move beyond regulation page counts toward counting restrictions and obligations imposed by the text and quantifying regulations by industry.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a>&nbsp;In other work, Joseph Kalmenovitz uses machine learning methods to count and separate regulations that are relevant for a firm's core businesses from those that are not relevant.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;These measures show a substantial drop in the number of rules in 2025.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a></p>
<p>Among other deregulatory efforts is the current U.S. Administration's "one-in-ten-out policy" revoking 10 old regulations for every new one adopted.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a>&nbsp;Based on the pace of the Administration's deregulatory efforts in the first part of 2025, I estimate that 30 percent of the regulatory restrictions in the Code of Federal Regulations will be eliminated by 2030, though this may prove an underestimate.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a></p>
<p>Regulations can have far larger consequences for the supply side than, for example, taxes, because they can amount to outright prohibitions and thus function as infinite taxes. Quantity controls are usually far more damaging than those that directly affect prices.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a>&nbsp;Consider agglomeration, when a group of firms in the same general industry benefit from proximity, such as R&amp;D labs and production plants, or clients and customers. An auto parts producer benefits from being close to an automaker.</p>
<p>Environmental or other restrictions that restrict co-location can affect the entire economy's supply side by preventing the agglomeration necessary for an industry to be profitable. Take one piece of an industrial ecosystem away because of a regulation and the rest become harder to sustain. Supply chain ecosystems exist&mdash;or don't&mdash;because of regulations determining what activity can take place and where. I think it is hard to argue that, say, the excess burden of going from a 30 percent to a 33 percent marginal tax rate has the same effect as a regulation preventing an entire industry from existing domestically. Regulations, particularly those that affect physical production, can force the economy from high-productivity sectors to low-productivity sectors by encouraging capital-intensive production to move to less regulated places, such as China.</p>
<p>Research on the effects of regulation on the supply side of the economy has developed along two major lines of inquiry. The first studies regulation's effect on total factor productivity (TFP) and growth by making production more expensive.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn14" title="footnote 14"><span>14</span></a><a name="f14"></a>&nbsp;If regulations make, say, electricity or manufactured goods more expensive to produce, they lower TFP.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn15" title="footnote 15"><span>15</span></a><a name="f15"></a>&nbsp;Regulations can also distort investment decisions across sectors or impede innovation, leading to an economy-wide misallocation of resources with commensurate effects on aggregate productivity levels.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn16" title="footnote 16"><span>16</span></a><a name="f16"></a></p>
<p>An alternative way of modeling regulation is via its effects on free entry and markups. Regulatory costs that appear marginal from an industry perspective often originate as fixed costs from a firm perspective. An existing homebuilder building one more house may be marginal, but for a new entrant to build it, they would have to invest in vast compliance infrastructure. In many jurisdictions, they'd have to learn how to measure carbon emissions, decipher labor regulations, pass various inspections at different stages, and pay other fixed costs. The barriers to building a house have become so burdensome that many builders exit entire markets, leaving numerous large metro areas without desperately needed supply. As such, regulations often serve as barriers to entry, with all the attendant consequences: reduced competition, artificially high returns to scale, higher markups, reduced innovation, and reduced productivity growth. Let's call these "markup regulations."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn17" title="footnote 17"><span>17</span></a><a name="f17"></a></p>
<p>There is abundant evidence both within and across countries that increased regulation causes reduced firm entry, decreased competition, and lower investment, all consistent with elevated fixed costs.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn18" title="footnote 18"><span>18</span></a><a name="f18"></a>&nbsp;Decreased firm entry, competition, and innovation lead to a malaise familiar to many: Formerly dynamic industries calcify, flagship businesses choose to move elsewhere or shutter completely, and communities feel cheated out of their way of life.</p>
<p><span>Implications for Monetary Policy</span><br />Now let me discuss the implications of regulation and deregulation for monetary policy. Most theory and research suggest that increasing the regulatory burden reduces productivity and thus puts upward pressure on prices. This is intuitive: Regulations impede production, and deregulation removes those impediments. More production means lower prices, and vice versa. But gauging the magnitudes of these effects is more difficult.</p>
<p>Work by Dustin Chambers, Courtney A. Collins, and Alan Krause found that a 1 percent increase in U.S. federal regulations in a particular industry is associated with a roughly 10 basis point increase in consumer prices in that industry, and that is only in the near term.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn19" title="footnote 19"><span>19</span></a><a name="f19"></a>&nbsp;Longer-term effects and effects from more substantial changes in regulations are, in my view, likely to be substantially larger, since firm entry and the effects of increased competition develop over time. Supply chain ecosystems can take years to rise or fall. I'd also expect cross-industry spillovers to boost aggregate effects above this level. But even these modest within-industry, short-term effects would be substantial in the context of the potential 30 percent decline in the regulatory code that I projected earlier. This implies a cumulative drag of roughly 3 percent on the consumer price level through 2030, a little over half a percent per year.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn20" title="footnote 20"><span>20</span></a><a name="f20"></a></p>
<p>What happens in the short term depends on various factors&mdash;the types of regulations involved, the way these regulations affect firms and households, and the manner of enforcement. On balance, I believe the substantial deregulation that has occurred in 2025 will continue over at least the next three years and be a large positive shock to productivity that will put downward pressure on prices. On net, this supports a more accommodative stance of monetary policy.</p>
<p>As I have argued, I think the primary effects of deregulation are on the supply side of the economy and have the effect of increasing potential output more than they increase actual output. For example, if the number of goods I can produce is effectively limited by regulation, and that cap is removed, this means I can produce more. If demand increases and production is limited by regulation or some other factor, then prices increase. If demand rises and these shackles have been removed, then output grows and pressure on prices is much smaller.</p>
<p>While I think of regulation as primarily a supply-side factor, it can also affect demand. For instance, the news of planned deregulatory action can stimulate investment now for future production, increasing aggregate demand and prices in the short run, before prices adjust to the lower level that would prevail over the longer run. However, I see little reason to expect the short-run effect on demand will exceed potential. In my earlier speech, I assumed that deregulation immediately increases actual output half as much as potential output, and then the two converge over a few years. While some approaches assume TFP shocks increase actual and potential output by the same amount, work by Olivier Coibion, Yuriy Gorodnichenko, and Mauricio Ulate shows that a structural approach to modeling the supply-side results in potential output overshooting actual output in response to a TFP shock.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn21" title="footnote 21"><span>21</span></a><a name="f21"></a></p>
<p>Of course, this matters because the output gap is a primary input into calculating the appropriate setting for monetary policy. If actual output falls below potential output, there is slack in the economy that could be accommodated by looser monetary policy. If deregulation boosts potential output above actual, the correct response is to cut rates. At the same time, by increasing the marginal product of capital, deregulation may raise the so-called neutral rate of interest at which monetary policy is neither accommodative nor restrictive. I addressed this in my first speech as a member of the Federal Reserve Board.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn22" title="footnote 22"><span>22</span></a><a name="f22"></a></p>
<p>Turning to markups, the second channel for the effects of regulation on the supply side, models indicate that if monetary policy ignores the deflationary effects of deregulation, then we risk causing an unnecessary contraction in the economy. That is the implication of an important 2014 paper by Gauti Eggertsson, Andrea Ferrero, and Andrea Raffo, which models deregulation as a reduction in markups&mdash;increased competition&mdash;in a standard New Keynesian model.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn23" title="footnote 23"><span>23</span></a><a name="f23"></a>&nbsp;They find that the appropriate response of monetary policy is to reduce interest rates in response to this type of deregulation shock and offset its consequent deflation. If for some reason monetary policy fails to do so, then deflation and economic contraction needlessly result. This model implies that, if the Federal Reserve fails to reduce policy rates in response to deregulation, there will be adverse consequences. Greece's experience testifies to this. Had the ECB not implemented exceptionally loose monetary policy and effectively accommodated Greece's structural reforms, the outcome could have been quite different.</p>
<p>I believe that central bankers should be paying close attention to the effects of regulation on productivity, output, and prices. In recent quarters, policy has been tighter than it should have been to reflect significant deregulation lifting potential growth and reducing inflation. Going forward, I expect that the ambitious deregulation underway in the United States will boost growth without boosting inflation and be one factor supporting a further easing of monetary policy. In this regard, Greece and the ECB have lit the path. I have raised this point with my Federal Open Market Committee colleagues and expect to continue to do so in our deliberations.</p>
<hr align="left" size="1" width="33%" />
<p><a name="fn1"></a>1. The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee. I am deeply indebted to Casey Mulligan for many conversations about the economics of regulation, but again, the ideas here reflect only my own views.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn2"></a>2. Mario Draghi (2024),&nbsp;<a href="https://commission.europa.eu/topics/competitiveness/draghi-report_en">The Future of European Competitiveness</a>, September 9.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn3"></a>3. In this speech, I am focusing on general economic regulations, not regulations on the banking sector, which are implemented by the Federal Reserve in conjunction with other regulatory agencies. For more on banking regulations, see Stephen I. Miran (2025),&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20251119a.htm">"Regulatory Dominance of the Federal Reserve Balance Sheet,"</a>&nbsp;speech delivered at the Bank Policy Institute and Small Business &amp; Entrepreneurship Council, Washington, November 19.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn4"></a>4. For example, lots of papers show very clear implications for productivity and "dynamism" of regulations that inhibit labor adjustment (see Steven J. Davis and John Haltiwanger (2014), "Labor Market Fluidity and Economic Performance," paper presented at "Re-Evaluating Labor Market Dynamics," a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, held in Jackson Hole, Wyo., August 22; and David H. Autor, William R. Kerr, and Adriana D. Kugler (2007), "Does Employment Protection Reduce Productivity? Evidence from US States,"&nbsp;<em>The Economic Journal</em>, vol. 117 (June), pp. F189&ndash;217). For a theory approach, Hopenhayn and Rogerson (1993) is a classic&mdash;a tax on firing is a tax on hiring (see Hugo Hopenhayn and Richard Rogerson (1993), "Job Turnover and Policy Evaluation: A General Equilibrium Analysis,"&nbsp;<em>Journal of Political Economy</em>, vol. 101 (5). For land use regulation literature, see Leonardo D'Amico, Edward L. Glaeser, Joseph Gyourko, William R. Kerr, and Giacomo A.M. Ponzetto (2024),&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w33188">"Why Has Construction Productivity Stagnated? The Role of Land-Use Regulation,"</a>&nbsp;NBER Working Paper Series 33188 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, November).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn5"></a>5. For example, a regulation that raises input costs might incent a firm to cut costs by reducing headcount, but the firm may find that response problematic as well because of other regulations.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn6"></a>6. For instance, the Small Business Administration and General Services Administration measure PRA paperwork burdens in dollars, whereas other agencies like FinCEN and parts of the Department of Agriculture measure these burdens in hours. Variation within agencies is usually across units, like the Food and Drug Administration relative to the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services within the Department of Health and Human Services.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn7"></a>7. Standard economics would suggest that, if the compliance associate is seen as a fixed cost but a new salesperson is seen as a variable cost, the optimality condition would ignore the fixed cost and have the firm hire the sales associate anyway. This is well and good for large firms that generate abundant cashflow or have easy access to liquidity, but many smaller firms face more binding cashflow and liquidity constraints and will be unable to hire that salesperson. Moreover, even for large firms, the compliance associate may be a variable cost for expanding an existing line of business, or he or she may be a fixed cost that impedes the firm's expansion into a new line of business or market. See the discussion that follows of "markup regulations" and competition.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="fn12"></a>12. McLaughlin (2025) estimates 2,404 deregulatory actions from the Spring 2025 Unified Agenda of Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions. If the average deregulatory action removes 25.6 restrictions from the CFR, which was the average through July 1 of this year, then 61,542 restrictions will be removed per year. Five years at this rate will remove 28 percent of a total of 1.1 million restrictions. I rounded up to 30 percent because I expect the pace of deregulation to accelerate with the accelerated pace of Senate confirmations due to the Senate's recent adoption of&nbsp;<em>en bloc</em>&nbsp;confirmation; with more personnel, deregulation will be much quicker than it was in the first few months of a fresh administration. Indeed, I think 30 percent will ultimately prove to be an underestimate. As McLaughlin notes, we will soon get the Fall 2025 Unified Agenda, which will allow me to update this calculation. I used McLaughlin's analysis rather than Kalmenovitz's for this exercise because, as of January 5, Kalmenovitz's measure showed a nearly 25 percent reduction in overall federal regulatory burden over the course of 2025, and as optimistic as I am regarding the coming deregulatory trend, that magnitude seems aggressive to me at present. Moreover, Kalmenovitz's measure is prone to revision. See Patrick McLaughlin (2025), "Early Data on Deregulatory Push in Washington," Third Order, October 28, https://thirdorder.substack.com/p/early-data-on-the-deregulatory-push.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="fn14"></a>14. The effects of regulation on TFP were one point I made in my first speech as a Federal Reserve Board member; see Stephen I. Miran (2025)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20250922a.htm">"Nonmonetary Forces and Appropriate Monetary Policy,"</a>&nbsp;speech delivered at the Economic Club of New York, New York, September 22.&nbsp;</p>

Seater (2013), "Federal Regulation and Aggregate Economic Growth,"&nbsp;<em>Journal of Economic Growth</em>, vol. 18 (June), pp. 137&ndash;77. For a rigorous theoretical model of productivity enhancements in a Schumpeterian model, see Bentley Coffey, Patrick A.

<p><a name="fn17"></a>17. Of course, antitrust regulations are designed to increase and not decrease competition; but these are a small portion of the overall regulatory code, and I am focused here on regulations outside of antitrust.&nbsp;</p>

McLaughlin, and Tyler Richards (2022), "Regulation, Entrepreneurship, and Firm Size,"&nbsp;<em>Journal of Regulatory Economics</em>, vol. 61, pp. 108&ndash;34.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="fn20"></a>20. Of course, this predicted decline is relative to what consumer prices would have done in the absence of the deregulatory actions and not a prediction about an absolute change.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn21"></a>21. See Olivier Coibion, Yuriy Gorodnichenko, and Mauricio Ulate (2018),&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Coibion-et-al_final-draft.pdf">"The Cyclical Sensitivity in Estimates of Potential Output," (PDF)</a>&nbsp;Brookings Paper on Econonomic Activity, Fall, pp. 343&ndash;441. Coibion et al. show that in a Blanchard-Quah (BQ) approach to estimating potential output, TFP shocks increase potential output much more rapidly than actual output (figure 12). The BQ approach relies on the uncontroversial theoretical assumption that supply-side shocks affecting potential output are those which have permanent effects on the level of output while demand shocks are restricted to having no permanent effects. It provides a more structural economic grounding for estimating potential output than various filter-based approaches.</p>
<p>The case for actual and potential output moving up the same amount in response to a TFP shock seems more plausible if the TFP shock is driven by a new technology, which requires investment to implement. But not all TFP shocks are the same, and regulations are quite different. If today a regulation limits the amount of carbon a factory can emit, but tomorrow the factory can emit more carbon, it does not require the same amount of new investment as would be required to, say, implement new computer technologies. Letting an existing smokestack run for 24 instead of 8 hours is quite different from having to buy graphical processing units to develop a large language model. In other words, it may be appropriate to consider regulatory TFP shocks as having different consequences for output gaps than technological TFP shocks have. See also Boivin, Kiley, and Mishkin (2011), who observe that the response of actual output to a TFP shock depends crucially on the monetary response, underlining that it is crucial for the Fed to stay abreast of TFP shocks in formulating the appropriate stance of policy (Jean Boivin, Michael Kiley, and Frederic Mishkin (2011), "How Has the Monetary Transmission Mechanism Evolved Over Time?" in Benjmain M. Friedman and Michael Woodford, eds.,&nbsp;<em>Handbook of Monetary Economics, Vol. 3</em>. (Amsterdam: Elsevier), pp. 369&ndash;422).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn22"></a>22. In that speech, I included a boost to neutral rates from deregulation (which was offset by reductions in neutral rates from other sources like reduced population growth and smaller fiscal deficits). I also included a wider output gap because of potential growth increasing faster than actual growth as a result of deregulation. In that speech, I did&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;model an explicit deregulation-driven reduction in prices, either from a TFP boost or a reduction in markups, an oversight partially addressed here.&nbsp;</p>

</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>The note concentrates on ESG integration and ESG exclusions, as references to these strategies are often made by market participants and widely referenced in marketing communications directed to retail investors.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>ESG integration and ESG exclusions can mean different things to different market participants. Lack of transparency when using these terms poses a notable greenwashing risk to investors. The aim of the note is not to define these strategies, but to call on market participants to be clear about what they mean when referencing them.</span></p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>Similarly to the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-promotes-clarity-sustainability-related-communications">first thematic note on ESG credentials</a><span>, this publication offers practical do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;ts for making sustainability claims. These are illustrated through concrete examples of good and poor practices that are based on observed market practices.</span></p>

<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>The European Supervisory Authorities (EBA, EIOPA and ESMA &ndash; the ESAs) have today signed a&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2026-01/MoU_DORA_oversight_ICT_CTPPs__EU-UK.pdf">Memorandum of Understanding</a><span>&nbsp;(MoU) with the Bank of England (BoE), the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). This agreement enhances the cooperation between the authorities to oversee critical ICT third-party service providers (CTPPs) as required by the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA).</span></p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>The MoU establishes clear principles and procedures for cooperation, information sharing and coordination of oversight activities between the relevant authorities responsible for EU CTPPs/UK CTPs oversight. The&nbsp;MoU aims at enhancing third-party risk management and contributing to the overall operational resilience of the financial sector in the EU and UK through strong cross-border cooperation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span><span>​​Legal basis and background</span></span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>The MoU has been prepared in accordance with DORA Articles 36, 44, and 49, which cover the ESAs&rsquo; oversight powers, international cooperation, and financial cross-sector exercises, communication and cooperation.</span></p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>​To exchange information with a third-country authority, the ESAs must ensure that the confidentiality and professional secrecy regime in the third country is equivalent to that in the EU. Therefore, before signing this MoU, the ESAs conducted an assessment that confirmed the UK confidentiality and professional secrecy regime&rsquo;s equivalence with that in DORA.</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p dir="LTR">TASE publishes today the list of companies that entered the &ldquo;TASE 100 Club&rdquo;, which includes companies with a market cap exceeding NIS 200 million, that have achieved a share yield of at least 100% in 2025. For the third consecutive year, TASE publishes the &ldquo;TASE 100 Club&rdquo; constituents, this as part of its efforts to improve the public&rsquo;s acquaintance with the TASE-listed companies.</p>
<p dir="LTR">According to TASE&rsquo;s Research Unit, 45 companies achieved a yield of more than 100% in 2025, as compared to only 35 companies in 2024. The highest share yield in 2025 was achieved by Aryt Industries, operating in the defense-military sector, with a price gain of more than 400%. Investment houses, More and Meitav, achieved a yield of 300%, and an additional eight companies achieved a yield in excess of 200%.</p>
<p dir="LTR">Out of the 45 companies included in the &ldquo;TASE 100 Club&rdquo;, 20 companies were awarded 5 stars, having achieved a positive yield in each of the past three years, as compared to only five companies awarded the 5-star top rating in 2024.</p>
<p dir="LTR">25 companies were awarded four starts, having achieved a cumulative positive yield over the past 3 years, as compared to 23 companies in 2024.</p>
<p dir="LTR">The 2025 list includes many major companies, including 29 companies with a market cap in excess of NIS 2 billion. The list comprises 24 companies included in the TA-125 index, as compared to 10 companies in 2024.</p>
<p dir="LTR">The list contains companies from a wide range of sectors, the most prominent</p>
<ul>
<li><span>14 technology sector companies, including 6 defense companies.</span></li>
<li>8 insurance companies.</li>
<li>6 financial services companies.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="LTR">Despite multiple challenges over the past year, the companies exhibited business resilience that was also reflected in the capital market. TASE's leading indices recorded outstanding yields compared to leading global indices: the TA-35 index increased by 51.6% and the TA-90 index increased by 46.6%.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Rating System of the &ldquo;TASE 100 Club&rdquo;</h4>
<p dir="LTR">The TASE staff applies a star system (3-5 stars) to rate the companies that achieved a yield exceeding 100% in 2025, which awards 5 stars to companies that achieved a positive yield in each of the past 3 years, 4 stars to companies that achieved a cumulative positive yield over the past 3 years, and 3 stars to other club members with a yield of more than 100% in the past year.</p>
<p dir="LTR">During the month of January, TASE will host the management of the &ldquo;TASE 100 Club&rdquo; constituents in a special Opening Bell Ceremony.&nbsp;</p>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/clearbid-global-markets-selects-archax-as-partner-for-uk-and-eu-expansion-exte-2026114/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ClearBid Global Markets (CBGM) today announced it has selected Archax as its regulated digital asset partner to expand the reach of its cross-border digital bond trading and data platform into the UK and EU regions.</p>
<p>CBGM is a full-service electronic trading platform and complete securities and data source, that effectively connects global bond markets utilising a digital Dutch Auction. This results in real-time, transparent and market-driven price discovery. It is an innovative substitute for traditional &lsquo;over the counter&rsquo; (OTC) methods, with a direct focus on capital markets-based financing for infrastructure, corporate and asset-backed borrowers.</p>
<p>Archax is a regulated digital asset exchange, broker and custodian, based in the UK, EU, US and UAE. Targeted at professionals and institutions, Archax supports all types of digital assets &ndash; from unregulated cryptocurrencies through to regulated tokenised real-world assets (RWAs).</p>
<p>By selecting Archax as a strategic partner for cross-border expansion, CBGM will initially leverage Archax&rsquo;s FCA regulations in the UK to offer its digital bond pre-issuance, trading and data platform to investors based there. Moving forwards, CBGM then plans to do the same in the EU region by leveraging Archax&rsquo;s permissions there too.</p>
<p><span>Robert Novembre, Founder and CEO of ClearBid Global Markets, comments:&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Our partnership with Archax marks a significant milestone for CBGM as we expand into the UK and advance our global mission to redefine capital markets. By combining our vision for transparent, data‑driven markets with Archax&rsquo;s fully regulated digital infrastructure, we are delivering institutional clients unprecedented visibility and liquidity across global bond markets. This collaboration empowers market participants to navigate complex environments through a single, seamless digital gateway&rdquo;.<span>&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p><span>Nick Donovan, Chief Revenue Officer of Archax, adds:</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Archax is all about being the most credible, institutional and regulated, digital asset solution in the marketplace. We are always on the look-out for potential partners who can leverage our regulatory stack and together expand our digital offerings in the space. As such, we are excited to be working with ClearBid Global Markets with their innovative digital approach for providing access to bonds for capital markets participants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>CBGM&rsquo;s digital bond marketplace is designed to revolutionise how capital is raised and invested by addressing the current market&rsquo;s lack of transparency due to manual, antiquated pricing processes, as well as the lack of efficient accessibility and connectivity between markets, which limits global capital flows and growth for emerging markets.</p>

<title>UK And EU Regulators Sign Memorandum Of Understanding To Strengthen Oversight Of Critical Third Parties</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The FCA, Bank of England and Prudential Regulation Authority have together signed a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/mou/mou-fca-boe-pra-esa-critical-third-parties.pdf" title="mou-fca-boe-pra-esa-critical-third-parties.pdf">Memorandum of Understanding</a>&nbsp;(MoU) with the European Supervisory Authorities to enhance cooperation and oversight of critical third parties (CTPs) that fall under the UK&rsquo;s CTP regime.</p>
<p>The MoU establishes a framework for coordinating and sharing information on the oversight of CTPs under the UK regime and critical third party providers (CTPPs) under the EU&rsquo;s Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), including during incidents such as power outages or cyber-attacks.</p>
<p>The MoU aims to manage potential risks to financial stability and market confidence, as well as strengthen international cooperation. It will also help reduce duplication and regulatory burden on CTPs and CTPPs.</p>
<p>The UK&rsquo;s CTP regime complements similar international standards and is designed to be compatible with DORA. The agreement demonstrates UK regulators&rsquo; commitment to cross-border cooperation and strengthening operational resilience to support growth and promote market stability.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ul>
<li>In 2024, UK regulators introduced&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/policy-statements/ps24-16-operational-resilience-critical-third-parties-uk-financial-sector" title="PS24/16: Operational resilience: Critical third parties to the UK financial sector">new rules</a>&nbsp;to bolster the resilience of critical third parties providing key services to the financial sector.</li>
<li>These rules came into effect on 1 January 2025 and apply once a CTP is designated by the Treasury.</li>
<li>The Treasury is responsible for deciding which third party service providers should fall under the new CTP regime. The rules will require designated CTPs to provide regular assurance, undertake resilience testing and report major incidents.</li>
<li>The designation process has begun and the regulators will continue to work with the Treasury throughout the designation process.</li>
<li>The regime does not reduce the responsibility of financial firms and Financial Market Infrastructures (FMIs) to manage their own operational resilience and third-party risks in line with existing outsourcing rules.</li>
</ul>

<title>The WFE Calls On Regulators To Balance Quantum Computing Risks Against More Immediate Operational Challenges</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The World Federation of Exchanges (&ldquo;WFE&rdquo;), the global industry association for exchange groups and CCPs, has warned of a substantial gap between regulatory expectations and industry expectations around quantum computing risk preparedness.</span><br /><br /><span>Major public authorities, standards bodies, and cross-border policy groups have begun issuing guidance, calling for early preparation and coordinated migration to post-quantum cryptography (PQC). This is driven by two core concerns:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Long lead times required to upgrade cryptographic systems; and&nbsp;</li>
<li>The &ldquo;harvest now, decrypt later&rdquo; threat where attackers steal encrypted data today to unlock it in future once more powerful technologies become available to break the encryption.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /><span>The WFE Global Cybersecurity Working Group recently conducted a preliminary survey on the Quantum Computing Preparedness, the results of which highlight the importance of other competing priorities. In particular, Generative AI risks are viewed as far more urgent and immediate, consuming most organisational attention and investment. Quantum Computing is seen as a longer-term threat, with many firms hesitant to commit too many resources until clearer timelines or stable standards emerge.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>Most WFE members estimate a 5&ndash;10+ year window before cryptographically relevant quantum computers (CRQCs) emerge, in line with NIST FAQs. Consequently, resourcing remains proportionate to a long-term risk, not an imminent one, and shouldn&rsquo;t be prioritised at the expense of more immediate operational concerns such as AI-driven threats and Cyber Resiliency. This is consistent with the WFE&rsquo;s&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://world-exchanges.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=48ddcbc11eb58f141a51219ea&amp;id=a28a86432b&amp;e=979576350c" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">2025 Annual Survey of Risks</a><span>&nbsp;where AI and Cyber Resilience risks continued to be ranked highest by members, as they have consistently for two years. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>Although members do not consider Quantum Computing risk to be imminent, they have already begun laying the necessary groundwork for future preparedness, including:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Actively monitoring regulatory guidance, vendor progress, and developments in NIST standardisation. Several are incorporating Quantum Computing discussions into risk committees and cyber governance forums.</li>
<li>Preliminary quantum risk assessments.</li>
<li>Including quantum-safe encryption criteria in procurement and vendor evaluation cycles.</li>
<li>Considering projects to map existing cryptographic assets, as the first step in any migration roadmap.</li>
<li>Working with the WFE to develop a best-practice guide on quantum transition, and a structured roadmap for market infrastructures.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /><strong>Nandini Sukumar, CEO of the World Federation of Exchanges</strong><span>, said, &ldquo;While Quantum Computing readiness is undoubtedly important, the migration to post-quantum cryptography remains a long-term undertaking, and the practical groundwork - planning, asset mapping, and vendor coordination - should be paced appropriately. Whilst exchanges recognise that Quantum Computing is a meaningful risk, regulators must understand that preparation should not deflect from more imminent risks related to AI and Cyber Resilience.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span>Read the full paper&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://world-exchanges.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=48ddcbc11eb58f141a51219ea&amp;id=81015be5c0&amp;e=979576350c" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a><span>.</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The inaugural edition of Dubai&nbsp;Future Finance Week (DFFW) will take place from 11 to 15 May 2026, convening&nbsp;international leaders from the finance, policy, technology and investment sectors through a&nbsp;coordinated programme of high-level forums held across the emirate. As global financial&nbsp;markets undergo accelerated structural change, the Week will provide a strategic platform&nbsp;for dialogue, collaboration and the exchange of insights on the future of the global financial&nbsp;ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organised under the directives and patronage of&nbsp;<span>His Highness Sheikh Maktoum bin&nbsp;Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, First Deputy Ruler of Dubai, Deputy Prime Minister&nbsp;and Minister of Finance of the UAE, and President of the Dubai International Financial&nbsp;Centre (DIFC)</span>, the Week underscores Dubai&rsquo;s role in advancing dialogue on the evolving&nbsp;dynamics of capital markets, innovation, sustainability and governance.</p>
<p>His Highness Sheikh Maktoum bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum said the event reflects&nbsp;Dubai&rsquo;s commitment to playing a key role in shaping a smart and sustainable global economy.&nbsp;The participation of leading decision-makers, thinkers and innovators from the financial&nbsp;services sector in the event provides an important opportunity to bring perspectives closer together, align efforts to address shared global challenges, and support dialogue on the future&nbsp;of the global financial sector, His Highness said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>HH Sheikh Maktoum added that the event also opens new avenues for cooperation and&nbsp;supports innovation. He noted that the gathering encourages effective participation that&nbsp;enables markets to achieve greater growth and prosperity, while supporting the objectives of&nbsp;the Dubai Economic Agenda D33, particularly positioning Dubai among the world&rsquo;s top four&nbsp;global financial centres and building a smart, diversified economy that keeps pace with future&nbsp;requirements.</p>
<p>Designed as an integrated, citywide platform and led by DIFC, Dubai Future Finance Week&nbsp;brings together several major industry forums under a single, cohesive agenda, themed&nbsp;&lsquo;Finance Reimagined: Where innovation meets policy and purpose&rsquo;. At its core is the Dubai&nbsp;FinTech Summit (DFS) with the theme of Connecting Markets &ndash; Transforming Economies,&nbsp;held under the patronage of His Highness Sheikh Maktoum bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al&nbsp;Maktoum, which serves as the Week&rsquo;s main event, shaping its momentum and convening&nbsp;global leaders to advance dialogue on the future of finance.</p>
<p>Over five days, venues across Dubai will host discussions spanning the full spectrum of&nbsp;modern finance, from capital markets, private wealth and institutional investment to digital&nbsp;assets and sustainability-led finance. Each event within the programme explores a distinct&nbsp;area of financial transformation, enabling participants to engage directly with global&nbsp;institutions, industry leaders and policymakers through a set of complementary forums.&nbsp;Together, they provide a structured environment for cross-sector insight and practical&nbsp;engagement on emerging areas of opportunity.<br /><br />By situating these discussions within a single, coordinated week, Dubai Future Financial Week&nbsp;will enable participants to connect themes that are often addressed in isolation. This&nbsp;integrated approach will allow attendees to examine how developments in one area influence&nbsp;progress in another and engage on priorities that cut across traditional boundaries.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>His Excellency Essa Kazim, Governor of DIFC</span>, said: &ldquo;Dubai&rsquo;s vision is to shape the global economy, and Dubai Future Finance Week is a natural extension of that ambition. It highlights the emirate&rsquo;s role as a catalyst for ideas, collaboration and forward-looking growth across international markets, and it underscores our determination here at DIFC to help set the pace for global financial and economic progress. The Week will strengthen this position by enabling engagement across finance, technology, regulation and investment, in support of the ambitions set out under the Dubai Economic Agenda D33.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>His Excellency Arif Amiri, Chief Executive Officer of DIFC Authority,</span>&nbsp;said: &ldquo;Dubai Future&nbsp;Finance Week reflects our commitment to providing platforms that bring the global financial&nbsp;community together to navigate change and identify new opportunities. As the region&rsquo;s&nbsp;leading global financial centre, DIFC is well positioned to offer a unified and focused&nbsp;environment for senior decision-makers to engage on priority issues. As global markets&nbsp;continue to evolve, Dubai plays a key role in shaping the future of finance through the depth&nbsp;of its ecosystem and its international connectivity.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Programme highlights</span><br />A central pillar of the programme, the Dubai FinTech Summit will return to Madinat Jumeirah&nbsp;with an expanded format designed to accelerate global collaboration and growth&nbsp;opportunities for FinTechs, scale-ups and investors. The summit will convene more than&nbsp;10,000 delegates from over 150 countries, alongside more than 1,000 investors, and over 300&nbsp;regional and international speakers, and over 250 sponsors, spanning over more than 25&nbsp;industry verticals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 2026 edition will feature a dedicated Investors&rsquo; Lounge and Deal Hub, new country&nbsp;pavilions to enhance cross-border partnerships, and curated content streams examining&nbsp;emerging trends in digital finance, AI-driven technologies and regulatory innovation. These&nbsp;developments build on the Summit&rsquo;s continued momentum and its contribution to the region&rsquo;s&nbsp;financial innovation landscape, supported by DIFC&rsquo;s ongoing growth as a global hub for&nbsp;financial innovation.</p>
<p>The Week will feature platforms that examine the systems and standards underpinning the&nbsp;future of financial services. Seamless FinTech Middle East will feature discussions on digital&nbsp;commerce, payments and financial infrastructure, while the Reg3 Forum will bring together&nbsp;regulators, policymakers and market participants to explore supervisory innovation and the&nbsp;evolution of cross-border regulatory frameworks. Together, these forums provide a&nbsp;foundation for addressing how global financial systems can remain connected, efficient and&nbsp;forward-looking.</p>
<p>There will also be leading gatherings focused on long-term capital allocation and sustainable&nbsp;economic growth. The DIFC Family Wealth Centre Summit will examine the priorities of family&nbsp;enterprises and the expanding role of private markets, while the Future Sustainability Forum&nbsp;will explore the growing importance of sustainability-led finance and climate-aligned&nbsp;investment. In parallel, the Islamic Finance Forum will highlight developments across Sharia-aligned markets, reflecting Dubai&rsquo;s established role as a global centre for Islamic finance.<br /><br />Additional platforms within the programme will provide perspective on wider sector&nbsp;performance, emerging economic models and venture activity across the region. Highlights&nbsp;include the MENA Banking Excellence Awards, which recognise transformation within the&nbsp;banking sector; the Solana Economic Zone, offering insights into decentralised technologies&nbsp;and digital economic models; IPEM Future Dubai, convening private-market leaders to assess&nbsp;capital flows and investment trends; and the Dubai Future District Fund annual meeting,&nbsp;showcasing developments from the emirate&rsquo;s venture and innovation ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Collectively, the programme represents the broadest and most comprehensive gathering of&nbsp;finance and future-focused events in the region, offering institutions, innovators and&nbsp;policymakers a single platform through which to engage on shared priorities, explore new&nbsp;areas of opportunity and contribute to the sector&rsquo;s long-term development.<br /><br />Organisations and partners wishing to participate in the Week or contribute to its wider&nbsp;programme can register at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.difc.com/whats-on/news/www.dubaifuturefinanceweek.com">www.dubaifuturefinanceweek.com</a>.</p>
