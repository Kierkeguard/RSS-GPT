<p class="p--heading-1">Stuart Heath, Director, and Elena Marchidann, Vice&nbsp;President&nbsp;and Global Product Lead for Derivatives Products &amp; Markets at Eurex, share exclusive insights into the launch of systematic QIS index futures, explaining the rationale behind it and what to expect going forward.</p>

<p class="p--heading-3">What is behind the launch of systematic QIS index futures at Eurex?</p>
<p>Quantitative Investment Strategies (QIS) have been among the&nbsp;fastest-growing&nbsp;segments among buy-side firms, offering transparent,&nbsp;rule-based access to thematic and factor-based exposures&nbsp;that&nbsp;have traditionally&nbsp;been&nbsp;distributed&nbsp;as&nbsp;OTC swaps or structured notes.</p>
<p>Eurex has a long history in the&nbsp;futurization&nbsp;of OTC derivatives, having pioneered successful products (e.g., dividend futures and TRFs). The new QIS offering marks the next chapter in our&nbsp;futurization&nbsp;strategy and is based on market demand. We have been working closely with our clients and our strategic partner,&nbsp;Premialab, to bring a listed alternative to the QIS space.</p>
<p class="p--heading-3">What are systematic QIS index futures,&nbsp;and what do they&nbsp;offer&nbsp;clients?</p>
<p>Systematic QIS index futures are listed derivatives based on eligible QIS indices, typically designed by a bank or buy-side firm. The QIS futures are&nbsp;very similar&nbsp;to &ldquo;plain vanilla&rdquo; index futures from a product construct perspective and are designed to be easily scalable. We started with long-exposure strategies (two factors and one thematic) based on European equities from the STOXX&reg; Europe 600 universe.</p>
<p>The new products will&nbsp;benefit&nbsp;from the traditional synergies of other listed offerings, in particular the distribution platform for buy-side clients who do not trade swaps or prefer trading listed products, as well as price transparency and portfolio margin offsets.</p>
<p class="p--heading-3">Who are you targeting to trade the systematic QIS index futures?</p>
<p>The new QIS offering will complement Eurex's existing index futures ecosystem by addressing demand for greater customization among sophisticated investors. The target audience includes hedge funds and institutional investors (e.g., asset managers, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds).&nbsp;In particular, institutional&nbsp;investors&nbsp;require execution and product transparency and often face constraints on the instruments they can trade (e.g., listed-only).</p>
<p class="p--heading-3">What were the biggest conceptual or technical challenges in transforming QIS from an OTC structure into a listed&nbsp;futures&nbsp;format?</p>
<p>QIS indices, which underpin OTC swaps and now Eurex futures, are customized, rule-based indices. A key challenge is ensuring robust risk management so that Eurex Clearing can accurately capture risk parameters from index histories or&nbsp;backtests. High turnover or frequent rebalancing can distort results. To address this, we worked closely with the Risk team to develop a framework that defines which indices are acceptable.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p--heading-3">How did collaborating&nbsp;with&nbsp;Premialab&nbsp;influence the development process, and what did we learn from integrating external data and analytics into a Eurex-listed product?</p>
<p>Premialab&nbsp;is a leading player in the QIS data and analytics field and part of the plumbing between buy-side consumers and investment bank providers. So, on a simplistic&nbsp;level,&nbsp;we are tapping into those pipes to consume data.&nbsp;However, working closely with a market-leading partner gives you access to key participants in the QIS market and the insight and ability to focus on the core themes that Eurex products can bring to&nbsp;the&nbsp;market.</p>
<p class="p--heading-3">Looking ahead, how do you see QIS index futures evolving within Eurex&rsquo;s broader futurization strategy?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The introduction of QIS futures is indeed the first step toward providing a clearing/listed product for&nbsp;a very large&nbsp;underlying market.&nbsp;Its development will enable end clients to access investment strategies more easily and help investment banks distribute them through a simple wrapper, while reducing their costs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This aligns with our futurization efforts, which have primarily focused on dealer-to-dealer products to date. Now,&nbsp;we add&nbsp;a&nbsp;dealer-to-client layer&nbsp;to&nbsp;support growth in both&nbsp;our&nbsp;new&nbsp;and existing&nbsp;products&nbsp;by providing&nbsp;dealers with a&nbsp;hedge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our ambition is to expand our offering to include global indices, long-short relative-value strategies, and, ultimately, other&nbsp;asset classes.</p>

<title>Hong Kong Securities And Futures Commission Suspends Choi Sau Wai For Seven Months</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<div class="newsc">
<p>The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has suspended Ms Choi Sau Wai, a former licensed representative of Glory Sun Securities Limited (GSSL), for seven months from 23 January 2026 to 22 August 2026 (Note 1).</p>
<p>As part of an investigation into a suspected ramp-and-dump scheme, the SFC found that, between October 2019 and January 2022, Choi knowingly allowed and facilitated an account executive of another brokerage firm (AE) to operate and carry out personal trades in a client&rsquo;s securities account at GSSL without obtaining the client&rsquo;s written authorisation, nor did she obtain a written consent from the AE&rsquo;s employer, in breach of GSSL&rsquo;s internal policies and the Code of Conduct (Notes 2 and 3).</p>
<p>During the relevant period, the AE, a relative of Choi&rsquo;s client, was allowed to conduct personal trading in the client&rsquo;s account at GSSL. The AE conducted approximately 1,300 securities transactions with an aggregate value of $670 million in the client&rsquo;s account without disclosing them to his employer.</p>
<p>In doing so, Choi&rsquo;s conduct exposed the client to potential losses from the personal trading conducted by the AE and GSSL to potential liability in case the client disputes the trades in her account. Choi also prevented GSSL from discharging its obligations under the Code of Conduct (Note 4).</p>
<p>In determining the sanction against Choi, the SFC has taken into account all relevant circumstances, including her breaches enabled the AE to circumvent his employer&rsquo;s internal controls, her cooperation in resolving the SFC&rsquo;s concerns and her otherwise clean disciplinary record.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choi is licensed under the Securities and Futures Ordinance to carry on Type 1 (dealing in securities) and Type 2 (dealing in futures contracts) regulated activities. She was accredited to GSSL (formerly known as China Goldjoy Securities Limited) as a licensed representative for Type 1 regulated activity from 14 January 2019 to 6 June 2023 and Type 2 regulated activity from 14 January 2019 to 27 September 2022. Since 19 September 2023, Choi has been accredited to SinoPac Securities (Asia) Limited as a licensed representative for Type 1 and Type 2 regulated activities.</li>
<li>The SFC has suspended the AE, Wong Chi Fai, for 27 months. Please refer to the SFC&rsquo;s press release dated&nbsp;<a href="http://apps.sfc.hk/edistributionWeb/gateway/EN/news-and-announcements/news/doc?refNo=26PR9">26 January 2026</a>.</li>
<li>Code of Conduct for Persons Licensed by or Registered with the SFC.</li>
<li>Please refer to the Statement of Disciplinary Action for the relevant regulatory requirements.</li>
</ol></div>

<title>ICE First Look At Mortgage Performance: Increased Refinance Activity Drives Mortgage Prepayments Back Toward 3.5-Year High</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span class="bw-dateline-wrapper">&nbsp;</span>ICE Mortgage Technology, neutral provider of a robust end-to-end mortgage platform and part of Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE: ICE), today released the December 2025 ICE First Look at mortgage delinquency, foreclosure and prepayment trends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;December&rsquo;s numbers show that lower interest rates drove refinance activity and prepayments to near multi-year highs,&rdquo; said Andy Walden, Head of Mortgage and Housing Market Research at ICE. &ldquo;At the same time, there was a divergence in delinquency trends, with early-stage delinquencies improving and late-stage delinquencies continuing to rise. Foreclosure activity also increased, driven mainly by FHA and VA loans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Key takeaways from this month&rsquo;s findings include:</p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li><span>Early-stage delinquencies improved:</span>&nbsp;The national delinquency rate fell by 16 basis points (bps) in December to 3.68% following November&rsquo;s calendar related high. This is down 3 bps from the same time last year and 26 bps below the December 2019 pre-pandemic benchmark.<br /><br /></li>
<li><span>Late-stage delinquencies reached a near two-year high:</span>&nbsp;While earlier-stage delinquencies (30- and 60-day) improved in December, late-stage delinquencies (90+ day) increased by 30,000, reaching their highest level in nearly three years and standing 19,000 above last year&rsquo;s level.<br /><br /></li>
<li><span>Prepayments remain robust:</span>&nbsp;The single month mortality (SMM) rate, which tracks prepayments, rose by 8 bps in December to 0.91%, just 10 bps shy of the October 3.5-year high. Lower interest rates have improved affordability and spurred refinance activity.<br /><br /></li>
<li><span>Foreclosure activity trending upward:</span>&nbsp;December&rsquo;s 40,000 foreclosure starts marks the third highest monthly volume in 2025, up 28% from the year before. Foreclosure inventory is up by 47,000 (+25%) year over year, and foreclosure sales have increased by 2,100 (+41%) from last year's levels.<br /><br /></li>
<li><span>Government loans driving foreclosure growth:</span>&nbsp;While foreclosure activity remains muted by historical standards, the number of loans in active foreclosure again hit its highest level since early 2023, driven by a notable rise in FHA foreclosures (+59% YoY) along with a resumption of VA activity following last year's moratorium.</li>
</ul>
<p>Data as of December 31, 2025<br />Total U.S. loan delinquency rate (loans 30 or more days past due, but not in foreclosure): 3.68%<br />Month-over-month change: -4.20%<br />Year-over-year change: -0.93%</p>
<p>Total U.S. foreclosure pre-sale inventory rate: 0.44%<br />Month-over-month change: 5.71%<br />Year-over-year change: 22.86%</p>
<p>Total U.S. foreclosure starts: 40,000<br />Month-over-month change 53.96%<br />Year-over-year change: 27.74%</p>
<p>Monthly prepayment rate (SMM): 0.91%<br />Month-over-month change: 9.92%<br />Year-over-year change: 59.15%</p>
<p>Foreclosure sales: 7,100<br />Month-over-month change: 6.68%<br />Year-over-year change: 40.77%</p>
<p>Number of properties that are 30 or more days past due, but not in foreclosure: 2,025,000<br />Month-over-month change: -89,000<br />Year-over-year change: 9,000</p>
<p>Number of properties that are 90 or more days past due, but not in foreclosure: 560,000<br />Month-over-month change: 30,000<br />Year-over-year change: 19,000</p>
<p>Number of properties in foreclosure pre-sale inventory: 239,000<br />Month-over-month change: 13,000<br />Year-over-year change: 47,000</p>
<p>Number of properties that are 30 or more days past due or in foreclosure: 2,265,000<br />Month-over-month change: -76,000<br />Year-over-year change: 56,000</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is it about?</span></p>
<p>TSOs propose to amend how balancing service providers (BSPs) participate in the European balancing markets, by harmonising:</p>

<title>Sage Capital Management Launches Private Banking Service For Institutional Clients, Providing Complete Integrated Financial Infrastructure For Digital Assets</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sage-capital-management-launches-private-banking-service-for-institutional-clien-2026126/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sage-capital-management-launches-private-banking-service-for-institutional-clien-2026126/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="http://www.sagecapital.co.uk/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Sage Capital Management</a>&nbsp;has evolved its business from a crypto prime broker to a complete operating system for digital assets. At the core of this transformation is the launch of the firm&rsquo;s private banking service designed for crypto professionals, enabling seamless management between fiat and digital asset markets within a single operating environment. In addition, Sage Capital Management has introduced a proprietary unified trading platform for liquidity, execution, risk management, and Transaction Cost Analysis (TCA).</p>
<p>With this expanded offering, Sage Capital Management can now enable hedge funds, asset managers, trading firms, brokers, corporate treasuries and digital asset treasuries to connect banking, markets access, capital, and technology through one regulated counterparty, providing them with all the infrastructure they need to seamlessly move, trade, and manage digital assets globally.</p>
<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathansage/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Nathan Sage</a>, CEO, Sage Capital Management, &ldquo;Today we are announcing an unrivalled offering that addresses significant pain points for institutional clients such as fragmentation and operational friction. We have created a single environment, with unified onboarding, which connects every part of the financial workflow for institutional digital asset clients, reducing operational risk, speeding up the movement of funds, minimising counterparty exposure, and enhancing capital efficiency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In particular, the launch of our banking service, fully integrated into our digital asset infrastructure is game changing, setting new standards in how institutional clients access, manage and deploy capital across digital asset markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sage Capital Management&rsquo;s new integrated financial network consists of four key pillars, which are available independently but have been designed to deliver maximum value when used together. These are:</p>
<p><b>Banking&nbsp;</b>-<b>&nbsp;</b>Launching today, Sage Capital Management&rsquo;s banking service provides clients with named, multi-currency accounts under their legal entity, with access to UK Faster Payments, SEPA, SWIFT and over 140 global currencies. This private banking style service is integrated with global payment rails from Tier 1 banks and enables clients to send and receive payments globally, just like a traditional bank account but directly connected to digital asset markets. Clients benefit by being able to move quickly between fiat and digital assets, and manage payments and FX. They can also have physical and virtual corporate Mastercard debit cards linked to their account.</p>
<p>A major feature of this new banking service is that every Sage Capital Management client receives an Embedded COO&trade; - a senior operator who acts as an extension of their business. This is the operational backbone of the service, providing clients with a true banking operations partner, not just access to an account.</p>
<p><b>Markets Access&nbsp;</b>- Providing clients with unified access to global spot, derivatives, and OTC liquidity, through a single, regulated counterparty. Sage Capital Management offers real-time settlement, unified risk, and non-internalised execution, with deep liquidity across more than 40 global venues, removing the need to onboard, fund, or manage multiple venues or liquidity providers.</p>
<p><b>Capital Engine -&nbsp;</b>Enabling clients to have centralised access to portfolio margin, institutional credit, and structured financing.&nbsp; Collateral is deployed once and used across the network, supported by Sage Capital Management&rsquo;s multi-provider capital architecture, which routes credit dynamically, maximising collateral efficiency.</p>
<p><b>The Sage Platform&nbsp;</b>- This proprietary technology development, also launching today, provides clients with a unified trading platform for liquidity, execution, margin, risk and TCA. It enables multi-venue, multi-product trading with an aggregated orderbook, advanced algos, and customisable institutional workspaces<b>.</b></p>
<p>Nathan Sage concludes, &ldquo;Our new offering sets us apart from competitors, with one integrated financial network, powered by a unified technology platform and engineered for institutional scale. We are giving institutions the ability to operate end-to-end &ndash; across banking, liquidity, capital, and technology &ndash; without friction, and are ultimately making institutional participation in digital assets more accessible than ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sage Capital Management operates within a multi-jurisdictional framework across the UK, EU and other recognised financial authorities. Banking, payments, custody and credit services are delivered through regulated entities and partners, ensuring institutional-grade governance, compliance, and operational oversight.</p>

<div>
<p class="component-text">Tokyo Stock Exchange, Inc. (TSE) has promoted English disclosure by listed companies in order to enhance convenience for overseas investors and enable them to make appropriate investment decisions based on the disclosed information. As part of this effort, TSE has been conducting surveys on the English disclosure implementation status of listed companies and providing a list of the results on its website to a wide range of people including overseas investors.</p>
<p class="component-text">The survey data is aggregated once per year and published as a report. TSE has now finalized the summary report as of the end of December 2025.<br /><br />As English disclosure became mandatory for companies listed on the Prime Market in April 2025, earnings reports and timely disclosure documents have been, in principle, disclosed simultaneously in Japanese and English. For other types of documents, the English disclosure rates of Prime-listed companies rose to 87.1% (up 4.2% year on year) for IR presentations and 94.9% (up 2.5% year on year) for notices of general shareholders meetings (notices and reference documents), showing that progress has been made in efforts that extend beyond simply meeting mandatory obligations.<br /><br />For more information, please refer to the appendix.</p>

<title>NGX Group, Lagos State, HEI Expand Project BLOOM To Alimosho, Building On Measurable Social Impact</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Nigerian Exchange Group Plc (NGX Group), in partnership with the Lagos State Government and the Health Emergency Initiative (HEI), has extended Project BLOOM (Bringing Life to Our Overlooked Minors) to Alimosho Local Government Area, continuing efforts to address child malnutrition in underserved communities across Lagos State.</p>
<p>The third outreach under the initiative, held in Alimosho within Lagos State Health District I, reached over 120 malnourished children, providing nutritional support, medical screening, and caregiver education. This follows earlier interventions in Yaba and Ajegunle, which have collectively supported over 320 children and 300 caregivers, with monitoring data showing that more than 50% of beneficiaries in the first two phases entered recovery.</p>
<p>NGX Group staff volunteers worked alongside Lagos State health workers and HEI facilitators during the outreach, assisting with screenings and data recording. Structured follow-up visits are scheduled after four weeks to monitor recovery and provide extended care where necessary.</p>
<p>Temi Popoola, Group Managing Director and CEO of NGX Group, linked the initiative to broader economic resilience. &ldquo;Sustainable capital markets are built on strong social foundations,&rdquo; he stated. &ldquo;The recovery rates we see with Project BLOOM prove that targeted, collaborative action between the public sector, civil society, and the private sector can deliver tangible impact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Executive Director of HEI, Achunine Pascal, said child malnutrition remains a major contributor to under-five mortality in Nigeria, adding that Project BLOOM is designed to go beyond immediate food support through structured follow-up and continued care.</p>
<p>Also speaking, the Chairman of Alimosho Local Government Area, Honourable Akinpelu Ibrahim Johnson, said the initiative supports the council&rsquo;s long-term strategy for improving child nutrition through early detection, prevention, and effective management of malnutrition. Representing the Permanent Secretary, Lagos State Health District I, Dr. Solomon Adeyanju commended NGX Group for its commitment to child health, describing Project BLOOM as a valuable complement to the state&rsquo;s primary healthcare efforts.</p>
<p>With additional outreaches planned, the partners reaffirmed their commitment to reducing preventable child mortality while strengthening the social foundations required for sustainable economic growth.</p>

<title>Correcting The Record: Progress Trumps Nostalgia, Jamie Selway, Director, SEC Division Of Trading And Markets, Keith Cassidy, Director, SEC Division Of Examinations, Jan. 23, 2026</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>More than twenty years ago, major brokerages entered into the Global Research Analyst Settlement (GRAS) to address allegations of twelve investment banking firms&rsquo; undue influence over research analysts at the time. GRAS imposed necessary but expressly provisional restrictions, including a five-year sunset clause, while the SEC worked to build a stronger, more durable regulatory framework applicable to the full universe of firms and their research departments.</p>
<p>In a recent opinion article, former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt suggests that ending GRAS weakens safeguards against analyst conflicts. We share Mr. Levitt&rsquo;s longstanding concern for market integrity. But GRAS was never intended to be permanent&mdash;and investor protection neither begins nor ends with a single settlement. Today&rsquo;s newer rules are broader in scope, more enforceable in practice, and calibrated to new technologies that enhance information accessible by investors.</p>
<p>Since GRAS, the SEC and FINRA, which has responsibility for all investment firms that conduct analyst research, have implemented a comprehensive set of protections that directly address research analyst conflicts. Regulation Analyst Certification, for example, requires analysts to affirm that their views are their own and to disclose compensation tied to their recommendations. FINRA Rule 2241, meanwhile, governs equity research conflicts; Rule 2242 does the same for debt research. These measures surpass GRAS in scope and provide clear standards and strong oversight.</p>
<p>Mr. Levitt&rsquo;s column also does not take account of FINRA&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure that existing and future rules enable firms to produce quality and objective research in the interest of investors. As FINRA&rsquo;s CEO Robert Cook&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.finra.org/media-center/blog/global-research-analyst-settlement-retirement">emphasizes</a>, current rules exceed GRAS requirements. Where Mr. Levitt focused on GRAS firewalls that helped to shield research analysts from the undue influence of investment banking personnel, Mr. Cook explains that Rule 2241&rsquo;s provisions are intended to provide such protection, doing so with a broader scope while taking into account the complexities of different business models and unique fact patterns. Further, the SEC monitors market practices through examinations and collaboration with FINRA, targeting the very misconduct that led to GRAS.</p>
<p>Markets evolve&mdash;and regulation must keep pace. GRAS was a stopgap, not a permanent solution. Investor protection hasn&rsquo;t ended; it has advanced. Clinging to an antiquated paradigm favors nostalgia over progress. Today&rsquo;s framework surpasses GRAS in scope and provides flexibility to address the future &ndash; with investor protection top of mind.</p>

<p>The CSA strongly urges anyone receiving an email from the CSA to remain vigilant and consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the message from a real, consistent and verifiable email address?</li>
<li>Is the message from someone you know who works at the CSA or works in one of its member organizations?</li>
<li>Were you expecting this email?</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Michael S. Selig today announced he will sponsor the CFTC&rsquo;s Agricultural Advisory Committee, and the CFTC is seeking nominations to fill current vacancies on the AAC. Submissions must be received by Feb. 18.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am honored to follow the footsteps of former CFTC Chairmen and sponsor the vitally important Agricultural Advisory Committee,&rdquo; Chairman Selig said. &ldquo;Agricultural futures markets were core to the CFTC&rsquo;s humble beginning 50 years ago and continue to be a central focus today. While the CFTC&rsquo;s regulatory authority continues to evolve, we cannot forget our roots. The viewpoints of America&rsquo;s growers, producers and the broader agricultural community are essential to informing the Commission as we work to support the markets for safe, abundant and affordable food, fiber and fuel for all Americans."</p>
<p>The AAC was created to advise the Commission on agricultural derivatives market regulatory issues and priorities that are important to producers, processors, consumers, and other interested stakeholders. The AAC is authorized to submit reports and recommendations to the Commission.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The public is invited to nominate individuals for the AAC and propose potential topics to prioritize. Each nomination submission should include relevant information about the nominee, such as the individual&rsquo;s name, title, and organizational affiliation as well as information that supports the individual&rsquo;s qualifications for selection. The submission should also include suggestions for potential topics to prioritize as well as the name and email or mailing address of the person nominating the individual. AAC nominations and topic suggestions should be sent to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:AAC@CFTC.gov">AAC@cftc.gov</a>&nbsp;by Feb. 18. Submission of a nomination is not a guarantee of selection.</p>
<p><span><strong>About CFTC Advisory Committees</strong></span></p>
<p>The CFTC oversees five active&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/About/CFTCCommittees/index.htm">advisory committees</a>. They were created to provide advice and recommendations to the Commission on a variety of regulatory and market issues that affect the integrity and competitiveness of U.S. markets. The advisory committees facilitate communication between the Commission and market participants, other regulators, and academics. The views, opinions, and information expressed by the advisory committees are solely theirs and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Commission, its staff, or the U.S. government.</p>

<title>Moomoo Expands Retail Access To The BitGo IPO With Broad Subscriber Participation - 100% Of Moomoo Subscribers Who Requested Shares Received At Least One Share</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p align="left"><a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=o0E8qqI1kVlKBR5Cre7iLhkr2Mdm6tO-W7hJhdvoGYSDDGGGXzO_oByWL1oLMsWmo6UlFYzscyr3p8DAIdv1KQ==" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Moomoo">Moomoo</a>, a leading global investment and trading platform, announced expanded retail access to the Initial Public Offering (IPO) of BitGo (NYSE: BTGO)&mdash;the first crypto IPO of 2026&mdash;with moomoo accounting for just under 10% of the total offering. Moomoo investors overall subscribed for $647.6 million in BitGo shares, which is over three times the total offering, with all moomoo customers who requested shares receiving an allocation, signaling exceptional retail demand. This outcome exceeds typical retail access in competitive, oversubscribed IPOs and underscores moomoo&rsquo;s growing role in bridging retail and institutional access as IPO activity begins to reaccelerate.</p>
<p align="left">BitGo is one of the most closely watched digital asset companies to enter the public markets, and its debut reflects renewed investor interest in the crypto and digital assets sector. For years, retail participation in IPOs has been constrained by limited access. Moomoo is working to change that dynamic by expanding retail participation in high-demand offerings and providing subscribers who requested shares with a more consistent path to allocation. This approach builds on prior subscriber participation by moomoo subscribers in offerings such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=tCfKEfLUsOjqbzmu884GfjFNBQY1A4a3VXGuw9_ukCao9IGtKKVxWRqkiGRwDQu_MkT3A62E-bQk44EBgLB_uQv1SZXjd8rY-TJo0Rqv9392cBLu--jrXnBbnLPGnTHTjJ_MZgdV7VtYVOthMV1a9W_61Mrf7WsmBm_ZyuviRck=" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Bullish">Bullish</a>, Figure, and Gemini.</p>
<p align="left">&ldquo;We are pleased to work with moomoo on our IPO and to make shares available to a broad base of investors,&rdquo; said Mike Belshe, CEO of BitGo. &ldquo;Through our partnership with moomoo, we&rsquo;re expanding access to public market opportunities, which aligns with the ongoing evolution of digital assets, where broader investor participation has been a core principle from the start.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="left">In addition to IPO access, moomoo provides comprehensive research and analytical resources to support informed investment decisions. The platform offers a robust suite of tools, including moomoo AI*, an intelligent investing assistant that delivers professional-grade insights across equities, ETFs, and IPO candidates. Powered by moomoo&rsquo;s extensive data ecosystem, moomoo AI helps users analyze market trends, financial metrics, and broader macro signals related to new listings.</p>
<p align="left">&ldquo;Participating in the BitGo IPO reflects our focus on expanding access to meaningful investment opportunities for our subscribers,&rdquo; said Neil McDonald, CEO of moomoo US. &ldquo;For this offering, we focused on preparation, transparency, and execution to help users participate with confidence as the IPO market begins to reopen.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="left"><em>*Moomoo AI is an AI tool provided by Moomoo Technologies Inc. (&ldquo;MTI&rdquo;). The tool is powered by widely used, publicly available AI solutions.

<title>The EBA Updates Technical Standards To Streamline Resolution Planning And Strengthen Cooperation In Resolution Colleges</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-eba-updates-technical-standards-to-streamline-resolution-planning-and-streng-2026123/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published its updated final draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) on resolution plans and on the functioning of resolution colleges. The revisions aim to simplify and refocus resolution planning while improving the effectiveness of cooperation and coordination among authorities.</span></p>
<p>Drawing on more than a decade of practical experience, as well as insights from crisis cases and simulation exercises, the EBA has completed a comprehensive review of the RTS on resolution plans and resolution colleges, adopted in 2016 and combined under&nbsp;<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02016R1075-20160708">Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1075</a>. The updated standards revise both the structure and the content of resolution plans and enhance the operational framework for resolution colleges for cross‑border groups.</p>
<p><span>Key changes to the RTS on resolution plans and resolvability assessments include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>A more consistent and concise set of essential information for plan summaries</li>
<li>More proportionate and focused plan content, tailored to the specificities of each institution or group.</li>
<li>A clearer separation between the resolution strategy selection and the assessment of resolvability.</li>
<li>A reorganised resolvability assessment structured around seven core dimensions to ensure greater consistency and effectiveness across the EU.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Key updates to the RTS on resolution colleges aim to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Simplify processes&nbsp;to reduce administrative burden.</li>
<li>Improve cooperation and information exchange among authorities involved in planning and execution.</li>
<li>Strengthen coordination mechanisms for the implementation of resolution schemes.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Legal basis</h4>
<p>Under the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) - Directive 2014/59/EU - the EBA is mandated to specify the content of resolution plans (Articles 10 and 12), the assessment of resolvability (Article 15), and the operational functioning of resolution colleges (Article 88). The original RTS were submitted to the Commission in 2014 and adopted in 2016.</p>

<title>Bitcoin In Correction Mode: Geopolitical Tensions And The Fed Succession Puzzle - Comment From James Butterfill, CoinShares’ Head Of Research</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><b><i>James Butterfill, CoinShares&rsquo; Head of Research, comments on current market conditions in the crypto sector. His focus: the ongoing Bitcoin correction, the upcoming nomination of the next US Federal Reserve Chair, and regulatory developments in the United States.</i></b></p>
<p><b>Bitcoin Correction: Geopolitics vs. Market Psychology</b><br />Bitcoin is currently in a correction phase driven by multiple factors simultaneously. Recent geopolitical stress surrounding Greenland and renewed tariff threats, which are similar to the developments with China last October, are weighing on market sentiment. In addition, sustained selling pressure from large market participants (&ldquo;whales&rdquo;) is dragging prices lower in the short term. While the widely cited four-year cycle theory is not fundamentally convincing, it has become increasingly self-fulfilling and is contributing to the current pullback.</p>
<p>Historically, geopolitical shocks tend to follow a similar pattern: events such as the collapse of the Yen carry trade or trade-related disputes initially trigger sharp drawdowns in Bitcoin before a phase of stabilization begins. The trajectory always depends on the specific nature of the event. Against this backdrop, continued short-term pressure followed by recovery appears likely.</p>
<p><b>Fed Succession: Why the Market May Be Wrong<br /></b>A second major headwind is uncertainty around the next Federal Reserve Chair. Markets had recently priced in Kevin Hasset, currently serving as a White House adviser, however President Trump signaled that he prefers to keep him in his current role. As a result, Polymarket has moved strongly toward Kevin Warsh, who is considered a pronounced hawk and skeptical of rate cuts. This expectation is visibly influencing Bitcoin sentiment.</p>
<p>This interpretation is largely misguided: in the current environment, Warsh would be poorly aligned with Trump&rsquo;s repeatedly stated objective of monetary easing this year. A Fed Chair who would categorically rule out rate cuts does not fit the President&rsquo;s policy direction. Futures markets and prediction markets may therefore be mispricing this scenario.</p>
<p>In the short term, geopolitical risks and the Fed succession question remain defining drivers for Bitcoin. In the medium to long term, however, the familiar pattern persists of geopolitical stress causing volatility but not necessarily structural weakness.</p>
<p><b>Regulation: The &ldquo;Clarity Act&rdquo; in Limbo</b><br />On the US regulatory front, delays to the &ldquo;Clarity Act&rdquo; are becoming increasingly apparent. Originally designed to establish clear rules for stablecoins and particularly beneficial for Ethereum, is currently being blocked in the US Senate Banking Committee because of a dispute relating to the rewards that are paid to those who own stablecoins. The bill&rsquo;s original intent risks being diluted by political interests.</p>

<title>Forks In The Curve: Whether And How To Respond To Monetary Policy Divergence - Speech By Megan Greene, Bank Of England, Member Of The Monetary Policy Committee, Given At The Resolution Foundation</title>

<div class="hero-paragraph"><span class="hero">
<p>In this speech, Megan Greene argues the UK economy is shaped by choices made by other central banks, mainly the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. Using history and fresh evidence, she explains how monetary policy divergence impacts UK inflation and growth, and how UK policy should react to the domestic effects.</p>

<h2>Speech</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s wonderful to be here with you at the Resolution Foundation today. The turn of the year is a time when we often take stock of where the economy has been and look ahead to the next 12 months. It&rsquo;s this annual ritual that has motivated my remarks today.</p>
<p>As a monetary policymaker at an inflation-targeting central bank, I spend a lot of time thinking about the future path for UK inflation when setting policy. But it isn&rsquo;t just the UK&rsquo;s monetary policy that matters for the evolution of inflation&mdash;monetary policy in other jurisdictions can impact our financial conditions and economy as well.</p>
<p>We can determine how markets expect interest rates to evolve by looking at the instantaneous forward OIS curves for the US, UK and euro area (Figure 1). You can see there is difference in the level of policy rates, particularly between the US and UK on the one hand and the euro area on the other, reflecting both cyclical and structural differences in these economies. More importantly, markets are pricing continued rate cuts for the UK and US this year, while the ECB is expected to keep rates on hold. If the markets are to be believed, some monetary policy divergence will emerge in 2026.</p>

<h5>Market capitalisation of &euro;25 billion; &euro;3.8 billion raised&nbsp;</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>2<span>nd</span>&nbsp;listing on Euronext in 2026</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>World&rsquo;s largest defence IPO ever recorded</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Strengthening Europe&rsquo;s strategic autonomy through capital markets&nbsp;</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Supported by Euronext&rsquo;s initiatives to enhance financing and visibility for European aerospace and defence companies</h5>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Euronext today congratulates Czechoslovak Group (&ldquo;CSG&rdquo;), a leading defence group based in Prague, on its listing on Euronext Amsterdam &nbsp;(ticker code: CSG).&nbsp;The listing of CSG underscores the growing role of European capital markets in supporting strategic industries that contribute to Europe&rsquo;s long-term autonomy and security.&nbsp;It is the 2<span>nd</span>&nbsp;listing on Euronext in 2026 and&nbsp;the world&rsquo;s largest defence IPO ever recorded, both in terms of amount raised and market capitalization.</p>
<p>CSG is one of Europe&rsquo;s leading defence companies and a critical long-term supplier to NATO&nbsp;states and partners. It&nbsp;is the second largest medium- and large-calibre ammunition producer in Europe and the largest small-calibre ammunition producer globally. CSG sells its products to key long-term customers, ranging from government bodies to well-established companies&nbsp;in over 70 countries worldwide.&nbsp;Founded in the Czech Republic, the Group&rsquo;s global footprint comprises 39 manufacturing facilities based in the Czech Republic, India,&nbsp;Italy, Serbia, Slovakia, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States.</p>
<p>The admission and issue price of CSG shares was set at &euro;25 per share. Market capitalisation was &euro;25 billion. The Initial Public Offering (IPO) raised a total of &euro;3.8 billion&nbsp;(assuming full exercise of the Over-Allotment Option).&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Michal Strnad, Chairman, Chairman of CSG,&nbsp;said:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<em>Today marks a historic milestone for CSG as we join the Euronext Amsterdam market and we welcome the confidence shown in us by investors. Our successful listing is a testament to the hard work, dedication and ingenuity of our people, and to the trust our customers and partners place in us. Becoming a publicly listed company demonstrates our commitment to high standards of transparency, disclosure and corporate governance and strengthens our ability to invest in innovation, expand our global reach and deliver on our mission to be a critical long-term supplier of advanced defence and industrial solutions to NATO states and Government partners worldwide. We are proud of the combination of our Czech industrial heritage and our global manufacturing footprint, and we look forward to creating long term value for all our stakeholders in the years ahead.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The listing of CSG highlights the importance of Euronext&rsquo;s initiatives to improve access to financing for European aerospace and defence companies. As Europe&rsquo;s leading capital markets infrastructure, Euronext plays a vital role in connecting the financing needs of strategic industries with increasing investor interest across European markets. Through dedicated measures such as the A&amp;D Funding Days, the European Defence Bond Label, the IPOready Defence programme and the European A&amp;D Growth Hub powered by ELITE, Euronext continues to deliver tailored solutions that strengthen Europe&rsquo;s strategic autonomy and competitiveness.&nbsp;<a href="https://gbr01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.euronext.com%2Fen%2Flisting%2Fraise-capital%2Fsector-focused-listing-solutions%2Faerospace-and-defence&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cbguegan%40euronext.com%7C2c7ea3776d8c4f1562a308de0caf80bf%7C315b1ee5c224498b871ec140611d6d07%7C0%7C0%7C638962145105636072%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=FGrddPk%2F1zBSs09RyuEJfaemx75zZ4qv%2F9to98IBbl8%3D&amp;reserved=0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Learn more about Euronext&rsquo;s initiatives to enhance financing and visibility for European aerospace and defence companies</a>.</p>

<title>ASIC: Former Financial Advisor Anthony Torre Sentenced To Six Years Imprisonment For Fraud And Stealing</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The District Court of Western Australia has sentenced former financial advisor, Anthony Paul Torre, to six years imprisonment, backdated to commence on 29 January 2025. Mr Torre will be eligible for parole after serving four years of his sentence.</p>
<p>Mr Torre was sentenced in relation to three counts of stealing and two counts of fraud resulting in the misappropriation of a total of $1,030,000 of clients&rsquo; superannuation funds during the period March 2010 and January 2015, contrary to sections 378 and 409 of the&nbsp;<em>Criminal Code&nbsp;</em>(WA). Mr Torre pleaded guilty to these offences on 28 January 2025, the day his trial for these offences was due to commence.</p>
<p>Mr Torre&rsquo;s victims included a couple over the age of 60 who were defrauded $500,000 and another man over the age of 60 who had $150,000 stolen.</p>
<p>ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said, &lsquo;Mr Torre betrayed the trust of his clients and left many of them financially devastated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The sentence imposed by the Court demonstrates the seriousness of the financial harm Mr Torre caused his clients and sends a clear message that misconduct predicated on trust will not be tolerated,&rsquo; the Deputy Chair said.</p>
<p>When handing down the sentence, Judge Prior remarked, &lsquo;This was a gross breach of trust&hellip;. The victims entrusted you with some of their life savings, their superannuation&rsquo;s funds, which they&rsquo;d worked hard for over the years and were hoping to utilise or enjoy in their retirement&hellip;. The victims in each case were vulnerable because you had easy access to their money and they trusted you as a professional financial advisor... I find your offending was due to a combination of greed, incompetence and arrogance&hellip;. I must impose a sentence that will deter other professionals such as financial advisors who might be minded to think that they can use their client&rsquo;s money inconsistently and against their clients' instructions and authorities.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As a result of Mr Torre&rsquo;s conviction, he is automatically disqualified from managing companies for five years.</p>
<p>The matter was prosecuted by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) following an investigation and referral by ASIC.</p>

<title>SGX RegCo Seeks Feedback On Changes To Board Lot Sizes</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Singapore Exchange Regulation (SGX RegCo) is consulting the public on proposed changes to reduce the standard board lot size of certain instruments traded on SGX&rsquo;s stock market.</p>
<p>This reduction was supported by the Equities Market Review Group as part of its recommendations to strengthen the development of Singapore&rsquo;s stock market.</p>
<p>The proposed changes are:</p>
<ol>
<li>reduction in the standard board lot size from 100 units to 10 units for instruments priced above $10 and up to $100; and</li>
<li>reduction in the standard board lot size from 100 units to 1 unit for instruments priced above $100.</li>
</ol>
<p>A smaller standard board lot size will lower the minimum outlay required for investments. This makes higher-priced stocks more affordable and accessible to investors, which could in turn broaden investor participation and increase trading activity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Share prices of some of our largest stocks have risen significantly in recent years, and about 30% of trading activity now comes from stocks priced above $10. This is the segment where we want to enhance accessibility and broaden participation. By reducing the board lot size for these higher-priced stocks, we bring the minimum investment down from a few thousand dollars to just a few hundred &ndash; making such investments more within reach, especially for younger retail investors,&rdquo; said Ng Yao Loong, Head of Equities, SGX Group.</p>
<p>Separately, arising from a regular review of the stock market structure, SGX RegCo is also proposing to remove the requirement to align the minimum bid sizes of securities and futures contracts traded in Hong Kong Dollar, Renminbi or Japanese Yen to those in their home markets.</p>
<p>The consultation is found&nbsp;<a href="https://regco.sgx.com/public-consultations">here</a>&nbsp;and SGX RegCo requests all comments by 13 February 2026. If the market supports the changes, they are expected to be implemented in mid-2026.</p>

<title>ASIC: Former United Global Capital Financial Adviser Milutin Petrovic’s Ban Varied To Three Years</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Former United Global Capital (UGC) (in liquidation) financial adviser Milutin Petrovic has had a six year ban varied to three years by the Administrative Review Tribunal.</p>
<p>Mr Petrovic will be banned from providing financial services, performing any function involved in carrying on of a financial services business and controlling an entity that carries on a financial services business for three years.</p>
<p>In January 2025, Mr Petrovic sought a review of a decision to ban him for six years which was made by a delegate of ASIC. The Administrative Review Tribunal heard the matter in June and July 2025. The decision to vary the ban was issued on 11 December 2025.</p>
<p>ART&nbsp;Decision:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/cth/ARTA/2025/2717.html?context=1;query=Milutin%20Petrovic;mask_path=">Petrovic and Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission ARTA 2717 (11 December 2025)</a>.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Mr Petrovic was banned from providing financial services, performing any function involved in carrying on of a financial services business and controlling an entity that carries on a financial services business for six years effective from January 2025&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-185mr-asic-bans-former-united-global-capital-in-liquidation-financial-adviser-milutin-petrovic-for-6-years/" title="25-185MR ASIC bans former United Global Capital (in Liquidation) financial adviser Milutin Petrovic for 6 years">25-185MR</a>.</p>
<p>Mr Petrovic applied to the Administrative Review Tribunal for a review of ASIC&rsquo;s decision. Mr Petrovic also applied for stay and confidentiality orders and that application has been withdrawn. The substantive review application was heard on 30 June and 1 and 2 July 2025.</p>
<p>The banning took effect from 15 January 2025, was stayed on an interim basis on 28 February 2025, and resumed on 26 March 2025 when that stay was dissolved.</p>
<p>The banning arose from Mr Petrovic&rsquo;s role as a financial adviser of UGC.&nbsp;ASIC was concerned that UGC and its representatives gave conflicted personal advice to clients, specifically those&nbsp;advised to establish&nbsp;a self-managed superannuation fund (SMSF) and invest in highly speculative investments related to Joel Hewish (UGC&rsquo;s director). This included a company called Global Capital Property Fund Limited (GCPF).</p>

<title>ASIC: Fund Manager Sentenced To 6 Years’ Jail In $3 Million Platinum Asset Management Insider Trading Case</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-fund-manager-sentenced-to-6-years-jail-in-3-million-platinum-asset-manag-2026123/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-fund-manager-sentenced-to-6-years-jail-in-3-million-platinum-asset-manag-2026123/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Former investment manager Rodney Forrest has been sentenced to 6 years&rsquo; imprisonment for insider trading and procuring others to trade in more than $3 million of Platinum Asset Management Limited (Platinum) shares (ASX: PTM).</p>
<p>In August 2024, Mr Forrest secretly accessed the computer of the Chairman of Regal Partners Limited (Regal) without permission and photographed confidential takeover documents (&lsquo;Pitch Deck&rsquo;). He then traded and procured others to trade in Platinum shares before leaking details of the takeover to the media, making over $300,000 profit for himself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The Federal Court in Sydney today sentenced Mr Forrest to five years imprisonment for insider trading and two years for procuring others to trade, with one year of the procuring offence to be served cumulatively with the insider trading offence. With a total sentence of six years and a non-parole period of three years, Mr Forrest will be eligible for parole on 22 January 2029.</p>
<p>His Honour Justice Bromwich&rsquo;s sentence also took into account a further offence that Mr Forrest provided unlicensed financial services as an investment funds manager to two entities over a 9-month period.</p>
<p>This marks the first outcome for ASIC&rsquo;s new specialist insider trading team which investigated and finalised the case within 16 months of the offending. The matter was prosecuted by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) (CDPP).</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s market surveillance team detected Mr Forrest&rsquo;s suspicious trading activity in September 2024<strong>.&nbsp;</strong>ASIC&rsquo;s insider trading team quickly launched an investigation, which led to a search warrant being executed on Mr Forrest&rsquo;s home in November 2024 and charges being laid in August 2025.</p>
<p>Prior to being charged, Mr Forrest adopted an agreed statement of facts for sentence and agreed to plead guilty at the first mention of the matter in the Downing Centre Local Court. Mr Forrest also agreed to forfeit the total realised profit from his insider trading of $309,571.84. The matter was committed for sentence to the Federal Court.</p>
<p>ASIC Chair Joe Longo said the prosecution of insider trading was an enduring priority for ASIC.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr Forrest&rsquo;s actions were a brazen breach of trust and exploitation, and his imprisonment today reflects the seriousness of his crime.</p>
<p>&lsquo;While some insider trading cases can take several years, Mr Forrest went from crime to jail time in just over a year, underscoring ASIC&rsquo;s determination to fast-track criminal cases of this type.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Insider trading is a zero-sum game. When somebody profits from inside information, everyone else loses, including every Australian with a superannuation or investment account.</p>
<p>&lsquo;ASIC will continue cracking down on insider trading and other misconduct that damages market integrity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Australia is recognised globally for the integrity of its financial markets, and ASIC is determined to keep it that way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In delivering the sentence, His Honour Justice Robert Bromwich said, &lsquo;This was serious and pernicious offending.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr Forrest ... obtained the Pitch Deck deliberately and dishonestly ... what then followed in relation to the use of that information was plainly premeditated, even if it cannot be known how far in advance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr Forrest ... made a conscious choice to do something he knew was wrong, dishonest and illegal.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was a profound breach of trust to obtain that information, and an even more profound breach of trust to use it for the purpose of illegal share trading.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The whole point of the insider trading prohibition is ... to maintain the integrity of the market by creating and maintaining a level information playing field,&rsquo; His Honour said.</p>
<p>Since 2009, 46 people have been criminally convicted of insider trading following ASIC investigations, including senior executives and company chairs. The maximum penalty for the offence of insider trading is imprisonment for 15 years.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>In line with its 2025 enforcement priorities, ASIC established a dedicated insider trading team in late September 2024 to swiftly progress insider trading investigations and increase the number of criminal briefs referred to the CDPP.</p>
<p>In July 2024, ASIC released Report 787&nbsp;<em>Review of Australian equity market cleanliness</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-787-review-of-australian-equity-market-cleanliness-1-november-2018-to-30-april-2024/" title="REP 787 Review of Australian equity market cleanliness: 1 November 2018 to 30 April 2024">REP 787</a>), which found that Australia&rsquo;s equity markets continue to operate with a high level of integrity and remain consistently among the cleanest in the world.</p>
<p>While the report confirmed strong overall market cleanliness, it did identify a temporary deterioration towards the end of 2023. During this period, an increase in media reports of deal information ahead of takeover, merger and capital-raising announcements suggested potential leaks of inside information, indicating a heightened risk of insider trading at such times.</p>
<p>Management of inside information does not only matter to public companies. Industry participants involved in corporate transactions, including market intermediaries, corporate and professional advisers, fund managers and entities operating in private markets play a crucial role in supporting market cleanliness. These parties often have access to inside information and are responsible for maintaining confidentiality, supervising their representatives and handling that information with appropriate care.</p>
<p>Rodney Forrest pleaded guilty to charges in August 2025 at the first mention of the matter in the Downing Centre Local Court, following a six-month investigation by ASIC&rsquo;s insider trading team (<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-163mr-charges-laid-in-platinum-asset-management-insider-trading-case/" title="25-163MR Charges laid in Platinum Asset Management insider trading case">25-163MR</a>).</p>
<p>In the statement of agreed facts filed with the Court in August 2025, Mr Forrest admitted: that while in possession of the inside information he:</p>
<ul>
<li>Acquired around $2.69 million worth of Platinum shares between 29 August to 10 September 2024.</li>
<li>Procured two individuals and an entity (for whom Forrest was the unlicensed investment manager) to also trade in Platinum shares between 6 September to 16 September 2024, in the case of the individuals by encouraging them to buy, and in the case of the entity, by operating its trading account to purchase Platinum shares totalling $457,000.</li>
<li>Leaked the inside information to the media.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Based on the statement of agreed facts filed with the Court, Mr Forrest admitted to the following chain of events:</strong></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good afternoon, and welcome to the second day of the Joint Compliance Outreach Program. My views are my own as a Commissioner and not necessarily those of the SEC or my fellow commissioners.</p>
<p>About 100 years ago, my hometown of Cleveland, Ohio, which sits on Lake Erie and is bisected by the Cuyahoga River, was grappling with the growing pains of a new century.&nbsp;The city had grown mightily on both sides of the river, and traffic snarled the existing thoroughfares, which only connected certain parts of the city.&nbsp;Rapid industrial growth had led to massive pollution in Lake Erie, which threatened Cleveland&rsquo;s clean water supply.&nbsp;Faced with these challenges, Cleveland did what municipalities do when encountering an infrastructure challenge: it issued municipal bonds and built.</p>
<p>To handle the traffic, Cleveland built the Hope Memorial Bridge, famous for the Art Deco statutes called the Guardians of Traffic, from which Cleveland&rsquo;s baseball team now draws its name.<a class="ck-anchor" href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-joint-compliance-outreach-program-municipal-market-professionals-012226?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;To handle the water pollution, it built the Baldwin Water Treatment Plant, a groundbreaking technological achievement at the time.<a class="ck-anchor" href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-joint-compliance-outreach-program-municipal-market-professionals-012226?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;Both structures are still standing and operating today, a testament to the importance of what is accomplished by your industry.</p>
<p>Over the past century, the physical structures of the Hope Bridge and Baldwin plant have been updated repeatedly in response to new technologies and innovations.&nbsp;While the municipal securities industry has also adopted new technologies and innovations, we must be honest: the pace of change here has often been slower than in other corners of our capital markets.&nbsp;Today I want to briefly touch on a potentially transformative innovation&mdash;tokenization&mdash;which is drawing a lot of interest in those other corners of our capital markets and may soon come to yours.</p>
<p>Tokenization offers potential benefits, including atomic settlement, facilitation of extended hours trading, and easier pledging of assets as collateral.&nbsp;Some of those benefits may not be relevant to municipal securities, but others, such as the ability to offer smaller minimum purchase amounts or the potential to enhance secondary market liquidity, may be highly appealing to municipal issuers or investors.&nbsp;As many of you likely know, the first tokenized offering of municipal securities in the United States occurred in 2024 in Quincy, Massachusetts.<a class="ck-anchor" href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-joint-compliance-outreach-program-municipal-market-professionals-012226?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" id="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wide-scale tokenization of municipal securities is not inevitable.&nbsp;Unique features of the municipal securities market&mdash;including its retail nature, the sheer number of issuers, and the complex interplay between state law, securities law, and tax law&mdash;may nullify some of the benefits of tokenization.&nbsp;Regulators are not good predictors of&mdash;let alone good drivers of&mdash; innovation. But we ought to work hard to accommodate technological change.&nbsp;So I want to extend an invitation: please come speak to us as the efforts involving tokenization&mdash;or any new technology&mdash;develop.&nbsp;Tell us when you encounter issues or rules that may be obstacles to change because they were written in an era of ink and paper, without these new technologies in mind.&nbsp;Ask us for clarity when needed.&nbsp;Do not wait until that new technology is knocking on your door.&nbsp;Come talk to us when you see it walking down the street toward you.</p>
<p>To highlight an example of what happens when our rules languish unaffected by the changing world they govern, we need only look at the recent off-channel communications cases.&nbsp;During the previous administration, the Commission brought a series of enforcement actions against broker-dealers, municipal advisors, investment advisers, and nationally registered securities rating organizations, which netted billions of dollars in penalties.&nbsp;The SEC claimed that virtually everyone had violated our recordkeeping rules by failing to capture electronic communications like text messages or WhatsApp chats.</p>
<p>I had a lot of issues with these cases, and they are, in my view, a prime example of what happens when regulators fail to accommodate technological and societal changes in how humans actually interact.&nbsp;One of today&rsquo;s discussion panels concerns enforcement, and compliance with these recordkeeping obligations may be a discussion topic.&nbsp;Rather than forcing our registrants to try to figure out how to comply with rules written for a different world, the SEC should work with industry to modernize these rules for all affected entities with a sensible pragmatism.&nbsp;The Commission, firms, investors, and other market participants are all better off when our rule books reflect the realities of the world in which we live.</p>
<p>Thank you again. I hope you have a fascinating and productive discussion today.&nbsp;</p>

<title>Commission Of Big Shoulders, Jamie Selway, Director, SEC Division Of Trading And Markets, Securities Traders Association Of Chicago Mid-Winter Meeting, Chicago, Il., Jan. 22, 2026</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>Good afternoon. Patty [Schuler], thank you for that kind introduction. Congratulations to STAC on your centennial and a hundred years of meaningful contributions to our industry. Your organization holds a special memory for me. Two days and twenty years ago, I joined a STAC panel for the first time&mdash;because who can resist the attraction of Chicago in January? After our panel ended, a friend encouraged me to head to O&rsquo;Hare, as Chicago-style winter weather was on the way. Luckily for me, I listened, and our flight took off just ahead of a slate of cancellations. I made it home late that Friday night. And on Sunday morning, my wife and I welcomed our first child to the world&mdash;four weeks ahead of schedule. Today, I wish Jack Selway a happy 20<span>th</span>&nbsp;birthday.</p>
<p>Before I say more, please understand that I speak today in my official capacity as the Commission&rsquo;s Director of the Division of Trading and Markets. My remarks do not necessarily reflect the views of the Commission, the Commissioners, or members of the Division&rsquo;s staff.</p>
<p>In 1914, Carl Sandburg published &ldquo;Chicago,&rdquo; the poem that gave your great city its well-known nickname. Sandburg wrote:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come and show me another city with lifted head singing so proud to be alive and coarse and strong and cunning.<br />Flinging magnetic curses amid the toil of piling job on job, here is a tall bold slugger set vivid against the little soft cities;<br />Fierce as a dog with tongue lapping for action, cunning as a savage pitted against the wilderness,<br />Bareheaded,<br />Shoveling,<br />Wrecking,<br />Planning,<br />Building, breaking, rebuilding . . .!&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/selway-remarks-commission-of-big-shoulders-012226?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1">[1]</a></p>
<p>More than a hundred years later, progress has replaced Chicago&rsquo;s hog butchers and tool makers with derivatives exchanges and proprietary traders. Your importance as a center for price discovery and risk management is unquestioned. Your deep global markets and expert trading community are strategic assets that ensure our Nation&rsquo;s continued economic pre-eminence. I am therefore pleased to discuss with this audience certain Division priorities for the next three years under the leadership of Chairman Atkins.</p>
<p>Returning to Sandburg, three of our projects involve &ldquo;planning and building.&rdquo; We will endeavor to create a framework for investors to access tokenized securities. We will work to further harmonize SEC rules with those of the CFTC. And we will guide our equity markets to a successful transition to 24-by-7 operation. &ldquo;Breaking and rebuilding&rdquo; describes our fourth project. Here, the Division proposes to modernize legacy rules to drive efficiency, stoke competitive forces, and reduce costs borne by the investing public.</p>
<p>Building on the work of our Crypto Task Force, the Division has engaged with market participants &ndash; both &ldquo;TradFi&rdquo; incumbents and &ldquo;DeFi&rdquo; new entrants &ndash; across the waterfront of tokenized securities operations, such as primary issuance, secondary trading, and custody. Our touchstone is &ldquo;innovation without arbitrage.&rdquo; This means that as we advise the Commission on modernizing policies to facilitate a healthy ecology for tokenized securities, we aim to do no harm to our existing, well-functioning marketplace. Before the holidays, we granted a &ldquo;no action&rdquo; letter to the DTC for its tokenized security services, and we issued staff statements on custody and trading. The Division will continue to consider staff action where appropriate and will soon take up the pen on rulemaking proposals, starting with financial responsibility, record keeping, and market structure. Importantly, we will work with self-regulatory organizations on initiatives to extend their operations to tokenized securities.</p>
<p>A second &ldquo;build&rdquo; is the SEC&rsquo;s effort to further harmonize its rules with our sister regulator, the CFTC. Here, the Division will work shoulder-to-shoulder with CFTC colleagues to ensure our Nation&rsquo;s continued leadership in financial markets, as Chairman Atkins directed us at our roundtable on September 29:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To achieve this ambitious vision, our two agencies must work in lockstep to transform dual regulation from a source of confusion into a source of strength. Together, we can offer the best of both worlds: the investor protections that have defined U.S. markets, combined with the innovation-friendly approach that will keep us at the frontier of financial technology throughout the 21stcentury.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/selway-remarks-commission-of-big-shoulders-012226?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Digital assets and event contracts squarely present opportunities for partnership. But streamlining rules for traditional markets is equally critical. Operational, capital, and compliance efficiencies await&mdash;as well as potential product and protocol innovations. Our work will be vastly improved by your ideas, and I ask that you engage the Division early and often.</p>
<p>Interest in 24-by-7 equity trading continues to grow, in terms of both retail investors and non-U.S. corporate clients attracted to the unmatched breadth and depth of our capital markets. The marketplace for global capital is already 24-by-7, as are many digital asset platforms, and our third project is to support industry initiatives to move our equity markets in this direction. Much work is required to ensure that investors understand, and benefit from, these profound changes to our collective workflow. As with any far-reaching industry effort, collaboration across the wide spectrum of market constituents is the key to success.</p>
<p>Our fourth project is focused not on the promising future, but rather on present challenges, caused by regulations of yesteryear. As we take stock of our rulebook, we find a number of walls to spackle and many weeds to pull. Regular, reasoned review of private sector obligations engendered by our rules is core to responsible regulation. Current examples of the Division&rsquo;s work here include efforts to reduce costs and improve governance of the Consolidated Audit Trail and to streamline the National Market System via modernization of Rule 611, commonly known as the &ldquo;Trade-Through Rule.&rdquo; The list of possibilities here is long. Once again, your feedback will help us prioritize and remain practical.</p>
<p>Best laid plans and multi-year projects require a healthy dose of humility. It is said that philosopher and boxing legend Mike Tyson observed that &ldquo;everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.&rdquo; And there is no tougher sparring partner than the market, as this community well knows. Quite possibly, surprises and challenges will confront the Division in coming years. Should these occur, trust that immediate demands from market exigencies will always be our priority.</p>
<p>Sandburg spoke of Chicago&rsquo;s &ldquo;lifted head singing so proud to be alive.&rdquo; Happy 100<span>th</span>&nbsp;birthday to STAC. This year, we mark our Nation&rsquo;s 250<span>th</span>&nbsp;birthday as well. So let&rsquo;s cut the cake &ndash; and celebrate. And dedicate ourselves anew to turning birthday wishes and plans and projects into an improved future circumstance that benefits the investing public that we together serve.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and attention. I look forward to your questions and your engagement on our priorities in the future.</p>

<title>SEC Approves 2026 PCAOB Budget And Accounting Support Fee</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-approves-2026-pcaob-budget-and-accounting-support-fee-2026122/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-approves-2026-pcaob-budget-and-accounting-support-fee-2026122/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today approved the 2026 budget for the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) and the related accounting support fee.</p>
<p>The 2026 PCAOB budget totals $362.1 million. The 2026 budget reflects a 9.4% ($37.6 million) decrease from the prior year and includes a 52% and 42% reduction in the chairperson and other Board members&rsquo; compensation, respectively. The accounting support fee (ASF) totals $306.0 million, an 18.4% ($68.9 million) decrease from the prior year, of which $280.3 million will be assessed on public company issuers and $25.7 million will be assessed on brokers and dealers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both during my time as a Commissioner and now as Chairman, I have recognized&ndash;and continue to recognize&ndash;the importance of driving improvements in audit quality. Nevertheless, all regulators, including the Commission and the PCAOB, must continually assess how and whether current approaches to fulfilling the Board&rsquo;s responsibilities provide benefits to investors without imposing excessive burdens on businesses. For the Commission, its diligent oversight of the PCAOB is a crucial check on the considerable authority that the Board holds over audit firms and the risks of potentially excessive burdens,&rdquo;&nbsp;said SEC Chairman Paul S. Atkins in a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-statement-pcaob-2026-budget-012226">statement</a>. &ldquo;A significant aspect of this oversight is the Board&rsquo;s budget. The PCAOB must exhibit a strong commitment to responsible stewardship of the accounting support fee, which is its primary source of funding and functions as a tax on public companies and broker-dealers. This includes being mindful of and transparent about material investments so that the Commission can appropriately exercise our budget oversight responsibilities. The decrease in this year&rsquo;s budget does not detract from the significance of the PCAOB&rsquo;s mission, which remains crucial; rather, it underscores that fiscal discipline and regulatory effectiveness complement each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This year&rsquo;s budget decrease represents progress. However, the ongoing initiatives by the Commission and PCAOB to re-assess the PCAOB&rsquo;s strategic plan, operations, and budget remain key priorities for the future,&rdquo; said SEC Chief Accountant Kurt Hohl. &ldquo;The SEC remains committed to robust oversight of the PCAOB and ensuring that its operations are transparent, justified, and worthy of the trust placed in it by investors and the public.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which established the PCAOB, provides the Commission with oversight responsibility over the PCAOB. This includes reviewing and approving the PCAOB&rsquo;s budget and accounting support fee annually.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) today&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asc.ca/-/media/ASC-Documents-part-1/Regulatory-Instruments/2026/01/6265698v1-CSA-Notice-of-Amendments-8-series-re-Modernization-of-the-Continuous-Disclosure-Regime-for.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced final amendments</a>&nbsp;to modernize the continuous disclosure regime for investment funds. These amendments are designed to reduce the regulatory burden on investment fund managers while maintaining the quality and timeliness of disclosure for investors.</p>
<p>The final rules include the following key amendments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exemptions from certain conflict of interest reporting requirements in securities legislation where similar requirements are already satisfied.</li>
<li>Elimination of certain class- or series-level disclosures from investment fund financial statements that are not required under International Financial Reporting Standards.</li>
<li>Minor editorial and other revisions to the simplified prospectus form.</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;These changes reflect our commitment to making regulation more efficient and responsive,&rdquo; said Stan Magidson, CSA Chair and Chair and CEO of the Alberta Securities Commission. &ldquo;We are reducing unnecessary burden on fund managers while preserving the integrity of investor disclosure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The final rules will take effect on April 22, 2026, and are available on CSA members&rsquo; websites.</p>
<p>The original consultation published on September 19, 2024, related to these final rules also included a proposal to replace the existing annual and interim Management Report of Fund Performance (MRFP) with a new annual and interim Fund Report.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The aim of the Fund Report is to create a document that is more streamlined and significantly less burdensome for fund managers to prepare, and more likely to be read and understood by investors compared to the MRFP. Based on stakeholder feedback, the CSA will develop and test a revised Fund Report that will be published at a later date for a subsequent comment period.</p>
<p>The CSA, the council of securities regulators of Canada&rsquo;s provinces and territories, coordinates and harmonizes regulation for the Canadian capital markets.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The first time I flew was in my teenage years, and like many of my generation, that was a flight to Europe for a family holiday. I didn&rsquo;t make it further afield until I was in my mid to late twenties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, most, if not all of us, would think of international travel as the norm &ndash; especially given the global nature of our business.</p>
<p>It is amazing, therefore, to think that right around this time in 1970, the first jumbo jet with fare-paying passengers landed at Heathrow.</p>
<p>That flight unlocked global travel to and from the UK on a new scale &ndash; and turned Heathrow into a gateway to the world for the majority.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But with this expansion came a new issue. Airport security &ndash; the gateway into the country itself &ndash; had to be reimagined. It needed to keep pace and process passengers on a larger scale and at speed without sacrificing safety.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the FCA, we are in the same business, in a way. We protect consumers and ensure the integrity of the UK&rsquo;s financial market.</p>
<p>And our gateway is the airport security and passport control of financial services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>High standards are non-negotiable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Market participants demand them, just like we do as passengers, and they will stay away if it is not there.&nbsp;But our gateway must not be a barrier to growth.</p>
<p>We know that a thriving, competitive financial services market is the bedrock of a growing economy. Especially ours here in the UK.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, I wanted to start by emphasising that we are open for business, and welcome new applications - including those from overseas.</p>
<p>We are here to support firms &ndash; and those who advise them &ndash; as they embark on their journey to authorisation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Much like airport security, the FCA gateway is evolving to meet today&rsquo;s challenges: innovative business models, international competitiveness and new technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are working hard to handle the scale and complexity of the authorisations journey while maintaining high standards &ndash; without adding time and frustration.</p>
<p>And, while I know that some in the room may have experienced lengthy assessments in the past, we are moving more quickly.</p>

<div class="container">
<h2>Misconceptions</h2>
<p>So, I&rsquo;d like to cover some common misconceptions.</p>
<p>Although we&rsquo;ve all seen &ndash; or heard about &ndash; lengthy queues and wait times, it may surprise many in this room that the average time to clear security at Heathrow was&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.cntraveller.com/article/uk-airport-security-wait-times" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)">ten minutes<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;last year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Quite impressive, since&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://mediacentre.heathrow.com/pressrelease/detail/24570" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)">84 million passengers<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>&nbsp;passed through!</p>
<p>The same mismatch between real time stats and perceived reality is true with our wait times.&nbsp;Many applicants believe it will be ages before we even consider looking at their application.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a myth I love to bust.</p>
<p>Over 99% of authorisation applications were&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/data/authorisations-operating-service-metrics-2025-26-q2.pdf" title="authorisations-operating-service-metrics-2025-26-q2.pdf">determined within statutory deadlines</a>&nbsp;in the second quarter of 2025/26. And half of all new firm authorisation applications were determined in less than four months.&nbsp;<br />Since making a substantial ongoing investment in digitising Authorisations, we&rsquo;ve seen good progress &ndash; and saved time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, digitised Forms have streamlined Senior Manager Regime application assessments. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Our most&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/data/fca-authorisations-operating-service-metrics" title="FCA Authorisations operating service metrics">recent quarterly metrics</a>&nbsp;show our median determination time for these applications was 28 calendar days, down from 39 days a year prior.&nbsp;I&rsquo;m sure such a drop in wait times would be envied in many regulatory and statutory bodies!</p>
<p>But we are not stopping there. We want to move even faster, and are accelerating our timelines to meet new statutory and voluntary targets.</p>
<p>These will shave months off the authorisation journey, and we&rsquo;ll report against them from February.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, some applicants think we stop the clock whenever we have a question &ndash; or just feel like it &ndash; to make our numbers look better.</p>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s bust another myth &ndash; it&rsquo;s not true.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can only stop the clock for two application types - senior manager or approved persons and Change in Control.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our published lower, median and upper quartile determination times show the total elapsed calendar days for each application, ignoring stop-clock periods.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These give applicants a more accurate picture of end-to-end assessment times.</p>
<p>We engage with applicants early and throughout the process by:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>keeping communication open</li>
<li>answering questions, and</li>
<li>providing regular feedback</li>
</ul>
<p>But we know this isn&rsquo;t enough.</p>
<p>Applicants want to know where they are in the process, and we&rsquo;re committed to strengthening our engagement to tell them.</p>
<p>Like Heathrow&rsquo;s plans for new baggage handling and security screening systems, we&rsquo;re streamlining how we work.&nbsp;I can&rsquo;t promise it will all be seamless, but we&rsquo;re testing new ways to improve our approach, including with new technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, we&rsquo;ve tested using generative AI to sift through large volumes of unstructured application text.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to share that our proof of concept shows it accurately extracts key facts from senior management function documents, which helps case officers evaluate applications faster.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re seeking to integrate this technology into Authorisations alongside broader work to speed up application decisions where appropriate. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We want to lead by example in deploying responsible AI, so we&rsquo;re starting as we mean to go on: with high standards, rigorous testing and an openness to new technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is critical we get this right &ndash; so it will take time.</p>
<p>And so as not to create a new myth, I can assure you that our staff will remain at the heart of all decisions.&nbsp;Our aim is to use technology simply to present the evidence for review, faster.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, we&rsquo;re moving more quickly, but we refuse to lower our standards or blindly wave people through.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t want airport security doing it, and you don&rsquo;t want us to, either.</p>
<p>For instance, an energy firm recently sought approval for long-term payment plans in relation to upgrades such as heat pumps. The plan would be tied to the customer rather than the property.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even after moving house, the consumer could remain liable for payments &ndash; a crucial detail not made clear in financial promotions. We paused the application until their website was updated. Only then was approval granted.</p>
<p>So, I implore you to remember: even when things seem to be slow, it&rsquo;s all about safety.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A spot check at the airport might annoy you in the moment, but it can be the difference between a turbulent flight and a safe landing.</p>

<h2>We're human too</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s one more myth I&rsquo;d like to bust: that the FCA is a &lsquo;scary&rsquo; regulator that doesn&rsquo;t like to talk to people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t something we&rsquo;re blind to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Passport control and customs officers face the same perception issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Officials can fluster people, lead to things getting lost in translation, and waste valuable time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But believe it or not, the truth is that we&rsquo;re human, too.</p>
<p>Behind every authorisation decision is a real person &ndash; many of whom have worked in the industry themselves!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me included.</p>
<p>Our job is to assess applications fairly, and to support and work with you to get to the right decision. We want you to take off safely, successfully and on time. So don&rsquo;t be afraid to talk to us! It&rsquo;s what helps us ensure that we fully understand the facts of an application.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many colleagues here today who are eager to speak with you, and I encourage you to do so.</p>
<p>Conversations are a key part of our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/authorisation/pre-application-support-service" title="Pre-application support service (PASS)">pre-application support service</a>&nbsp;(PASS), which we launched in 2023 and extended to all wholesale, payments and crypto applications in April 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recently expanded it even further, including applications for targeted support.</p>
<p>In these free meetings, you can ask an FCA expert &ndash; often the one assessing your application &ndash; any question you have. I promise you, no question is too big or small, so be as open as you wish.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because of PASS, we now receive higher quality applications &ndash; resulting in faster, easier assessments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During these sessions, we have discussed everything from the application process itself to strategic launch options.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We even helped firms identify and proactively resolve legal and technical policy issues that could have otherwise impacted their applications and slowed the assessment down.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re committed to engaging with applicants early &ndash; but don&rsquo;t think you have to be at the point of applying to talk to us.&nbsp;We can adjust our level of detail as needed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, one individual came to us for clarity on the authorisation process for their proposed small business. They weren&rsquo;t ready for authorisation, but they were grateful for the realistic view of what&rsquo;s involved.</p>
<p>These conversations are just one part of our efforts to create a new relationship between regulator and regulated &ndash; one of genuine collaboration.</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-how-to-engage" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>How to engage</h2>
<p>In our January 2025&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/correspondence/fca-letter-new-approach-support-growth.pdf" title="fca-letter-new-approach-support-growth.pdf">letter to the Prime Minister</a>, we set out a number of pro‑growth measures, including several related to authorisations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, our &lsquo;Minded to Approve&rsquo; initiative.</p>
<p>We now give more firms &lsquo;in principle&rsquo; decisions earlier so they can take key next steps &ndash; like finalising capital raising or hiring key staff.&nbsp;In 2025, we gave &lsquo;minded to approve&rsquo; communications in over 250 cases. The vast majority of applications were approved shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>Second, every firm in our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/innovation/regulatory-sandbox" title="Regulatory Sandbox">Regulatory Sandbox</a>&nbsp;now has a dedicated authorisation officer to guide them through testing and authorisation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve increased dedicated supervisors in Early and High Growth Oversight by 50% to help new and expanding firms navigate the regulatory landscape.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fourth, we&rsquo;re building a global network to give major international investors and firms easier access to the FCA.</p>
<p>Last year, we established a presence in the US and Asia-Pacific, which is already delivering a positive impact. This year, we&rsquo;ll expand into Singapore and beyond.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll hear more about these initiatives from Laura and Dominic, and others here today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I wanted to stress that each one of these initiatives is in place and working together to support new firms to start up, scale up and grow.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re not stopping there.</p>
<p>In October, we announced the launch of our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/authorisation/scale-up-unit" title="Scale-up Unit: supporting fast-growing, innovative firms ">Scale-up Unit</a>&nbsp;with the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) to support dual-regulated firms during rapid growth. We&rsquo;ll share details for solo regulated firms shortly.</p>
<p>As a key stakeholder in&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-for-investment-financial-services" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)">The Office for Investment: Financial Services<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>, we&rsquo;re providing tailored support to international firms looking to set up and grow their financial services operations here in the UK.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And finally, we&rsquo;re working with HMT to develop a provisional licence regime.</p>
<p>It will give firms time-limited permissions to operate in a controlled environment and under strong regulatory oversight as they work to meet the full Threshold Conditions within 18 months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, you choose to do so, we encourage you to engage and collaborate with us sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re here to help you:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>get a big picture view,</li>
<li>spot any issues you might have missed, and</li>
<li>help fix them before they turn into problems or delays</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s like identifying that rogue item in your hand luggage that just won&rsquo;t pass security. A simple adjustment, in a timely way, can make for a smoother security screening and better travel experience.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-conclusion" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>To conclude, the gateway to growth should be an open door, but also a safeguard &ndash; and that&rsquo;s exactly what we&rsquo;re building.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re here to support you and your clients and make your journey easier.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And we want to hear your thoughts on what we do well and not so well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our aim is to be a regulator that champions sustainable growth for the UK&rsquo;s consumers and economy &ndash; and we&rsquo;re always listening, learning and adapting. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Now is the time to apply for authorisation &ndash; or at least to start planning and talking to us about how best to pack your bags, manage weight limits and arrange your security tray.</p>
<p>I encourage everyone to take advantage of all our services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re here to help, so don&rsquo;t be afraid to engage with us &ndash; both today and beyond.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And have a safe flight.</p>

<title>ECB And ESRB Issue Joint Report Analysing Financial Stability Risks From Geoeconomic Fragmentation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li>Geoeconomic fragmentation and geopolitical risk have become key sources of macro-financial uncertainty, which can affect financial stability</li>
<li>Geopolitical shocks can amplify financial stress and dampen economic growth</li>
<li>Report sets out new monitoring framework integrating geopolitical indicators into financial stability analysis</li>
</ul>
<p>The European Central Bank (ECB) and the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) today published a joint report entitled &ldquo;<a class="link-inline arrow" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/ecb.report202601_financialstabilityrisks.en.pdf?640b4328004d04797e1fd7ebf0e39aa0">Financial stability risks from geoeconomic fragmentation</a>&rdquo; with&nbsp;<a class="link-inline arrow" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/ecb.report202601_financialstabilityrisks_annex.en.pdf?28e1c9105ba3169894aaca32658aceb7">technical annex</a>, which examines how rising geopolitical risks and heightened uncertainty can affect financial stability in the euro area and across the European Union. The report identifies the key transmission channels through which geopolitical shocks can propagate to the financial system.</p>
<p>The following findings indicate that geopolitical shocks and policy uncertainty tend to lead to tighter financial conditions, financial market stress, increased risk premia and reduced loan growth.</p>
<ul>
<li>Geopolitical risks and policy uncertainty have risen markedly since the mid‑2010s, with notable increases in 2024 and 2025. At the same time, financial market volatility has remained contained or short-lived.</li>
<li>Estimates suggest that geopolitical risks lower expected growth outcomes, with significant downside tail risks for the real economy, accompanied by heightened financial stress. Geopolitical events can significantly alter the interconnectedness between bonds, commodities, equities and exchange rates.</li>
<li><a class="link-inline" id="_Hlk219704616"></a>The impact of geopolitical shocks is heterogeneous across EU Member States, whereby more open economies and those with higher public debt ratios tend to be more vulnerable to amplification effects.</li>
<li>In response to geopolitical shocks, banks and non-banks adjust their balance sheets by reducing lending, especially cross-border exposures. While this reduces the financial system&rsquo;s exposure to external shocks, it also limits international diversification.</li>
</ul>
<p>At a time of accelerating geoeconomic fragmentation and persistent geopolitical uncertainty, the ECB and the ESRB stress the importance of enhanced, more harmonised datasets, as well as complementary scenario analyses, for preserving financial stability and increasing economic resilience.<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>The report&rsquo;s insights can help policymakers and financial institutions to better detect and evaluate geopolitical risks for the financial sector and calibrate macroprudential policy responses.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<ul class="ecb-small">
<li>The report was prepared by financial stability experts under a joint workstream of the ECB&rsquo;s Macroprudential Analysis Group and the ESRB&rsquo;s Analysis Working Group.</li>

<title>Statement On PCAOB 2026 Budget, Paul S. Atkins, SEC Chairman, Jan. 22, 2026</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/statement-on-pcaob-2026-budget-paul-s-atkins-sec-chairman-jan-22-2026-2026122/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/statement-on-pcaob-2026-budget-paul-s-atkins-sec-chairman-jan-22-2026-2026122/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Commission voted today to approve the 2026 budget for the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the &ldquo;PCAOB&rdquo; or &ldquo;Board&rdquo;) and the related accounting support fee. The 2026 PCAOB budget totals $362.1 million, reflecting a 9.4 percent ($37.6 million) decrease from the prior year.<a class="ck-anchor" id="_ftnref1"></a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-statement-pcaob-2026-budget-012226?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;I support this budget and recognize its importance as an initial step in refocusing the PCAOB on its core mission.</p>
<p>Both during my time as a Commissioner and now as Chairman, I have recognized&ndash;and continue to recognize&ndash;the importance of driving improvements in audit quality. Nevertheless, all regulators, including the Commission and the PCAOB, must continually assess how and whether current approaches to fulfilling the Board&rsquo;s responsibilities provide benefits to investors without imposing excessive burdens on businesses. For the Commission, its diligent oversight of the PCAOB is a crucial check on the considerable authority that the Board holds over audit firms and the risks of potentially excessive burdens.</p>
<p>A significant aspect of this oversight is the Board&rsquo;s budget. The PCAOB must exhibit a strong commitment to responsible stewardship of the accounting support fee, which is its primary source of funding and functions as a tax on public companies and broker-dealers. This includes being mindful of and transparent about material investments so that the Commission can appropriately exercise our budget oversight responsibilities. The decrease in this year&rsquo;s budget does not detract from the significance of the PCAOB&rsquo;s mission, which remains crucial; rather, it underscores that fiscal discipline and regulatory effectiveness complement each other.</p>
<p>In 2007, during my final vote on a PCAOB budget before leaving the Commission, I highlighted two main concerns, which I will briefly revisit now.</p>
<p>The first concern was the high salaries of the PCAOB Board members, prompting me to reject the budget that year. I highlighted then that &ldquo;[t]he SEC can and must provide objective oversight with respect to the Board&rsquo;s salaries. If we do not oversee those, nobody else can.&rdquo;<a class="ck-anchor" id="_ftnref2"></a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-statement-pcaob-2026-budget-012226?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2">[2]</a>This budget, I believe, addresses this first concern, reducing the chairman&rsquo;s and other Board members&rsquo; compensation by 52 percent and 42 percent, respectively. This action demonstrates a clear commitment to aligning PCAOB Board pay more closely with the ethos of public service that reinforces trust, demonstrates fiscal responsibility, and affirms the honor of stewardship over the capital markets.</p>
<p>My second concern stemmed from the PCAOB&rsquo;s lack of a long-term strategic plan, which I firmly advocated for, and that the Commission required the PCAOB to develop starting in 2007.<a class="ck-anchor" id="_ftnref3"></a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-statement-pcaob-2026-budget-012226?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3">[3]</a>I believed then and still believe today that a robust strategic plan is necessary to ensure that the PCAOB&rsquo;s growth and budget aligns with its statutory role. Effective budgeting requires a strategic plan that considers the broader context, sets clear objectives, identifies gaps between goals and the current status, and provides an action plan with clear, transparent, and measurable benchmarks.</p>
<p>The development of an updated strategic plan is a key priority for 2026. I look forward to working with the PCAOB Board and the Commission&rsquo;s Chief Accountant to create a comprehensive strategic plan that will get the PCAOB back to basics: focusing on integrity and objectivity of the profession, reducing unnecessarily complex regulations, and re-centering this important institution on its core statutory responsibilities.</p>
<p>The Commission remains committed to robust oversight of the PCAOB and to ensuring that its operations are transparent, justified, and worthy of the trust placed in it by investors and the public.</p>
<p>I would like to thank PCAOB Acting Chairman George Botic, as well as PCAOB Board Members Kara Stein, Anthony Thompson, and Christina Ho, for their hard work in preparing this budget given the time constraints and delays caused by the government shutdown and for their responsiveness to the Commission&rsquo;s feedback.</p>
<p>I would also like to thank my colleagues at the SEC for their dedicated efforts on this matter, including:</p>
<p>Kurt Hohl, Duc Dang, Anita Doutt, Shaz Niazi, Fariba Nasary, Taylor Pross, Greg Hillson, and Mark Jacoby from the Office of the Chief Accountant;</p>
<p>Caryn Kauffman, Crystal Willis, and Adam Salazar from the Office of Financial Management;</p>
<p>Bryant Morris, Dorothy McCuaig, and Eduardo Aleman from the Office of the General Counsel; and</p>
<p>Greg Schulze and Bobby Sharma from the Office of Information Technology.</p>

<p><span><span>&ldquo;Despite advising on relatively much lesser number of deals, Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz managed to lead the chart by value due to its involvement in big-ticket deals.

<p><span>SIX welcomes Inyova SICAV as a new issuer of Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs).

<p>The Inyova Impact Investing Active Equity Fund EUR UCITS ETF follows an actively managed strategy that invests globally in companies whose products and services contribute positively to sustainable development and generate measurable environmental and social impact alongside financial returns. While the fund is built on businesses advancing themes such as renewable energy, electromobility, medical technology, gender equality, and human rights, it goes beyond thematic exposure by focusing on active ownership and measurable impact. This leads to long-term value creation potential with clear impact objectives.</p>
<p>With this launch, SIX further broadens its offering of actively managed and impact-oriented ETFs for Swiss and international investors. Inyova SICAV is the first new ETF issuer to join SIX Swiss Exchange in 2026, following a record-breaking 2025 with over 300 new products listed and seven new issuers onboarded. SIX Swiss Exchange now hosts 36 ETF issuers offering more than 2,100 ETFs, underscoring its position as one of Europe&rsquo;s most dynamic and diverse ETF marketplaces.&nbsp;Ultumus, a SIX company, provides critical infrastructure services supporting the Inyova ETF's operational workflow for this launch.</p>
<p>Dr. Tillmann Lang, chairman and co-founder of Inyova, elaborates: &ldquo;With this ETF, we enable investors to pursue their financial goals while achieving sustainability impact and staying fully aligned with their values. By listing our ETF at SIX, we are making our active impact approach more accessible, giving private and professional investors a diversified, research-driven portfolio of companies that drive positive environmental and social outcomes with the potential for long-term value creation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Danielle Reischuk, Senior ETFs &amp; ETPs Sales Manager, SIX Swiss Exchange, adds: &ldquo;We are delighted to welcome Inyova SICAV as a new ETF issuer at SIX Swiss Exchange. Their impact-driven, actively managed approach enriches the spectrum of sustainability-oriented investment solutions available on our marketplace. This listing underscores our commitment to offering a robust, efficient venue for innovative issuers and providing investors with access to differentiated strategies.&rdquo;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Bursa Malaysia Berhad (&ldquo;Bursa Malaysia&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Exchange&rdquo;) today announced that the independently assessed Corporate Governance (CG) Ratings for Public Listed Companies (PLCs) on the MAIN Market and ACE Market are now published on the MyBURSA platform. This enhancement enables investors and market participants to access each PLC&rsquo;s CG Rating, further advancing market transparency and strengthening the appeal of Malaysian companies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ratings are derived from assessments conducted by the Minority Shareholders Watch Group (MSWG), in its capacity as the Domestic Ranking Body, using the ASEAN Corporate Governance Scorecard (ACGS) methodology which is aligned with the G20/OECD Principles of Corporate Governance, and endorsed by the ASEAN Capital Markets Forum (ACMF). This will enable investors to compare governance standards across markets in line with international standards and best practices.</p>
<p>Julian M Hashim, Chief Regulatory Officer of Bursa Malaysia said: &ldquo;With the CG Ratings now accessible on MyBURSA, investors can evaluate the governance standards of PLCs alongside other key data points, enabling more holistic risk assessments and long‑term value analysis. For PLCs, the visibility of CG Ratings serves as a benchmark for continuous improvement and enhances their competitiveness in attracting domestic and global capital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By integrating the CG Ratings into MyBURSA, complementing the ESG Ratings already available on the platform, Bursa Malaysia aims to elevate governance standards, encourage continuous improvement among PLCs, and enhance the attractiveness of Malaysia&rsquo;s capital market to investors through the provision of comprehensive, decision‑useful and comparable information,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>MSWG&rsquo;s assessment is based on publicly disclosed information, including Annual Reports, Corporate Governance Reports, Sustainability Reports, and other relevant information available in the public domain.</p>
<p align="left">More information on the ACGS methodology and scorecard is available on MSWG&rsquo;s website: <a href="https://mswg.org.my/analytics/">https://mswg.org.my/analytics/</a><a href="https://mswg.org.my/analytics/">.</a></p>

</ul>
</div>

<div class="row-with-picture">
<div class="detailText">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group and Allfunds have jointly entered into a binding agreement on the terms of a recommended acquisition by Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group (the &ldquo;Acquisition&rdquo;).&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Under the terms of the Acquisition, each Allfunds shareholder will be entitled to receive &euro;8.80 per Allfunds share to be delivered as follows: &nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<ul class="rte--list">
<li>&euro;6.00 per Allfunds share in cash; &nbsp;</li>
<li>0.0122 new Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group shares per Allfunds share, representing &euro;2.60 per Allfunds share based on the volume-weighted average price of &euro;213.40 per Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group share for the ten-day period ended on 26 November 2025; and &nbsp;</li>
<li>a permitted cash dividend of up to &euro;0.20 per Allfunds share (excluding those in treasury) for the financial year 2025.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition, Allfunds shareholders will also be entitled to receive certain further permitted dividends in respect of subsequent financial periods.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The consideration payable under the Acquisition values Allfunds at approximately &euro;5.3 billion and represents a premium of 32.5 percent to the closing price of &euro;6.64 per Allfunds share as at the close of business on 26 November 2025 and a premium of 40.3 percent to the volume-weighted average price for the three-month period ended 26 November 2025 of &euro;6.27 per Allfunds share.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Acquisition is to be effected by means of a Court-sanctioned scheme of arrangement between Allfunds and Allfunds shareholders under Part 26 of the UK Companies Act 2006, requiring the approval by a majority in number representing not less than 75 percent in value of Allfunds&rsquo; Scheme Shareholders present and voting, either in person or by proxy, at the Court meeting.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Allfunds Directors unanimously support the Acquisition and intend to recommend unanimously that Allfunds shareholders vote in favor of the Acquisition.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group has received irrevocable undertakings in support of the Acquisition in respect of 292,376,083 Allfunds shares in aggregate, representing approximately 48.9 percent of the issued share capital (excluding treasury shares) of Allfunds as at 20 January 2026.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group has received irrevocable undertakings to vote in favor of the Scheme at the Court meeting and the resolutions to be proposed at the Allfunds general meeting from LHC3 Limited and BNP Paribas, who hold &nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<ul class="rte--list">
<li>215,907,812 and 76,441,271 Allfunds shares, respectively, representing approximately, &nbsp;</li>
<li>36.1 percent and 12.8 percent, respectively, of the issued share capital (excluding treasury shares) of Allfunds as at 20 January 2026. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group has also received irrevocable undertakings to vote in favor of the Scheme at the Court Meeting and the resolutions to be proposed at the Allfunds general meeting from each of the Allfunds Directors, who hold 27,000 (or, on or prior to the Effective Date, will hold) Allfunds shares, in aggregate representing approximately 0.005 percent of the issued share capital (excluding treasury shares) of Allfunds as at 20 January 2026.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Acquisition represents a highly compelling opportunity to create a truly global world class player in fund services that will combine the companies&rsquo; complementary global footprints with the distribution strength of Allfunds and the custody and settlement capabilities of Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group&rsquo;s Clearstream Fund Services segment.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Allfunds Group and Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group bring excellent complementarity in their respective product suites, client bases, partners, and the key markets served by each of them and the combination is ideally placed to benefit from a number of robust secular growth trends and excel in an evolving industry. &nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The combination and its strategic rationale also align with the interest of Europe and the Savings- and Investments Union (SIU). It strengthens the demand side of the capital markets by bringing end investors closer to investment fund products in an efficient and seamless way and allowing for wider choice of products. The Acquisition is expected to deliver substantial benefits for the European investment fund industry and establish a harmonized platform with global reach, better positioned to support the allocation of retail savings into productive capital solutions such as investment funds. &nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Following the Acquisition, the combined group will benefit from a broader geographic footprint, enhanced reach and a complementary suite of products and expertise, strengthening its ability to serve clients across the fund value chain and supporting accelerated growth. &nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The two businesses also exhibit significant synergy potential which is expected to be delivered across the fund value chain, including fund distribution, custody, settlement and other value-added services such as data and regulatory reporting, enabling provision of best-in-class services to their clients and further enhancing the capacity for innovation, particularly in the digitalization of the fund value chain. Driven by strong secular industry trends, Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group sees double digit revenue growth potential for the combined business in the mid- to long-term.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Annabel Spring, CEO of Allfunds</strong>&nbsp;said: &ldquo;Over the past 25 years, Allfunds has democratised access to investment funds around the world and shaped the wealth management industry. We have grown to be a leading global distribution and dealing platform connecting distributors with fund partners across 66 countries. The combination of deep expertise and exceptional client service and innovation, from alternatives to blockchain, have made Allfunds what it is today. With Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group, our complementary footprints and capabilities create a world-class player with global reach and local relationships, which will better support distributors and fund partners, and propel the wealth management industry forward. The board of Allfunds is confident that the offer represents a compelling opportunity for Allfunds shareholders to realise value, delivering an attractive premium, in cash and shares, allowing future participation in the benefits of the combination.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Stephan Leithner, CEO of Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group</strong>&nbsp;said: &ldquo;We are very pleased to announce the acquisition of Allfunds, which is to be unanimously recommended by its Directors and is supported by its two largest shareholders. We believe that the combination of Allfunds Group's technical expertise and entrepreneurial drive with Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group's capabilities within Clearstream Fund Services will create a leading business in the sector, which better serves the needs of clients, supporting the continuing development of the funds sector in Europe and around the world. This acquisition represents the next step in the development of Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group as a European champion in providing critical infrastructure to the financial markets. It is a testament to our strategy of 'Leading the transformation&rsquo;.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Having analyzed the potential benefits of the Acquisition based on its deep experience of operating in the funds market, Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group believes that the combined group will be able to achieve annual run rate pre-tax cost synergies of approximately &euro;60 million, representing approximately 15 percent of the combined cost base of Allfunds and Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group&rsquo;s Clearstream Fund Service segment. In addition, Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group expects to realize annual run-rate cash savings on capital expenditure of approximately &euro;30 million. &nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These synergies will primarily be delivered through the implementation of the combined operating model across core services, a streamlined regulatory and IT set-up and simplifications of central functions. &nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group expects to deliver approximately 50 percent of the total annual-run-rate synergies, including both cost and capital expenditure savings, by year-end 2028. &nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Reflecting the compelling financial rationale of the transaction, the Acquisition is anticipated to deliver on an annual run-rate basis high single-digit accretion to Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group&rsquo;s Cash EPS within the first full year following completion of the Acquisition, consistent with Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group's disciplined approach to capital deployment and its key financial criteria for value-accretive M&amp;A. Following completion, Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group expects to maintain its AA- long-term rating at the Group level. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group has fully committed funding in place to finance the cash portion of the consideration under the Acquisition.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group plans to start the share buy-back program announced on December 9, 2025 in February 2026 shortly after the publication of the Preliminary Results Q4 and FY 2025. In the period up to end of July 2026, shares of the company at a total cost of up to &euro;500 million will be repurchased. &nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Subject to the receipt of applicable regulatory approvals, the completion of the Acquisition is anticipated to occur in the first half of 2027.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"></div>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Econoday, a leading provider of global economic intelligence and data-driven insights, today announced the expansion of its Sovereign Debt product with the addition of Japan to its country coverage.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Japan&rsquo;s inclusion reflects Econoday&rsquo;s continued commitment to delivering comprehensive, high-quality fiscal data across major economies. With the world&rsquo;s third-largest economy and the highest debt-to-GDP ratio among developed nations, Japan plays a critical role in global sovereign debt markets.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;Expanding our Sovereign Debt coverage to Japan is a natural and important step in meeting our clients&rsquo; growing need for global fiscal clarity. Japan issues some of the largest government bonds in the world. Each new issuance can influence bond yields, interest rates, and the yen, making it a key indicator in today's interconnected markets.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span><span>said Alana Kleinberger, Econoday&rsquo;s CEO</span><span>. &ldquo;As sovereign debt dynamics continue to influence markets and policy worldwide, access to reliable and comparable data is essential. Japan&rsquo;s addition enhances the analytical power of our platform.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Econoday&rsquo;s Sovereign Debt Calendar provides live and historical tracking of sovereign debt issuance from 30 countries and 3 supra-national issuers. Developed in collaboration with institutional investors, it enables unified surveillance of debt auctions across multiple jurisdictions.</span></p>

<title>Finansinspektionen Withdraws The Authorisation Of Get Betal</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Finansinspektionen withdraws the authorisation of the payment institution Get betal AB. The company has, in part, provided inaccurate information to FI in its application for authorisation. The decision applies immediately.</span></p>
<div class="editor-content">
<p>Get betal AB (Get betal or the company) is a payment institution that is authorised to provide the payment service money remittance pursuant to Chapter 1, section 6 of the Payment Services Act (2010:751). The company offers money remittance services to, among other countries, Somalia, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda and Turkey, and has notified Finansinspektionen that it conducts cross-border operations in 15 countries within the EU/EEA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In January 2025, Finansinspektionen opened an investigation into Get betal&rsquo;s operations. As part of the investigation, the authority has reviewed the company&rsquo;s compliance with several central provisions of the Payment Services Act and provisions in other regulations that govern the company&rsquo;s business. The investigation shows that the company has been in violation of several of these provisions. Finansinspektionen also reviewed information the company submitted in conjunction with its application for authorisation to conduct business pursuant to the Payment Services Act. This review shows that the company at that time submitted inaccurate information which had a direct impact on the authority&rsquo;s decision to grant the company authorisation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pursuant to Chapter 8, section 11 of the Payment Services Act, Finansinspektionen shall withdraw a payment institution&rsquo;s authorisation if the institution has received the authorisation by submitting inaccurate information. If sufficient, the authority may instead issue the institution a warning. Finansinspektionen makes the assessment &ndash; in part due to the violations that otherwise were identified during the investigation &ndash; that a warning is not a sufficient measure. Get betal&rsquo;s authorisation shall thus be withdrawn. This decision will go into effect immediately.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The December Chicago Business BarometerTM was  revised by -0.8 point to 42.7 in December from 43.5,  due to the annual seasonal adjustment recalculation.</p>
<p>Growth in the first half of the year was slightly weaker  than previously estimated as the Barometer in Q1 was  revised 0.7 point lower led by weaker New Orders and  Production indicators. In contrast, activity in the second  and third quarters was a touch stronger than previously  estimated. March saw the largest downward revision,  with the Barometer revised lower 1.4 point to 46.2  from its initial estimate, while May recorded the  highest upward revision of 1.7 points to 42.2. The  Barometer remained below 50 for 25 consecutive  months and, excluding November 2023, it has been in  contraction territory since September 2022. On a  quarterly basis, Q2 2025 was revised higher to 42.3  (+0.5 point) and Q3 was revised to 43.3 (+0.2 point),  while Q4 was unrevised at 41.2.</p>
<p>In December, Production saw the largest downward  revision (-2.2 points) followed by New Orders   (-0.4 point). Order Backlogs were revised higher (+1.9  points) and Employment was also revised up (+1.5  points). Supplier Deliveries were unchanged in  December and was the only Barometer component in  expansionary territory, where it has been for 11  consecutive months. All three Buying Policy indicators  were also revised lower in December. Inventories were  revised up (+0.3 point).</p>
<p>Prices Paid expanded at a faster pace than previously  estimated in the second half of the year, with the  indicator revised higher by 2.3 points December.</p>
<p>Overall, data from the Chicago Business Barometer&trade;  survey saw minor revisions. All series in the Chicago  Report&trade; are seasonally adjusted by the US Census X-13  procedure and the seasonal adjustment factors are  recalculated annually every January.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=6wNKVQBiRrcAwox8aKmJAZXknTfU_ArX9UFYJmfufejxiOe1GM-ePBY7Ni7QfnbZKzCJKf9Jmcl6QFhuZ3iEmG8qNYKGNCaGJer0kAVVDUORy2iAlVOqOPU88hlu1YlJ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="CUSIP Global Services">CUSIP Global Services</a>&nbsp;(CGS) today announced the release of its CUSIP Issuance Trends Report for December 2025. The report, which tracks the issuance of new security identifiers as an early indicator of debt and capital markets activity over the next quarter, found sharp monthly decreases in request volume for new corporate and municipal identifiers. On an annualized basis, total identifier request volume surged in 2025 versus 2024 totals.</p>
<p>North American corporate CUSIP requests totaled 6,723 in December, which is down 21.6% on a monthly basis. On an annualized basis, however, North American corporate requests were up 7.1% over December 2024 totals. Requests for new U.S. corporate equity identifiers fell 3.9% and requests for new U.S. corporate debt identifiers declined 37.7% for the month of December.</p>
<p>The aggregate total of identifier requests for new municipal securities &ndash; including municipal bonds, long-term and short-term notes, and commercial paper &ndash; fell 20.2% versus November totals. On a year-over-year basis, overall municipal volumes were up 14.6% through the end of December. Texas led state-level municipal request volume with a total of 105 new CUSIP requests in December, followed by New York (81) and California (60).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monthly CUSIP request volume may have dropped off significantly in December, but when we take a look back at 2025 in total, we see a significant increase in new issuance activity across most major asset classes, including corporate debt and equity and municipal securities,&rdquo; said Gerard Faulkner, Director of Operations for CGS. &ldquo;As we head into the New Year, with uncertainty over interest rates and the broader economy still looming, the first few months of request volume in 2026 will provide valuable insight into how issuers are thinking about the markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Requests for international equity CUSIPs fell 1.3% in December and international debt CUSIP requests fell 15.8%. On an annualized basis, international equity CUSIP requests were up 12.4% and international debt CUSIP requests were up 10.6%.</p>

<p>During an official Ring the Bell ceremony held at the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (LuxSE) yesterday, a delegation of the leadership of Banco de Ahorro y Credito FONDESA, S.A (BANFONDESA) and the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (LuxSE) gathered together to mark the listing of BANFONDESA&rsquo;s DOP 250 million (equivalent to EUR 3.3 million) sustainability bond on LuxSE.</p>
<p>Supported by technical assistance from the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) and financing from the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg through the Global Trust Fund (GTF), this milestone marks the first sustainability bond ever issued by a Dominican issuer, reinforcing the growing momentum behind sustainable investment in emerging markets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>We are honoured to welcome BANFONDESA and its pioneering sustainability bond to the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. This transaction highlights the important role capital markets can play in mobilising private capital to support microfinance, green investment and social inclusion, and reaffirms our commitment to supporting issuers from emerging markets in accessing international investors</i>,&rdquo; said Arnaud Delestienne, Chief Commercial Officer and Member of the Executive Committee at LuxSE.</p>
<h4>A milestone for sustainable development in the Dominican Republic</h4>
<p>Exclusively dedicated to supporting microfinance and sustainable development in the Caribbean nation, the proceeds of the bond will finance micro- and green loans across key sectors including renewable energy, energy efficiency, sustainable transportation and agriculture. The bond will also finance social projects promoting the growth of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p>Initially listed on the Bolsa de Valores de la Rep&uacute;blica Dominicana (BVRD) in November 2024, the bond also expected to benefit vulnerable communities by improving access to essential services such as energy, water, housing, healthcare and education.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>This bond is not the end of a journey &ndash; it is the beginning of a new era that symbolises trust, partnership and the belief that inclusive green finance can transform lives in the Dominican Republic. We will continue to scale green lending, strengthen climate</i><i>‑</i><i>risk tools, and deepen our partnership with the European Investment Bank and Luxembourg &ndash; a country whose leadership in sustainable finance is shaping real change on the ground</i>,&rdquo; said Cristian Reyna, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors at BANFONDESA.</p>
<p>A long-standing partner of BANFONDESA, the European Investment Bank (EIB) has supported the institution since 2008 through targeted financing to expand access to finance for low-income clients, particularly women, in the Dominican Republic. This partnership was further strengthened in 2018 through an EIB senior loan, aimed at financing green projects for BANFONDESA&rsquo;s clients under the ACP Cotonou Investment Facility and the creation of BANFONDESA Renovable. The loan was complemented by significant technical assistance to support women-focused and environmentally sustainable projects, helping pave the way for the issuance of BANFONDESA&rsquo;s first sustainability bond.</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><span>Annual Resolution Report highlights the FSB&rsquo;s ongoing efforts to strengthen the global resolution regimes for banks, insurers and financial market infrastructures.</span></li>
<li><span>The FSB will undertake further work to support members addressing critical challenges, such as funding in resolution and effective bail-in execution, particularly in cross-border contexts.</span></li>
<li><span>The FSB</span><span>&nbsp;is planning to launch a strategic review of its crisis preparedness activities to ensure that they remain well aligned with emerging risks and changes in the financial sector.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) today published its&nbsp;<a class="custom-internal-link processed-internal-link" href="https://www.fsb.org/2026/01/2025-resolution-report-from-plans-to-practice-operationalising-resolution/">2025 Resolution Report</a>, which reviews global progress in implementing resolution reforms and enhancing crisis preparedness across the financial sector. The report also sets out the FSB&rsquo;s priorities for 2026 to advance the operationalisation of resolution frameworks.</p>
<p>Foundational resolution frameworks are now mostly in place, with significant progress in operational planning and resolvability assessments.</p>
<p>In 2025, the FSB focused on supporting resolution authorities&rsquo; operational readiness by publishing a practices paper on transfer tools, which shares insights and draws lessons from past resolution cases. The FSB also supported knowledge sharing on funding in resolution and advanced work on bail-in execution by forming a dedicated task force. Additionally, the FSB published draft guidance to promote consistency in determining which insurers should be subject to recovery and resolution planning requirements.</p>
<p>Dominique Laboureix, Chair of the Single Resolution Board, and Chair of the FSB Resolution Steering Group, said &ldquo;This Resolution Report highlights the progress achieved in 2025 in enhancing crisis readiness across banks, insurers and CCPs. In 2026, we will build on this momentum, focusing on removing remaining challenges to cross-border bail-in execution and funding in resolution, and advancing cross-sector information sharing and collaboration to further strengthen global financial stability.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the FSB plans to conduct a peer review on public sector backstop funding mechanisms and to publish a practices paper on funding in resolution to further support operational planning. The FSB is also planning to launch a strategic review of its crisis preparedness activities. The review will aim to ensure the FSB&rsquo;s crisis preparedness activities reflect emerging vulnerabilities and structural changes in the financial system as well as to strengthen coordination among the FSB and standard-setting bodies with crisis preparedness mandates.</p>
<p>The FSB has also published an&nbsp;<a class="custom-internal-link processed-internal-link" href="https://www.fsb.org/2026/01/good-practices-for-crisis-management-groups-revised-version/">update to the&nbsp;<em>Good Practices for Crisis Management Groups</em></a>, which was first issued in 2021. The supplementary information aims to enhance crisis coordination between home and host authorities outside of crisis management groups.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Background</h2>
<p>The 2025 Resolution Report has been prepared by the FSB Resolution Steering Group, which is the primary global forum for the development of global standards and guidance on resolution regimes and recovery and resolution planning for systemically important financial institutions. ReSG is chaired by Dominique Laboureix, Chair of the Single Resolution Board.</p>
<p>Crisis Management Groups of global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) have been in place for over 10 years as a core part of the post global financial crisis coordination infrastructure. According to the FSB&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em><a class="custom-internal-link" href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/04/key-attributes-of-effective-resolution-regimes-for-financial-institutions-revised-version-2024/">Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions</a></em>&nbsp;Key Attribute 8, home and key host authorities of all G-SIBs should maintain CMGs to enhance preparedness and facilitate the management and resolution of cross-border financial crises.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FSB coordinates at the international level the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies and develops and promotes the implementation of effective regulatory, supervisory, and other financial sector policies in the interest of financial stability. It brings together national authorities responsible for financial stability in 24 countries and jurisdictions, international financial institutions, sector-specific international groupings of regulators and supervisors, and committees of central bank experts. The FSB also conducts outreach with approximately 70 other jurisdictions through its six Regional Consultative Groups.</p>
<p>The FSB is chaired by Andrew Bailey, Governor of the Bank of England. The FSB Secretariat is located in Basel, Switzerland and hosted by the Bank for International Settlements.</p>

<p>Professor Mervyn E. King , a famous advocate for corporate governance, once said that &ldquo;Governance is about leadership. A board should be a thought partner to management, not just a compliance officer&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Why I start with this quote is to make the point that corporate governance starts from the top of the corporate body, the Board.</p>

<title>CFTC Chairman Selig: America’s Financial Markets Are Ready For A Golden Age</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cftc-chairman-selig-americas-financial-markets-are-ready-for-a-golden-age-2026120/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cftc-chairman-selig-americas-financial-markets-are-ready-for-a-golden-age-2026120/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>We are at a pivotal moment in the evolution of American financial markets. Advances in technology are enabling the creation of entirely new products, platforms and business models, in turn transforming the financial services landscape as we know it.</span></p>
<p><span>And thanks to President Donald Trump&rsquo;s leadership, Congress is now on the cusp of enacting the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, which would provide long-overdue regulatory clarity to an American industry that embodies the promise of the future.</span></p>
<p><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has an important role in developing the rules for this new frontier of finance. The CFTC was initially formed to promote orderly operations in markets for the future delivery of agricultural products. But as innovation has enabled capital to reach ever greater efficiencies, policymakers have recognized that the agency with experience regulating everything from pork bellies to credit default swaps is uniquely capable of overseeing novel and emerging markets.</span></p>
<p><span>Today, innovators are leveraging technologies such as blockchain and artificial intelligence not just to modernize legacy financial systems, but also to build new ones. The same spirit that drove American farmers to cultivate the Great Plains inspires today&rsquo;s entrepreneurs to leave traditional finance behind and conquer new, unexplored territories.</span></p>
<p><span>Anyone with a smartphone and an internet connection can access blockchain-native financial markets that are peer-to-peer and open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. Meanwhile, advancements in artificial intelligence are making it possible to uncover methods for hedging risk even the savviest professionals would overlook. These technologies are lowering barriers to entry, expanding risk-management tools and allowing market participants to tailor strategies to their individual needs and preferences. The excitement surrounding the infinite possibilities created by these technologies is palpable, and we are witnessing increased participation in markets the prior administration sought to overlook&mdash;or eliminate altogether.</span></p>
<p><span>Instead of developing guardrails that foster ingenuity, the Biden administration focused on regulation by enforcement&mdash;subjecting novel products such as digital assets and perpetual futures to legacy rules that could not fit the product, but could fit the prosecutor. This aversion to innovation sent many of the most enterprising businesses offshore, and everyday Americans paid the price.</span></p>
<p><span>Under my leadership, the CFTC is charting a new course.</span></p>
<p><span>Despite the prior administration&rsquo;s missteps, America is still home to the greatest innovators, and our markets remain the deepest and most liquid in the world. Legacies like these are built over decades, but they cannot stand on their own. The CFTC and other financial regulators must develop clear and fit-for-purpose regulations that allow entrepreneurs to build new things, while continuing to protect the public from fraud, scams and market manipulation.</span></p>
<p><span>To future-proof the CFTC for tomorrow&rsquo;s innovations, the agency&rsquo;s regulations must adapt to meet our nation&rsquo;s builders where they are. That is why I have launched the &ldquo;Future-Proof&rdquo; initiative. While decades-old rules designed for agricultural futures contracts may still suit those markets today, they do not contemplate nascent products or trading venues. Just as American businesses are modernizing legacy financial systems by harnessing new technologies, the CFTC must upgrade its approach to unleash innovation. As part of this initiative, the CFTC&rsquo;s staff will undertake a comprehensive review of the agency&rsquo;s existing rules and regulations and modernize these requirements to ensure a level playing field for new entrants and incumbents alike.</span></p>
<p><span>As new asset classes emerge and the CFTC&rsquo;s role evolves, guidelines we establish should not just fit the product, but also serve a tailored regulatory purpose. Prediction markets have exploded in popularity as broad swaths of market participants seek to hedge portfolio risks and test their abilities to forecast truth. Similarly, the digital asset economy has grown from a mere experiment in cryptography to a more than $3 trillion market with ever greater types of assets being generated on blockchain networks.</span></p>
<p><span>Should Congress deliver on making America the crypto capital of the world and send digital asset market structure legislation to the president&rsquo;s desk, the CFTC will have a broad set of new responsibilities. Pass us the torch, and we will ensure that these markets flourish at home with tailored regulatory frameworks that keep American markets the best in the world.</span></p>
<p><span>Arbitrary, cumbersome and opaque rules will not stand the test of time. The CFTC&rsquo;s approach should be to deliver the minimum effective dose of regulation&mdash;nothing more and nothing less. This means an end to policymaking through enforcement. And this means the agency&rsquo;s policymaking divisions will develop clear rules of the road for market participants that will be codified through notice-and-comment rulemaking to ensure that the regulatory requirements do not change wildly from administration to administration.</span></p>
<p><span>The president has assembled a remarkable team in the financial regulatory space, of which I am humbled to be a part. To achieve the golden age of American financial markets, as the president might call it, regulators must break with the rigid and restrictive regulatory practices of the past. The CFTC will seize this generational opportunity to modernize and future-proof its approach to regulation and ensure that the great innovations of today and tomorrow are made in America.</span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>He explained that the QFMA continues to implement its strategy derived from the Third Financial Sector Strategy, which is aligned with Qatar National Vision 2030 and the State&rsquo;s Third National Development Strategy.

<p><span><span><span><span>Dr. Tami Al-Binali highlighted the close cooperation between the QFMA and the QSE, noting that this collaboration represents an integrated model that contributes to enhancing market liquidity and stimulating new listings, while ensuring that growth is underpinned by clear regulatory frameworks, effective disclosure, and the highest standards of investor protection.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>He stressed that the participation of both the QFMA and QSE in this year&rsquo;s Davos Forum reflects the State of Qatar&rsquo;s commitment to continuing the development of its financial markets in line with global best practices, and to strengthening its role as a transparent and efficient regional financial center capable of attracting long-term investments.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>For his part, Mr. Abdulla Mohammed Al Ansari, Chief Executive Officer of Qatar Stock Exchange, emphasized that QSE is playing a central role in advancing Qatar&rsquo;s economic diversification and strengthening the competitiveness of its capital market. He noted that the Exchange is undergoing a comprehensive transformation that focuses on enhancing market liquidity, improving investor access, expanding investment products &ndash; including debt instruments and ESG aligned offerings &ndash; and upgrading digital market infrastructure.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Mr. Al-Ansari explained that QSE&rsquo;s participation in Davos reflects its commitment to broadening the investor base, deepening international connectivity, improving market efficiency, enhancing regional and global cooperation, and showcasing the growing investment opportunities available in Qatar&rsquo;s capital market.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>He added: &ldquo;Qatar Stock Exchange continues to advance initiatives that deepen liquidity, expand the product diversity, integrate sustainability and ESG standards. These efforts support the objectives of the Third Financial Sector Strategy and position Qatar&rsquo;s capital market as a transparent, resilient, and investor-friendly environment capable of attracting long-term global capital.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Mr. Al-Ansari reaffirmed that ongoing coordination with the Qatar Financial Markets Authority and relevant stakeholders remains essential to ensuring market growth within clear regulatory frameworks, strengthening investor confidence, and enhancing connectivity with global markets&mdash;thereby reinforcing Qatar&rsquo;s position as an advanced regional financial center aligned with international best practices.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The panel discussion featured an in-depth exchange on the pivotal role of the QFMA as the regulatory body responsible for governance, oversight, regulatory supervision, and investor protection, and of Qatar Stock Exchange as the principal securities trading venue in the State of Qatar.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>During the discussion, Qatar&rsquo;s experience in developing its capital markets was highlighted, including the achievement of key milestones that have contributed to transforming the market into a dynamic platform attractive to local, regional, and international investors, through deepening liquidity, enhancing transparency, and reinforcing the State of Qatar&rsquo;s position as a trusted investment destination focused on sustainable growth.</span></span></span></span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="paragraph">The Luxembourg Stock Exchange (LuxSE) today announced the acquisition of a business line from Tetrao International, specialised in the extraction of large amounts of sustainable bond data points from a wide range of sources.</p>
<p class="paragraph">&ldquo;<i>This acquisition is a strategic move for the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and demonstrates our unwavering commitment to providing structured and meaningful sustainable bond data. Investors need access to reliable data to make informed investment decisions, and given our long-term strategy in this field, we consider it important to have full oversight of the data collection process and strategy. We have successfully worked with Tetrao for a number of years and see great potential in its technology and expertise</i>,&rdquo; commented Julie Becker, CEO of LuxSE.</p>
<p><b>Large scale data collection powering the LGX DataHub</b></p>
<p>Tetrao powers its technology with artificial intelligence to provide data services including data point extraction, data collection and automatic browser agents. Using proprietary machine learning algorithms combined with generative AI large language models and powerful computer vision, Tetrao&rsquo;s technology implements agents that simulate human behaviour to identify, read and understand complex information from websites and documents, while ensuring the highest quality standard thanks to processes that seamlessly blend human expertise, AI predictions and end-to-end auditable data decisions.</p>
<p class="paragraph">LuxSE initially acquired a minority stake in Tetrao in January 2021 and has relied on the start-up&rsquo;s data collection services to accelerate the development of its market-leading sustainable bond data offering since then. As part of the acquisition, Tetrao&rsquo;s highly experienced ESG data analytics team will join the LuxSE Group and continue to extract and collect sustainable bond data points for the Luxembourg Green Exchange (LGX), using the specialised knowledge, technology and proprietary tools developed by Tetrao. Tetrao will remain a key technology provider for the LuxSE Group.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Pierre Schoonbrodt, CFO of LuxSE, served as board member of Tetrao International: &ldquo;<i>We look forward to bringing Tetrao&rsquo;s ESG data analytics unit into the LuxSE Group. The team offers unique expertise in the field of data collection and has a deep understanding of our processes and business needs</i>. <i>Thanks to the advanced technological solution which was developed for our specific area of activity, this acquisition will strengthen our data services and open opportunities to expand into new areas.&rdquo;&nbsp;</i></p>
<p class="paragraph"><b>A natural next step for Tetrao</b></p>
<p class="paragraph">Tetrao was created by Christian Gillot in Luxembourg in 2014 and started its commercialisation in 2017. In 2019, Tetrao launched an R&amp;D project for the investment fund industry that collected daily documentation and relevant metadata on 85,000 instruments of the fund industry.</p>
<p class="paragraph">The start-up then went on to develop specialised services in the field of sustainability data collection.

<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailhost.mondovisione.com:4443/daymergroup.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Daymer Group</a>, a leading independent fiduciary and consulting company providing services to the Asset Management industry, is expanding its footprint and opening an office in the Dubai International Financial Centre, UAE. The Dubai office is regulated by the DFSA and will be led by senior finance professional Mike Davis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Headquartered in the Cayman Islands, Daymer Group&rsquo;s core business is sourcing experienced, highly competent Independent Non-Executive Board Members for the Asset Management industry (funds, structured products, corporate structures and family offices). In addition, Daymer Group provides consulting and fractional CEO/CFO/COO services. The firm&rsquo;s clients manage over USD 12Bn in AUM.</p>
<p>Daymer Group&rsquo;s directors and consultants include former C-suite executives, partners and senior leaders from multiple sectors, providing independent insight and advice, ensuring improved governance standards and credibility for its clients. The Daymer Middle East team includes Martin Homberger, who led Barclays Bank's ME regional Compliance and Financial Crime functions, with previous experience at Deutsche Bank and Clifford Chance, Mark Emmerson with over 40 years of banking and trade finance experience, and Simon Calder who recently served for six years as the Deputy CEO and Chief Operating Oﬃcer for HSBC in the UAE.

<p><b>Daymer Group Founder&nbsp;</b>Richard Scott-Hopkins said: &ldquo;With existing offices in London and Cayman, Dubai was the logical third location for Daymer Group. New and established Asset Managers are moving to the UAE to take advantage of the attractive tax regimes, developed regulatory network and to be closer to their current and potential investors. Several of our existing clients are moving people or opening offices in the UAE and they have asked Daymer to support them.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Director Mike Davis</b>&nbsp;commented: &ldquo;As the Middle Eastern asset management industry continues to evolve, managers and their investors are putting a higher value on truly independent advice and support. Daymer team members are not only highly qualified themselves, but they can also call on the experience and know-how of the wider, global Daymer Director Network.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="bw-subheadline-wrapper">
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li><span><i>Record 2.4BN Derivative Contracts Traded in 2025 with Record ADV of 9.3M, +13% and +14% vs Previous Records Set in 2024</i></span></li>
<li><span><i>Record NYSE Equities ADV +40% at 3.35BN shares and Record NYSE Options ADV of 10.5M</i></span></li>
<li><span><i>Open Interest Across ICE Ends 2025 +17% vs 2024 With Highest OI in ICE&rsquo;s History set on December 11, 2025, of 113.4M</i></span></li>
<li><span><i>Single Day trading records at NYSE Equities and NYSE Options set in 2025 of 7BN and 18M, respectively</i></span></li>
<li><span><i>ICE&rsquo;s NYSE systems process single day records of 1 trillion+ messages twice in 2025 showing strength of ICE&rsquo;s world-leading technology and infrastructure</i></span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE: ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today announced record milestones reached in 2025 across its world leading derivative and NYSE equity and NYSE options markets.</p>
<p>A record 2.4BN futures and options were traded across ICE&rsquo;s global derivatives markets in 2025, surpassing the previous record trading volumes set in 2024 by 13%. ICE also saw record average daily volumes (ADV) across its markets in 2025 of 9.3M, +14% versus 2024.</p>
<p>Open interest (OI) across ICE&rsquo;s markets ended 2025 at 102.7M, +17% versus the end of 2024. ICE&rsquo;s markets reached their highest open interest in ICE&rsquo;s history on December 11, 2025, at 113.4M, with ICE&rsquo;s benchmark Brent futures market hitting record open interest on December 22, 2025, at 3.2M and ending the year with OI across Brent futures and options +22% at 6M and with record volume of 383.6M.</p>
<p>In 2025, ICE experienced record volumes across its benchmark commodity, energy and interest rate markets, with a record 1.4BN, 1.3BN and 891M contracts traded respectively, with record commodities ADV +13% at 5.4M, record energy ADV +15% at 5M and record interest rates ADV +19% at 3.5M vs 2024. ICE&rsquo;s markets are the largest and most liquid in the world to trade commodities, energy and European interest rate derivatives, routinely offering the most capital efficient venues to trade these products due to the margin offsets available when customers have a well-diversified portfolio. Offsets can be as high as 99% for a well-balanced trading portfolio across energy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in 2025, ICE&rsquo;s New York Stock Exchange equity and options markets experienced their single highest trading days in NYSE history with 7BN shares and 18M NYSE Options traded respectively on a single day, as well as setting new record ADV across NYSE Equities of 3.35BN, +40% vs 2024 and record ADV across NYSE Options of 10.5M, +12.6%.</p>
<p>"ICE&rsquo;s derivatives markets and its equity markets at NYSE set multiple milestones in 2025 reflecting the strength, resilience and capacity of ICE&rsquo;s technology and infrastructure,&rdquo; said Ben Jackson, President of ICE. "For over 25 years, ICE has continually invested in building its technology and markets for the benefit of its customers, methodically building a network of markets to provide the breadth of tools, the supporting data and the infrastructure our customers need to manage their risk as precisely and extensively as they wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2025 Benchmark volume highlights set on ICE included:</p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li>Brent, WTI, Gasoil, Total Oil, TTF, Total Natural Gas, Environmentals, Euribor and SONIA all traded at record levels across futures and options, with Brent ADV +11% in 2025 at 1.5M, ICE WTI ADV +10% and ICE Gasoil ADV +8%.</li>
<li>Total Natural Gas ADV +18% at 1.9M in 2025, with TTF ADV +22% and North American Natural Gas ADV +15% vs 2024.</li>
<li>ICE&rsquo;s U.S. Financial Gas markets traded at record levels in 2025 surpassing the previous record year set in 2024 by 17% with 61.5M traded, and reaching the highest open interest in ICE&rsquo;s history on October 31, 2025, of 12.7M.</li>
<li>ICE&rsquo;s U.S. Power markets traded at their highest levels in ICE&rsquo;s history during 2025 with a record 7.8BN MWh traded, with volumes + over 30% vs 2024.</li>
<li>ICE&rsquo;s NGL markets traded at record volumes through 2025, +39% vs 2024 with 12.5BN barrels traded, with open interest ending 2025 +29%.</li>
<li>Record Interest Rates ADV in 2025 at 3.5M, +19% vs 2024, with record Euribor ADV of 2M +8% and record SONIA ADV of 921K, +28% vs 2024, with Euribor OI ending 2025 +40% vs 2024.</li>
</ul>
<p>2025 highlights across ICE&rsquo;s equity markets at the New York Stock Exchange -- the world&rsquo;s largest equities exchange and the gold standard for trading technology -- included:</p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li>4 of the top 5 highest volume days in NYSE Equities trading history occurred in 2025, setting new single day trading record of 7BN shares.</li>
<li>25 highest NYSE message traffic days occurred in 2025 - on two occasions ICE&rsquo;s NYSE systems processed over 1 trillion messages in a single day.</li>
<li>19 of the top 20 highest volume days in NYSE Options trading history occurred in 2025, setting new single day record of over 18M.</li>
<li>3 largest closing auctions in NYSE history occurred in 2025, setting new single day auction record of over $205BN in value traded.</li>
</ul>
<p>The NYSE Closing Auction remains the single largest daily liquidity event in U.S. cash equities trading, combining the NYSE's state-of-the-art Pillar trading technology with direct market maker facilitation to produce key anchor prices for listed companies which are used for a variety of applications including valuation benchmarks, index calculations, and regulatory reporting.</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority: Regulators Give Clarity In Relation To Open Banking Pricing Models</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-financial-conduct-authority-regulators-give-clarity-in-relation-to-open-bank-2026120/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-financial-conduct-authority-regulators-give-clarity-in-relation-to-open-bank-2026120/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The FCA has issued a joint statement with the Payment Systems Regulator (PSR) giving clarity on open banking pricing models.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We and the PSR have issued the following&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/corporate/fca-psr-prioritisation-commerical-variable-recurring-payments-ukpi.pdf" title="Joint prioritisation statement: commercial variable recurring payments &ndash; UKPI scheme">statement (PDF)</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This confirms we will not, at this stage, prioritise a Competition Act 1998 (CA98) investigation into the centralised &lsquo;access fee&rsquo; pricing model being developed by the UK Payments Initiative (UKPI) for commercial Variable Recurring Payments (cVRPs). &nbsp;</p>
<p>cVRPs are an emerging open banking technology that allow consumers to give trusted third parties secure, recurring access to manage payments on their behalf. They have the potential to offer consumers and businesses control and convenience, while enabling lower-cost, more flexible payment options for businesses.</p>
<p>After engaging with the funders of the UKPI, we and the PSR worked at pace to clarify our enforcement position on the UKPI&rsquo;s proposal for a commercial model and consulted with the CMA about our planned non-prioritisation statement given concurrency arrangements. The statement will give UKPI certainty to continue developing its cVRP product &ndash; including for certain regulated financial services, utilities and public sector payments &ndash; without delay. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This supports our strategy to make cVRPs a reality, giving people more control over their payments and lower processing fees for businesses. &nbsp;</p>
<p>On 15 January 2026, we and the PSR&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/correspondence/fca-psr-letter-cma-open-banking-commercial-variable-recurring-payments.pdf" title="Joint FCA and PSR letter to CMA on open banking commercial variable recurring payments">wrote to the CMA (PDF)</a>&nbsp;to set out our position. &nbsp;</p>
<p>On 16 January 2026, the CMA&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/review-of-banking-for-small-and-medium-sized-businesses-smes-in-the-uk#commercial-variable-recurring-payments---letter-to-the-fca-and-psr" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Letter to the FCA and PSR | Competition Markets Authority (opens in a new window)">confirmed to us and the PSR<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;that, based on the information available to it, it does not intend to take a different position on CA98 prioritisation to that of us and the PSR. &nbsp;The CMA is keen to ensure that businesses are not deterred from collaborating in ways that may be beneficial to consumers or the wider economy because of uncertainty about how competition law applies. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Bridge to a long-term framework</h2>
<p>This is a temporary measure ahead of the government&rsquo;s anticipated legislative framework, expected by the end of 2026. It applies until that framework is in place or until July 2027, whichever comes first.</p>
<p>During this period, we and the PSR will continue to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monitor market developments</li>
<li>Review any changes to the pricing methodology.</li>
<li>Expect UKPI to submit its finalised governance documents. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>All 3 competition authorities &ndash; the FCA, PSR and CMA &ndash; may revise their prioritisation approach if new information emerges or if the expected legislative framework is not implemented by July 2027.</p>

<div class="RichText   ">
<p>LSEG Risk Intelligence has unveiled its new Sanctioned Securities Data File (SSDF), a granular, instrument-level dataset engineered to help financial institutions identify and manage securities with direct or indirect links to sanctioned entities.</p>
<p>Developed in partnership with BIGTXN, a recognised leader in advanced data analytics, the SSDF links global sanctions designations and ownership and control relationships directly to financial securities, providing a structured view of how sanctions translate into real exposure at the instrument level.</p>
<p>Early analysis from the dataset shows that approximately one-third of all sanctions-linked instruments are captured through ownership and control pathways, rather than explicit legal designations. For example, a company may not be sanctioned itself, but if a sanctioned parent owns or controls it, the securities it issues still fall within scope.</p>
<p>Further analysis indicates that sanctions exposure is not confined to historic or inactive positions. Around six in ten sanctions-linked instruments identified through the SSDF remain active, underscoring that sanctions risk represents an ongoing operational challenge for trading, investment and post-trade teams.</p>
<p>At the instrument level, sanctions impact is concentrated in the mechanisms of capital formation and corporate restructuring. Rights and entitlements, debt instruments and structured products collectively account for approximately 80% of sanctions-linked issuance, demonstrating that exposure is embedded within market infrastructure rather than isolated to traditional equity listings.</p>
<p>From a jurisdictional perspective, Russia-imposed measures continue to dominate the sanctions-instrument landscape, accounting for approximately 60% of affected issuance. Sanctions regimes administered by the European Union, United States, New Zealand and Ukraine also contribute materially to the volume of impacted instruments, highlighting the growing importance of managing sanctions exposure across multiple jurisdictions simultaneously.</p>

<div class="RichText   ">
<p>As global sanctions regimes expand, diverge and update at increasing frequency, firms face mounting complexity in determining whether the securities they trade, hold or service fall within regulatory scope. The Sanctioned Securities Data File systematically links sanctions designations from LSEG&rsquo;s World-Check platform to real, tradable instruments enabling compliance teams to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Detect exposure beyond simple name‑based lists</li>
<li>Screen across multi‑asset‑class portfolios</li>
<li>Embed structured sanctions intelligence into front‑to‑back workflows</li>
<li>React faster to evolving geopolitical and regulatory developments</li>
</ul>
<p>Chris Moyser, Head of Strategy at LSEG Risk Intelligence, comments:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sanctions regimes today extend far beyond simple lists of designated names. Financial institutions need a systematic way to understand how those designations translate into real exposure across securities, ownership structures and corporate actions. The Sanctioned Securities Data File is designed to bring that clarity - helping firms identify risk that is often difficult to detect using traditional screening approaches.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="VerticalSpacing VerticalSpacing--m">
<div class="RichText   ">
<p>What is the Sanctioned Securities Data File (SSDF)?<br />The Sanctioned Securities Data File (SSDF) is an instrument-level dataset from LSEG Risk Intelligence that links global sanctions designations and ownership and control relationships directly to financial securities. It is designed to help financial institutions identify and manage sanctions exposure across global markets.</p>
<p>Why does ownership and control matter for sanctions exposure?<br />Sanctions regimes increasingly apply through ownership structures and control relationships, not just through direct designation of issuers. This means a security may be linked to sanctions even if the issuing company is not explicitly sanctioned, provided it is owned or controlled by a sanctioned entity.</p>
<p>What does &ldquo;ownership and control relationships&rdquo; mean in practice?<br />Ownership and control relationships refer to situations where a sanctioned entity owns, controls or exerts influence over another company. In these cases, the securities issued by the non-sanctioned company may still fall within sanctions scope due to that relationship.</p>
<p>What proportion of sanctions-linked securities are connected through ownership and control?<br />Early analysis from the Sanctioned Securities Data File shows that approximately one-third of sanctions-linked securities are connected through ownership and control pathways, rather than direct legal designation alone.</p>
<p>Are sanctions-linked securities still actively traded?<br />Yes. Analysis indicates that around 60% of sanctions-linked instruments identified through the SSDF remain active, highlighting that sanctions exposure is an ongoing operational consideration rather than a purely historical issue.</p>
<p>Which types of financial instruments are most affected?<br />Sanctions-linked exposure is concentrated in rights and entitlements, debt instruments and structured products, which together account for approximately 80% of sanctions-linked issuance identified in the dataset.</p>
<p>Which jurisdictions contribute most to sanctions-linked securities exposure?<br />Russia-imposed measures account for the largest share of sanctions-linked securities identified. Sanctions regimes administered by the European Union, United States, New Zealand and Ukraine also contribute materially to the affected instrument universe.</p>
<p>How does the SSDF differ from traditional sanctions screening?<br />Traditional sanctions screening typically focuses on matching names against sanctions lists. The SSDF goes further by systematically linking sanctions designations and ownership and control relationships to financial instruments, enabling firms to identify indirect exposure that may not be visible through name-based screening alone.</p>
<p>Who is the Sanctioned Securities Data File designed for?<br />The SSDF is designed for financial institutions involved in trading, investment management, custody, clearing, settlement and risk management that need to identify and manage sanctions exposure across securities and portfolios.</p>
<p>How is the Sanctioned Securities Data File delivered?<br />The dataset is delivered via a centralised, structured data feed that can be integrated into existing compliance, risk and trading workflows. It supports screening across a broad range of asset classes and is updated in line with evolving global sanctions designations.</p>
<p>What does this analysis show about the future of sanctions risk?<br />The findings highlight that sanctions risk is increasingly embedded in the structure of financial markets through ownership, control and instrument design. This underscores the need for more granular, instrument-level approaches to sanctions screening and exposure management.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li> New industry champions to turn rapid AI adoption into safe, scalable growth. &nbsp; </li>
<li> Around three-quarters of UK financial firms already use AI, with the technology expected to boost the economy, cut costs for&nbsp;firms&nbsp;and transform services for customers.&nbsp; </li>
<li> Champions will focus on helping firms seize opportunities at pace while protecting consumers and financial stability, reporting directly to the Economic Secretary.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<p>AI is already widely used across financial services, with around three-quarters of UK firms now deploying AI, up sharply from just over half in recent years. Independent analysis suggests AI could add tens of billions of pounds to the financial and professional services sector by 2030, as well as transforming services for consumers, underlining both the pace of adoption and the scale of the opportunity ahead.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>The new Champions, Harriet Rees from Starling Bank and Dr Rohit Dhawan from Lloyds Banking Group, will help turn this momentum into practical delivery through their extensive experience of working in this field. They will report directly to the Economic Secretary Lucy Rigby - helping firms seize the&nbsp;huge potential&nbsp;of AI in financial services, and exploring ways to accelerate safe adoption at scale, identify where innovation can move faster, and tackle barriers holding firms back. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Their focus will be on ensuring firms can seize the opportunities AI presents with confidence &mdash; improving customer outcomes, boosting productivity and competitiveness, and maintaining trust, resilience and strong consumer protection &mdash; while reinforcing the UK&rsquo;s position as a global hub for financial services, technology and investment. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Economic Secretary to the Treasury Lucy Rigby KC MP said:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="last-child">Harriet and Rohit bring deep, real-world experience of deploying AI safely at scale, and they will help turn rapid adoption into practical delivery &ndash; unlocking growth while keeping our financial system secure and resilient.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Harriet Rees, Group Chief Information Officer &ndash; Starling Bank, said: </strong></p>

<p class="last-child">Being appointed AI Champion for Financial Services is an exciting opportunity as the sector faces a pivotal moment to become a world leader in AI. I look forward to working with HM Treasury and the industry to create a world-class ecosystem in which innovation exceeds customers&rsquo; expectations and the transformative power of AI unlocks growth. In turn, this will reinforce the UK&rsquo;s status as the world&rsquo;s most technologically advanced financial centre.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Dr Rohit Dhawan, Head of AI and Advanced Analytics &ndash; Lloyds Banking Group, said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="last-child">It is a privilege to have been asked by HM Treasury to take on the role of AI Champion for financial services. AI has the potential to reshape the industry and at Lloyds Banking Group we are already seeing how thoughtful and responsible adoption of AI can transform customer experience and the way a large organisation operates. I look forward to working with HM Treasury, regulators and industry partners to accelerate the trusted and effective use of AI across financial services and support the UK&rsquo;s ambition to remain a global leader in financial innovation.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Harriet Rees is Group Chief Information Officer at Starling, where she leads data, engineering, information security and product development. Having joined Starling in 2018 to found its Data Science practice, she now defines and delivers the Group&rsquo;s technology strategy, including oversight of information and technology assets and ensuring operational resilience at scale. Harriet also plays a leading role in shaping the future of AI in financial services as Co-Chair of the Bank of England&rsquo;s AI Taskforce and a member of the AI Consortium. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr Rohit Dhawan is Group Director and Head of AI &amp; Advanced Analytics at Lloyds Banking Group, a role he has held since 2024. He is responsible for shaping the Group&rsquo;s strategy and roadmap for AI, machine learning and advanced analytics.

<p>Leading regulated digital prime broker&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.gc.exchange/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">GCEX (GCEX Group)</a>&nbsp;serving institutional and professional clients across the UK, EU and UAE, has added Gold Futures CFDs to its product range.</p>
<p>Offering Futures CFDs further strengthens GCEX&rsquo;s multi-asset capabilities, supporting clients seeking greater flexibility in how they manage market exposure. Additional Futures CFDs will follow shortly, marking the next step in GCEX&rsquo;s continued expansion across traditional and digital asset classes.</p>
<p>This addition provides an alternative structure to rolling spot instruments and non-expiring CFDs by offering exposure within a clearly defined contract period. The initial release includes the GCG26 contract (February 2026 Gold Future), giving clients access to CFDs that reference the price of underlying exchange-listed futures.</p>
<p>Lars Holst, CEO of GCEX, said: &ldquo;The introduction of Gold Futures CFDs reflects the ongoing development of our product suite and our commitment to supporting client requirements across both traditional and digital markets. Our focus is on offering institutional-grade instruments underpinned by robust regulatory governance across all GCEX entities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Futures CFDs carry a defined end date (the expiry date), viewable in GCEX&rsquo;s XplorTrader platform. Priced according to the futures curve, these products embed cost-of-carry elements directly into the contract structure, eliminating overnight financial charges. Clients must close their positions before expiry; otherwise GCEX will automatically close the position at the final settlement price to ensure seamless outcome.</p>
<p>GCEX Group empowers institutional and professional clients to access deep liquidity in CFDs on digital assets and FX, alongside spot trading and conversion of digital assets. The company also offers a comprehensive range of Forex brokerage and crypto-native technology solutions under its XplorDigital suite.

True Global Ventures are investors in GCEX.<span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul>
<li><span>Over AED 500k awarded to date and AED 1.5mn confirmed in upcoming challenge value</span></li>
<li><span>Ignyte&rsquo;s challenge-led initiative reinforces Dubai&rsquo;s position as a launchpad for next-generation Web3 start-ups</span></li>
<li><span>Multi-party partnership with Binance, CoinW, Ripple Labs, Solana and Ton Foundation underpin the programme</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Ignyte - the region&rsquo;s leading global digital start-up ecosystem, has successfully concluded major programmes culminated in a landmark Demo Day at the Museum of the Future, where selected start-ups presented their solutions before a panel of industry leaders, investors, and global partners. The challenge tracks were delivered in partnership with du Business, Solana, TON Foundation and Avalanche, providing start-ups with both capital incentives and direct exposure to global innovation ecosystem.</p>
<p>As part of the initiative, Ignyte and Solana&rsquo;s regional community delivered a developer-focused engagement series, providing hands-on opportunities for experimentation, collaboration, and solution testing, which were showcased at the Demo Day.</p>
<p>Building on this momentum, Ignyte is advancing a robust pipeline of forthcoming challenge tracks, with an indicative aggregated value exceeding AED 1.5mn by H1 2026. So far AED 500,000 has been awarded, and the next phase reflects planned contributions totalling AED 1mn. (USD 285,000), involving prominent global and regional partners.</p>
<p>Partners include, Binance, CoinW, Ripple Labs, Solana, and Ton Foundation, established to strengthen Web3 infrastructure within Ignyte ecosystem. Through this multi-party collaboration, start-ups gain access to high-performance, low-cost blockchain networks, liquidity insights, and exchange exposure.</p>
<p><span>Mohammad Alblooshi, Chief Executive Officer of DIFC Innovation Hub, said:&nbsp;</span>"Dubai has become the region&rsquo;s foremost global hub innovation, with DIFC at the centre of this transformation. Ignyte exemplifies our commitment to empowering the region&rsquo;s most promising start-ups and blockchain pioneers by providing them with world-class infrastructure, expertise and networks to accelerate their growth. By bringing together industry leaders we are opening direct access to global blockchain ecosystems, removing barriers to entry, and enabling visionary entrepreneurs to build, launch, and scale the future of Web3 - right here in Dubai, for markets across the region and globally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This first-of-its-kind multi-party challenge initiative marks a new chapter for Ignyte as a bridge between global blockchain ecosystems and the UAE's innovation economy, further reinforcing Dubai&rsquo;s role in shaping the future of Web3 on a global stage.</p>

<p class="component-text">Traditionally, Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) has published the number of listed shares around the 20th of each month, along with factors influencing changes such as capital increases, stock splits, and the exercise of subscription warrants.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC is seeking feedback on a proposal to remake a relief instrument to extend the exemption for securitisation entities from holding an Australian financial services (AFS) licence.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2016L00457/latest/text"><em>ASIC Corporations (Securitisation Special Purpose Vehicles) Instrument 2016/272</em></a>&nbsp;(the Instrument) is due to expire on 1 April 2026.</p>
<p>ASIC proposes to remake the Instrument on largely the same terms for a period of five and a half years.</p>
<h2>Providing feedback</h2>
<p>Please send your submissions to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:rri.consultation@asic.gov.au">rri.consultation@asic.gov.au</a>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<strong>5pm AEDT on Friday 20 February 2026.</strong></p>
<p>Refer to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/consultations/cs-43-proposed-extension-of-instrument-relieving-securitisation-entities-from-holding-an-afs-licence/" title="CS 43 Proposed extension of instrument relieving securitisation entities from holding an AFS licence">CS 43&nbsp;<em>Proposed extension of instrument relieving securitisation entities from holding an AFS licence</em></a></p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2016L00457/latest/text">ASIC Instrument 2016/272</a>&nbsp;exempts a securitisation entity from holding an AFS licence where it holds the securitisation product as a custodian or trustee or is issuing a securitisation product to:</p>
<ul>
<li>an AFS licence holder</li>
<li>an entity that is exempted from holding an AFS licence, or</li>
<li>a wholesale client.</li>
</ul>
<p>Under the&nbsp;<em>Legislation Act 2003</em>, legislative instruments are repealed, or &lsquo;sunset&rsquo;, after 10 years, unless ASIC acts to preserve them.</p>
<p>The Instrument was made in 2016 to continue the relief provided by class orders [CO 04/1526] and [CO 05/1270].</p>

<title>ASIC Secures Nearly $40 Million In Refunds To Investors And Drives Change After CFD Sector Falls Short</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-secures-nearly-40-million-in-refunds-to-investors-and-drives-change-after-2026119/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-secures-nearly-40-million-in-refunds-to-investors-and-drives-change-after-2026119/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC has secured the return of nearly $40 million to more than 38,000 retail investors and driven substantial compliance improvement across Australia&rsquo;s contracts for difference (CFD) sector following a whole of industry review.</p>
<p>CFDs allow investors to speculate on the price movements of assets such as shares, currencies or commodities, without owning them. Between October 2024 and December 2025, ASIC reviewed 52 licensed CFD issuers, requiring them to show how they were distributing their high-risk products.</p>
<p>In the report,&nbsp;<em>Risky business: Driving change in CFD issuers&rsquo; distribution practices</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-828-risky-business-driving-change-in-cfd-issuers-distribution-practices/" title="REP 828 Risky business: Driving change in CFD issuers&rsquo; distribution practices">REP 828</a>), ASIC found widespread weaknesses in how CFD issuers complied with their design and distribution obligations (DDO),&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2022-releases/22-082mr-asic-s-cfd-product-intervention-order-extended-for-five-years/" title="22-082MR ASIC&rsquo;s CFD product intervention order extended for five years">ASIC&rsquo;s CFD product intervention order (PIO)</a>&nbsp;and regulatory reporting requirements.</p>
<p>ASIC found that more than half the CFD sector had contravened the PIO by offering &lsquo;margin discounts&rsquo; to retail clients who took on opposing long and short positions. These investors incurred higher funding costs but could not profit from their opposing CFD positions.</p>
<p>ASIC Commissioner Simone Constant said, &lsquo;Each year, thousands of Australians lose money trading CFDs and through our review we have helped put $40 million back in the pockets of more than 38,000 investors.</p>
<p>&lsquo;These are complex, high-risk products, where most investors face losses, and even profitable trades can be entirely eroded by trading costs.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>Driving improvement in distribution and compliance practices</h2>
<p>&lsquo;ASIC&rsquo;s direct intervention has driven widespread improvements in CFD issuers&rsquo; target market determinations, client onboarding questionnaires, reporting compliance and monitoring of client trading outcomes,&rsquo; Ms Constant said.</p>
<p>Key changes in CFD issuers&rsquo; distribution practices and compliance arrangements achieved in ASIC&rsquo;s review include:</p>
<ul>
<li>39 issuers made changes to their target markets</li>
<li>46 issuers improved website content, with one issuer amending almost 1,000 webpages</li>
<li>44 issuers improved their client onboarding questionnaires, with many issuers making substantial changes</li>
<li>42 issuers implemented new processes for ongoing monitoring of client trading outcomes and behaviours, or made significant improvements to existing processes</li>
<li>48 issuers implemented changes to comply with their over-the-counter (OTC) derivative transaction reporting requirements, after the review identified over 70 million erroneous reports</li>
<li>Reportable situations lodged by issuers increased by 127% compared to the previous year, reflecting greater compliance awareness and responsiveness.</li>

<p>Ms Constant said, &lsquo;While the CFD industry has made important changes, there&rsquo;s still work to do. Issuers must continually monitor, adapt, and strengthen their compliance practices, and we urge Australians to pay close attention to what they are being offered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;ASIC will continue to act decisively, and where appropriate, will take further action to address misconduct and reduce consumer harm.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Driving better outcomes for consumers of financial products and services, including high-risk products, such as CFDs, is one of ASIC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/markets/market-supervision/asic-s-priorities-for-the-supervision-of-market-intermediaries/" title="ASIC&rsquo;s priorities for the supervision of market intermediaries">2025-26 priorities for supervising market intermediaries</a>.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>CFDs are complex, leveraged, over-the-counter (OTC) products that can expose retail investors to significant losses. They allow clients to speculate on the change in value of assets like shares, currencies and commodities. Leverage and associated financing fees can magnify investor losses. A small price change against a leveraged CFD position can have a big effect on trading returns or losses, even loss of the entire investment.</p>
<p>In the 2024 financial year alone, 68% of retail CFD investors lost money, totalling more than $458 million, including $73 million in fees.</p>
<p><a href="https://moneysmart.gov.au/">ASIC&rsquo;s Moneysmart website</a>&nbsp;has further information about&nbsp;<a href="https://moneysmart.gov.au/investment-warnings/contracts-for-difference-cfds">CFDs</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://moneysmart.gov.au/investment-warnings/forex-trading">forex trading</a>.</p>
<p>The DDO, which commenced in October 2021, are intended to help consumers obtain appropriate financial products by requiring issuers and distributors to have a consumer-centric approach to the design and distribution of products.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s review built on two earlier reviews undertaken between 2022 and 2024 of CFDs issuers&rsquo; distribution practices and reports setting out better practices for meeting their obligations and areas for improvement:</p>
<ul>
<li>Report 770&nbsp;<em>Design and distribution obligations: Retail OTC derivatives</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-770-design-and-distribution-obligations-retail-otc-derivatives/" title="REP 770 Design and distribution obligations: Retail OTC derivatives">REP 770</a>)</li>
<li>Report 795&nbsp;<em>Design and distribution obligations: Compliance with the reasonable steps obligations</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-795-design-and-distribution-obligations-compliance-with-the-reasonable-steps-obligation/" title="REP 795 Design and distribution obligations: Compliance with the reasonable steps obligation">REP 795</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>During its review, on 5 December 2025, ASIC also issued an interim stop order against Stratos Trading Pty Limited (trading as FXCM) after it failed to respond to ASIC&rsquo;s concerns regarding deficiencies in its target market determination (<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-295mr-asic-issues-ddo-stop-order-against-fxcm-for-tmd-deficiencies/" title="25-295MR ASIC issues DDO stop order against FXCM for TMD deficiencies">25-295MR</a>). The stop order was revoked after FXCM amended its target market determination to address ASIC&rsquo;s concerns.</p>
<p>On 3 November 2023, ASIC commenced proceedings in the Federal Court against online investment platform, eToro Aus Capital Limited (eToro), regarding its CFD product in the regulator&rsquo;s first design and distribution action (<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2023-releases/23-204mr-asic-sues-etoro-in-its-first-design-and-distribution-action-to-protect-consumers-from-high-risk-cfd-products/" title="23-204MR ASIC sues eToro in its first design and distribution action to protect consumers from high-risk CFD products">23-204MR</a>).</p>
<h3>ASIC&rsquo;s product intervention order (PIO)</h3>
<p>The PIO on CFDs came into effect in 2021 and has been effective in reducing the risk of significant detriment to retail clients resulting from CFDs (<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2022-releases/22-082mr-asic-s-cfd-product-intervention-order-extended-for-five-years/" title="22-082MR ASIC&rsquo;s CFD product intervention order extended for five years">22-082MR</a>).</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s CFD product intervention order will expire on 23 May 2027, unless it is remade. In 2026, ASIC will engage with industry on our proposed way forward.</p>

<title>Alberta Securities Commission Warns Alberta Investors Of The Top Misleading Investment Fraud Tactics To Watch For In 2026</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/alberta-securities-commission-warns-alberta-investors-of-the-top-misleading-inve-2026119/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Alberta Securities Commission (ASC) today published&nbsp;<a href="https://www.checkfirst.ca/2026/01/19/top-investment-scams-to-watch-for-in-alberta-in-2026-how-ai-driven-scams-are-shaping-investment-fraud/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">information on the top three scams and misleading tactics</a>&nbsp;Alberta investors should watch out for this year and how they can protect themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2026, investors now face an ever-evolving landscape of online threats that can put their hard-earned money at risk: deepfakes, finfluencers, and the growing use of private messaging apps. According to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre research, Canadians lost more than $310 million to investment scams in 2024.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tools and technology scammers use are rapidly evolving &ndash; from sophisticated deepfake impersonations to encrypted group chats &ndash; making fraud increasingly harder to detect at first glance,&rdquo; said Hilary McMeekin, Director of Communications and Investor Education. &ldquo;We urge investors to slow down, check registration, and ensure any advice aligns with their investment goals and risk tolerance before investing.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Top three harmful investment tactics to watch out for</strong></p>
<p><strong>Deepfakes or AI-Impersonations:</strong>&nbsp;The ASC has seen deepfake content &ndash; images, video and audio created with artificial intelligence (AI) &ndash; often used to impersonate prominent political figures and select well-known Canadians in promotions for fraudulent investment and crypto schemes. Albertans should be aware of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advertising, websites and social media posts that appear to feature credible public figures endorsing an investment opportunity, especially offerings that promise quick or guaranteed returns.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Attempts by scammers to impersonate local individuals, including deepfakes of Alberta-based business leaders, industry experts, and other credible provincial public figures.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The potential for a more sophisticated AI-driven approach that uses cloned voices and realistic likenesses of well-known financial advisors, finfluencers and virtual public speakers for seminars and online presentations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Private messaging apps:</strong>&nbsp;Private messaging platforms, like WhatsApp and Telegram, are often used by fraudsters to engage with investors and build trust. After grabbing the victims&rsquo; attention through an ad or social media post, scammers use these channels to bring people to group chats where they share promises of exclusive trips as investment incentives and guaranteed investment returns.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once these groups are established, scammers can often exploit the trust that already exists within personal networks by encouraging individuals to invite their contacts to join the chat. When family members or friends pass along invitations to investment groups, it creates a built‑in sense of credibility and lowers skepticism, allowing scammers to reach new victims without having to seek them out directly.</p>
<p>Many of these interactions lead investors to harmful investment schemes such as pump-and-dumps or crypto scams.</p>
<p><strong>Finfluencers and unregistered advice:</strong>&nbsp;Digital creators typically seek monetization of their content through affiliate links, paid agreements, and other strategies that can blur the line between education and unregistered advice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Canadian Securities Administrators and the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) recently&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asc.ca/News-and-Publications/News-Releases/2025/12/11-CSA-and-CIRO-provide-guidance-for-finfluencers-and-firms" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">issued guidance</a>&nbsp;so that finfluencers and the firms they work with can understand and follow securities laws when posting investment information online. Generally, anyone offering investments or personalized investment advice must be registered with the ASC or another provincial securities regulator.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How can Albertans protect themselves?</strong></p>
<p>Investors can easily access all kinds of advice and information online and many of these marketing tactics leverage trust, urgency and perceived credibility to pressure investors into acting fast. The ASC encourages Albertans to pause, step back and take the time to do their own research and make sure an investment opportunity is right for them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verify that the investment professionals, firms and online trading platforms they plan to use are registered by visiting the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.checkfirst.ca/check-registration/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Check Registration</a>&nbsp;page on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.checkfirst.ca/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CheckFirst.ca</a>.</li>
<li>Ask questions when something doesn&rsquo;t feel right, and report suspicious activity to the ASC by calling 403.355.3888 or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asc.ca/Enforcement/File-a-Complaint" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">online</a>. Early reporting helps the ASC act faster and protect others.</li>
<li>Access CheckFirst.ca for unbiased information and resources designed to help investors stay informed and avoid fraudulent schemes.</li>
</ul>
<p>The ASC is the regulatory agency responsible for administering the province's securities laws. It is entrusted with fostering a fair and efficient capital market in Alberta and with protecting investors. As a member of the Canadian Securities Administrators, the ASC works to improve, coordinate and harmonize the regulation of Canada's capital markets.</p>

<title>DGCX Sees 30% Increase In Trade Volumes In 2025 To Surpass USD 46 Billion, DCCC Secures ESMA Counterparty Recognition To Boost Global Dubai Market Confidence</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/dgcx-sees-30-increase-in-trade-volumes-in-2025-to-surpass-usd-46-billion-dccc-2026119/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul type="disc">
<li><em><b>Total traded volumes surpassed 2 million lots, marking a 30% year-on-year increase, with the value of contracts traded reaching USD 46.96 billion</b></em></li>
<li><em><b>DCCC was re-recognised as a third-country CCP by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA),&nbsp;</b><b>reinforcing international confidence in Dubai&rsquo;s market infrastructure</b></em></li>
<li><em><b>DGCX continues to play a central role in strengthening Dubai&rsquo;s financial markets through transparent, well-capitalised and internationally connected trading and clearing services</b></em></li>
</ul>
<p>The Dubai Gold and Commodities Exchange (DGCX) has announced a strong operational and market performance in 2025, with traded volumes rising 30% year-on-year and gold futures activity increasing sharply, reinforcing its role in regional and international derivatives markets.</p>
<p>Total traded volumes reached 2,048,556 lots in 2025, with the total value of contracts traded reaching USD 46.96 billion. Meanwhile, average daily volumes rose to 7,940 lots, and average open interest of 13,015 lots underscored the continued depth and resilience of its markets.</p>
<p>DGCX recorded its highest single-day trading volume of 26,108 lots in April 2025, with gold futures driving growth with volumes rising to 613% year on year and 5,335 lots, reflecting increased demand for hedging and price discovery tools.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Dubai Commodities Clearing Corporation (DCCC), the clearing house of DGCX, was re-recognised as a third-country central counterparty (CCP) by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). The move follows a regulatory assessment process by ESMA and reflects both increased international confidence in Dubai&rsquo;s infrastructure and the UAE&rsquo;s continued progress in strengthening its financial market frameworks.</p>
<p><b>Ahmed Bin Sulayem, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of DGCX,</b>&nbsp;said:&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;DGCX delivered a strong performance in 2025, with total traded volumes rising by over 30% to surpass two million lots and value traded exceeding USD 46 billion. This momentum, reinforced by a sharp increase in gold futures activity, signals the deepening of our markets and the central role we continue to play in effective risk management and price discovery. ESMA&rsquo;s recognition of the Dubai Commodities Clearing Corporation as a third-country CCP, following a rigorous regulatory assessment, highlights the growing international confidence in Dubai&rsquo;s market infrastructure and the UAE&rsquo;s standing as a world-class and trusted hub for global trade and capital flows.&rdquo;</i><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>In November 2025, DGCX was recognised as MENA Exchange of the Year at the 2025 Future and Options (FOW) International Awards. The award reflects DGCX&rsquo;s continued investment in market infrastructure, product development and risk management standards aligned with global best practice.</p>
<p>Together, these developments underscore DGCX&rsquo;s role in supporting the wider financial ecosystem in Dubai by providing market participants with access to transparent and internationally connected trading and clearing infrastructure.</p>

<title>European Banking Authority And Authority For Anti-Money Laundering And Countering The Financing Of Terrorism Complete Handover Of AML/CFT Mandates</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/european-banking-authority-and-authority-for-anti-money-laundering-and-counterin-2026119/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>On 1 January 2026, the European Banking Authority (EBA) and the Authority for Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AMLA) completed the transfer of all AML/CFT mandates and functions from the EBA to AMLA, marking a milestone in the EU's fight against financial crime. The handover concludes the EBA's stand-alone AML/CFT mandate that began in 2020 and is part of the new EU AML/CFT package which established AMLA at the centre of an integrated, European system of AML/CFT supervision.</p>
<p>AMLA and the EBA have worked closely to ensure a seamless and timely transition. Key EBA tools and expertise, including the EuReCa database, supervisory insights, and risk assessments, have been transferred to AMLA. All existing EBA AML/CFT guidelines and standards will remain in force until replaced by AMLA, guaranteeing regulatory continuity for industry and supervisors.</p>
<p>Under the new framework AMLA will complete the EU&rsquo;s Single Rulebook, advance supervisory convergence, and coordinate the work of FIUs to enhance cross-border exchange of financial intelligence. AMLA will also directly supervise 40 of the most complex financial institutions or groups in the EU. The EBA will continue to address money laundering risks through prudential regulation, working hand in hand with AMLA to maintain a coherent framework.</p>
<p>The two authorities have put in place a strong cooperation framework through a formal ESAs-AMLA&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/esas-sign-memorandum-understanding-amla-effective-cooperation-and-information-exchange">Memorandum of Understanding</a>, enabling regular information exchange, joint initiatives and consistent engagement with the private sector.</p>
<p>Together, AMLA and EBA aim to deliver a more effective and consistent EU response to financial crime.</p>

<title>The Joint Bank Reporting Committee Publishes Its 2026 Work Programme And Recommendations To Enhance Semantic Integration On ESG Definitions</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The Joint Bank Reporting Committee (JBRC) published today its Work Programme for 2026, outlining key priorities and deliverables for the year ahead. In parallel, the JBRC released a set of recommendations for all authorities to consider in the development of ESG reporting requirements. The European Banking Authority (EBA) and the European Central Bank (ECB) will follow up on the implementation of these recommendations.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Work Programme 2026</span></span></p>
<p>The JBRC&rsquo;s Work Programme for 2026 sets out the Committee&rsquo;s main priorities as it continues supporting progress towards an integrated European reporting system for banks.</p>
<p>In the coming year, the JBRC will maintain its focus on semantic integration and on developing common definitions and standards across statistical, supervisory and resolution reporting. These efforts contribute to the broader EU initiative to streamline reporting obligations, strengthen data consistency and enhance efficiency for both reporting institutions and authorities.</p>
<p>The 2026 Work Programme is available on the JBRC&rsquo;s dedicated webpages&nbsp; hosted by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/activities/single-rulebook/regulatory-activities/supervisory-reporting/joint-bank-reporting-committee-jbrc">EBA</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/ecb_statistics/reporting/jbrc/html/index.en.html">ECB.</a></p>
<p><span><span>ESG-focused recommendations released</span></span></p>
<p>Alongside the Work Programme, the JBRC issued a set of recommendations on ESG disclosures aimed at supporting greater semantic integration across supervisory, resolution and statistical reporting frameworks. These recommendations represent another important milestone in ensuring more consistent and aligned approaches to ESG data across Europe. They also provide a relevant contribution to the finalisation of the Implementing Technical Standards (ITS) on ESG disclosures, to the preparation of future ESG reporting requirements, and to the development of any new ESG-related definitions.</p>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>The JBRC, established jointly by the European Banking Authority (EBA) and the European Central Bank (ECB), plays a central role in the European initiative to streamline banks&rsquo; reporting frameworks by developing common definitions, semantics and standards for regulatory data reported by banks.&nbsp;</p>

<li><i>Will allow for fractional share trading</i></li>
<li><i>Will offer immediate settlement via tokenized capital</i></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The New York Stock Exchange, part of Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE: ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today announced its development of a platform for trading and on-chain settlement of tokenized securities, for which it will seek regulatory approvals.</p>
<p>NYSE&rsquo;s new digital platform will enable tokenized trading experiences, including 24/7 operations, instant settlement, orders sized in dollar amounts, and stablecoin-based funding. Its design combines the NYSE&rsquo;s cutting-edge Pillar matching engine with blockchain-based post-trade systems, including the capability to support multiple chains for settlement and custody.</p>
<p>Subject to regulatory approvals, the platform will power a new NYSE venue that supports trading of tokenized shares fungible with traditionally issued securities as well as tokens natively issued as digital securities. Tokenized shareholders will participate in traditional shareholder dividends and governance rights. The venue is designed to align with established principles for market structure, with distribution via non-discriminatory access to all qualified broker-dealers.</p>
<p>The launch of the NYSE&rsquo;s tokenized securities platform is one component of ICE&rsquo;s broader digital strategy, which includes preparing its clearing infrastructure to support 24/7 trading and the potential integration of tokenized collateral. ICE is now working with banks including BNY (NYSE: BK) and Citi (NYSE: C) to support tokenized deposits across ICE&rsquo;s clearinghouses to help clearing members transfer and manage money outside of traditional banking hours, meet margin obligations, and accommodate funding requirements over different jurisdictions and time zones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For more than two centuries, the NYSE has transformed the way markets operate,&rdquo; said Lynn Martin, President, NYSE Group. &ldquo;We are leading the industry toward fully on-chain solutions, grounded in the unmatched protections and high regulatory standards that position us to marry trust with state-of-the-art technology. Harnessing our expertise to reinvent market infrastructure is how we&rsquo;ll meet and shape the demands of a digital future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>ICE, parent company of the NYSE and operator of six clearing houses around the world including the world&rsquo;s largest energy clearing house and the world&rsquo;s largest clearing house for credit default swaps, has been at the forefront of market innovation for more than 25 years.</p>
<p>"Since its founding, ICE has propelled markets from analog to digital,&rdquo; said Michael Blaugrund, Vice President of Strategic Initiatives, ICE. &ldquo;Supporting tokenized securities is a pivotal step in ICE's strategy to operate on-chain market infrastructure for trading, settlement, custody, and capital formation in the new era of global finance.&rdquo;</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority: Tribunal Upholds Ban And Fines For Corrupt And Dishonest Adviser</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The FCA's decision to ban Darren Antony Reynolds from working in financial services and fine him &pound;2,037,892 has been upheld by the Upper Tribunal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FCA's decision to ban Darren Antony Reynolds from working in financial services and fine him &pound;2,037,892 has been upheld by the Upper Tribunal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr Reynolds was dishonest when he gave pension transfer advice and investment recommendations to his customers, causing them significant harm.</p>
<p>Mr Reynolds showed a clear disregard for his customers&rsquo; interests. He encouraged British Steel Pension Scheme members to transfer out of their defined benefit pension scheme, despite knowing that the advice was wholly unsuitable. He also advised his customers to invest in high-risk and unsuitable products while at the same time hiding high exit fees and forging documents.</p>
<p>Mr Reynolds&rsquo; misconduct exposed hundreds of people to serious financial loss. Over &pound;17.6m has been paid in compensation to more than 470 affected customers, many of whom suffered losses in excess of statutory compensation limits.</p>
<p>In addition, Mr Reynolds let 2 unapproved people give pension advice, putting customers at risk. When confronted with his misconduct he lied to regulators, allowed important evidence to be destroyed, and moved his family home into a trust to avoid paying his debts.</p>
<p>Therese Chambers, joint executive director of Enforcement and Market Oversight at the FCA, said:</p>
<p>'Mr Reynolds&rsquo; misconduct was the worst we saw out of all the British Steel Pension Scheme cases, and he caused untold damage to his clients. He acted in a way that was corrupt and dishonest, putting his own profits before people&rsquo;s pensions and acting without integrity as he tried to cover his tracks. &nbsp;</p>
<p>'He has spent many years trying to evade responsibility for his actions. The Tribunal&rsquo;s full endorsement of our findings now brings those efforts to avoid accountability to an end. We will pursue recovery of the penalty to the fullest possible extent and will not hesitate to bankrupt him if necessary. We will ensure that he does not retain a single penny of his corrupt profits.'</p>
<p>The Tribunal noted that 'Mr Reynolds is clearly guilty of dreadful misconduct over a protracted period, which had very serious adverse impacts on a large number of retail customers. He is, as the Authority alleged, a corrupt and dishonest man lacking integrity.'</p>

<li>A Defined Benefit (DB) pension is a valuable investment with advantages that cannot be replicated by other investments. Strong reasons are required for it to be suitable for a person to exit a DB pension scheme in favour of another investment.</li>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Twenty-nine Polish capital market leaders have been awarded and recognised at the 2025 Stock Market Review Gala, an event that symbolically closed a record-breaking year for the Warsaw Stock Exchange and the entire Polish capital market.</em></p>
<p>The 2025 Stock Market Review Gala was held on 14 January 2026 at the Warsaw Stock Exchange, the heart of the Polish capital market. The event provided an opportunity to present awards and distinctions and offered a space for discussions about the future of the capital market in Poland. The Gala brought together key representatives of the financial community, including Minister of Finance and Economy Andrzej Domański and Minister of State Assets Wojciech Balczun, as well as representatives of brokerage houses, banks, issuers, and GPW&rsquo;s partners. During the event, 29 awards and special mentions were presented to entities which made a major contribution to the development of the Polish capital market in the past year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>The year 2025 exceeded our wildest expectations. We were hoping for a breakthrough and we witnessed the biggest bull market of the century. The WIG index crossed the symbolic mark of 100,000 points in April and set a record for gains in the 21<span>st</span>&nbsp;century at the last trading session of the month. The historic index performance, huge turnover, and deals which attracted billions of zlotys of new capital to the Warsaw Stock Exchange are owed to the efforts of all capital market participants because we set new records together. Key reforms are ahead, including the launch of Personal Investment Accounts (OKI). The market is keeping its fingers crossed for the smooth implementation of OKIs as we believe that they will drive further market development and, above all, ensure that Poles profit from the success of the Polish economy,</em>&rdquo; said Tomasz Bardziłowski, President of the Management Board of the Warsaw Stock Exchange.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Scila, the leading independent provider of trade surveillance and risk management technology, today reports a significant expansion in the energy and commodities sector. During the second half of 2025, the company achieved a combined total of more than 10 new contract wins and successful deployments, reinforcing its position as a preferred partner for complex energy market participants.<br /><br />The surge in demand in this customer segment is largely driven by the implementation of the REMIT II regulation, a comprehensive EU framework designed to increase market integrity and transparency. As this regulation demands more sophisticated monitoring of algorithmic trading and order book data, energy players are increasingly seeking Scila&rsquo;s robust, engineering-first platform to ensure full domain specific adherence to the new standards.<br /><br />Scila&rsquo;s recent successes span the entire energy value chain, from commodity trading houses and international producers to major utilities and prominent interdealer brokers (IDBs). The company&rsquo;s solutions also continue to serve as the benchmark for leading energy exchanges and regulators worldwide.<br /><br /><em>&ldquo;This high volume of commercial activity and successful go-lives is a clear validation from the market on our ongoing more than decade-long commitment to providing world-class technology to the energy sector,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;says Mikko Andersson, CEO of Scila.&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Energy market participants realize that navigating the complexities of REMIT II and modern trading requires an organization that is as robust and scalable as the systems we deliver. With nearly 90% of our staff dedicated to R&amp;D and delivery, we provide a level of direct technical expertise that is unique in this industry.&rdquo;</em><br /><br />Scila has a long-standing history of attracting and retaining the world&rsquo;s largest and most influential trading organizations. Originally established as a pioneer in trade and market surveillance, the company has successfully expanded its offering to include innovative and high-performance solutions within risk management, capable of handling massive data volumes across regional and global markets in real-time with true multi-asset capabilities.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Regarding our recent inflow of energy-focused customers and the REMIT II driver, we are seeing a distinct trend where organizations that initially utilized rudimentary solutions are now turning to Scila after encountering operational limitations,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;says Lars Gr&auml;ns Rohde, Chief Revenue Officer at Scila.&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Our ability to deliver unified, high-performance solutions to global supermajors and the most demanding commodity traders proves that our technology is built for the deepest challenges of the global energy markets.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><span>Bj&oslash;rn Sibbern</span>, Chief Executive Officer, said:<br />&ldquo;On behalf of the Board of Directors and the Executive Board, I would like to thank Daniel for his great commitment. He has shaped SIX over many years through his high level of professional expertise and personal engagement. His reliability and strong sense of responsibility have contributed significantly to the development of SIX. We look forward to Daniel supporting the Group during the transition of responsibilities over the coming months and thank him for his continued contribution.&rdquo;</p>

This change reflects the firm&rsquo;s ongoing growth across jurisdictions and the continued development of its senior partner model. The new name aligns with how MKI operates today, supporting institutional investors and listed companies in complex, event-driven situations shaped by stakeholder behaviour and judgement.</span><br id="isPasted" /><br /><span>MKI&rsquo;s work increasingly spans multiple geographies, with a presence in both Europe and the United States. The advisory group&rsquo;s approach is grounded in experience, accountability, and independent judgement, delivered by a team of senior partners.</span><br id="isPasted" /><br /><span>"I&rsquo;m delighted that we are now operating as MKI Global Partners. The name reflects how the business has evolved and the international nature of our work,&rdquo; said&nbsp;</span><span>Mark Kelly, CEO of MKI Global Partners.</span><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Our industry is full of opinions. We focus on fact-based intelligence. Our clients don&rsquo;t need more noise; they need relevant, connected and genuinely new information that helps them make better decisions in complex situations.&rdquo;</span><br id="isPasted" /><br /><span>MKI applies a consistent discipline when gathering and delivering intelligence. Insights must be relevant, connected to the client&rsquo;s priorities, and not already understood by the client.</span><br id="isPasted" /><br /><span>This approach supports investors who face rapidly changing event-driven scenarios. It also benefits corporates, where boards and leadership teams need quality intelligence to understand likely responses from key parties and therefore connect perspectives across advisory disciplines.</span><br id="isPasted" /><br /><span>The firm&rsquo;s remit increasingly extends beyond shareholders to include a broader set of stakeholders such as creditors, regulators, governments, unions, professional services firms and other influencers whose motivations can be decisive in high-stakes situations.</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced the following enforcement updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>CFTC Obtains Federal Court Order Imposing Civil Monetary Penalties and Trading Bans on Precious Metals Spoofers&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois entered two consent orders against&nbsp;<strong>Gregg Smith&nbsp;</strong>of New York and&nbsp;<strong>Michael Nowak&nbsp;</strong>of New Jersey for spoofing in the precious metals futures markets while employed at a major bank.</p>
<p>Under the orders, Smith must pay a $200,000 civil monetary penalty and is barred from trading in CFTC markets or registering with the CFTC for three years. Nowak must pay a $150,000 civil monetary penalty and is barred from trading and registration for six months. Both defendants are also required to cease and desist from further violating the spoofing prohibition in the Commodity Exchange Act.</p>
<p>The consent order resolves a CFTC enforcement action filed in September 2019 [<em>See</em>&nbsp;CFTC Press Release No.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8013-19">8013-19</a>].</p>
<p><span>In a related criminal case, Smith and Nowak were convicted of fraud, attempted price manipulation, and spoofing. In August 2023, Smith was sentenced to two years in prison and ordered to pay a $50,000 fine, and Nowak was sentenced to one year and a day in prison and ordered to pay a $35,000 fine.&nbsp;</span><em>United States v. Smith</em><span>, No. 19 Cr. 669 (N.D. Ill.).</span></p>
<p><span>See&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/12886/ENFSmithConsentOrder122225/download"><span>Smith Order</span></a><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/12881/ENFNowakConsentOrder122225/download"><span>Nowak Order</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><strong>CFTC Secures Federal Court Order Requiring Florida Resident, Firm to Pay Over $335,000 for Misappropriating Confidential Information, Fictitious Trading</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas entered a consent order imposing permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement, and civil monetary penalties against&nbsp;<strong>Peter Miller&nbsp;</strong>of Miami, and his firm&nbsp;<strong>Omerta Capital LLC</strong>.</p>
<p>Under the order, the defendants, jointly and severally, must pay $135,788 in disgorgement, representing their unlawful gains, and a $200,000 civil monetary penalty. The order also bans the defendants from registration and all trading for 18 months and from block trading for five years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The consent order resolves all claims the CFTC brought against the defendants in the complaint filed in December 2021 and amended in December 2022 [See CFTC Press Release Nos.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8468-21">8468-21</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8634-22">8634-22</a>].</p>
<p>In a related criminal case, the Department of Justice charged Miller in December 2021, with one count of conspiracy to commit commodities fraud based on conduct alleged in the CFTC&rsquo;s complaint. [United States v. Peter Miller, No. 4:21-cr-00570 (S.D. Tex. Dec. 10, 2021)]. Miller pleaded guilty and was sentenced in June 2024 to five months in prison and five months of home confinement. He was also ordered to pay $135,788 in criminal forfeiture.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>CFTC Charges Oklahoma Man, His Unregistered Commodity Pool Operator with Fraud, Registration Violations</strong></p>
<p>The CFTC filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma against&nbsp;<strong>Travis Ford</strong>&nbsp;of Oklahoma and his company,&nbsp;<strong>Wolf Capital Crypto Trading LLC</strong>, charging them with fraud and registration violations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The complaint alleges Ford and Wolf Capital fraudulently solicited and accepted the equivalent of more than $10 million from investors for an unregistered commodity pool operated by Wolf Capital.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the complaint, the CFTC seeks restitution, disgorgement, civil monetary penalties, permanent trading and registration bans, and a permanent injunction against further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations, as charged.</p>
<p>In a related criminal case, the Department of Justice charged Ford with conspiracy to commit wire fraud. [<em>See United States v. Ford</em>, No. 4:24-cr-00387 (N.D. Okla. Dec. 10, 2024).]<span>&nbsp;</span>On Nov.13, Ford was sentenced to five years in prison and ordered to pay certain monetary relief.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, President Hasner, for the kind introduction. It is an honor to speak at Florida Atlantic University, and I am glad to have the chance to talk with those here from the American Institute for Economic Research and the Shadow Open Market Committee.</p>
<p>I especially appreciate the opportunity to discuss my economic outlook at the start of the new year. It is a task made considerably easier with the gradual return of federal government data, which was disrupted by last year's lapse in funding. The lack of data reinforced two long-held beliefs for me. One, how grateful I am for the dedicated service of the statistical agencies to keep policymakers, businesses, and the public informed about the state of the economy. And, two, how important it is to have access to an array of data beyond what those agencies provide. That includes data produced by the Federal Reserve System, state governments, and a wide variety of private-sector sources. All of those data sources inform my view of the economy and help me make monetary policy decisions.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-slide2-20260116.jpg" id="fig2">Today</a>, I will start by sharing my outlook for the economy at the start of 2026. Next, I will discuss the implications of that outlook for the path of monetary policy. And, finally, I will discuss some recent developments in monetary policy implementation, which I know is of interest to many of you in this room. As a reminder, these views are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues.</p>
<p><span>Economic Outlook</span><br />I am starting 2026 with a cautiously optimistic point of view. Conditions in the labor market appear to be stabilizing, and I see the economy as well positioned to continue to grow while inflation returns to a pathway toward our 2 percent objective. The most recent data indicate that economic activity has remained strong. In the third quarter of 2025, gross domestic product rose at an annual rate of 4.3 percent. As you can see in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-slide3-20260116.jpg" id="fig3">figure 1</a>, that was a sharp acceleration from the first half of last year, mostly reflecting strong consumer spending and an upward swing in net exports, which can be volatile. Business investment grew at a solid rate in the third quarter, while residential investment continued to be soft. Fourth-quarter growth is likely to be restrained due to the effects of the government shutdown. Still, excluding those effects, I see the economy expanding at a solid pace of about 2 percent in the near term.</p>
<p>Looking at the labor market, job growth moderated last year, and the unemployment rate edged higher. In November and December, employers added about 50,000 jobs to payrolls each month, as you can see in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-slide4-20260116.jpg" id="fig4">figure 2</a>. This came after payrolls declined in October, largely due to an unusually large number of separations from the federal government. However, even setting aside October, the broader trend last year showed slower job creation than in 2024. At least part of the slowdown in the job market reflects a decline in the growth of the labor force due to lower immigration and labor force participation. However, labor demand has softened as well. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate, shown in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-slide5-20260116.jpg" id="fig5">figure 3</a>, ended the year at 4.4 percent, up modestly from 4.1 percent at the end of the previous year.</p>
<p>That said, the labor market is not deteriorating rapidly, as layoffs remain low; however, hiring remains low as well.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-slide6-20260116.jpg" id="fig6">Figure 4</a>&nbsp;shows that there were 0.9 available jobs in November for every unemployed American seeking work. While that level is normally consistent with a solid labor market, the ratio is considerably lower than a few years ago, when labor market conditions were much tighter early in the pandemic recovery. In this less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market, the downside risks to employment appear to have risen. My baseline, however, is for the unemployment rate to hold steady throughout this year.</p>
<p>Considering the other part of our dual mandate, inflation remains somewhat elevated from our 2 percent goal. As you know, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) targets the rate of increase in the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index; however, due to the government shutdown, the most recent available PCE price data are for September 2025. For this reason, I find it informative to review consumer price index (CPI) data to get a timelier sense of the direction of inflation, even if it does not directly translate to our inflation target. Over the longer term, both CPI and PCE measures tell a similar story. Data released earlier this week showed that the CPI rose 2.7 percent over the 12 months ending in December, the same rate as November. Core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, rose 2.6 percent, also matching November's reading. You can see in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-slide7-20260116.jpg" id="fig7">figure 5</a>&nbsp;that both headline and core measures of inflation have eased significantly from their highs in mid-2022. However, that progress slowed over the past year or so, and inflation remains at a level that is above readings consistent with our inflation target.</p>
<p>Looking at the subcomponents of core CPI, shown in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-slide8-20260116.jpg" id="fig8">figure 6</a>, we can see why there has been a slowdown in the pace of disinflation. Over the past year, we have seen further notable declines in services inflation&mdash;rent of shelter as well as other non-energy services&mdash;but these have been offset by an increase in core goods price inflation. Looking at the three buckets separately, shelter inflation, shown by the black dot-dashed line, has continued to decline, and core services inflation excluding shelter, the red dashed line, has also been on a downward trend, albeit on a somewhat bumpier path. Those readings are consistent with overall inflation moving back toward our target. What is inconsistent with a return to 2 percent inflation is the rise in core good prices. Following very high readings during the pandemic, goods inflation fell sharply, reaching its pre-pandemic range in 2023, and fluctuated roughly in that range until 2025. Last year, core goods price inflation picked up markedly, to 1.4 percent over the 12 months ending in December 2025, at least in part reflecting increased tariffs filtering through to certain goods prices.</p>
<p>While some upside risks remain, moving forward I expect to see inflation return to a sustainable path back to our 2 percent target. It is a reasonable base case that the effects of tariffs on inflation will not be long-lasting&mdash;effectively, a one-time shift in the price level. My view that inflation will resume a path toward our goal is consistent with near-term measures of inflation expectations declining from their peaks last year, as reflected in both market- and survey-based measures. And most measures of longer-term expectations remain consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal.</p>
<p><span>Monetary Policy</span><br />Although I am cautiously optimistic about the path ahead, as a monetary policymaker, I do confront a challenging situation. With the downside risks to employment having risen last year, I viewed the balance of risks as having shifted. As a result, I supported the FOMC's decisions to reduce the policy interest rate last year. I viewed that as the right step to balance the upside risk of persistent above-target inflation and the downside risk of a deteriorating labor market. This policy stance puts the economy in a good position moving forward.</p>
<p>As shown in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-slide9-20260116.jpg" id="fig9">figure 7</a>, since the middle of 2024, the Committee has reduced the policy rate by 1.75 percentage points. In my view, those moves have brought the federal funds rate into a range consistent with the neutral rate &mdash; a rate that neither stimulates nor restricts economic activity. I look forward to our upcoming policy meeting, which will be held in less than two weeks. While I do not want to prejudge the decision that will take place there, in my view, the current policy stance leaves us well positioned to determine the extent and timing of additional adjustments to our policy rate based on the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.</p>
<p><span>Monetary Policy Implementation</span><br />Now, let me turn to monetary policy implementation. I'll begin with a bit of history to provide a backdrop for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-slide10-20260116.jpg" id="fig10">recent developments</a>.</p>
<p>In January 2019, following many years of successful implementation along with extensive deliberations, the FOMC formally adopted its ample-reserves implementation framework.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20260116a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;Some key advantages of this framework include successful control of the policy rate in a variety of conditions and effective transmission to other money market rates and broader financial conditions. The FOMC defined this framework as one where "control over the level of the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates is exercised primarily through the setting of the Federal Reserve's administered rates, and in which active management of the supply of reserves is not required."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20260116a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;Therefore, the supply of reserves needs to be sufficiently large to meet the demand for reserves on most days.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, I'll now discuss recent developments in monetary policy implementation. As of December 2025, the FOMC concluded the process of reducing the size of the Fed's balance sheet that began in mid-2022 by halting the reduction of the Fed's asset holdings. During this process, we successfully reduced our securities holdings by about $2.2 trillion. This asset runoff affected not only our assets, but also our liabilities such as the reserves in the banking system and the level of overnight reverse repurchase agreement (repo) operation balances.</p>
<p>At the beginning of balance sheet runoff in 2022, reserves were at an abundant level of around $3.5 trillion. As the balance sheet shrank over the next few years, the federal funds rate remained about 7 basis points below the interest on reserve balances (IORB) rate for most of this period. The decline in the level of reserves from an abundant level toward an ample level exerted upward pressure on money market rates in recent months. As the level of reserves declined, repo rates started to increase and became more volatile. We began to see intensified rate pressures, especially on tax payment days and Treasury securities settlement days, when large flows into the Treasury General Account (TGA), another liability of the Fed, led to corresponding declines in the amount of reserves in the banking system. The federal funds rate started to move up steadily in its target range, and it now stands at 1 basis point below the IORB rate. These and other indicators of tightening money market conditions were what we expected to see as reserves declined toward the range of ample reserves.</p>
<p>It is important to note that while ending the asset runoff slows down the decline in reserves, it does not completely halt this process. Even when the Fed's assets remain constant, trend growth in non-reserve liabilities, particularly currency in circulation, will continue to absorb reserves over time. There is also significant cyclical variation in the supply of reserve balances, reflecting seasonal changes in the TGA and other factors. Furthermore, the demand for reserves is not static but rather dynamic, influenced by various factors including economic growth and changes in the financial system. Consequently, to maintain an ample reserves level&mdash;a key operational objective of our current monetary policy implementation framework&mdash;the FOMC must expand its balance sheet commensurately with the public's demand for its liabilities. This necessitates a nuanced and forward-looking approach to balance sheet management that considers both cyclical and structural factors affecting the demand for and supply of reserves.</p>
<p>With the level of bank reserves judged to have declined to an ample level, the FOMC initiated reserve management purchases in December 2025. This was the crucial next step in balance sheet management to maintain ample reserves and ensure effective interest rate control, as consistent with the plan we adopted in May 2022.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20260116a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a></p>
<p>It is important to note that reserve management purchases are not quantitative easing (QE). Each process has a distinct purpose, with different goals and economic implications. QE represents a monetary policy tool deployed when the federal funds rate is constrained by the effective lower bound. The primary objective of QE is to provide economic stimulus by exerting downward pressure on long-term interest rates. This has been achieved typically through large-scale purchases of longer-term Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities. These purchases are intended to influence the yield curve and broader financial conditions by removing duration risk held by the public for a given setting of short-term interest rate policy.</p>
<p>In contrast, reserve management purchases involve the acquisition of Treasury bills and other short-term Treasury securities in a manner that further normalizes the average maturity of the Federal Reserve's asset holdings. They help implement the short-term interest rate policy decided on by the Committee but do not alter broader financial conditions. These routine purchases are conducted to maintain ample reserves and ensure effective control over short-term interest rates. The pace and size of these purchases are calibrated to meet demand for reserve balances and to adjust reserve supply as other items on the liabilities side of our balance sheet grow over time. These purchases do not have any implications for the stance of monetary policy.</p>
<p>As detailed in the statement released by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at the conclusion of our December 2025 FOMC meeting, reserve management purchases will be front-loaded for the first few months to alleviate potential near-term pressures in money markets.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20260116a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;Thereafter, we expect the pace of reserve management purchases to decline, though the actual size will depend on seasonal fluctuations in non-reserve liabilities and market conditions. In the end, the size of our balance sheet will be determined by the public's demand for our liabilities in our ample-reserves regime.</p>
<p>Before concluding, let me also emphasize that in our ample-reserves regime, standing repo operations are a critical tool that helps provide a ceiling on money market rates. By doing so, these operations ensure that the federal funds rate remains within its target range, even on days of elevated pressures in money markets. Consistent with this view, the FOMC eliminated the aggregate limit on standing repo operations in December 2025.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20260116a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;These operations are intended to support monetary policy implementation and smooth market functioning, and they should be used by our counterparties when deemed economically sensible. This is indeed what we saw over the 2025 year-end period. There was notable upward pressure on repo rates amid substantial net Treasury settlements, as widely expected. Usage increased at the Fed's standing repo operations on year-end as market repo rates increased substantially. Despite the elevated levels of repo rates, trading conditions remained orderly in money markets. I am pleased to see increased usage of our standing repo operations when it becomes economically sensible to do so.</p>
<p><span>Conclusion</span><br />To conclude, I will reiterate that I am cautiously optimistic about the path of the economy while acknowledging that we face risks to both sides of our dual mandate. Consequently, I will continue to watch incoming data carefully so that we can set policy to achieve our mandated goals: maximum employment and stable prices. A critical aspect of achieving these goals is ensuring that the Fed can efficiently and smoothly implement monetary policy decisions. We have taken the necessary steps to ensure that capability and will continue to do so.</p>
<p>Once again, it has been an honor to be here. Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you, and I look forward to our discussion.</p>

<title>Remarks At The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, Paul S. Atkins, SEC Chairman, Tel Aviv-Yafo, Israel, Jan. 16, 2026</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Sivan, thank you for that generous introduction. Chairman Zinger, Governor Yaron, and Itai, I am honored to stand alongside each of you this morning and to bring greetings from Washington. Before I share a few reflections, I should like to begin by noting that this marks my first visit to Israel, and that I have been struck both by the beauty of your culture and the strength of your people. Thank you all for the warmth with which you have welcomed me.</p>
<p>Today, we commemorate a new trading week whose benefits, I believe, could be transformative. By moving to Monday through Friday trading, the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange has brought Israel&rsquo;s capital markets into closer alignment with those of its global counterparts. And that alignment, I suspect, will enhance liquidity, encourage greater investment, and send a clear signal to the world that Israel is open for business. Yet even as you take this step to further conform with international markets, I encourage you to preserve the spirit that distinguishes your own. A spirit that has astonishingly produced GDP growth in the middle of a war.</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the State of Israel has punched far above its weight in ways that defy easy explanation. A country with fewer residents than my native state of North Carolina, Israel is short on natural resources, surrounded by uncertainty, yet remarkably rich in resilience and resolve. Home to more startups per capita than anywhere around the world. Second globally in venture capital raised per capita. Among the most companies listed on Nasdaq after the United States. Birthplace of breakthroughs like the USB and drip irrigation. Yours is a nation that has never waited for ideal conditions to pursue prosperity.</p>
<p>Which of course brings us to the broader context in which we assemble today. In recent years especially, Israelis have lived with a level of strain that few societies are asked to endure. While children learned to adapt to the wail of sirens; while reservists fled their desks at work and dinner tables at home; while each of you bore the weight of Israel&rsquo;s longest war, your spirit did not dim. You did not close your markets, permit innovation to pause, nor investment to retreat. In short, you did not allow fear to dictate your future. Instead, Israeli indices soared to new highs. The shekel strengthened against major global currencies. Growth rebounded with force. And projections point to continued investment over the coming year. Crisis seems only to have catalyzed the very progress that it could have constrained.</p>
<p>Of course, this kind of resilience has a name:&nbsp;<em>Hatikvah</em>. Hope. After all, it is hope that has helped to make a barren&nbsp;desert bloom. To turn an ancient land into a hub of high-tech. To bend adversity toward prosperity. It is precisely this ethos that has also made our partnership so strong, for the United States and Israel have long shared more than diplomatic ties and billions in bilateral trade. We are bound by a deep and abiding belief in free enterprise; by the conviction that fair and efficient markets are a force for human flourishing. I am confident that cooperation between our two countries will only deepen in the years ahead because the partnership between our markets and our people only makes both stronger.</p>
<p>So thank you for welcoming me so warmly on my first visit to Israel. Thank you for your leadership, your friendship, and resolve. And congratulations once again on attaining this important milestone. As Israel aligns more closely with the world, may you continue to transform it.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<title>Outlook For The Economy And Monetary Policy, Federal Reserve Vice Chair For Supervision Michelle W. Bowman, At Outlook 26: The New England Economic Forum, Foxborough, Massachusetts</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good morning and thank you for the invitation to join you today.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20260116a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;It is a pleasure to be with you here in Boston at the New England Economic Forum to share my outlook on the economy and monetary policy, and I would like to thank Kathleen Murphy, the CEO of the Massachusetts Bankers Association, for inviting me to speak at your first economic forum.</p>
<p>I am also grateful for the kind introduction from Susan Collins. I greatly value her perspective, and I appreciate the opportunity to work closely with her as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and as a fellow member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).</p>
<p>It is good to see so many bank and business leaders from across the Northeast here at Gillette Stadium. Throughout my time at the Federal Reserve&mdash;and earlier in my career as a community banker&mdash;I have made it a priority to engage directly with bankers and business leaders to better understand how economic conditions affect local communities. These conversations provide important context for my views on the economy and monetary policy.</p>
<p>With the FOMC having concluded its final meeting of 2025 a little over a month ago, and with our next meeting at the end of this month, today I will share my perspective on recent policy decisions, discuss how my assessment of the economy evolved over the past year, review current economic conditions, and then outline my outlook for the economy and monetary policy.</p>
<p>As we enter 2026, the economy has continued to grow, and I see inflation moving closer to our goal. But beneath the surface, the labor market has become more fragile. My focus today is why that fragility poses the greater risk and what that means for the path of policy.</p>
<p><span>Update on Recent Monetary Policy Decisions</span><br />At our September meeting last year, the Committee resumed the process of gradually removing policy restraint and bringing the federal funds rate closer to its neutral level. At that meeting, and again at our meetings in October and December, the Committee voted to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, bringing the range to 3-1/2 to 3-3/4 percent.</p>
<p>These decisions were intended to proactively limit the risk of greater and more persistent damage to the labor market, while inflation continued to show signs that it is on a sustained downward trajectory toward our 2 percent objective. The policy rate now reflects a total of 75 basis points of cuts since September and is closer to my estimate of its neutral level.</p>
<p>I voted in favor of each of these actions in light of the weakening in labor market conditions and my expectation that inflation, excluding the effects of tariffs, would soon be within close range of our 2 percent goal. Looking ahead, as we gather additional evidence on economic activity, labor market conditions, and inflation, it will be important to continue assessing the appropriate path of policy and the timing of further adjustments.</p>
<p><span>How My Views on the Economy Evolved over the Past Year</span><br />Before turning to current economic conditions, I would like to spend a few minutes explaining how my views on the economy and monetary policy evolved over the past year. I believe this context is important, particularly at a time when the balance of risks around our dual mandate has been shifting.</p>
<p>At the December 2024 FOMC meeting, my projections for 2025 anticipated that real gross domestic product (GDP) would rise in the mid&ndash;2 percent range, that core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation would slow by a bit less than one-half percentage point, and that the unemployment rate would increase moderately to about its longer-run level. Those projections also included three quarter-point reductions in the federal funds rate over the course of 2025. In hindsight, the economy seems to have evolved largely in line with those expectations, especially if we consider inflation excluding the estimated effect of tariffs.</p>
<p>Throughout much of last year, I reserved judgment on the effects of new policy initiatives and instead maintained an overall optimistic view of the economy. In particular, I did not assume that changes in trade or immigration policy would necessarily lead to persistent inflationary pressures or large negative effects on economic activity. I also considered the potential for positive supply-side effects from other policy developments, including regulatory changes, tax policy, and a business-friendly approach.</p>
<p>With respect to trade policy, I expected that initial tariff proposals would likely be scaled back over time, that there would be little retaliation from trade partners, and that foreign producers, importers, and consumers would adjust in ways that would help limit pass-through to inflation. Substitution across goods and suppliers appeared to play an important role in moderating the effects of tariffs on both economic activity and prices.</p>
<p>On immigration, I anticipated that a reduced inflow of new immigrants would restrain demand for rental and affordable housing and ease upward pressure on housing inflation in the near term. While changes in population affect both supply and demand, I viewed the near-term demand effects as particularly relevant for inflation dynamics. I also expected relatively small effects on GDP growth from lower immigration, despite reduced labor supply and employment growth, as these new immigrants tend to have lower income and be less productive than the overall U.S. workforce.</p>
<p>Although inflation remained a concern for me early in the year, my assessment shifted as I began to see clearer signs of slowing economic growth and increasing fragility in the labor market. I became more confident that the inflationary effects of tariffs would largely be one-off, as I observed growing evidence that businesses were less able to pass through higher costs to consumers. I saw this as a sign of weakness in demand and consistent with the cooling labor market. These developments led me to place increasing weight on risks to employment and to signal a shift in my balance of risks in June, after which I dissented at the July meeting favoring a 25-basis point reduction to reflect this shift.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20260116a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a></p>
<p>Economic activity seems to have been supported by a surge in equity prices and investment activity related to artificial intelligence (AI). Although stock market valuations may appear stretched, expected earnings growth for AI-related companies has been high, and, so far, a substantial part of the investment has been self-financed. I am concerned that disappointing news on AI investment returns could lead to a sharp correction in equity prices, but the economy continues to show elevated productivity growth likely due, in part, to increased adoption of AI technologies.</p>
<p>Higher productivity gains have helped ease inflationary pressures and encouraged me to support cutting the policy rate last year, especially since we have not seen consistent signs that the labor market is stabilizing.</p>
<p><span>Current Economic Conditions</span><br />Turning to current economic conditions, the U.S. economy has been resilient and has continued to expand at a solid pace, but I remain concerned about signs of fragility in the labor market. I am also increasingly confident that inflation will come down toward 2 percent as tariff effects on goods inflation continue to wane in coming months.</p>
<p>Real GDP growth appears to have exceeded 2 percent last year. Although growth was somewhat volatile, it still averaged close to its pace in 2024 despite the drag from lower immigration, especially if we consider the effects of the government shutdown. Growth was supported by strength in business investment, including data center projects and a surge in high-tech AI investment. These types of projects tend to be relatively insensitive to interest rates and have the potential to significantly raise productivity.</p>
<p>At the same time, other areas of demand softened last year. Consumer spending and residential investment weakened, as slower growth in real disposable income and house prices weighed on demand. The weakness in housing activity and prices over the past year likely reflected some pullback in housing demand. Elevated mortgage rates may have exerted a more persistent drag as income growth expectations declined and house prices remained high relative to rents. Given very low housing affordability, existing home sales have remained depressed since 2023 and at levels only comparable with the early 2010s following the financial crisis. But the recent firming in house prices and home sales seems encouraging, suggesting less restraint on housing demand following the decline in mortgage rates since the middle of last year.</p>
<p>The latest data releases show that GDP significantly increased in the third quarter, as consumer spending accelerated, but likely slowed in the fourth quarter, reflecting a drag from the government shutdown and softer momentum in retail sales through November, consistent with recent weakness in personal income. Disappointingly, residential investment seems on track to decline again in the fourth quarter. Although home sales are rising in response to lower mortgage rates, residential improvements and new construction activity have remained slow.</p>
<p><em>Labor Market Conditions</em><br />Over the past year, as unemployment rose and payroll employment flattened out, we saw labor market conditions gradually weaken. During that time, the unemployment rate increased substantially to 4.4 percent in December, reflecting a decline in hiring rather than a sharp increase in layoffs, as many firms appeared focused on retaining workers rather than expanding payrolls. Payroll employment growth slowed significantly, and job gains became increasingly concentrated in a relatively small number of nonbusiness service industries. Private job gains averaged only about 30,000 per month in the fourth quarter, well below what is needed to keep the unemployment rate from rising, with job gains more than accounted for by the health-care and social services industries, suggesting that labor demand has continued to gradually soften since early last year. Wage growth has slowed to a pace consistent with 2 percent inflation, reflecting both easing labor demand and strong productivity growth, and the labor market is no longer a significant source of inflationary pressure.</p>
<p>Although the labor market is still near full employment, it has become increasingly more fragile and could continue to deteriorate in the coming months. The rise in unemployment has been experienced mostly by demographic groups that tend to be more affected by the business cycle. The share of those working part time for economic reasons, meaning not by choice, has increased considerably over the past two months. This has coincided with a rise in the share of multiple job holders, suggesting that an increasing number of workers struggle to make ends meet.</p>
<p>Job gains have been concentrated in just a few services industries that tend to be less affected by the business cycle. The share of industries with positive job growth over the past six months has been hovering around historically low levels. Private payroll employment may have started to fall in recent months, as the sizable upward bias in the published data implied by the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages seems to have persisted at least through the second quarter.</p>
<p>Although initial claims for unemployment insurance have remained low, there are signs that layoffs may have increased as Challenger private job cut announcements have reached their highest 12‑month level since 2010, outside of the pandemic. We could see layoffs rise quickly since job openings have softened and hiring rates are already low. The share of long-term unemployed workers reached 26 percent in December, the highest since early 2022, reflecting a less dynamic, low-hiring, low-firing labor market that some have said is giving rise to a jobless expansion.</p>
<p>All of these indicators point to growing labor market fragility, and this configuration of the labor market raises the risk that conditions could deteriorate further if demand does not strengthen. With hiring rates already low, layoffs could rise more quickly if firms begin to reassess their staffing needs in response to weaker activity.</p>
<p><em>Inflation Developments</em><br />On inflation, we have seen considerable progress in lowering the underlying trend, considering that still-elevated inflation mostly reflects tariff effects that I expect will fade this year. When those effects are taken into account, core PCE inflation appears to be much closer to 2 percent.</p>
<p>Based on the latest consumer and producer price reports, 12‑month core PCE inflation likely stood at 2.9 percent in December. However, after removing estimated tariff effects, core PCE inflation would have hovered close to 2 percent in recent months, well below the 3 percent reading at the end of 2024. This progress in the underlying trend of inflation reflects a considerable slowing in core services inflation, consistent with the easing in labor market pressures and housing inflation given the weakness in market rents.</p>
<p>The underlying trend in core PCE inflation appears to be moving much closer to our 2 percent target than is currently showing in the data. Core services inflation is already roughly consistent with our target, and only core goods inflation remains elevated, but I expect it to start moving down in coming months as the effects of earlier price increases and one-time tariff-related adjustments fade.</p>
<p><span>Economic Outlook and Risks</span><br />Looking ahead, my baseline expectation is that economic activity will continue to expand at a solid pace and the labor market will stabilize near full employment as monetary policy becomes less restrictive. Less restrictive regulations, lower business taxes, and a more favorable business environment will continue to boost supply&mdash;largely due to higher productivity&mdash;and more than offset any negative effects on economic activity and inflation from tariffs. As the tariff effects continue to wane, these supply-side policies, along with strength in AI-related investment, will continue to boost productivity gains and help ensure that inflation remains on a downward path.</p>
<p>That said, the outlook is subject to risks on both sides of our mandate, and those risks are not symmetric. On the inflation side, potential upside risks include renewed pressures in services prices, a change in firms' pricing behavior, or disruptions to global supply chains stemming from trade or geopolitical developments. This could include changes to oil prices based on reactions to recent events in Venezuela and in the Middle East.</p>
<p>While the risks merit close monitoring, I currently view them as less likely to materialize in a sustained way. First, there has been willingness to negotiate trade policy, and supply chains have largely been unaffected thus far. Second, foreign suppliers and importers have been adjusting to the new tariffs, and there are many anecdotes of businesses being unwilling to raise prices because of higher consumer price sensitivity, especially among low-income consumers. Reduced immigration will also continue to lessen demand, especially for housing, and will be a drag on inflation.</p>
<p>On the employment side, I continue to see downside risks. Continued softness in hiring, combined with already low hiring rates, means that even a small decline in demand could translate into a larger increase in unemployment. Once firms begin to shift from slowing hiring to reducing head count, labor market conditions could quickly deteriorate.</p>
<p>Memories of pandemic worker shortages are still fresh, and, so far, businesses have mostly maintained, rather than reduced, their workforce. They also seem to be more willing to compress profit margins, since consumers are less willing to accept higher prices. Without a broad improvement in demand conditions, businesses may need to begin to lay off workers, recognizing that it will not be as difficult to rehire given the shift in labor market conditions.</p>
<p><span>The Path Forward for Monetary Policy</span><br />With inflation on a sustained trajectory toward 2 percent and signs of fragility in the labor market, my view is that we should continue to focus on risks to our employment mandate and preemptively stabilize and support labor market conditions. Over the second half of last year, I frequently pointed to a shift in economic conditions and in the balance of risks to our employment and inflation goals. I also noted the signs of weakening labor market conditions shown in the flattening of payroll employment gains and the rise in the unemployment rate. But with a rising unemployment rate and inflation remaining slightly above target, our maximum-employment and price-stability goals have been in tension. With our goals in tension, our framework calls for a balanced approach&mdash;taking into account not only the size of deviations from our goals, but also the likelihood that those deviations could become persistent.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20260116a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a></p>
<p>In considering the appropriate path for monetary policy, my approach remains intentionally proactive and forward looking. It takes time to see the full effects of monetary policy on the economy. Placing too much weight on the most recent data can result in an inherently backward-looking assessment of economic conditions. In my view, that approach increases the risk of falling behind the curve and ultimately requiring more abrupt and larger policy adjustments than would otherwise be necessary.</p>
<p>Instead, we should rely on forecasts that are informed by a broad set of indicators and by ongoing engagement with businesses and communities across the country. In my view, this approach is more likely to capture how the economy will evolve over time. Acting in a timely and measured way, based on how we expect the economy to evolve, can help support employment and price stability while limiting the risk of unnecessary volatility.</p>
<p>With inflation pressures easing&mdash;after excluding one-off tariff effects&mdash;and with the risk that labor market conditions could weaken further, I see policy as moderately restrictive. The labor market can appear to be stable right up until it doesn't. Absent a clear and sustained improvement in labor market conditions, we should remain ready to adjust policy to bring it closer to neutral. We should also avoid signaling that we will pause without identifying that conditions have changed. Doing so will indicate that we are not attentive or responsive to the recent and expected path of the labor market.</p>
<p>At the same time, I want to emphasize that monetary policy is not on a preset course. At each FOMC meeting, my colleagues and I will evaluate incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks to our dual-mandated goals of maximum employment and price stability. I will also continue to meet with a broad range of contacts to inform my assessment of economic conditions and the appropriate stance of policy.</p>
<p><span>Supervisory and Regulatory Priorities</span><br />Before I conclude my remarks today, I would like to briefly touch on the Federal Reserve's supervisory and regulatory agenda, which I know is of particular interest to many of you here today.</p>
<p>While monetary policy often takes center stage, effective supervision and regulation are essential to maintaining a safe, sound, and resilient banking system&mdash;one that supports economic growth and serves communities across the country.</p>
<p>Since the President appointed me as Vice Chair for Supervision last June, we have made meaningful progress on several priorities that will improve transparency, efficiency, and focus within our supervisory and regulatory framework. My objective is to ensure that supervision and regulation are appropriately tailored, risk focused, and grounded in our statutory responsibilities.</p>
<p>Congress has also taken several steps in this regard. The passage of the GENIUS Act (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act), along with ongoing consideration of banking and other digital assets legislation, underscores the importance of regulatory clarity as innovation enables the banking and financial systems to continue to evolve. We are actively working to implement the Federal Reserve's responsibilities under this new law.</p>
<p>Last week, I shared my agenda and provided an update on our work to modernize bank supervision and regulation.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20260116a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;I will highlight a few of these and the concrete steps we have taken since last June to enhance supervision and regulation. We have</p>
<ul>
<li>finalized changes to rationalize the large financial institution ratings framework, to better reflect a firm's condition based on material financial risks</li>
<li>finalized revisions to the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio, returning it to its traditional role as a capital backstop and helping to reduce the risk of market disruptions</li>
<li>proposed recalibration of the community bank leverage ratio to the statutory minimum, providing greater flexibility for eligible community banks</li>
<li>removed reputational risk from the examination toolkit, allowing examiners to focus on material financial risks</li>
<li>issued, for the first time, a set of supervisory operating principles to enhance transparency, accountability, and consistency in examinations&mdash;to benefit both examination staff and the banks we supervise</li>
<li>published a request for information on payments fraud to support a more coordinated and effective response</li>

<title>Spain Investors Day Marks The Start Of 2026 For Spanish Markets</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/spain-investors-day-marks-the-start-of-2026-for-spanish-markets-2026116/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/spain-investors-day-marks-the-start-of-2026-for-spanish-markets-2026116/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The 16th edition of Spain Investors Day (SID) showed that the stock market is back in vogue. BME has participated in SID since its inception, whose objective is to promote Spain as an investment destination, and this year, with the IBEX 35 at record highs and attractive stock market multiples, this is more justified than ever. King Felipe VI presided over the opening ceremony, and Prime Minister, Pedro S&aacute;nchez, made the closing</p>
<p>Spain has established itself as one of the most attractive investment destinations in Europe in a complex international context. The Spanish economy has shown high resilience, combining sustained growth, inflation control, record job creation, and improved public finances with a notable reduction in the risk premium and a recovery in international confidence.</p>
<p>In this context, Spanish companies are doing very well. The IBEX 35 is at historic highs and valuations remain clearly attractive: the P/E ratio (times that the profit is reflected in the share price) is 13 times, 2.3 points below its average for the last 37 years and the lowest in Europe (the US is above 28 times). &ldquo;Our average dividend yield of 4.1% is among the highest in the world, and national and international managers indicate that Spain will continue to attract investment after several years off the radar. In short, the stock market is in vogue.&rdquo; With these words, Juan Flames, CEO of BME, referred to the favorable moment for the Spanish stock market during the official SID dinner. Also participating in the opening ceremony were Jos&eacute; Manuel Albares, Minister of Foreign Affairs; Carlos San Basilio, Chairman of the CNMV; and Juan Pablo Garc&iacute;a-Lliber&oacute;s, CCO of AON Spain.</p>
<p>BME has supported this initiative since its inception and, at its 16th edition, had the opportunity to promote the attractiveness of the Spanish market through Bjorn Sibbern, CEO of SIX and Chairman of BME. Sibbern took part in the group photo at the opening ceremony presided over by the King and attended the closing ceremony with the Prime Minister, Pedro S&aacute;nchez.</p>
<p>He also took part in one of the main panels of the meeting: &ldquo;The role of large investors in the development of the Spanish economy.&rdquo; The debate was attended by Manuel de la Rocha, Secretary of State and Director of the Office of Economic Affairs and G20 for the Presidency of the Government; Davies of Abersoch, former UK Minister of Trade and Investment and Chairman of Letterone; Joseph Oughourlian, Chairman of Amber Capital and Grupo PRISA; and Javier Valle, Senior Managing Director of Apollo Global Management. The panel was moderated by Lara Hemzaoui, partner at Linklaters.</p>
<p>In his speech, Bjorn Sibbern highlighted Spain's appeal as an investment destination. "At the last SID, I was optimistic about Spain, but I did not foresee that the IBEX 35 would exceed a 49% increase in value. Trading volume has increased, share prices have risen, and the outlook for 2026 is favorable. I am proud to lead one of the most attractive stock exchanges in Europe.&ldquo; He concluded by saying that &rdquo;we must encourage retail participation so that they can be part of this fantastic market."</p>
<p><span>International context</span></p>
<p>During the various panels, it was identified that institutional stability, commitment to multilateralism, a stronger and more integrated Europe, openness to international trade, and Spain's strategic role as a bridge to Latin America, reinforced by the agreement with Mercosur, are key factors that explain the country's attractiveness. Added to this are the strength of the business fabric, sectoral and geographical diversification, and, notably, the talent of Spanish human capital, considered an essential competitive advantage for attracting productive and long-term investment.</p>
<p>Alongside this positive diagnosis, the debates also identified the main challenges facing the Spanish economy in order to consolidate this favorable cycle. These include the need to accelerate the reduction of public debt, close the productivity gap with Europe and the United States, boost growth, and increase the size of companies. They also include simplifying regulation and improving access to housing. Likewise, the importance of strengthening energy self-sufficiency, advancing investment in defense and innovation, and deepening European integration&mdash;especially in the union of capital markets&mdash;was noted in order to better channel savings toward investment. The final consensus was that Spain is starting from a solid and attractive position, but must take advantage of this moment to continue with structural reforms that guarantee sustainable and competitive growth in the long term.</p>
<p>During the closing ceremony of the SID, Prime Minister Pedro S&aacute;nchez highlighted the solid prospects for the Spanish economy, which is on track to achieve six years of growth and job creation. Finally, he reaffirmed Spain's openness to productive investment, the importance of the agreement with Mercosur, and announced the creation of the &ldquo;Espa&ntilde;a Crece&rdquo; Sovereign Fund to maintain the momentum of the European Next Generation funds, which end this year, and to continue supporting investment in strategic sectors. The Fund will have a base of &euro;10.5 billion and aims to mobilize a further &euro;120 billion through private debt and national and international investments.</p>

<h2>Speech</h2>
<p>Can I start by extending my welcome to all participants in the Bellagio Group, and congratulate the organisers on a timely and highly relevant choice of subject. My role today is some scene setting. I am going to cover three points. First, a reminder of the benefits of open economies and why they need to be supported by an international&nbsp;rules-based system which gives important roles to multilateral institutions. Second, I will set out some of the conditions that help to make this system work. And, finally I will highlight a number of the specific big challenges we face today and must take on.</p>
<p>The benefits of trade and openness in terms of specialisation and larger markets are very well known. So, too, is the need to have rules of the game and some form of commitment and co-ordination device to put these rules into effect and protect legitimate national interests. This may sound reasonable enough, but defining exactly such national interests has been hard, not least because their precise nature and force can change over time. Bretton Woods was a defining moment in terms of institution creation, but it was, of course, context specific &ndash; in the context of beggar my neighbour policies in the inter-war period when the institutional fabric of the gold standard broke down, and then a global war.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of the international rules-based system has a number of key general dependencies.</p>
<p>First, it depends on domestic national support and license&nbsp;<a id="_Hlk219108797"></a>&ndash; it cannot operate in isolation. The goals of international co-operation must sit alongside domestic national policy objectives, but there also must be scope for the international goals to shape those domestic objectives. It cannot be a one-way street and this principle must apply to all participants.</p>
<p>It follows that there is a natural tension between economic globalisation and domestic objectives and economic welfare. We cannot assume this away. Take the case of global imbalances. Our shared objective should be to tackle persistent and excessive imbalances. Effective cooperation should focus on policies that are demonstrably welfare‑improving at home and that, in turn, help to rebalance the global economy. We may not reach the first‑best global outcome (the rarely attainable &lsquo;global planner&rsquo;s optimum&rsquo;), but this approach should bring us materially closer to a mutually beneficial result.</p>
<p>Second, the system must be robust to all states of the world. I will come back to this later in some thoughts on the current context. This requires a considerable degree of flexibility in the design and operation of the institutions and thus the system. In fact, the IFIs I would argue have been pretty good at inventing and re-inventing themselves.</p>
<p>This flexibility of re-invention depends critically on the collective leadership of member countries &ndash; which takes us back to the inbuilt national versus international tension. And, today, we face the challenge of re-invention in a multi-polar world, and one where the nature of the poles is shifting with the revealed tensions. One of the lessons of economic history, going back at least to the nineteenth century and probably further, is that such shifts in polarity invariably strain the operation of the system.</p>
<p>My third point here is that the focus of attention, and tensions, has shifted over time. The outcome of Bretton Woods was more designed around international monetary relations, and that was the focus of the initial decades<sup>1</sup>. I don&rsquo;t want to trivialise the importance of monetary relations today, but the focus of disagreement is now much more on trade. Trade I would argue is more susceptible to domestic pressures than international monetary relations. Why? It raises issues of fairness and equality in domestic political economy much more directly, and thus there is likewise a much more direct link to domestic well-being and domestic interest groups. Trade is more directly blameable &ndash; for instance for changes in relative wages between groups in national economies.</p>
<p>So, I take three points from this opening description of the international system: it depends on domestic license; it must be robust to changing states of the world, and we are seeing change happening; and it is for the moment more about trade, though as a central bank governor I can&rsquo;t wash my hands and say &ldquo;trade doesn&rsquo;t affect my world&rdquo;, it does.</p>
<p>I will now turn to the second theme, namely a number of important conditions which shape the operation of the international system, and how they look in the current setting. I will focus on four such conditions.</p>
<p>The first is that &ndash; put simply &ndash; it is easier to operate the international system during conditions of strong growth in a critical number of the member countries, and more so strong productivity growth which feeds directly living standards. It is easier to liberalise trade and resist protectionism in conditions of more rapid growth, and where that growth acts to alleviate redistributive tensions &ndash; in other words, the growth is inclusive. Broadly speaking, this assisted the relative success of the GATT system of trade agreements<br />post-war.</p>
<p>Today, slower growth, and headwinds to that growth, complicate achieving domestic consensus to support international co-operation and free trade. While it is true that openness supports growth and has reduced global poverty, it can have, and has had, distributional consequences in economies, and there has been an undermining of social capital so-called and domestic cohesion. And, in turn, this creates opposition to openness.</p>
<p>I mentioned headwinds which operate to restrict growth. Today, I see four such headwinds, which is a high number and thus a strong counter&ndash;current to growth. The first is that in terms of productivity cycles &ndash; and to borrow Schumpeter&rsquo;s phraseology &ndash;industrial development involves changes that &ldquo;occurs in discrete rushes&rdquo; separated from each other by spans of comparative quiet<sup>2</sup>. Today, in terms of technology, we have been between such discrete rushes for around the last 15 years. My assumption is that AI and robotics will be the next &ldquo;rush&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The second headwind is that most countries are facing populations that are on average ageing, and this contributes to lower growth and increased demands on fiscal resources.</p>
<p>The third headwind is that for many countries the demands for defence expenditure are increasing. This can contribute to growth, but also adds to fiscal pressures.</p>
<p>And, the fourth headwind comes from Climate-related economic shocks and the consequences of the policies chosen to tackle these shocks.</p>
<p>Taken together, these headwinds to growth are a powerful force to complicate the operation of the international system.</p>
<p>The second contextual issue for the operation of the international system concerns domestic industrial policies. Industrial policy went out of favour in the 1980s, or at least so did the form that was tagged as picking winners and thus anti-competitive. That was then as it were.</p>
<p>Industrial policy is now back with us as an issue &ndash; it has grown in use. But it has &ndash; at least in some of its more modern forms &ndash; also changed in nature. As an example, it can be a response to the headwinds I discussed earlier.</p>
<p>Industrial policy has become a focus of dispute as a potential driver of persistent global imbalances. Preliminary Bank of England Staff work suggests that macro factors remain the dominant drivers, but that industrial policy applied at scale over an extended period &ndash; particularly alongside a relatively closed capital account &ndash; can have material short-to-medium-term effects. Staff are also developing a theoretical framework to clarify the channels through which these effects can arise: industrial policy expands what a country produces, but if domestic absorption is simultaneously suppressed, the excess flows abroad as a current account surplus. Meanwhile, absorbing countries see employment drawn away from tradables into lower-productivity sectors.</p>
<p>In sum, we have to accept that in our assessment of imbalances and their causes, we need to embed both macro and microeconomic perspectives. Surveillance has to keep pace with these changes. The Bank Staff work which we plan to publish this spring, represents an important, if modest, first step in this direction, and we hope it will serve as a call for more empirical analysis on this issue.</p>
<p>This brings me to the third contextual issue. The tension around the assessment and surveillance of imbalances is running high &ndash; that&rsquo;s a statement of the obvious, but has to be said nonetheless. The assessment has to be without fear or favour, and thus has to be objective, and seen to be so. Seeking truth from facts sounds easier than it is in practice. Theory alone will not get us there. Practice is necessary for achievement, and that practice has to be backed up by our support. Part of the purpose of international agencies is that from time to time they have to tell us what we don&rsquo;t want to hear, let alone act upon. Of course, they have to be accountable for the accuracy and quality of the assessment. But, accepting that, we have to call out messenger shooting.</p>
<p>This brings me to the fourth and final contextual issue. The rise of so-called populism makes the whole task harder. Three features of populism stand out in this respect. First, a tendency to emphasise domestic production and wealth distribution as in opposition to international openness rather than as complementary. Second, a tendency to attribute unfavourable conditions to outside forces, rather than to point to shared challenges. And, third, encouraging a decline in trust such that institutions &ndash; domestic and international &ndash; are viewed as distant, unresponsive and acting for the benefit of powerful and uncontrollable interests.</p>
<p>For those of us who are institutionalised, the answer is that we have to challenge back, in deeds more than just words. But, we have to ensure our houses are in order too.</p>
<p>This brings me to the end &ndash; all that is left is to point to four things that we have to assert and demonstrate continually.</p>
<p>First, to emphasise the benefits of robust economic openness for growth and well-being. Now is not the time to close the world to the benefits of trade. But to do this, we have to be realistic and assertive in defining and achieving robust openness.</p>
<p>Second, recognise the importance of, and invest in the broadest sense, in the multilateral institutions. We should not pretend that all has been perfect, and we must be prepared to make changes where they are called for, as was done in the past. But we must be clear and agreed that a world without effective institutions is unlikely to be stable.</p>
<p>Third, we should seek to enable the next major contribution to global productivity growth &ndash; the next discrete rush &ndash; likely to be AI and robotics &ndash; but to do so in a way that is sensitive to managing the consequences, and particularly invest in developing skills.</p>
<p>Fourth, I am going take a free shot because I also chair an international organisation, the Financial Stability Board. Financial Stability is a condition of growth. Acceptance of this, and interpretation of and agreement on what it means, is not as well grounded as it needs to be. But that would be another speech, or alternatively I can recommend the 88 page assessment of bank capital requirements that the Bank of England published in December.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I would like to thank Sarah Breeden, Ambrogio Cesa-Bianchi, Dan Christen, Peter Denton, Mark Joy, Karen Jude, Clare Lombardelli, Martin Seneca, James Talbot and Matt Trott for their comments and help in the preparation of these remarks.</p>

<ul>
<li><span>It is the&nbsp;first&nbsp;company to join BME&rsquo;s growth markets&nbsp;in 2026</span></li>
</ul>
<p>BME Growth today welcomed<span>&nbsp;Treelogic</span>. The traditional bell ringing ceremony held at the Madrid Stock Exchange was led by&nbsp;<span>Enrique&nbsp;Berdayes&nbsp;&Aacute;lvarez,&nbsp;</span>COO,&nbsp;<span>Ignacio&nbsp;Morate&nbsp;del Fresno,</span>&nbsp;CHRO&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span>Pablo&nbsp;Pi&ntilde;era&nbsp;&Aacute;lvarez,&nbsp;</span>CFO of the company, who was accompanied by<span>&nbsp;Juan Flames</span>, CEO of BME, and Jes&uacute;s Gonz&aacute;lez, managing director of BME Growth.</p>
<p>The company, which is the first to debut on&nbsp;BME&rsquo;s growth markets&nbsp;so far this year, took a reference price of&nbsp;2.50&nbsp;euros per share, implying a total valuation of the company of&nbsp;15&nbsp;million euros.</p>
<p>"We are starting the year in the best possible way, with a new addition to our growth markets. It is essential that&nbsp;more&nbsp;companies use these markets as a lever to grow,&nbsp;consolidate&nbsp;and give greater visibility to their projects and initiatives. Furthermore, this case is particularly significant, as&nbsp;Treelogic&nbsp;is a company that supports others in their processes and projects, which will contribute even more significantly to the industrial development of our country," added Juan Flames.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joining BME Growth marks the beginning of a new phase for&nbsp;Treelogic. It is a natural step in our evolution as a technology company, which will enable us to gain visibility, strengthen our corporate structure, and continue to develop high value-added projects,&rdquo; said Marcelino Cortina, CEO of&nbsp;Treelogic. &ldquo;Joining BME Growth marks the beginning of a new phase for&nbsp;Treelogic.

In 2025, these markets welcomed 14 new companies and now have more than 150 listed firms, which raised 605 million euros last year through 105 capital increases. BME offers alternatives for every type of company&mdash;from those in their early formation stages, via preparatory steps in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.entornopremercado.es/esp/">Pre-Market Environment</a>, to growth markets and the main stock exchange for large corporations. Among the advantages of accessing capital markets for small and medium-sized enterprises are financing, enhanced reputation, greater visibility, support for inorganic growth, and an improved ability to attract and&nbsp;retain&nbsp;talent.&nbsp;</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Fines Oil Rig Consultant £309,843 For Insider Dealing</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA has fined Russel Gerrity &pound;309,843 for using inside information to net himself &pound;128,765.</p>
</div>
</section></p>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>As a consultant, Mr Gerrity had access to information about whether oil and gas had been discovered during the drilling of wells. Between October 2018 and January 2022, he took advantage of this and used inside information to buy shares in Chariot Oil &amp; Gas Limited and Eco (Atlantic) Oil and Gas Plc ahead of announcements that increased their price. &nbsp;</p>
<p>On another occasion, he used inside information to avoid a loss. He sold shares that he already owned ahead of an announcement that no oil or gas had been found, which then resulted in a price fall. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The FCA was initially notified of some of Mr Gerrity&rsquo;s trading through Suspicious Transaction and Order Reports (STORs) submitted by a firm, showing the vital role of industry in uncovering market abuse. &nbsp;</p>
<p>During its subsequent investigation, the FCA&rsquo;s systems detected further suspicious trades placed by Mr Gerrity, over multiple accounts with different brokers, while he was based outside of the UK. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Steve Smart, executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said:</p>
<p>'Mr Gerrity abused his position to line his own pockets. We will take action against those who damage the integrity of our markets, and seek to recover any ill-gotten gains.&rsquo;&nbsp;</p>

<li>Mr Gerrity engaged in insider dealing in breach of Article 14(a) of the UK Market Abuse Regulations. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Mr Gerrity agreed to solve this matter and qualified for a 30% (stage 1) discount under the FCA&rsquo;s settlement procedures. Were it not for this discount, the FCA would have imposed a financial penalty of &pound;387,448.</li>

<title>Speech By Mr Loh Boon Chye, CEO SGX Group, At The Launch Of SID Chairpersons Guild</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Mr Chee Hong Tat, Minister for National Development and Deputy Chairman of MAS<br />Mr Yeoh Oon Jin, Chairman of SID<br />Board chairs from SGX-listed companies<br />Distinguished guests<br />Ladies and Gentlemen</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good morning, and thank you for joining us at the SGX IPO Arena.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This venue is where many entrepreneurs have struck the gong to mark their companies&rsquo; entry into the public markets.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as we all know, the IPO is not the finish line; it is the starting point of a much longer journey.</p>
<p><strong>Why the Guild Matters</strong></p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, as we launch the SID Chairpersons&rsquo; Guild, we recognise that listed companies exist not just for their controlling shareholders, but for their entire investor base.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These investors expect companies to create sustainable value, and that requires strong leadership at the very top.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the CEO of a listed company, I can attest to the difference that wise counsel makes.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At SGX, I have been fortunate to learn from three very distinguished chairmen &ndash; Mr Chew Choon Seng, Mr Kwa Chong Seng and our current chairman, Mr Koh Boon Hwee, all of whom have provided invaluable perspectives to my management team and me.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not every board or CEO has access to such guidance. That is why this Guild matters: it creates a trusted space for chairs to share insights, exchange ideas, and mentor one another, so that every company can benefit from leadership excellence.</p>
<p><strong>Connecting to the National Agenda</strong></p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This initiative aligns closely with the broader Value Unlock agenda that Minister Chee announced in November.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a national effort to strengthen governance, sharpen strategy, and enhance investor confidence. The Guild is a cornerstone of this vision.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By uplifting board leadership, we reinforce Singapore&rsquo;s reputation for trusted, forward-looking companies.</p>
<p><strong>Looking Ahead</strong></p>
<p>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the Guild&rsquo;s forums and peer-learning opportunities, chairs will be able to engage with global experts, regulators and investors &ndash; building the capabilities needed to navigate complexity and unlock long-term value.</p>
<p>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is how we move from compliance to true competitiveness, from meeting expectations to shaping the future.</p>
<p><strong>Closing</strong></p>
<p>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, I congratulate SID for driving this initiative and thank all of you for being part of this journey.</p>
<p>15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together, let&rsquo;s make the Chairpersons&rsquo; Guild not just a network, but a force for excellence &ndash; one that complements national efforts and sets new benchmarks for governance and value creation.</p>
<p>16.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you.</p>

<title>Treasury International Capital Data For November</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/treasury-international-capital-data-for-november-2026115/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/treasury-international-capital-data-for-november-2026115/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The U.S. Department of the Treasury today released Treasury International Capital (TIC) data for November 2025.&nbsp; The next release, which will report on data for December 2025, is scheduled for February 18, 2026.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sum total in November of all net foreign acquisitions of long-term securities, short-term U.S. securities, and banking flows was a net TIC inflow of $212.0 billion. &nbsp;Of this, net foreign private inflows were $167.2 billion, and net foreign official inflows were $44.9 billion.</p>
<p>Foreign residents increased their holdings of long-term U.S. securities in November; their net purchases were $221.8 billion.&nbsp; Net purchases by private foreign investors were $157.8 billion, and net purchases by foreign official institutions were $64.0 billion.</p>
<p>U.S. residents increased their holdings of long-term foreign securities, with net purchases of $1.6 billion.</p>
<p>After including adjustments, such as estimated foreign portfolio acquisitions of U.S. stocks through stock swaps, overall net foreign purchases of long-term securities are estimated to have been $220.2 billion in November.</p>
<p>Foreign residents increased their holdings of U.S. Treasury bills by $0.4 billion.&nbsp; Foreign resident holdings of all dollar-denominated short-term U.S. securities and other custody liabilities decreased by $6.5 billion.</p>
<p>Banks&rsquo; own net dollar-denominated liabilities to foreign residents decreased&nbsp;by $1.7 billion.</p>
<p>Complete data are available on the Treasury website&nbsp;<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/data/treasury-international-capital-tic-system">here</a>.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-center">###</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About TIC Data</p>
<p>The monthly data on holdings of long-term securities, as well as the monthly table on Major Foreign Holders of Treasury Securities, reflect foreign holdings of U.S. securities collected primarily on the basis of custodial data.&nbsp; These data help provide a window into foreign ownership of U.S. securities, but they cannot attribute holdings of U.S. securities with complete accuracy.&nbsp; For example, if a U.S. Treasury security purchased by a foreign resident is held in a custodial account in a third country, the true ownership of the security will not be reflected in the data.&nbsp; The custodial data will also not properly attribute U.S. Treasury securities managed by foreign private portfolio managers who invest on behalf of residents of other countries.&nbsp; In addition, foreign countries may hold dollars and other U.S. assets that are not captured in the TIC data.&nbsp; For these reasons, it is difficult to draw precise conclusions from TIC data about changes in the foreign holdings of U.S. financial assets by individual countries.</p>

<title>CalPERS Hires Shari Slate As Chief Diversity, Equity, And Inclusion Officer</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The California Public Employees&rsquo; Retirement System announced Monday that it has hired Shari Slate as its new Chief Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Officer.</p>
<p>Slate, a Sacramento area resident, has spent nearly two decades helping large companies work toward a purpose-driven culture that considers the needs and experiences of all employees, customers, and other stakeholders. Most recently, she served as Senior Vice President and Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer at CVS Health, whose businesses include not only CVS drugstores but also pharmacy benefits management and Aetna health insurance.</p>
<p>Prior to joining CVS, Slate was Chief Inclusion and Collaboration Officer and Senior Vice President at Silicon Valley giant Cisco Systems Inc., where she helped launch the Office of Inclusion and Collaboration in 2015.</p>
<p>During Slate&rsquo;s tenure at Cisco, she helped the company build a pipeline of talent across the full spectrum of diversity. Fortune Magazine recognized Cisco as No. 1 of the &ldquo;World&rsquo;s 25 Best Places to Work&rdquo; in 2019 and 2020 and Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For&reg; in the U.S. for three consecutive years: 2021, 2022, and 2023.</p>
<p>At CalPERS, Slate will drive the ongoing effort to integrate diversity, equity, and inclusion across the organization and beyond with suppliers, contractors, and investment partners. She will be a member of the Executive Team and report directly to CEO Marcie Frost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shari brings the kind of leadership this moment calls for &ndash; connecting diversity, inclusion, and equity to trust, governance and our core values,&rdquo; Frost said. &ldquo;She will help CalPERS continue to lead with our purpose, which is to deliver the best outcomes for the millions of people who depend on us for their retirement and health care benefits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slate said she joined CalPERS because of &ldquo;its clarity of purpose and the responsibility it carries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;CalPERS shows up for people at one of the most important moments of their lives, when work ends and trust matters most,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I hope to ensure that CalPERS works for all the people it was built to serve &ndash; beginning with our people and extending to every member who depends on this system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A graduate of Mills College, Slate began her career in sales and was an award-winning manager for Xerox Corp. before being hired at Sun Microsystems as one of the youngest diversity officers at a Fortune 500 company.</p>
<p>She has served on numerous boards and councils, including the California State University Foundation Board of Governors and the World Economic Forum&rsquo;s Global Future Council on Systemic Inequalities and Social Cohesion.</p>
<p>Slate represented Cisco on the Business Roundtable&rsquo;s Diversity &amp; Inclusion Working Group after 181 CEOs redefined the purpose of a corporation to serve all stakeholders. She contributed to shaping the group&rsquo;s view of DEI not as a standalone goal, but the connective tissue linking employee well-being, business performance, customer trust, supplier inclusion, and community impact.</p>

<title>Office Of The Comptroller Of The US Currency Announces Enforcement Actions For January 2026</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) today released enforcement actions for January 2026.</p>
<p>The OCC uses enforcement actions against an institution-affiliated party (IAP) to deter, encourage correction of, or prevent violations, unsafe or unsound practices, or breaches of fiduciary duty. Enforcement actions against IAPs reinforce the accountability of individuals for their conduct regarding the affairs of a bank. The term &ldquo;institution-affiliated party,&rdquo; or IAP, is defined in 12 USC 1813(u) and includes bank directors, officers, employees, and controlling shareholders. Orders of Prohibition prohibit an individual from any participation in the affairs of a bank or other institution as defined in 12 USC 1818(e)(7).

<title>UK Prudential Regulation Authority To Streamline Supervision As Part Of 2026 Priorities</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-prudential-regulation-authority-to-streamline-supervision-as-part-of-2026-pri-2026115/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-prudential-regulation-authority-to-streamline-supervision-as-part-of-2026-pri-2026115/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) has today published its supervisory priorities for 2026, outlining in a letter its sector-specific priorities for the coming year to all banks, building societies, insurers and other PRA-regulated firms.</p>
<p>These include important plans to streamline the supervisory process by moving some supervisory activity, including Periodic Summary Meetings (PSMs), to a two-year cycle.</p>
<p>These meetings are an internal, formal review led by the PRA to consider potential risks posed by a regulated firm to the PRA&rsquo;s objectives, and to set the supervisory strategy for the coming period.</p>
<p>Over recent years, the PRA has transitioned some firms to biennial review cycles, reflecting the longer-term nature of supervisory workplans and allowing firms and supervisors to focus resources more efficiently on identifying and remediating key risks.</p>
<p>From 1 March larger firms will begin to move to this two-year cycle, while maintaining a regular cadence for discussion of important matters, alongside ad hoc supervisory meetings. This will result in firms having a more proportionate and efficient set of engagements with the PRA.</p>
<p>The Priorities letters are designed to help firms understand the main areas of supervisory focus over the next year, addressing key risks in each sector while setting out the PRA&rsquo;s priorities to support competition, competitiveness and growth. Other streamlining measures include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accelerating timelines for reviewing senior manager applications, new firm authorisations and internal ratings-based model change pre-approval applications;</li>
<li>Developing the new UK captive regime for insurers, through a summer 2026 consultation with a view to launch the new regime in 2027;</li>
<li>And streamlining and modernising reporting requirements through the Future Banking Data project.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sam Woods, Deputy Governor for Prudential Regulation and Chief Executive Officer of the PRA, said:</p>
<p>'As we set out our priorities for 2026, we are also updating our approach by moving from an annual to a two-year supervisory cycle for firms. This will allow us to make our operations more efficient and help streamline firms&rsquo; interactions with the PRA.'</p>
<p>These priorities build on the PRA&rsquo;s extensive work to maintain stability and promote growth and competitiveness in the financial sector. Recent changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The removal of the Building Societies Sourcebook alongside&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2025/december/regulators-announce-plans-to-support-growth-of-mutuals-sector">new measures</a>&nbsp;to support the growth of the mutuals sector;</li>

<li>The PSM process typically involves the PRA internally setting out the forward-looking supervisory strategy for individual firms, before a letter is shared with the firm&rsquo;s board and management to outline its assessment of key risks, as well as any areas of focus, and request mitigating actions be taken where necessary.</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Lingfeng Capital today announced the forthcoming launch of the&nbsp;Digital Venture Fund (DVF). DVF delivers a regulated, multi-chain tokenised venture fund providing institutional-level access to early-stage fintech and digital infrastructure opportunities. The fund will be launched on&nbsp;<span>LSEG&rsquo;s Digital Markets Infrastructure (DMI)</span>&nbsp;platform during a&nbsp;<span>London Stock Exchange market opening ceremony in March</span>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Designed as a next-generation venture product, DVF combines Lingfeng Capital&rsquo;s established investment capability with LSEG&rsquo;s digital markets infrastructure and Archax&rsquo;s digital exchange and custody framework. Together, this creates an environment where traditional and digital-native investors can participate in the same venture strategy through modernised access rails enabled by distributed ledger technology.</p>
<p>&ldquo;DVF exists to prove that high-quality venture investing can be expanded by tokenised access,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span>Brian McNulty, Partner, DVF at Lingfeng Capital</span>. &ldquo;Investors want diversification, they want innovation&nbsp;and they want regulated structures they can trust. We are now able to offer a product that stays firmly institutional while opening the door to new forms of participation and liquidity. This collaboration is an important milestone in connecting global capital to digital markets infrastructure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;LSEG is pleased that Lingfeng Capital and DVF has chosen to use LSEG&rsquo;s Digital Markets Infrastructure&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span>Darko Hajdukovic, Head of Digital Markets Infrastructure</span>. "We&rsquo;re excited to be working with such an innovative firm, offering professional investors access to exciting new investment opportunities through LSEG&rsquo;s independent, trusted and scaled network.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Archax will provide regulated digital issuance, secondary-market connectivity and custody services, enabling DVF to offer optional token-based access while remaining fully compliant with institutional standards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the first FCA-regulated digital securities exchange, broker and custodian, we are uniquely positioned to provide compliant token issuance, secondary trading and custody within a single regulated environment. DVF showcases how real-world assets and digital rails can operate together to open new markets for investors without sacrificing oversight or trust.&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span>Graham Rodford, CEO and co-founder of Archax</span>.</p>
<p>DVF invests in fintech and digital-infrastructure companies through a traditional venture strategy, with the tokenised structure enabling modern distribution, improved efficiency and offers optional future liquidity. Digital-native investors will also be able to diversify into a fundamentals-driven venture fund through traditional channels.</p>
<p>DVF represents the first institutional-grade venture product designed for cross-participation between traditional investors, digital-asset holders and blockchain foundations, with future phases enabling deeper network integration and expanded investor access.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Transaction Network Services (TNS) has expanded its global market data and infrastructure footprint in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region by adding connectivity to the Japan Alternative Market (JAX). This new connection provides TNS customers with direct, managed access to JAX&rsquo;s market data feeds, delivered across TNS&rsquo; extensive global network.</span><br /><br /><span>JAX began operations in December 2024, adding a new trading venue to Japan&rsquo;s equities market. Through TNS&rsquo; connectivity, global firms can access JAX market data and incorporate it into their trading and analytics workflows.</span><br /><br /><span>&ldquo;The rise of alternative trading venues like JAX represents a significant shift in the Asian financial landscape,&rdquo; said Jeff Mezger, Vice President of Product Management, TNS. &ldquo;JAX is a compelling success story, and by making its market data available to our global customer base, we are helping to lower the barriers to entry for firms looking to capitalize on this competitive shift.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span>While Asian exchanges often require bespoke broker connections for order routing and clearing, TNS simplifies market data access. Firms can leverage TNS&rsquo; expansive extranet, consisting of over 5,000 endpoints for local broker access, and can view JAX market data alongside other major exchanges via TNS&rsquo; low latency&nbsp;</span><a href="https://tnsi.com/solutions/financial/network-maps-global-access/">managed global network</a><span>.</span><br /><br /><span>&ldquo;Partnering with TNS provides JAX with a direct link to a broad, international community of market participants,&rdquo; said a JAX spokesperson. &ldquo;Their global infrastructure and deep experience in market connectivity supports JAX&rsquo;s continued growth as we build a more competitive trading environment in Japan.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span>The JAX integration reinforces TNS&rsquo; continued investment in expanding its APAC footprint and delivering reliable,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://tnsi.com/solutions/financial/market-data/">low-latency market data</a><span>&nbsp;to customers worldwide. TNS&rsquo; Japanese exchange portfolio also includes Japannext, Tokyo Financial Exchange (TFX) and the Japan Exchange Group (JPX), which encompasses the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE), Osaka Exchange (OSE), and Tokyo Commodity Exchange (TOCOM).</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Agentic commerce is accelerating rapidly, reshaping how consumers discover, decide, and buy products and services online. Industry leaders forecast that a significant share of digital commerce will soon be agent-assisted:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-agentic-commerce-opportunity-how-ai-agents-are-ushering-in-a-new-era-for-consumers-and-merchants" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">McKinsey projects that by 2030, agentic commerce could see between $3 trillion and $5 trillion in global retail value.</a>&nbsp;As agentic commerce evolves, it faces a key challenge: securely integrating AI with complex payment systems simply.<b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<h4>New assets to power agentic commerce</h4>
<p><a href="https://docs.connect.worldline-solutions.com/documentation/ConnectAI/worldline-model-context-protocol-mcp-server" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Worldline&rsquo;s Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers</a>&nbsp;on the Global Collect platform address this by acting as a secure bridge and translation layer between LLMs and Worldline&rsquo;s APIs, enabling AI agents to initiate payment actions via natural language. For merchants, the MCP server unlocks innovation avenues and supports agent-initiated actions such as payment creation, refunds, status checks, and payment captures. It also enables AI-driven shopping by allowing agents to share secure payment links while maintaining security and compliance.</p>
<p>The second capability is&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.connect.worldline-solutions.com/documentation/ConnectAI/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="ConnectAI">ConnectAI</a>, a dedicated hub on its&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.connect.worldline-solutions.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Documentation Site">Documentation Site</a>&nbsp;for developers and merchants to explore, build, test, and prepare for agentic commerce. ConnectAI brings together tools, documentation, and guidance for emerging agentic payment protocols.</p>
<p><b>Stijn Gasthuys, Head of Global Commerce at Worldline</b>,<b>&nbsp;</b>commented: &ldquo;Agentic commerce will unlock new waves of innovation, helping merchants deliver better customer experiences. Our investments in this area position Worldline to capture a growing global market for AI-powered transactions, delivering secure, scalable infrastructure that empowers merchants and developers to innovate with confidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Gertjan Dewaele, VP of Product &amp; Technology at Worldline</b>,<b>&nbsp;</b>commented: &ldquo;The shift to agentic commerce is underway, and MCP servers are the first building block for moving merchants from experimentation to real-world deployment. By providing secure, simple access to Worldline&rsquo;s payment capabilities for AI agents, we enable the next generation of agentic commerce and streamline internal operations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Worldline is actively shaping the future of agentic commerce by collaborating across the broader ecosystem with networks, tech leaders, AI platforms, and partners, laying the groundwork for secure, scalable agent-initiated payments. This includes active support for emerging standards such as&nbsp;<a href="https://worldline.com/en/home/main-navigation/resources/blogs/2025/worldline-collaborates-with-google-cloud-on-the-agents-payments-protocol-for-users-merchants-and-payment-providers-to-transact-with-confidence">Google&rsquo;s Agent Payments Protocol (AP2)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/under-the-hood-universal-commerce-protocol-ucp/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP)">Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP)</a>, with a strong focus on European regulatory and trusted requirements.</p>

<title>LSEG Launches Digital Settlement House</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/lseg-launches-digital-settlement-house-2026115/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/lseg-launches-digital-settlement-house-2026115/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>LSEG today announces the launch of a new digital settlement service, Digital Settlement House (LSEG DiSH), an open-access platform which enables programmatic and instantaneous settlement between independent payment networks, both on and off chain. Through commercial bank deposits held on the DiSH ledger (DiSH Cash), the service will enable the 24/7 instantaneous movement of commercial bank money in multiple currencies and jurisdictions, PVP and DVP, providing a real cash leg for FX and digital asset transactions and settlements.</p>
<p>With LSEG DiSH, market participants will be able to conduct PvP or DvP and settlements using any asset, orchestrating payments on any connected network, digital and traditional. DiSH Cash, LSEG DiSH's ledger enabled commercial bank money solution, will operate accounts at commercial banks, providing members with instant ownership of a commercial bank deposit at any bank within the LSEG DiSH network, and a mechanism for the 24/7 movement of commercial bank money. LSEG DiSH can facilitate settlement on its own ledger, or act as notary to facilitate settlement in other networks and assets.</p>
<p>By using LSEG DiSH, users can unlock trapped assets, enabling instantaneous use of cash, securities and digital assets 24/7. They will also be able to optimise liquidity through new tools that enable intraday borrowing and lending to better manage assets and obligations. The service also enables users to reduce settlement risk through reduced settlement timelines, synchronised settlement, and increased collateral availability.</p>
<p>The launch follows a successful Proof of Concept (PoC) in collaboration with Digital Asset and a consortium of leading financial institutions, completing transactions on the Canton Network. Executed across multiple assets and currencies, the transactions leveraged commercial bank deposits at leading commercial banks, with ownership recorded on the LSEG DiSH ledger, enabling the PoC participants to instantaneously transfer commercial bank deposits. The deposits were tokenised on the Canton Network for use as a true cash leg of the transactions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>LSEG DiSH will operate through LSEG&rsquo;s Post Trade Solutions business, utilising a trusted rulebook framework and account structure, supporting a broad network of members across multiple commercial banks and currencies. Instantaneous settlement of cash means that LSEG DiSH can offer dynamic management of intraday liquidity and funding, as well as 24/7 management of settlements and margin.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Daniel Maguire, Group Head, LSEG Markets and CEO, LCH Group</span>, said: &ldquo;LSEG DiSH expands the tokenised cash and cash like solutions available to the market, and for the first time, offers a real cash solution tokenised on the blockchain utilising cash in multiple currencies held at commercial banks. This innovative service will enable users to reduce settlement risk, and integrate existing cash, securities and digital assets across new and existing market infrastructure. We look forward to developing this service in partnership with the market.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<ul class="pr-top-bullets">
<li>Kristi Tange appointed as Group Chief Risk Officer</li>
<li>Clare Weaver MBA, becomes Chief Legal Officer</li>
</ul>
<p>ClearToken, the digital financial market infrastructure firm, today announces two senior appointments to enhance its Senior Leadership Team and further strengthen its legal and risk functions.</p>
<p><span>Kristi Tange has been appointed Group Chief Risk Officer,</span>&nbsp;to lead governance, risk, and strategic oversight, including compliance, communications, and regulatory relations. She brings nearly three decades of experience at Goldman Sachs across operations, risk, and finance in the US, UK, and Japan.</p>
<p>Most recently, Kristi served as Global Head of Operational Risk and Resilience at Goldman Sachs, where she led a strategic uplift of operational risk and UK resilience programmes. Previously, she headed Recovery and Resolution Planning, successfully filing two US Title I resolution plans. Her experience also includes enterprise risk, where she led risk identification, and senior leadership roles in operations across liquidity and collateral, client onboarding (including financial crimes), client assets, data, regulatory reporting, tax, derivatives, and treasury.</p>
<p><span>Clare Weaver, MBA, has become Chief Legal Officer,</span>&nbsp;where she will lead the Legal &amp; Regulatory function for the Group, providing strategic legal and regulatory advisory support to the CEO and Boards and managing the Group&rsquo;s legal affairs. Clare has been ClearToken&rsquo;s legal counsel and Head of Legal &amp; Regulatory and Company Secretary since inception in 2023.</p>
<p>Clare brings over 20 years of experience across specialist Corporate, Commercial, M&amp;A, fintech, and financial regulatory matters both in private practice and in industry, for more than 15 years deeply covering &ldquo;general counsel&rdquo; roles spanning all legal matters (including employment, commercial, corporate and finance). Clare previously established the Nomura Digital Office legal function and was founding interim CLO of Laser Digital (part of Nomura), before joining ClearToken in 2023.</p>
<p class="pr-subheading">Maintaining developmental momentum</p>
<p>These recent appointments are the latest milestones in ClearToken&rsquo;s growth, as the company seeks to unlock the full potential of 24/7 digital markets by offering horizontal post-trade services with the legal certainty offered by a regulated financial market infrastructure (FMI). They are also important steps towards the company&rsquo;s ambition to provide clearing and settlement services across digital asset markets for securities, derivatives and financing transactions.</p>
<p>In 2025, ClearToken achieved&nbsp;<a href="https://cleartoken.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CLEARTOKEN-November-2025-FCA-Authorisation-Press-Release.pdf" target="_blank">FCA Authorisation</a>&nbsp;to launch its delivery-versus-payment (DvP) settlement platform,&nbsp;<a href="https://cleartoken.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ClearToken-Adopts-Nasdaq-Eqlipse-Clearing-Press-Release.pdf" target="_blank">selected Nasdaq</a>&nbsp;as its technology partner, and&nbsp;<a href="https://cleartoken.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/CT-Settle-Go-Live-press-release-6.12.2025.pdf" target="_blank">launched CT Settle</a>, its DvP settlement platform for digital assets. ClearToken is now proceeding with its formal application for authorisation from the Bank of England as a Central Counterparty (CCP).</p>
<p><span>Benjamin Santos-Stephens, CEO of ClearToken, said:</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;We are delighted to welcome Kristi to ClearToken and congratulate Clare on her new role with us. These appointments build on the momentum we achieved in 2025 and are important milestones for us as we continue to build for the future. Such high calibre appointments bring with them a wealth of relevant experience and expertise and are welcome enhancements to our senior leadership team, as we continue with our strategy to create the world&rsquo;s first clearing house and settlement depository for both tokenised traditional and digitally native assets.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Kristi Tange, Chief Risk Officer of ClearToken, commented:</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;It is a very exciting time to join ClearToken, which is well positioned to unify the traditional finance and digital assets worlds and unlock the massive potential of tokenisation. I am looking forward to working with the energetic and visionary team here to build the financial market infrastructure which will underpin the future of global, 24/7 markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Clare Weaver, Chief Legal Officer at ClearToken said:</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Having worked with ClearToken well before joining full time in 2023, I&rsquo;m extremely proud of what we have achieved together so far. As the legislative landscape, and therefore opportunities, for digital assets continues to develop across the globe, I look forward to helping our strong, diverse team deliver on our growth ambitions in 2026 and beyond, and at the same time ensuring that legal certainty and compliance remains at the core of what we do.&rdquo;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) confirms that as a result of a sophisticated phishing attack, first disclosed in August 2025, approximately 750,000 Canadian investors have been impacted.</p>
<p>We deeply regret this occurred and apologize for any inconvenience or concern.</p>
<p>CIRO is reaching out to affected investors to alert them of the incident and offering credit monitoring as an added precaution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are intent on doing right by those who are personally affected,&rdquo; said Andrew Kriegler President and Chief Executive Officer of CIRO. &ldquo;We take our public interest role very seriously. Matters of privacy and security are extremely important to us, as are our guiding organizational values of transparency and accountability. That&rsquo;s why we remain committed to further strengthening our own cybersecurity defences and data security practices and supporting the ongoing efforts of the broader investment industry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following information may have been impacted: dates of birth, phone numbers, annual income, social insurance numbers, government issued ID numbers, investment account numbers and account statements. CIRO does not collect account login detail, such as passwords, security questions and PINs and therefore that information was not at risk.</p>
<p>CIRO received this information in the normal course of carrying out its regulatory mandate to protect investors from improper investment conduct and practices, and through its investigative, compliance assessment and market regulation work.</p>
<p><em>Protecting Canadian Investors</em></p>
<p>CIRO quickly contained the incident and took immediate steps to secure our systems and protect the information in our care. We notified law enforcement and all relevant authorities, including privacy commissioners. A leading third-party forensic IT investigator was retained to determine what information was impacted.</p>
<p>CIRO launched a thorough investigation with the support of external cybersecurity experts. Our preliminary investigation revealed that registration information for member firms and registered individuals had been affected. We immediately shared those findings publicly and directly with our members and impacted registrants. At that time, we noted the investigation was ongoing, and we committed to sharing the final findings of the e-discovery process once the review was complete. After more than 9,000 hours of examination, we can now confirm the full extent of the incident.</p>
<p>There is currently no evidence that the information has been misused. We continue to monitor for malicious activity and have not identified any threat activity or exposure on the dark web.</p>
<p>As a precaution and in order to help detect possible misuse of information, CIRO is providing affected investors two-years of credit monitoring and identity theft protection with both of the major credit agencies. Step by step instructions detailing how to activate protection services will be communicated to those impacted, directly.</p>
<p><em>Additional Information</em></p>
<p>Only some clients or former clients of CIRO dealer members were impacted by the cybersecurity breach. Clients impacted by the cyber incident will be sent a notification letter by CIRO starting on January 14, 2026. If you did not receive a notification letter from CIRO but want to confirm whether you were impacted and should have received a notification letter, you can request this information from CIRO in writing using the contact form available in the cyber incident section of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ciro.ca/ciro-cybersecurity-incident" target="_self" title="CIRO cybersecurity incident">CIRO&rsquo;s website</a>&nbsp;(ciro.ca).</p>

<title>Regulations, The Supply Side, And Monetary Policy, Federal Reserve Governor Stephen I. Miran, At The Delphi Economic Forum, National Gallery – Alexandros Soutsos Museum, Athens, Greece</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/regulations-the-supply-side-and-monetary-policy-federal-reserve-governor-step-2026114/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Madame Ambassador, for the introduction and the opportunity to speak today. My topic is the implications of deregulation for monetary policy, an appropriate one for this setting.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;Greece's recovery from the crisis that began in 2009 was only possible after the Greek people implemented substantial and painful reforms, including alleviating suffocating over-regulation in many sectors. In addition to the other reforms embraced by Greece, deregulation freed businesses to compete domestically and internationally, and promoted individuals' access to the economy. The range of reforms has included liberalizing product and service markets, easing licensing and administrative burdens, opening previously restricted professions, and increasing labor market flexibility. The government liberalized electricity and gas utilities; privatized airports, ports, and utilities; and reformed bankruptcy procedures and other business laws.</p>
<p>While it is challenging to quantify how these deregulatory actions have affected the economy, there is little doubt that these reforms have supported a remarkable return to economic growth and higher living standards. Macroeconomic stability has returned to Greece. Unemployment has fallen to its lowest level since the Global Financial Crisis, and investment and exports have rebounded. Product and labor market reforms helped restore competitiveness, reduce unit labor costs, and encourage firm entry. By easing the ability of supply to respond to prices, these reforms have improved the transmission of monetary policy. While monetary policy is set by the ECB, its transmission varies in part with how national governments manage their economies. Long-term Greek borrowing rates narrowed their spread to Germany's, below 1 percent, compared with 6 percent a decade ago. Greece has a come a long way, impressing the whole world with its recovery.</p>
<p><span>Regulation and the Economy's Supply Side</span><br />For all the conversation around Mario Draghi's report,<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;Greece shows that well-targeted deregulatory reforms can help lay the foundation for more sustained and robust economic growth by expanding the productive capacity of the economy, known as the supply side. Such sustainable increases in actual and potential growth have different implications for monetary policy than purely cyclical growth spurts, which boost growth in the near term without raising economic potential. These jolts can create substantial inflation, undermining growth in the medium term by forcing central banks to raise interest rates, and also in the long term by causing a misallocation of resources.</p>
<p>Recent experiences have reinforced the need for central bankers to fully consider the broad range of nonmonetary factors that could affect the appropriate stance of monetary policy. One such factor that is especially important at this juncture is the regulatory burden borne by businesses and individuals, which has begun to recede in the past year.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;I believe that the sweeping deregulation underway in the United States will significantly boost competition, productivity, and potential growth, allowing faster economic growth without putting upward pressure on inflation. This would support continued easing of restrictive monetary policy, but ignoring these effects would result in monetary policy that is needlessly contractionary.</p>
<p>One challenge for central bankers in fully incorporating deregulation into their economic outlooks is that it is difficult to measure in aggregate. Economists are inclined to study things when there are quantitative data to illuminate their work&mdash;a version of the famous "lamppost problem" of only looking where the lamppost shines. This may have contributed to a tendency to give short shrift to regulation in judging the economic outlook. Quantitatively measuring regulations is more difficult than taxes, subsidies, or interest rates. Regulations that businesses face can vary enormously based on the sector, size, and sometimes even the age of a company. Some regulations ban activities altogether. Some regulations impose fixed or variable costs for complying. Some regulations affect consumption decisions and some affect production. Regulations can vary enormously across jurisdictions and sometimes within jurisdictions. Additionally, enforcement determines how binding regulations are in practice, and enforcement can be even harder to measure than the effects of regulations themselves.</p>
<p>These measurement challenges are evident in the abundance of economic studies on specific regulations but the much smaller volume of work that tries to comprehensively measure the aggregate effects of the accumulation of regulations on the macroeconomy.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;From the perspective of an individual firm, it may be easy to adjust behavior in response to one regulation, known as a "margin of adjustment," but compounding regulations can constrain the ability to shift costs by hitting multiple margins of adjustment.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;One pebble doesn't stop a stream, water can flow around it; but enough pebbles will.</p>
<p>A common approach to quantifying the effects of regulations is to count the number of pages of new regulations, though this does not account for varying economic significance across pages. Another approach is to count the number of work hours required to comply, as reported under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA). However, there is wide variation in how different regulatory agencies produce these costs estimates, even sometimes variation within agencies, and more importantly, the counting of work hours related to the PRA does not capture the full opportunity cost of the regulations&mdash;that is, how that lost hour of work could have been used more productively&mdash;or the firms and industries that don't exist because of the regulation.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;If a firm needs to hire a person to comply with some new regulation and can't hire a sales associate who could generate new business or can't engage in a productive activity at all, then the foregone opportunity can be significantly larger than the wage for compliance hours.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a></p>
<p>There has been some progress in measuring regulation through advances in natural language processing and artificial intelligence, and I expect more of this to come. For instance, Patrick McLaughlin's QuantGov project at Stanford University's Hoover Institution uses computational tools to move beyond regulation page counts toward counting restrictions and obligations imposed by the text and quantifying regulations by industry.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a>&nbsp;In other work, Joseph Kalmenovitz uses machine learning methods to count and separate regulations that are relevant for a firm's core businesses from those that are not relevant.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;These measures show a substantial drop in the number of rules in 2025.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a></p>
<p>Among other deregulatory efforts is the current U.S. Administration's "one-in-ten-out policy" revoking 10 old regulations for every new one adopted.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a>&nbsp;Based on the pace of the Administration's deregulatory efforts in the first part of 2025, I estimate that 30 percent of the regulatory restrictions in the Code of Federal Regulations will be eliminated by 2030, though this may prove an underestimate.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a></p>
<p>Regulations can have far larger consequences for the supply side than, for example, taxes, because they can amount to outright prohibitions and thus function as infinite taxes. Quantity controls are usually far more damaging than those that directly affect prices.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a>&nbsp;Consider agglomeration, when a group of firms in the same general industry benefit from proximity, such as R&amp;D labs and production plants, or clients and customers. An auto parts producer benefits from being close to an automaker.</p>
<p>Environmental or other restrictions that restrict co-location can affect the entire economy's supply side by preventing the agglomeration necessary for an industry to be profitable. Take one piece of an industrial ecosystem away because of a regulation and the rest become harder to sustain. Supply chain ecosystems exist&mdash;or don't&mdash;because of regulations determining what activity can take place and where. I think it is hard to argue that, say, the excess burden of going from a 30 percent to a 33 percent marginal tax rate has the same effect as a regulation preventing an entire industry from existing domestically. Regulations, particularly those that affect physical production, can force the economy from high-productivity sectors to low-productivity sectors by encouraging capital-intensive production to move to less regulated places, such as China.</p>
<p>Research on the effects of regulation on the supply side of the economy has developed along two major lines of inquiry. The first studies regulation's effect on total factor productivity (TFP) and growth by making production more expensive.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn14" title="footnote 14"><span>14</span></a><a name="f14"></a>&nbsp;If regulations make, say, electricity or manufactured goods more expensive to produce, they lower TFP.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn15" title="footnote 15"><span>15</span></a><a name="f15"></a>&nbsp;Regulations can also distort investment decisions across sectors or impede innovation, leading to an economy-wide misallocation of resources with commensurate effects on aggregate productivity levels.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn16" title="footnote 16"><span>16</span></a><a name="f16"></a></p>
<p>An alternative way of modeling regulation is via its effects on free entry and markups. Regulatory costs that appear marginal from an industry perspective often originate as fixed costs from a firm perspective. An existing homebuilder building one more house may be marginal, but for a new entrant to build it, they would have to invest in vast compliance infrastructure. In many jurisdictions, they'd have to learn how to measure carbon emissions, decipher labor regulations, pass various inspections at different stages, and pay other fixed costs. The barriers to building a house have become so burdensome that many builders exit entire markets, leaving numerous large metro areas without desperately needed supply. As such, regulations often serve as barriers to entry, with all the attendant consequences: reduced competition, artificially high returns to scale, higher markups, reduced innovation, and reduced productivity growth. Let's call these "markup regulations."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn17" title="footnote 17"><span>17</span></a><a name="f17"></a></p>
<p>There is abundant evidence both within and across countries that increased regulation causes reduced firm entry, decreased competition, and lower investment, all consistent with elevated fixed costs.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn18" title="footnote 18"><span>18</span></a><a name="f18"></a>&nbsp;Decreased firm entry, competition, and innovation lead to a malaise familiar to many: Formerly dynamic industries calcify, flagship businesses choose to move elsewhere or shutter completely, and communities feel cheated out of their way of life.</p>
<p><span>Implications for Monetary Policy</span><br />Now let me discuss the implications of regulation and deregulation for monetary policy. Most theory and research suggest that increasing the regulatory burden reduces productivity and thus puts upward pressure on prices. This is intuitive: Regulations impede production, and deregulation removes those impediments. More production means lower prices, and vice versa. But gauging the magnitudes of these effects is more difficult.</p>
<p>Work by Dustin Chambers, Courtney A. Collins, and Alan Krause found that a 1 percent increase in U.S. federal regulations in a particular industry is associated with a roughly 10 basis point increase in consumer prices in that industry, and that is only in the near term.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn19" title="footnote 19"><span>19</span></a><a name="f19"></a>&nbsp;Longer-term effects and effects from more substantial changes in regulations are, in my view, likely to be substantially larger, since firm entry and the effects of increased competition develop over time. Supply chain ecosystems can take years to rise or fall. I'd also expect cross-industry spillovers to boost aggregate effects above this level. But even these modest within-industry, short-term effects would be substantial in the context of the potential 30 percent decline in the regulatory code that I projected earlier. This implies a cumulative drag of roughly 3 percent on the consumer price level through 2030, a little over half a percent per year.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn20" title="footnote 20"><span>20</span></a><a name="f20"></a></p>
<p>What happens in the short term depends on various factors&mdash;the types of regulations involved, the way these regulations affect firms and households, and the manner of enforcement. On balance, I believe the substantial deregulation that has occurred in 2025 will continue over at least the next three years and be a large positive shock to productivity that will put downward pressure on prices. On net, this supports a more accommodative stance of monetary policy.</p>
<p>As I have argued, I think the primary effects of deregulation are on the supply side of the economy and have the effect of increasing potential output more than they increase actual output. For example, if the number of goods I can produce is effectively limited by regulation, and that cap is removed, this means I can produce more. If demand increases and production is limited by regulation or some other factor, then prices increase. If demand rises and these shackles have been removed, then output grows and pressure on prices is much smaller.</p>
<p>While I think of regulation as primarily a supply-side factor, it can also affect demand. For instance, the news of planned deregulatory action can stimulate investment now for future production, increasing aggregate demand and prices in the short run, before prices adjust to the lower level that would prevail over the longer run. However, I see little reason to expect the short-run effect on demand will exceed potential. In my earlier speech, I assumed that deregulation immediately increases actual output half as much as potential output, and then the two converge over a few years. While some approaches assume TFP shocks increase actual and potential output by the same amount, work by Olivier Coibion, Yuriy Gorodnichenko, and Mauricio Ulate shows that a structural approach to modeling the supply-side results in potential output overshooting actual output in response to a TFP shock.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn21" title="footnote 21"><span>21</span></a><a name="f21"></a></p>
<p>Of course, this matters because the output gap is a primary input into calculating the appropriate setting for monetary policy. If actual output falls below potential output, there is slack in the economy that could be accommodated by looser monetary policy. If deregulation boosts potential output above actual, the correct response is to cut rates. At the same time, by increasing the marginal product of capital, deregulation may raise the so-called neutral rate of interest at which monetary policy is neither accommodative nor restrictive. I addressed this in my first speech as a member of the Federal Reserve Board.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn22" title="footnote 22"><span>22</span></a><a name="f22"></a></p>
<p>Turning to markups, the second channel for the effects of regulation on the supply side, models indicate that if monetary policy ignores the deflationary effects of deregulation, then we risk causing an unnecessary contraction in the economy. That is the implication of an important 2014 paper by Gauti Eggertsson, Andrea Ferrero, and Andrea Raffo, which models deregulation as a reduction in markups&mdash;increased competition&mdash;in a standard New Keynesian model.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn23" title="footnote 23"><span>23</span></a><a name="f23"></a>&nbsp;They find that the appropriate response of monetary policy is to reduce interest rates in response to this type of deregulation shock and offset its consequent deflation. If for some reason monetary policy fails to do so, then deflation and economic contraction needlessly result. This model implies that, if the Federal Reserve fails to reduce policy rates in response to deregulation, there will be adverse consequences. Greece's experience testifies to this. Had the ECB not implemented exceptionally loose monetary policy and effectively accommodated Greece's structural reforms, the outcome could have been quite different.</p>
<p>I believe that central bankers should be paying close attention to the effects of regulation on productivity, output, and prices. In recent quarters, policy has been tighter than it should have been to reflect significant deregulation lifting potential growth and reducing inflation. Going forward, I expect that the ambitious deregulation underway in the United States will boost growth without boosting inflation and be one factor supporting a further easing of monetary policy. In this regard, Greece and the ECB have lit the path. I have raised this point with my Federal Open Market Committee colleagues and expect to continue to do so in our deliberations.</p>

<p><a name="fn1"></a>1. The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee. I am deeply indebted to Casey Mulligan for many conversations about the economics of regulation, but again, the ideas here reflect only my own views.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="fn3"></a>3. In this speech, I am focusing on general economic regulations, not regulations on the banking sector, which are implemented by the Federal Reserve in conjunction with other regulatory agencies. For more on banking regulations, see Stephen I. Miran (2025),&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20251119a.htm">"Regulatory Dominance of the Federal Reserve Balance Sheet,"</a>&nbsp;speech delivered at the Bank Policy Institute and Small Business &amp; Entrepreneurship Council, Washington, November 19.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn4"></a>4. For example, lots of papers show very clear implications for productivity and "dynamism" of regulations that inhibit labor adjustment (see Steven J. Davis and John Haltiwanger (2014), "Labor Market Fluidity and Economic Performance," paper presented at "Re-Evaluating Labor Market Dynamics," a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, held in Jackson Hole, Wyo., August 22; and David H. Autor, William R. Kerr, and Adriana D. Kugler (2007), "Does Employment Protection Reduce Productivity? Evidence from US States,"&nbsp;<em>The Economic Journal</em>, vol. 117 (June), pp. F189&ndash;217). For a theory approach, Hopenhayn and Rogerson (1993) is a classic&mdash;a tax on firing is a tax on hiring (see Hugo Hopenhayn and Richard Rogerson (1993), "Job Turnover and Policy Evaluation: A General Equilibrium Analysis,"&nbsp;<em>Journal of Political Economy</em>, vol. 101 (5). For land use regulation literature, see Leonardo D'Amico, Edward L. Glaeser, Joseph Gyourko, William R. Kerr, and Giacomo A.M. Ponzetto (2024),&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w33188">"Why Has Construction Productivity Stagnated? The Role of Land-Use Regulation,"</a>&nbsp;NBER Working Paper Series 33188 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, November).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn5"></a>5. For example, a regulation that raises input costs might incent a firm to cut costs by reducing headcount, but the firm may find that response problematic as well because of other regulations.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn6"></a>6. For instance, the Small Business Administration and General Services Administration measure PRA paperwork burdens in dollars, whereas other agencies like FinCEN and parts of the Department of Agriculture measure these burdens in hours. Variation within agencies is usually across units, like the Food and Drug Administration relative to the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services within the Department of Health and Human Services.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn7"></a>7. Standard economics would suggest that, if the compliance associate is seen as a fixed cost but a new salesperson is seen as a variable cost, the optimality condition would ignore the fixed cost and have the firm hire the sales associate anyway. This is well and good for large firms that generate abundant cashflow or have easy access to liquidity, but many smaller firms face more binding cashflow and liquidity constraints and will be unable to hire that salesperson. Moreover, even for large firms, the compliance associate may be a variable cost for expanding an existing line of business, or he or she may be a fixed cost that impedes the firm's expansion into a new line of business or market. See the discussion that follows of "markup regulations" and competition.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="fn12"></a>12. McLaughlin (2025) estimates 2,404 deregulatory actions from the Spring 2025 Unified Agenda of Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions. If the average deregulatory action removes 25.6 restrictions from the CFR, which was the average through July 1 of this year, then 61,542 restrictions will be removed per year. Five years at this rate will remove 28 percent of a total of 1.1 million restrictions. I rounded up to 30 percent because I expect the pace of deregulation to accelerate with the accelerated pace of Senate confirmations due to the Senate's recent adoption of&nbsp;<em>en bloc</em>&nbsp;confirmation; with more personnel, deregulation will be much quicker than it was in the first few months of a fresh administration. Indeed, I think 30 percent will ultimately prove to be an underestimate. As McLaughlin notes, we will soon get the Fall 2025 Unified Agenda, which will allow me to update this calculation. I used McLaughlin's analysis rather than Kalmenovitz's for this exercise because, as of January 5, Kalmenovitz's measure showed a nearly 25 percent reduction in overall federal regulatory burden over the course of 2025, and as optimistic as I am regarding the coming deregulatory trend, that magnitude seems aggressive to me at present. Moreover, Kalmenovitz's measure is prone to revision. See Patrick McLaughlin (2025), "Early Data on Deregulatory Push in Washington," Third Order, October 28, https://thirdorder.substack.com/p/early-data-on-the-deregulatory-push.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="fn14"></a>14. The effects of regulation on TFP were one point I made in my first speech as a Federal Reserve Board member; see Stephen I. Miran (2025)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20250922a.htm">"Nonmonetary Forces and Appropriate Monetary Policy,"</a>&nbsp;speech delivered at the Economic Club of New York, New York, September 22.&nbsp;</p>

Seater (2013), "Federal Regulation and Aggregate Economic Growth,"&nbsp;<em>Journal of Economic Growth</em>, vol. 18 (June), pp. 137&ndash;77.

<p><a name="fn17"></a>17. Of course, antitrust regulations are designed to increase and not decrease competition; but these are a small portion of the overall regulatory code, and I am focused here on regulations outside of antitrust.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="fn20"></a>20. Of course, this predicted decline is relative to what consumer prices would have done in the absence of the deregulatory actions and not a prediction about an absolute change.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn21"></a>21. See Olivier Coibion, Yuriy Gorodnichenko, and Mauricio Ulate (2018),&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Coibion-et-al_final-draft.pdf">"The Cyclical Sensitivity in Estimates of Potential Output," (PDF)</a>&nbsp;Brookings Paper on Econonomic Activity, Fall, pp. 343&ndash;441. Coibion et al. show that in a Blanchard-Quah (BQ) approach to estimating potential output, TFP shocks increase potential output much more rapidly than actual output (figure 12). The BQ approach relies on the uncontroversial theoretical assumption that supply-side shocks affecting potential output are those which have permanent effects on the level of output while demand shocks are restricted to having no permanent effects. It provides a more structural economic grounding for estimating potential output than various filter-based approaches.</p>
<p>The case for actual and potential output moving up the same amount in response to a TFP shock seems more plausible if the TFP shock is driven by a new technology, which requires investment to implement. But not all TFP shocks are the same, and regulations are quite different. If today a regulation limits the amount of carbon a factory can emit, but tomorrow the factory can emit more carbon, it does not require the same amount of new investment as would be required to, say, implement new computer technologies. Letting an existing smokestack run for 24 instead of 8 hours is quite different from having to buy graphical processing units to develop a large language model. In other words, it may be appropriate to consider regulatory TFP shocks as having different consequences for output gaps than technological TFP shocks have. See also Boivin, Kiley, and Mishkin (2011), who observe that the response of actual output to a TFP shock depends crucially on the monetary response, underlining that it is crucial for the Fed to stay abreast of TFP shocks in formulating the appropriate stance of policy (Jean Boivin, Michael Kiley, and Frederic Mishkin (2011), "How Has the Monetary Transmission Mechanism Evolved Over Time?" in Benjmain M. Friedman and Michael Woodford, eds.,&nbsp;<em>Handbook of Monetary Economics, Vol. 3</em>. (Amsterdam: Elsevier), pp. 369&ndash;422).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn22"></a>22. In that speech, I included a boost to neutral rates from deregulation (which was offset by reductions in neutral rates from other sources like reduced population growth and smaller fiscal deficits). I also included a wider output gap because of potential growth increasing faster than actual growth as a result of deregulation. In that speech, I did&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;model an explicit deregulation-driven reduction in prices, either from a TFP boost or a reduction in markups, an oversight partially addressed here.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="text-align-justify"><span>The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor, published today a&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2026-01/ESMA36-429234738_-165_Thematic_notes_on_sustainability-related_claims-_ESG_strategies.pdf">second thematic note</a><span>&nbsp;on sustainability-related claims, focusing on ESG strategies.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>The note concentrates on ESG integration and ESG exclusions, as references to these strategies are often made by market participants and widely referenced in marketing communications directed to retail investors.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>ESG integration and ESG exclusions can mean different things to different market participants. Lack of transparency when using these terms poses a notable greenwashing risk to investors. The aim of the note is not to define these strategies, but to call on market participants to be clear about what they mean when referencing them.</span></p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>Similarly to the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-promotes-clarity-sustainability-related-communications">first thematic note on ESG credentials</a><span>, this publication offers practical do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;ts for making sustainability claims. These are illustrated through concrete examples of good and poor practices that are based on observed market practices.</span></p>

<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>The European Supervisory Authorities (EBA, EIOPA and ESMA &ndash; the ESAs) have today signed a&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2026-01/MoU_DORA_oversight_ICT_CTPPs__EU-UK.pdf">Memorandum of Understanding</a><span>&nbsp;(MoU) with the Bank of England (BoE), the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). This agreement enhances the cooperation between the authorities to oversee critical ICT third-party service providers (CTPPs) as required by the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA).</span></p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>The MoU establishes clear principles and procedures for cooperation, information sharing and coordination of oversight activities between the relevant authorities responsible for EU CTPPs/UK CTPs oversight. The&nbsp;MoU aims at enhancing third-party risk management and contributing to the overall operational resilience of the financial sector in the EU and UK through strong cross-border cooperation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span><span>​​Legal basis and background</span></span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>The MoU has been prepared in accordance with DORA Articles 36, 44, and 49, which cover the ESAs&rsquo; oversight powers, international cooperation, and financial cross-sector exercises, communication and cooperation.</span></p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>​To exchange information with a third-country authority, the ESAs must ensure that the confidentiality and professional secrecy regime in the third country is equivalent to that in the EU. Therefore, before signing this MoU, the ESAs conducted an assessment that confirmed the UK confidentiality and professional secrecy regime&rsquo;s equivalence with that in DORA.</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p dir="LTR">TASE publishes today the list of companies that entered the &ldquo;TASE 100 Club&rdquo;, which includes companies with a market cap exceeding NIS 200 million, that have achieved a share yield of at least 100% in 2025. For the third consecutive year, TASE publishes the &ldquo;TASE 100 Club&rdquo; constituents, this as part of its efforts to improve the public&rsquo;s acquaintance with the TASE-listed companies.</p>
<p dir="LTR">According to TASE&rsquo;s Research Unit, 45 companies achieved a yield of more than 100% in 2025, as compared to only 35 companies in 2024. The highest share yield in 2025 was achieved by Aryt Industries, operating in the defense-military sector, with a price gain of more than 400%. Investment houses, More and Meitav, achieved a yield of 300%, and an additional eight companies achieved a yield in excess of 200%.</p>
<p dir="LTR">Out of the 45 companies included in the &ldquo;TASE 100 Club&rdquo;, 20 companies were awarded 5 stars, having achieved a positive yield in each of the past three years, as compared to only five companies awarded the 5-star top rating in 2024.</p>
<p dir="LTR">25 companies were awarded four starts, having achieved a cumulative positive yield over the past 3 years, as compared to 23 companies in 2024.</p>
<p dir="LTR">The 2025 list includes many major companies, including 29 companies with a market cap in excess of NIS 2 billion. The list comprises 24 companies included in the TA-125 index, as compared to 10 companies in 2024.</p>
<p dir="LTR">The list contains companies from a wide range of sectors, the most prominent</p>
<ul>
<li><span>14 technology sector companies, including 6 defense companies.</span></li>
<li>8 insurance companies.</li>
<li>6 financial services companies.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="LTR">Despite multiple challenges over the past year, the companies exhibited business resilience that was also reflected in the capital market. TASE's leading indices recorded outstanding yields compared to leading global indices: the TA-35 index increased by 51.6% and the TA-90 index increased by 46.6%.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Rating System of the &ldquo;TASE 100 Club&rdquo;</h4>
<p dir="LTR">The TASE staff applies a star system (3-5 stars) to rate the companies that achieved a yield exceeding 100% in 2025, which awards 5 stars to companies that achieved a positive yield in each of the past 3 years, 4 stars to companies that achieved a cumulative positive yield over the past 3 years, and 3 stars to other club members with a yield of more than 100% in the past year.</p>
<p dir="LTR">During the month of January, TASE will host the management of the &ldquo;TASE 100 Club&rdquo; constituents in a special Opening Bell Ceremony.&nbsp;</p>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/clearbid-global-markets-selects-archax-as-partner-for-uk-and-eu-expansion-exte-2026114/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ClearBid Global Markets (CBGM) today announced it has selected Archax as its regulated digital asset partner to expand the reach of its cross-border digital bond trading and data platform into the UK and EU regions.</p>
<p>CBGM is a full-service electronic trading platform and complete securities and data source, that effectively connects global bond markets utilising a digital Dutch Auction. This results in real-time, transparent and market-driven price discovery. It is an innovative substitute for traditional &lsquo;over the counter&rsquo; (OTC) methods, with a direct focus on capital markets-based financing for infrastructure, corporate and asset-backed borrowers.</p>
<p>Archax is a regulated digital asset exchange, broker and custodian, based in the UK, EU, US and UAE. Targeted at professionals and institutions, Archax supports all types of digital assets &ndash; from unregulated cryptocurrencies through to regulated tokenised real-world assets (RWAs).</p>
<p>By selecting Archax as a strategic partner for cross-border expansion, CBGM will initially leverage Archax&rsquo;s FCA regulations in the UK to offer its digital bond pre-issuance, trading and data platform to investors based there. Moving forwards, CBGM then plans to do the same in the EU region by leveraging Archax&rsquo;s permissions there too.</p>
<p><span>Robert Novembre, Founder and CEO of ClearBid Global Markets, comments:&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Our partnership with Archax marks a significant milestone for CBGM as we expand into the UK and advance our global mission to redefine capital markets. By combining our vision for transparent, data‑driven markets with Archax&rsquo;s fully regulated digital infrastructure, we are delivering institutional clients unprecedented visibility and liquidity across global bond markets. This collaboration empowers market participants to navigate complex environments through a single, seamless digital gateway&rdquo;.<span>&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p><span>Nick Donovan, Chief Revenue Officer of Archax, adds:</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Archax is all about being the most credible, institutional and regulated, digital asset solution in the marketplace. We are always on the look-out for potential partners who can leverage our regulatory stack and together expand our digital offerings in the space. As such, we are excited to be working with ClearBid Global Markets with their innovative digital approach for providing access to bonds for capital markets participants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>CBGM&rsquo;s digital bond marketplace is designed to revolutionise how capital is raised and invested by addressing the current market&rsquo;s lack of transparency due to manual, antiquated pricing processes, as well as the lack of efficient accessibility and connectivity between markets, which limits global capital flows and growth for emerging markets.</p>

<title>UK And EU Regulators Sign Memorandum Of Understanding To Strengthen Oversight Of Critical Third Parties</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The FCA, Bank of England and Prudential Regulation Authority have together signed a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/mou/mou-fca-boe-pra-esa-critical-third-parties.pdf" title="mou-fca-boe-pra-esa-critical-third-parties.pdf">Memorandum of Understanding</a>&nbsp;(MoU) with the European Supervisory Authorities to enhance cooperation and oversight of critical third parties (CTPs) that fall under the UK&rsquo;s CTP regime.</p>
<p>The MoU establishes a framework for coordinating and sharing information on the oversight of CTPs under the UK regime and critical third party providers (CTPPs) under the EU&rsquo;s Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), including during incidents such as power outages or cyber-attacks.</p>
<p>The MoU aims to manage potential risks to financial stability and market confidence, as well as strengthen international cooperation. It will also help reduce duplication and regulatory burden on CTPs and CTPPs.</p>
<p>The UK&rsquo;s CTP regime complements similar international standards and is designed to be compatible with DORA. The agreement demonstrates UK regulators&rsquo; commitment to cross-border cooperation and strengthening operational resilience to support growth and promote market stability.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ul>
<li>In 2024, UK regulators introduced&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/policy-statements/ps24-16-operational-resilience-critical-third-parties-uk-financial-sector" title="PS24/16: Operational resilience: Critical third parties to the UK financial sector">new rules</a>&nbsp;to bolster the resilience of critical third parties providing key services to the financial sector.</li>
<li>These rules came into effect on 1 January 2025 and apply once a CTP is designated by the Treasury.</li>
<li>The Treasury is responsible for deciding which third party service providers should fall under the new CTP regime. The rules will require designated CTPs to provide regular assurance, undertake resilience testing and report major incidents.</li>
<li>The designation process has begun and the regulators will continue to work with the Treasury throughout the designation process.</li>
<li>The regime does not reduce the responsibility of financial firms and Financial Market Infrastructures (FMIs) to manage their own operational resilience and third-party risks in line with existing outsourcing rules.</li>
</ul>

<title>The WFE Calls On Regulators To Balance Quantum Computing Risks Against More Immediate Operational Challenges</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The World Federation of Exchanges (&ldquo;WFE&rdquo;), the global industry association for exchange groups and CCPs, has warned of a substantial gap between regulatory expectations and industry expectations around quantum computing risk preparedness.</span><br /><br /><span>Major public authorities, standards bodies, and cross-border policy groups have begun issuing guidance, calling for early preparation and coordinated migration to post-quantum cryptography (PQC). This is driven by two core concerns:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Long lead times required to upgrade cryptographic systems; and&nbsp;</li>
<li>The &ldquo;harvest now, decrypt later&rdquo; threat where attackers steal encrypted data today to unlock it in future once more powerful technologies become available to break the encryption.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /><span>The WFE Global Cybersecurity Working Group recently conducted a preliminary survey on the Quantum Computing Preparedness, the results of which highlight the importance of other competing priorities. In particular, Generative AI risks are viewed as far more urgent and immediate, consuming most organisational attention and investment. Quantum Computing is seen as a longer-term threat, with many firms hesitant to commit too many resources until clearer timelines or stable standards emerge.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>Most WFE members estimate a 5&ndash;10+ year window before cryptographically relevant quantum computers (CRQCs) emerge, in line with NIST FAQs. Consequently, resourcing remains proportionate to a long-term risk, not an imminent one, and shouldn&rsquo;t be prioritised at the expense of more immediate operational concerns such as AI-driven threats and Cyber Resiliency. This is consistent with the WFE&rsquo;s&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://world-exchanges.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=48ddcbc11eb58f141a51219ea&amp;id=a28a86432b&amp;e=979576350c" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">2025 Annual Survey of Risks</a><span>&nbsp;where AI and Cyber Resilience risks continued to be ranked highest by members, as they have consistently for two years. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>Although members do not consider Quantum Computing risk to be imminent, they have already begun laying the necessary groundwork for future preparedness, including:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Actively monitoring regulatory guidance, vendor progress, and developments in NIST standardisation. Several are incorporating Quantum Computing discussions into risk committees and cyber governance forums.</li>
<li>Preliminary quantum risk assessments.</li>
<li>Including quantum-safe encryption criteria in procurement and vendor evaluation cycles.</li>
<li>Considering projects to map existing cryptographic assets, as the first step in any migration roadmap.</li>
<li>Working with the WFE to develop a best-practice guide on quantum transition, and a structured roadmap for market infrastructures.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /><strong>Nandini Sukumar, CEO of the World Federation of Exchanges</strong><span>, said, &ldquo;While Quantum Computing readiness is undoubtedly important, the migration to post-quantum cryptography remains a long-term undertaking, and the practical groundwork - planning, asset mapping, and vendor coordination - should be paced appropriately. Whilst exchanges recognise that Quantum Computing is a meaningful risk, regulators must understand that preparation should not deflect from more imminent risks related to AI and Cyber Resilience.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span>Read the full paper&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://world-exchanges.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=48ddcbc11eb58f141a51219ea&amp;id=81015be5c0&amp;e=979576350c" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a><span>.</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The inaugural edition of Dubai&nbsp;Future Finance Week (DFFW) will take place from 11 to 15 May 2026, convening&nbsp;international leaders from the finance, policy, technology and investment sectors through a&nbsp;coordinated programme of high-level forums held across the emirate. As global financial&nbsp;markets undergo accelerated structural change, the Week will provide a strategic platform&nbsp;for dialogue, collaboration and the exchange of insights on the future of the global financial&nbsp;ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organised under the directives and patronage of&nbsp;<span>His Highness Sheikh Maktoum bin&nbsp;Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, First Deputy Ruler of Dubai, Deputy Prime Minister&nbsp;and Minister of Finance of the UAE, and President of the Dubai International Financial&nbsp;Centre (DIFC)</span>, the Week underscores Dubai&rsquo;s role in advancing dialogue on the evolving&nbsp;dynamics of capital markets, innovation, sustainability and governance.</p>
<p>His Highness Sheikh Maktoum bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum said the event reflects&nbsp;Dubai&rsquo;s commitment to playing a key role in shaping a smart and sustainable global economy.&nbsp;The participation of leading decision-makers, thinkers and innovators from the financial&nbsp;services sector in the event provides an important opportunity to bring perspectives closer together, align efforts to address shared global challenges, and support dialogue on the future&nbsp;of the global financial sector, His Highness said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>HH Sheikh Maktoum added that the event also opens new avenues for cooperation and&nbsp;supports innovation. He noted that the gathering encourages effective participation that&nbsp;enables markets to achieve greater growth and prosperity, while supporting the objectives of&nbsp;the Dubai Economic Agenda D33, particularly positioning Dubai among the world&rsquo;s top four&nbsp;global financial centres and building a smart, diversified economy that keeps pace with future&nbsp;requirements.</p>
<p>Designed as an integrated, citywide platform and led by DIFC, Dubai Future Finance Week&nbsp;brings together several major industry forums under a single, cohesive agenda, themed&nbsp;&lsquo;Finance Reimagined: Where innovation meets policy and purpose&rsquo;. At its core is the Dubai&nbsp;FinTech Summit (DFS) with the theme of Connecting Markets &ndash; Transforming Economies,&nbsp;held under the patronage of His Highness Sheikh Maktoum bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al&nbsp;Maktoum, which serves as the Week&rsquo;s main event, shaping its momentum and convening&nbsp;global leaders to advance dialogue on the future of finance.</p>
<p>Over five days, venues across Dubai will host discussions spanning the full spectrum of&nbsp;modern finance, from capital markets, private wealth and institutional investment to digital&nbsp;assets and sustainability-led finance. Each event within the programme explores a distinct&nbsp;area of financial transformation, enabling participants to engage directly with global&nbsp;institutions, industry leaders and policymakers through a set of complementary forums.&nbsp;Together, they provide a structured environment for cross-sector insight and practical&nbsp;engagement on emerging areas of opportunity.<br /><br />By situating these discussions within a single, coordinated week, Dubai Future Financial Week&nbsp;will enable participants to connect themes that are often addressed in isolation. This&nbsp;integrated approach will allow attendees to examine how developments in one area influence&nbsp;progress in another and engage on priorities that cut across traditional boundaries.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>His Excellency Essa Kazim, Governor of DIFC</span>, said: &ldquo;Dubai&rsquo;s vision is to shape the global economy, and Dubai Future Finance Week is a natural extension of that ambition. It highlights the emirate&rsquo;s role as a catalyst for ideas, collaboration and forward-looking growth across international markets, and it underscores our determination here at DIFC to help set the pace for global financial and economic progress. The Week will strengthen this position by enabling engagement across finance, technology, regulation and investment, in support of the ambitions set out under the Dubai Economic Agenda D33.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>His Excellency Arif Amiri, Chief Executive Officer of DIFC Authority,</span>&nbsp;said: &ldquo;Dubai Future&nbsp;Finance Week reflects our commitment to providing platforms that bring the global financial&nbsp;community together to navigate change and identify new opportunities. As the region&rsquo;s&nbsp;leading global financial centre, DIFC is well positioned to offer a unified and focused&nbsp;environment for senior decision-makers to engage on priority issues. As global markets&nbsp;continue to evolve, Dubai plays a key role in shaping the future of finance through the depth&nbsp;of its ecosystem and its international connectivity.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Programme highlights</span><br />A central pillar of the programme, the Dubai FinTech Summit will return to Madinat Jumeirah&nbsp;with an expanded format designed to accelerate global collaboration and growth&nbsp;opportunities for FinTechs, scale-ups and investors. The summit will convene more than&nbsp;10,000 delegates from over 150 countries, alongside more than 1,000 investors, and over 300&nbsp;regional and international speakers, and over 250 sponsors, spanning over more than 25&nbsp;industry verticals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 2026 edition will feature a dedicated Investors&rsquo; Lounge and Deal Hub, new country&nbsp;pavilions to enhance cross-border partnerships, and curated content streams examining&nbsp;emerging trends in digital finance, AI-driven technologies and regulatory innovation. These&nbsp;developments build on the Summit&rsquo;s continued momentum and its contribution to the region&rsquo;s&nbsp;financial innovation landscape, supported by DIFC&rsquo;s ongoing growth as a global hub for&nbsp;financial innovation.</p>
<p>The Week will feature platforms that examine the systems and standards underpinning the&nbsp;future of financial services. Seamless FinTech Middle East will feature discussions on digital&nbsp;commerce, payments and financial infrastructure, while the Reg3 Forum will bring together&nbsp;regulators, policymakers and market participants to explore supervisory innovation and the&nbsp;evolution of cross-border regulatory frameworks. Together, these forums provide a&nbsp;foundation for addressing how global financial systems can remain connected, efficient and&nbsp;forward-looking.</p>
<p>There will also be leading gatherings focused on long-term capital allocation and sustainable&nbsp;economic growth. The DIFC Family Wealth Centre Summit will examine the priorities of family&nbsp;enterprises and the expanding role of private markets, while the Future Sustainability Forum&nbsp;will explore the growing importance of sustainability-led finance and climate-aligned&nbsp;investment. In parallel, the Islamic Finance Forum will highlight developments across Sharia-aligned markets, reflecting Dubai&rsquo;s established role as a global centre for Islamic finance.<br /><br />Additional platforms within the programme will provide perspective on wider sector&nbsp;performance, emerging economic models and venture activity across the region. Highlights&nbsp;include the MENA Banking Excellence Awards, which recognise transformation within the&nbsp;banking sector; the Solana Economic Zone, offering insights into decentralised technologies&nbsp;and digital economic models; IPEM Future Dubai, convening private-market leaders to assess&nbsp;capital flows and investment trends; and the Dubai Future District Fund annual meeting,&nbsp;showcasing developments from the emirate&rsquo;s venture and innovation ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Collectively, the programme represents the broadest and most comprehensive gathering of&nbsp;finance and future-focused events in the region, offering institutions, innovators and&nbsp;policymakers a single platform through which to engage on shared priorities, explore new&nbsp;areas of opportunity and contribute to the sector&rsquo;s long-term development.<br /><br />Organisations and partners wishing to participate in the Week or contribute to its wider&nbsp;programme can register at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.difc.com/whats-on/news/www.dubaifuturefinanceweek.com">www.dubaifuturefinanceweek.com</a>.</p>
