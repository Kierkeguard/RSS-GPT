<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>Scope Prime &ndash; the award-winning institutional liquidity brand of Rostro Group &ndash; has today announced the launch of its Futures &amp; Options (F&amp;O) offering. Providing professional market participants with transparent pricing and execution, the service delivers direct access to on-exchange liquidity across multiple global exchanges, including the CME, Eurex, ICE, and CBOT.</p>
<p><b>Saul Knapp, Managing Director, Futures &amp; Options at Rostro Group, commented</b>:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know market participants are becoming more sensitive to execution quality, pricing transparency and counterparty risk management. Our Futures &amp; Options offering complements our established OTC suite by providing direct market access to regulated, on-exchange liquidity &ndash; offering an alternative to traditional broker-delivered OTC execution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trading on-exchange products significantly reduces the counterparty risk for those institutional clients placing larger orders, whilst also delivering material economic benefits. As Futures &amp; Options remove the overnight financing associated with CFD trading, total execution costs are instead determined by transparent exchange fees and commission structures.</p>
<p><b>Saul Knapp, added:</b></p>
<p>&ldquo;Exchange-traded liquidity has always been transparent and resilient by design. Our role is to make it accessible, commercially viable, and operationally practical for professional clients by providing access to level 2 pricing, connecting our clients directly to the central limit order book and, as a result, ensuring our clients have their orders filled at the best available price on the market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To ensure seamless integration for broker-dealers, asset managers and hedge funds, Scope Prime has deployed an infrastructure that delivers access to metals, indices, soft commodities, and treasuries via trading platforms MT5, CQG, and Trading Technologies (TT).</p>
<p>The F&amp;O launch will be supported by ongoing thought leadership, educational content, and live demonstrations, with Scope Prime showcasing the offering at <b>iFX Expo Dubai</b> from 10th -12th February, 2026.</p>
<p><i>Disclaimer: Product availability may vary across Scope Prime branded entities. </i></p>

<title>SET Market Report For January 2026</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>The Thai stock market started&nbsp;the year on&nbsp;solid&nbsp;footing, rising 5.2 percent from the end of 2025 to close at 1,325.62 points at the end of January 2026, underpinned by both domestic and international factors. Foreign capital inflows returned with net buying for the second consecutive month, while value stocks regained investor interest amid global market volatility. Looking at the broader picture, AI advancements and government stimulus policies are expected to propel global economic growth in 2026. However, stretched valuations of U.S. technology stocks, coupled with geopolitical tensions and concerns about diminishing Federal Reserve (Fed) independence, prompted capital migration from the U.S. to other regions.</p>
<p><b>SET Senior Executive Vice President Soraphol Tulayasathien</b> noted that on the domestic front, Thai listed companies recorded an all-time high combined dividend payments and share buybacks in 2025. Notably, the SETHD Total Return Index (SETHD TRI), which measures the performance of the top 30 SET-listed companies with high dividend yields, delivered a total return of 11.32 percent in 2025. The Thai stock market in January 2026 benefited from an election rally, with historical data showing that the SET Index has typically posted positive returns during the one-month periods both pre- and post-elections. Additionally, the absence of Long-Term Equity Fund (LTF) redemption spree that the market experienced at the start of previous years combined with foreign investors' net buying of Thai stocks for the second consecutive month also bolstered the market.</p>
<p><b>Key highlights for January 2026</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The SET Index closed at 1,325.62 points, up 5.2 percent from the 2025 year-end, moving in line with most regional peers. In January, the industry groups that outperformed the SET Index were Technology, Industrials and Resources.</li>
<li>The combined SET and Market for Alternative Investment (mai) average daily trading value surged 19.2 percent YoY to THB 46.50 billion (approx. USD 1.48 billion). </li>
<li>Foreign investors recorded net buying of THB 4.35 billion. Combined with the previous month's net buying, total foreign inflows reached THB 10.55 billion, marking the first two consecutive months of their net buying since July 2023.<b>&nbsp;</b></li>
<li>Foreign investors continued to dominate trading activity, representing 53.37 percent of total trading value, followed by local retail investors at 29.63 percent, local institutional investors at 10.56 percent, and securities companies at 6.44 percent.</li>
<li>There were no new listings on SET or mai.</li>
<li>SET&rsquo;s forward P/E ratio at the end of January 2026 stood at 14.7 times, lower than the Asian stock market average of 16.0 times. The historical P/E ratio was at 14.2 times, well below the Asian stock market average of 18.2 times.</li>
<li>SET&rsquo;s dividend yield at end-January 2026 was 3.82 percent, higher than the Asian stock market average of 2.72 percent.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Derivatives Market for January 2026</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Thailand Futures Exchange&rsquo;s (TFEX) daily trading volume reached 454,455 contracts, up 5.5 percent from the previous month, mainly due to the increases in Gold Online Futures and Silver Online Futures.</li>

<title>Economic Outlook: Federal Reserve Governor Lisa D. Cook, At The Economic Club Of Miami, Miami, Florida</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>Thank you, Francisco, for the kind introduction, and many thanks to the Economic Club of Miami for the opportunity to speak with you today.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20260204a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;It is wonderful to see firsthand the vibrant and growing South Florida economy. The Miami region's unemployment rate is below the national average, and consumers in Florida have been among the country's most resilient. I am happy to have the opportunity to engage with all of you who are central to that dynamism.</p>
<p>I am especially glad to have the chance to update you on my economic outlook shortly after the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC's) first meeting of the year. As always, I am focused on achieving the dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices given to us by Congress. This evening, I will discuss both parts of that mandate and give you my view of how the economy is evolving. I will then share some thoughts about the apparent disconnect between sentiment and activity readings before discussing implications for monetary policy.</p>
<p><span>Economic Outlook</span><br />Broadly, I see the U.S. economy as continuing to be resilient, with recent data indicating that growth in the second half of 2025 was even stronger than previously forecast. Inflation appears to have stalled stubbornly above our 2 percent goal, while at the same time the labor market appears to have stabilized in recent months. While the overall condition of the economy is solid, I am carefully watching sentiment, delinquencies, and other indicators that show a worsening outlook for low- and moderate-income households.</p>
<p><em>Inflation</em><br />Allow me to start with inflation. While some data are delayed because of last year's government shutdown, we have a good sense of inflation's direction. Based on the latest available data, it is estimated that the personal consumption expenditures price index rose 2.9 percent for the 12 months ending in December, still above our 2 percent target. Core inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy categories, was estimated to be 3 percent at the end of last year. Those readings indicate that progress on inflation essentially stalled in 2025. I have long discussed how important it is to return inflation to our target.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20260204a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;Such a plateau is frustrating after seeing significant disinflation in the preceding few years.</p>
<p>To understand why inflation leveled off in 2025, I find it instructive to look at the subcomponents. The disinflationary trend has continued for housing services, an expected outcome as cooling new tenant rents flow through to overall shelter prices. Inflation for nonhousing services has also eased, consistent with a less tight labor market. Conversely, when looking at core goods prices, we have seen a notable uptick in inflation. That primarily reflects an increase in tariffs last year on a wide variety of imported products.</p>
<p>With anchored inflation expectations, it is anticipated that tariff increases should only lead to a one-time rise in the price level. That raises the likelihood that the recent disinflationary trend could resume once tariffs effects recede into the rearview mirror. However, much uncertainty remains. The future direction of tariff policy is unclear. And, even when tariff levels are settled, uncertainty remains with respect to how long it will take for that price rise to be complete and whether it will take hold in inflation expectations.</p>
<p>I would note that measures of short-run inflation expectations have fallen since last spring and longer-run inflation expectations measures have been stable. However, I am watching the clock here&mdash;the longer inflation remains above target, the greater the probability that higher inflation will become entrenched in expectations.</p>
<p><em>Labor market</em><br />With respect to the labor market, data available through the end of last year suggest that the labor market stabilized after having softened through 2024 and earlier in 2025. In December, the unemployment rate was 4.4 percent. While up from the cyclical trough, the rate was little changed over the second half of last year and remains relatively low. To put 4.4 percent in perspective, consider that the average unemployment rate over the 50-year period preceding the pandemic was 6.2 percent.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, layoffs remain low, and new applications for unemployment benefits have held steady for several years. The number of available jobs relative to unemployed workers seeking work is just below 1. This reading is historically consistent with a solid labor market, although it is appreciably down from a few years ago, when the labor market was considerably tighter.</p>
<p>Risks to the labor market persist. Individuals who report working part time for economic reasons as a share of employment jumped at the end of 2025 after gradually moving higher over the past few years. Furthermore, job creation has slowed. Nonfarm payrolls rose by only 50,000 jobs each in November and December after declining in October as a result of a substantial decline in federal government employment. This low payroll growth does not necessarily indicate a weakening labor market, as it is likely connected to the fall in the supply of workers due to immigration policies and underlying demographics. However, it does suggest that the low unemployment rate is not driven by strong labor demand. Instead, labor demand has eased roughly in line with the fall in labor supply.</p>
<p>Overall, these readings indicate to me that the labor market is roughly in balance, but I am highly attentive to developments, knowing it can shift quickly.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, as I have discussed in several speeches, I see the continued proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) as likely to have a significant effect on the labor market and the economy.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20260204a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;Growing evidence shows that AI has the power to significantly boost productivity. Better productivity gains would support economic output and allow real wages to increase. I also see AI accelerating the generation of ideas, which could lead to the creation of new products, businesses, and jobs. Nonetheless, I am aware that job destruction may precede job creation, such that the unemployment rate might rise as the economy transitions, causing hardship for many workers and their families. I am concerned that there is a dynamic inconsistency problem such that there could be a mismatch between the arrival of costs related to AI investment and the arrival of benefits, including higher productivity that is noninflationary.</p>
<p><em>Economic activity</em><br />The overall economy is solid. GDP rose at a 4.4 percent annual rate in the third quarter of 2025, the most recent period for which data are available. That marked the second straight quarter of strong growth after a first-quarter downturn. The third quarter's gain was driven by consumer spending, which broadly remains highly resilient, as well as an increase in net exports, which is a volatile category. Fourth-quarter growth readings will be somewhat constrained by the effects of the federal government shutdown, which should unwind in the current quarter. For all of 2025, I estimate the economy grew a bit better than 2 percent, and I see a similar rate of growth being maintained this year.</p>
<p>Recent strong overall growth likely masks a challenging situation facing many families, particularly low- and moderate-income households. For example, youth and Black unemployment rates, both of which tend to be more cyclical than overall unemployment, have risen since last spring. The deteriorating labor market experienced by these two groups mirrors other emerging strains in some households' financial health and balance sheets. Among these households, I have observed large increases in delinquencies and see some evidence that their spending has stagnated when compared to the robust spending growth of their higher-income counterparts. This divergence is sometimes called a "two speed" or "K-shaped" economy, in which the well-off are doing well, while vulnerable households are not.</p>
<p><span>A View on Sentiment</span><br />I think about this two-speed or K-shaped economy when I attempt to take signal from various sentiment readings. Consumer sentiment, by many measures, is lower than one would expect in a solid economy, and perceptions of job availability have continued to worsen. Outreach calls I have with business and labor leaders, as well as with members of various communities and organizations, similarly suggest a dissatisfaction with the economy&mdash;and a worsening one&mdash;particularly among vulnerable households.</p>
<p>Typically, weak sentiment indicators are associated with a downturn in the economy and the labor market. However, there is reason to approach them differently at this time. I find it important to try to understand what is driving that discrepancy to ensure that I am not putting too little weight on what are called softer indicators. I have come to the view that there are four main reasons households are reporting low sentiment.</p>
<p>First, households are worse off relative to recent history. Though the economy is solid now, it has clearly softened in the past year or two, when it was running hot. It is natural that households would compare to their near past when assessing the economy's health and their prospects.</p>
<p>Second, the introduction of AI has raised uncertainty about the job market. Even Americans who see the benefits of AI can also be concerned about the labor-market transition and wonder whether, in coming years, jobs will be available for themselves and their families.</p>
<p>Third, there are decades-long structural changes that present challenges for today's middle-class families. Most notably, housing costs have increased sharply for both homebuyers and renters and have far surpassed wage gains in almost every region of the country. Moreover, the cost of education, health care, elder care, and childcare has risen by more than wages; household debt has also risen; and intergenerational mobility has declined. I conjecture that the growing pains of these trends may not be felt by American households linearly over time but, rather, that they interact with other macroeconomic trends such that they become especially painful at times, including in recent years. For instance, I think the age distribution of our workforce may make these trends more salient now with young adults competing for housing and jobs with older, wealthier baby boomers.</p>
<p>Finally, the fourth reason I will point to as an explanation for weak sentiment is the high inflation experienced, not just today, but over the past five years. This reason also interacts with the long-standing trends I just mentioned: The recent bout of inflation would have called attention to the corrosive rise in real prices of housing, childcare, and education that occurred over decades.</p>
<p>In summary, the reasons for low sentiment are real and are deeply concerning. But they do not, in my view, reveal a signal about increased slack that we can tackle with our typical demand-side monetary policy. In fact, for the part of households' concerns related to the pain of inflation, the best thing we can do in our roles is to ensure that inflation returns to and stays at target.</p>
<p><span>Monetary Policy</span><br />When considering the proper stance of monetary policy, I see risks to both parts of our dual mandate. Inflation remains persistently above our 2 percent target, and there is considerable uncertainty about when the tariff effects will recede. While the unemployment rate has shown signs of stabilization, the lack of dynamism in the labor market likely makes it susceptible to downside shocks. Overall, uncertainty about the outlook remains elevated, although I believe the labor market will continue to be supported by the three rate cuts last year.</p>
<p>At this time, I see risks as tilted toward higher inflation. As a result, I supported the FOMC's decision to hold the policy rate steady at our meeting last week. As I described, there is an argument for being optimistic about the path of inflation, but, until I see stronger evidence that inflation is moving sustainably back down to target, that is where my focus will be, in the absence of unexpected changes in the labor market. As I have said before but cannot repeat too many times, the FOMC's firm commitment to its inflation mandate is imperative.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20260204a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;After nearly five years of above-target inflation, it is essential that we maintain our credibility by returning to a disinflationary path and achieving our target in the relatively near future. At the height of the recent bout of high inflation, we promised that we would return to target, and it was this promise that kept inflation expectations anchored and allowed us to see the sharp disinflation from 2022 through 2024. If we were to lose credibility, the cost may not be immediately felt, but it would be resoundingly and painfully felt when we need it the most, in an inflation crisis such as the one we experienced three years ago.</p>
<p><span>Conclusion</span><br />As I have laid out, I remain optimistic that inflation will soon return to a path toward our target, that the labor market is stabilizing, and that sustainable growth lies ahead. My optimism is tempered with caution. This is why I will remain vigilant in studying a wide range of incoming information so that I can pursue the best policy to achieve our dual-mandate goals. My future policy decisions will be guided by incoming data, my economic outlook, and the evolving balance of risks.</p>
<p>Thank you, again, to the Economic Club of Miami for this opportunity. I look forward to your questions.</p>

<p>SGX Group (Singapore Exchange) today&nbsp;reported its strongest half-year revenue and net profit, demonstrating the strength of its multi-asset offering in supporting investors amid uncertainty across global markets.</p>
<p>1H FY2026 net revenue, excluding treasury income, increased 10.1% year-on-year (y-o-y) to S$636.6 million (S$578.0 million), while adjusted net profit rose 11.6% y-o-y to S$357.1&nbsp;million (S$320.1 million). Adjusted EBITDA climbed 9.2% to S$466.2 million (S$426.9 million), with adjusted earnings per share at 33.4 cents (29.9 cents).</p>
<p>The Board of Directors has declared an interim quarterly dividend of 11.0 cents (9.0 cents) per share, payable on 24 February 2026. This brings total dividends in 1H FY2026 to 21.75 cents (18.0 cents) per share, up 20.8% y-o-y.</p>
<p>Loh Boon Chye, Chief Executive Officer of SGX Group, said, &ldquo;We achieved our strongest half-year performance, driven by sustained growth across our multi-asset business. The resilience of our trusted platform has enabled market participants to diversify their investments and manage risk in a challenging global environment. We remain confident in delivering medium-term revenue growth of 6-8% alongside sustainable shareholder returns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our derivatives franchise recorded a half-year high of 1.35 million contracts in daily average volume, underscoring the strength and relevance of our world class risk-management offering. Beyond listed markets, our SGX FX business has scaled further, with client acquisition and platform adoption pushing average daily volumes to a new high of US$180 billion. Our technology capabilities in this space are also delivering greater value to clients,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Loh added, &ldquo;Closer to home, activity in our stock market has been robust, supported by forward-looking measures from the Equities Market Review Group. Securities daily average traded value (SDAV) rose 20% y-o-y to S$1.51 billion &ndash; the highest in five years &ndash; with a growing IPO pipeline and retail participation at a four-year high. Our efforts are continuing into the second half, as we work closely with the Monetary Authority of Singapore and ecosystem partners to sustain this momentum.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Total expenses increased 2.9% to S$270.8 million (S$263.1 million). Higher fixed staff costs and other expenses<a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/#_ftn6">[6]</a>&nbsp;were partially offset by lower variable staff costs and depreciation and amortisation.</p>

<p>We remain on track to achieve our organic top-line growth target of 6-8% (excluding treasury income), which was previously announced at the start of FY2025. Expense and capex guidance for FY2026 remain unchanged at a 4-6% increase and S$90-S$95 million, respectively. We will continue to manage our costs prudently while investing strategically for growth. In line with our commitment to sustainable and growing dividends, we are confident that we can continue to deliver the 0.25 cents quarterly dividend increase until the end of FY2028, as previously guided.</p>

<title>ASIC Takes Further Steps To Support Australians Impacted By First Guardian And Shield Collapse</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC is taking further steps to support thousands of Australians who invested in the Shield Master Fund (Shield) and First Guardian Master Fund (First Guardian), which have collapsed.</p>
<p>So far, less than 2,000 of around 11,000 Australians who invested approximately $1.1 billion in Shield and First Guardian have lodged complaints with the Australian Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA), prompting ASIC to take further action to ensure investors understand the impact.</p>
<p>From tomorrow (Friday 6 February 2026), ASIC will begin sending further information to investors, including a link to a dedicated consumer website that contains trusted and independent support, and options to make a complaint:&nbsp;<a href="https://takeyoursuperback.com/?utm_source=ASIC&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=Asic_Website_tracking&amp;utm_id=ASIC+website+"><strong>takeyoursuperback.com</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The new consumer website has been independently developed by Super Consumers Australia with funding from ASIC. Super Consumers Australia is an independent consumer advocacy organisation that is helping consumers impacted by the collapse of First Guardian and Shield understand what they can do.</p>
<p>The website provides First Guardian and Shield investors with guidance and resources to help navigate next steps including:</p>
<ul>
<li>how to lodge a complaint with AFCA to seek compensation,&nbsp;<strong>including deadlines for submitting complaints</strong></li>
<li>how to access support services if they are experiencing financial hardship or need someone to talk to</li>
</ul>
<p>Consumers should visit&nbsp;<a href="https://takeyoursuperback.com/?utm_source=ASIC&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=Asic_Website_tracking&amp;utm_id=ASIC+website+"><strong>takeyoursuperback.com</strong></a>&nbsp;for further information and details on how they can make a complaint to AFCA.</p>
<p>To date, around 4,000 consumers have benefited from approximately $421 million in payments from Macquarie and compensation from Netwealth as part of court enforceable undertakings agreed to by ASIC as part of its investigations into Shield and First Guardian.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s investigations into Shield and First Guardian continue. Nearly 50 people across ASIC are working across 26 investigations, which are among the largest and most complex cases in ASIC&rsquo;s history.</p>
<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>Consumers impacted by the collapse of First Guardian and Shield can expect to receive correspondence from ASIC in the coming weeks.</p>
<p><strong>If you have lost money due to the collapse of Shield and First Guardian, you should consider lodging a complaint with the&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.afca.org.au/news/shield-and-first-guardian-collapse-how-afca-can-help"><strong>Australian Financial Complaints Authorit</strong><strong>y</strong></a>.</p>
<p>AFCA is the external dispute resolution scheme for financial complaints in Australia and must deal with complaints independently and fairly.&nbsp;<strong>AFCA&rsquo;s service is free for consumers.&nbsp;</strong>You do not need to pay someone to help you lodge a complaint with AFCA.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<h3>ASIC&rsquo;s action</h3>
<p>ASIC is investigating numerous individuals and entities connected to Shield and First Guardian including:</p>
<ul>
<li>the marketing lead generators</li>
<li>the financial advisers and the financial firms that authorised them</li>
<li>the superannuation trustees that made First Guardian available via platforms</li>
<li>the auditors, and</li>
<li>the operators of the managed investment scheme.</li>
</ul>
<p>Around 11,000 people invested their money, including their superannuation retirement savings, into First Guardian and/or Shield.</p>
<p>In many cases, this happened after people were contacted by lead generators and referred to financial advisers. These advisers often told investors to roll over their existing superannuation balances into a choice superannuation fund available on a platform or to set up a self-managed super fund (SMSF) to facilitate investment into First Guardian or Shield.</p>
<p>For more information about the status of ASIC&rsquo;s enforcement action and investigations refer to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/asic-investigations-and-enforcement/enforcement-activities/first-guardian-master-fund/" title="First Guardian Master Fund">First Guardian Master Fund</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/asic-investigations-and-enforcement/enforcement-activities/shield-master-fund/" title="Shield Master Fund">Shield Master Fund</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Since ASIC&rsquo;s investigations into the Shield Master Fund and First Guardian Master Fund commenced, ASIC has communicated with investors through a number of channels.</p>
<p>ASIC has established dedicated investor webpages for both Shield and First Guardian which provide information to investors about how they could make a complaint (including making complaints to AFCA), other support that is available, responses to frequently asked questions and information about ASIC&rsquo;s actions (including links to ASIC&rsquo;s media releases).<br /><br />ASIC also sent 10 rounds of direct mail letters and emails to certain categories of investors and communicated with hundreds of investors who have emailed ASIC directly.</p>
<h3>Complaints to AFCA and seeking compensation</h3>
<p>AFCA is a free, fair and independent dispute resolution scheme. AFCA considers complaints about financial products and services. AFCA&rsquo;s service is offered as an alternative to tribunals and courts to resolve complaints consumers and small businesses have with their financial firms.</p>
<p>Impacted consumers may be eligible to receive compensation, but they need to take action and lodge a complaint with AFCA.</p>
<p>AFCA has made recent lead&nbsp;<a href="https://www.afca.org.au/news/latest-news/afca-publishes-video-update-and-lead-decisions-on-shield-and-first-guardian-complaints">decisions</a>&nbsp;that have awarded consumers compensation for losses stemming from the collapse of First Guardian and Shield. In these cases, AFCA found, amongst other things, these consumers received financial advice that was inappropriate for their circumstances and not in their best interests.</p>
<p>Even if a complaint is lodged with AFCA, a compensation outcome is not guaranteed.</p>
<p>AFCA has&nbsp;dedicated information&nbsp;on its website for consumers impacted by the collapse of First Guardian and Shield:</p>

<title>Federal Reserve Board Finalizes Hypothetical Scenarios For Its Annual Stress Test And Votes To Maintain The Current Stress Test-Related Capital Requirements Until Public Feedback Can Be Considered</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Federal Reserve Board on Wednesday finalized the hypothetical scenarios for its annual stress test, which helps ensure that large banks can continue to lend to households and businesses even in a severe recession. The final scenarios are substantially similar to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20251024a.htm">scenarios</a>&nbsp;proposed in October. Additionally, the Board voted to maintain the current stress capital buffer requirements until 2027, when new requirements can be calculated based on models that take public feedback into consideration.</p>
<p>"Waiting to calculate new stress capital buffer requirements until we receive public feedback will give us the opportunity to correct any deficiencies in our supervisory models based on that feedback," said Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle W. Bowman. "This should further improve the transparency, effectiveness, and fairness of our models and improve our accountability to the public."</p>
<p>The Board's annual stress test evaluates the resilience of large banks by estimating losses, net revenue, and capital levels under hypothetical recession scenarios that extend two years into the future. This year, 32 banks will be tested against a severe global recession with heightened stress in both commercial and residential real estate markets, as well as in corporate debt markets. The scenarios are not forecasts and should not be interpreted as predictions of future economic conditions.</p>
<p>In the 2026 stress test scenario, the U.S. unemployment rate rises nearly 5.5 percentage points, to a peak of 10 percent. The unemployment rate increase is accompanied by severe market volatility, a widening of corporate bond spreads, and a collapse in asset prices, including about a 30 percent decline in house prices and a 39 percent decline in commercial real estate prices.</p>
<p>Large banks with substantial trading or custodial operations are also required to incorporate a counterparty default scenario component to estimate potential losses from the unexpected default of the firm's largest counterparty amid an acute market shock. In addition, banks with large trading operations will be tested against a global market shock component that primarily stresses their trading and related positions. The final scenarios include two revisions to the global market shock component to improve consistency across shocks applied to similar exposures and enhance plausibility.</p>
<p>The table below shows the components of the annual stress test that apply to each bank, based on data as of the third quarter of 2025. The brief methodology document describes the Board's intention to generally use the same models as the 2025 stress test with limited model adjustments.</p>

<p>Nigerian Exchange Group Plc (NGX Group) on Wednesday, hosted a Closing Gong Ceremony in honour of the Inspector-General of Police, IGP Kayode Egbetokun, signaling a strengthened partnership between capital market regulators and law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>The ceremony highlighted a shared commitment to investor protection, the prevention of financial crime, and the reinforcement of trust and confidence in Nigeria&rsquo;s capital market.</p>
<p>Welcoming the IGP, Alhaji Umaru Kwairanga, Group Chairman of NGX Group, commended the leadership of the Nigeria Police Force in supporting market integrity.

Strong collaboration between regulators, enforcement agencies, and market infrastructure institutions is essential to building a resilient and credible market that supports economic growth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Director-General of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Dr. Emomotimi Agama, emphasized the importance of coordinated enforcement, noting: &ldquo;Investor protection is at the core of market regulation, and today&rsquo;s engagement highlights how critical collaboration with law enforcement is to achieving that mandate. This partnership strengthens our enforcement capacity, enhances deterrence against illegal investment activities, and reinforces confidence in the Nigerian capital market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his response, IGP Kayode Egbetokun reaffirmed the commitment of the Nigeria Police Force, stating: &ldquo;A transparent and well-regulated capital market is vital to Nigeria&rsquo;s economic growth. The Nigeria Police Force remains committed to working with regulators and market operators to prevent financial crime, protect investors, and uphold the integrity of our financial system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Also speaking, Chairman of Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX), Ahonsi Unuigbe, highlighted the role of the Exchange in promoting market discipline: &ldquo;A transparent and orderly market can only thrive where rules are respected and misconduct is addressed decisively.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced it has withdrawn&nbsp;</span><span>the&nbsp;</span><span>notice of proposed rulemaking titled &ldquo;Event Contracts&rdquo;</span><span>&nbsp;that published June 10, 2024.</span><span>&nbsp;[See&nbsp;</span><span>CFTC Press Release No.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8907-24">8907-24</a><span>] The CFTC does not intend to issue final rules with respect to the proposal.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Additionally, Commission staff has withdrawn CFTC Staff Letter 25-36, a Staff Advisory on Certain Contract Markets, issued&nbsp;</span><span>Sept.&nbsp;</span><span>30, 2025 [See&nbsp;</span><span>CFTC Press Release No.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/9137-25">9137-25</a><span>].</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s actions reflect the CFTC&rsquo;s commitment to lawful innovation in our markets,&rdquo; said CFTC Chairman Michael S. Selig. &ldquo;The 2024 event contracts proposal reflected the prior administration&rsquo;s frolic into merit regulation with an outright prohibition on political contracts ahead of the 2024 presidential election. The Commission is withdrawing that proposal and will advance a new rulemaking grounded in a rational and coherent interpretation of the Commodity Exchange Act that promotes responsible innovation in our derivatives markets in line with Congressional intent.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>Chairman Selig also commended the staff&rsquo;s withdrawal of its 2025 sports event contracts advisory.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;While intended to highlight litigation considerations, the advisory inadvertently created confusion and uncertainty for our market participants&rdquo; Chairman Selig said. &ldquo;I look forward to working with staff on an event contracts rulemaking.&rdquo;</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you very much, Adam [Farkas], for your kind introduction, and for the invitation to join you all this evening. I regret that a government shutdown here in the United States prevented me from joining you in person today. But I am grateful for the opportunity to take part in this conversation virtually, and to discuss ways in which we can work together on matters of mutual concern.</p>
<p>Let me begin by thanking Adam and our hosts at AFME for their flexibility under these circumstances. And let me also add that the views I express here are my own as Chairman of the SEC and not necessarily those of the SEC as an institution or of the other Commissioners.</p>
<p>I understand that, by design, tonight&rsquo;s dinner will spark a constructive dialogue on transatlantic cooperation. That sentiment captures the spirit in which I appear before you this evening&mdash;here to speak, of course, but no less, to listen.</p>
<p>After all, headlines can emphasize our differences. But, if my time in public service has taught me anything, it is that wisdom more reliably dwells in the lessons of our past than in the passions of the present. History, I think, has a way of steadying us.</p>
<p>Fran&ccedil;ois Mitterrand, the fourth president of France&rsquo;s Fifth Republic, likely agreed on very little with President Ronald Reagan. I might add that I, as an American living in Paris at the time, was not an admirer of many of his policies. But, during one of President Mitterand&rsquo;s visits with President Reagan in the White House, Monsieur Mitterand remarked, &ldquo;Our eyes are not always turned in exactly the same direction.... And that, in a way, is perfectly natural, in view of the fact that we aren&rsquo;t sitting in the same place.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-remarks-afme-020426#_ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;&ldquo;But when it is necessary,&rdquo; President Mitterrand concluded, &ldquo;you are present&mdash;and we are present&rdquo; for one another.</p>
<p>And so it was, perhaps most poignantly, after the Second World War. Cities that stood for centuries were reduced to rubble. And out of those embers emerged a continent that was scarred by the wounds of war, its people weary and its future uncertain. As Americans, we felt the tug of our ties to Europe, forged in the shared struggle to defeat an evil totalitarian system and sharpened by the specter of yet another under Soviet influence. Through the Marshall Plan, the United States committed itself to Europe&rsquo;s recovery, investing our faith in the continent as much as our capital.</p>
<p>Of course, I am also reminded of Europe&rsquo;s presence during our own, more recent, hour of need. Soon after the plumes of smoke cleared from two destroyed skyscrapers in Lower Manhattan, U.S. and EU authorities partnered with their global counterparts to develop the Multilateral Memorandum of Understanding for cross-border enforcement cooperation, otherwise known as the IOSCO MMOU.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-remarks-afme-020426#_ftn2">[2]</a>&nbsp;The speed with which signatories negotiated and adopted this MMOU was unprecedented, as my predecessor SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt said at the time, and shows the spirit of global cooperation in securities regulation that is true then, as it is true today.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-remarks-afme-020426#_ftn3">[3]</a>&nbsp;The MMOU has grown to 131 regulators, and IOSCO members continue to expand and enhance their cooperation.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-remarks-afme-020426#_ftn4">[4]</a></p>
<p>To be sure, ours is partnership that, while often revealed in moments of crisis, is hardly confined to them. It also finds expression in the work that follows. Indeed, the same ethos of mutual support that has sustained us through hardship has also summoned us to opportunity. European capital, for example, has long helped to author our economic story, because before the United States was a nation, it was an investment. The first permanent European settlements in the Western Hemisphere were financed through joint-stock enterprises that allowed investors on your side of the pond to pool together capital in anticipation of a burgeoning new world. Over time, Europeans have only deepened their engagement with American markets and today hold record levels of U.S. equities, with ownership soaring by 91 percent over the last three years alone.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-remarks-afme-020426#_ftn5">[5]</a>&nbsp;We are grateful for this engagement and encourage our European friends to continue investing alongside us.</p>
<p>Of course, it can be easy to romanticize the transatlantic relationship of the postwar era. To echo President Mitterrand, our gaze is not always fixed in the same direction. Yet despite any differences that may arise, our economies&mdash;and our people&mdash;are entwined in ways that healthy disagreements can sometimes obscure but scarcely unravel.</p>
<p>Which brings me to today, and to the work that lies ahead. President Trump said it very well in Davos: &ldquo;The United States cares greatly about the people of Europe...and we believe deeply in the bonds we share as a civilization.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-remarks-afme-020426#_ftn6">[6]</a>&nbsp;Indeed, the United States and Europe are bound in many ways, notably by a belief in global markets as a force for economic growth. The EU demonstrated this most recently by launching the Savings and Investments Union Initiative. And AFME&rsquo;s stated aim&mdash;to advocate for deep, competitive, and integrated global capital markets&mdash;speaks to that same understanding.</p>
<p>This is ultimately for the good of all. As they say, a rising tide lifts all boats&mdash;on both sides of the Atlantic, I might add.</p>
<p>But every so often, a ship needs to shed the barnacles clinging to its hull.</p>
<p>For our part, America&rsquo;s $124 trillion capital markets remain the deepest and most liquid around the globe. They are a marvel of human ingenuity in channeling resources toward their most productive uses. But over many years, Washington has allowed onerous regulations to build without pruning and weeding those regulations that are no longer necessary, dissuading companies from going public&mdash;and discouraging prudent risk taking once they are. Indeed, the path to public ownership has become narrower, costlier, and saddled with rules that can create more friction than benefit. So, under my leadership, the SEC is taking a number of steps to make our capital markets more efficient and more attractive for investors and businesses alike.</p>
<p>First, we are working to simplify and scale disclosure requirements to reduce the costs of preparing SEC filings and, at the same time, make them more comprehensible so that investment decisions can turn on economic signals rather than regulatory noise. Our approach is consistent with America&rsquo;s G20 priority of unleashing economic prosperity by limiting regulatory burdens.</p>
<p>Second, we are de-politicizing shareholder meetings and returning their focus to voting on director elections and significant corporate matters. Political and social issues belong neither in the boardroom nor before shareholders. We should task our elected officials&mdash;not our regulatory agencies&mdash;with addressing these matters.</p>
<p>Finally, we are focused on reforming the litigation landscape in the United States to eliminate frivolous complaints, while maintaining an avenue for shareholders to continue to bring forth meritorious claims. In short, we must shield the innovator from the frivolous, while protecting the investor from the fraudulent.</p>
<p>Taken together, these steps will help to ensure that America&rsquo;s capital markets remain open, dynamic, and, above all, worthy of the trust that investors place in them, both here at home and around the world.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, for foreign companies, including those in Europe, that list their shares on U.S. stock exchanges and access our capital markets, we continue to evaluate whether to update our current regulatory regime to reflect today&rsquo;s corporate practices and business models. Last June, the SEC solicited public feedback on how it could modernize rules in this area, which the agency developed in 1983. SEC staff is currently reviewing ideas from over 80 comment letters submitted by trade associations, law firms, public companies, individual investors, and others. In whatever way the Commission may ultimately amend its rules in this area, my focus is not to limit the number of foreign companies that access the U.S. capital markets. Rather, my north star is that retrospective review of our rules, in light of changed circumstances, is a hallmark of an effective regulatory regime.</p>
<p>Now, as we work to widen the pathway to public ownership, we must not lose sight of the bedrock beneath it: high-quality accounting and audit standards.</p>
<p>I have previously discussed the importance of the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation and its accounting standards board, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), promoting high-quality accounting standards that are focused solely on driving reliable financial reporting. The International Standards on Auditing issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) are also essential as these standards are used in every global capital market, often as a baseline for local standards. High-quality international accounting and auditing standards help to ensure transparency, comparability, and reliability of financial information. They also enable efficient investment decisions and foster economic stability. Importantly, strong standards do more than safeguard the markets that already exist&mdash;they give innovators the confidence to build what comes next.</p>
<p>Both the IASB and the IAASB face funding pressures, as well as structural challenges that threaten their independence, stability, and capacity to sustain high-quality globally consistent standards. I am committed to working with my fellow financial sector authorities to carry out the reforms needed to ensure a viable international standard setting process moving forward.</p>
<p>Finally, leadership requires the courage to implement core principles anew when emerging technologies offer the promise of stronger markets. For too long, Washington approached emerging on-chain financial infrastructure as something to be restrained by regulatory ambiguity and overzealous enforcement, rather than to be evaluated on its merits as a potential tool for modernization. That posture chilled innovation and left meaningful potential unrealized. Thankfully, it is a new day at the SEC. We intend to help deliver President Trump&rsquo;s call to make America the crypto capital of the world.</p>
<p>Through Project Crypto, which will now proceed as a joint initiative with our sister agency, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, whose new chairman was one of my former counsel, we are exercising the authorities that Congress has already provided to explore the possibilities unleashed by tokenization, including an innovation exemption framework for permissioned on-chain finance. We will preserve investor protection, transparency, and supervisory oversight while giving regulated markets a glimpse of how modernization can reshape how assets are issued, traded, margined, and settled. These efforts are not about weakening standards or recreating legacy risks in new forms, but they are about strengthening market infrastructure through technologies that enhance resilience, auditability, and efficiency.</p>
<p>We should refrain from forcing on-chain innovations to comply with legacy market rules that are not fit-for-purpose, especially where that strategy would hamstring technological evolution to preserve the status quo. While innovators should know that we will not create shortcuts that degrade the policy goals of our statutes, we will not permit fear to guide us, either. This balancing act is how the United States can keep our markets the world&rsquo;s deepest and most liquid&mdash;not by standing still in the face of change, but by pairing regulatory discipline with the courage to drive it.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>As we pursue this work, allow me to conclude by turning from the SEC&rsquo;s policy priorities at home to the partnerships that we maintain across borders, many of which are represented at tonight&rsquo;s dinner.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s cooperation with European securities regulators remains strong, especially in the areas of enforcement and supervision of registrants. We also continue to collaborate&mdash;closely on many fronts&mdash;to address a number of cross-border regulatory issues.</p>
<p>Last year, for example, 42 percent of our incoming requests for enforcement assistance came from Europe, while 32 percent of the Commission&rsquo;s outgoing requests were to Europe. In terms of supervisory cooperation, 55 percent of our foreign requests were from Europe, while 56 percent of our outgoing requests went to Europe. Our working together, hand-in-hand, with foreign authorities to prevent cross-border securities law violations, is essential to carrying out the SEC&rsquo;s investor protection mission.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, through steady and sustained dialogue, we come to understand one another&rsquo;s regulatory frameworks, anticipate potential points of friction, and prevent differences from becoming divisions that might otherwise affect cross-border market activity. All of us want to know that we can pick up the phone quickly, speak plainly, and work together to address challenges as they arise. To be present for one another, as President Mitterrand might have put it.</p>
<p>That is why the SEC will remain steadfast in our engagement with our foreign counterparts around the globe&mdash;bilaterally and multilaterally, formally and informally&mdash;and keep lines of communication open, active, and ready when circumstances demand it.</p>
<p>After all, the Atlantic has never truly separated our economies over the past 250 years. In many ways, one can see it as representing less a barrier than a bridge connecting the capital, ideas, and relationships that bind markets and nations together.</p>
<p>So, as I stated earlier, this is the spirit in which I appear before you tonight&mdash;and it is the spirit in which the United States stands ready to work with Europe in the years ahead.</p>
<p>For now, I want to thank you for being a very patient and indulgent audience. I am grateful for your time this evening, and for accommodating my virtual participation. I very much look forward to your questions&mdash;and of course, to the work ahead. Thank you.</p>

<p>In October 2025, 25 financial institutions active in the UK foreign exchange (FX) market participated in the semi-annual turnover survey for the Foreign Exchange Joint Standing Committee (FXJSC). The survey results are summarised below. Detailed tables for the October 2025 reporting period are available separately.</p>
<p>The main findings of the survey are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The average daily reported UK FX&nbsp; turnover was $3,850 billion in October 2025, representing a 5% decrease relative to turnover recorded in the April 2025 survey. This is consistent with previous trends, where turnover in October has been lower than the preceding April survey. On a year-to-year basis, UK FX turnover in October 2025 increased by 20% when compared to the October 2024 survey.&nbsp;</li>
<li>UK FX turnover fell across most instruments, mainly led by FX spot which fell from $1,293 in April 2025 to $1,059 billion in October 2025. Other notable declines were also observed in FX options and outright forwards, while FX swaps increased to $1,840 billion &ndash; up 18% when compared to the April 2025 survey.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Market share of the top three traded currency pairs: USD/EUR, USD/JPY and USD/GBP remained broadly in line with previous surveys. USD/EUR was still be the most traded currency pair in the UK, with an average daily turnover of $901 billion,&nbsp; which made up 23% of overall FX turnover in October 2025.</li>
<li>Since October 2008, overall average daily UK FX turnover has risen from $1,697 billion to $3,850 billion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Tables 1 to 4 below provide various summaries of the average daily data for October 2025 with comparisons to April 2025.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<ol>
<li>The FXJSC was established in November 1973 and is a forum for market participants, infrastructure providers and the relevant UK public authorities to discuss conjunctural and structural issues concerning the wholesale foreign exchange (FX) market in the UK and the associated supporting infrastructure. The FXJSC currently has two sub committees.</li>
<li>The Operations Sub-Committee was established in 2002. Its members are operations managers from many major banks active in the London wholesale FX market, as well as representatives from service providers, trade associations and from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).</li>
<li>The Legal Sub-Committee was established in 2004 and comprises legal professionals providing in-house counsel for many of the major institutions involved in the wholesale FX market in London and representatives from the FCA.</li>
<li>While the data presented here is of a similar nature to that collected by the BIS Triennial Survey, the FXJSC data is collected more frequently. In addition, the basis of reporting for the FXJSC Turnover Survey is the location of the price-setting dealer, whereas the basis of reporting in the BIS Triennial Survey is the location of the sales desk.</li>
<li>Results for the April 2025 BIS triennial survey:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/statistics/bis-survey/2025">Foreign exchange and OTC derivatives markets turnover survey &ndash; 2025 | Bank of England</a></li>
<li>The results of the October 2025 FXJSC Turnover Survey are also available on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/london-foreign-exchange-joint-standing-committee">website of the FXJSC</a>.</li>

<title>U.S. Department Of The Treasury: Quarterly Refunding Statement Of Deputy Assistant Secretary For Federal Finance Brian Smith</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The U.S. Department of the Treasury is offering $125 billion of Treasury securities to refund approximately $90.2 billion of privately-held Treasury notes and bonds maturing on February 15, 2026.&nbsp; This issuance will raise new cash from private investors of approximately $34.8 billion.&nbsp; The securities are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A 3-year note in the amount of $58 billion, maturing February 15, 2029;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A 10-year note in the amount of $42 billion, maturing February 15, 2036; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A 30-year bond in the amount of $25 billion, maturing February 15, 2056.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The 3-year note will be auctioned at 1:00 p.m. ET on Tuesday, February 10, 2026.&nbsp; The 10-year note will be auctioned at 1:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday, February 11, 2026.&nbsp; The 30-year bond will be auctioned at 1:00 p.m. ET on Thursday, February 12, 2026.&nbsp;All these auctions will take place on a yield basis and will settle on Tuesday, February 17, 2026.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The balance of Treasury financing requirements over the quarter will be met with regular weekly bill auctions, cash management bills (CMBs), and monthly note, bond, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), and 2-year Floating Rate Note (FRN) auctions.</p>
<h3>NOMINAL COUPON AND FRN FINANCING</h3>
<p>Treasury believes its current auction sizes leave it well positioned to address potential changes to the fiscal outlook and to the size and composition of the SOMA portfolio. &nbsp;Based on current projected borrowing needs, Treasury anticipates maintaining nominal coupon and FRN auction sizes for at least the next several quarters.&nbsp; Treasury is monitoring SOMA purchases of Treasury bills and growing demand for Treasury bills from the private sector.&nbsp; Looking ahead, Treasury continues to evaluate potential future increases to nominal coupon and FRN auction sizes, with a focus on trends in structural demand and potential costs and risks of various issuance profiles.</p>
<p>The table below presents, in billions of dollars, the actual auction sizes for the November 2025 to January 2026 quarter and the anticipated auction sizes for the February to April 2026 quarter:&nbsp;</p>

<h3>TIPS FINANCING</h3>
<p>Over the February to April 2026 quarter, Treasury plans to maintain TIPS auction sizes at current levels: the February 30-year TIPS new issue auction size at $9 billion, the March 10-year TIPS reopening auction size at $19 billion, and the April 5-year TIPS new issue auction size at $26 billion.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>BILL ISSUANCE</h3>
<p>Based on current fiscal forecasts, Treasury expects to maintain the offering sizes of benchmark bills at or near current levels into mid-March.&nbsp; By late March, Treasury anticipates incrementally reducing short-dated bill auction sizes in light of the April 15 tax date.&nbsp; These reductions will likely lead to a cumulative $250-300 billion net decline in total bill supply by early May.&nbsp; As always, Treasury will continue to evaluate near-term borrowing needs and assess additional adjustments to bill auction sizes as appropriate.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>CASH BALANCE</h3>
<p>Per Treasury&rsquo;s recent borrowing announcement, Treasury assumes an $850 billion cash balance at the end of March.&nbsp; However, based on current projections for the upcoming refunding quarter, Treasury estimates that the size of the Treasury General Account (TGA) could peak around $1,025 billion (plus or minus $50 billion) by late April, before declining in May.&nbsp; This estimate reflects significant uncertainty regarding the size of April tax receipts, as well as macroeconomic factors and the path of fiscal and monetary policy.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>BUYBACKS</h3>
<p>Today, Treasury is releasing a tentative buyback&nbsp;<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/221/Tentative-Buyback-ScheduleQ12026.pdf">schedule</a>&nbsp;for the upcoming refunding quarter.&nbsp; Treasury anticipates that, over the course of the upcoming quarter, it will purchase up to $38 billion in off-the-run securities across buckets for liquidity support and up to $75 billion in the 1-month to 2-year bucket for cash management purposes.</p>
<p>On January 14, 2026, Treasury released a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) regarding plans to offer direct buyback access to a limited number of additional counterparties&nbsp;based on their participation in Treasury auctions. &nbsp;The NPR comment period closes on February 13, 2026. &nbsp;The NPR and instructions for submitting comments are available at https://www.regulations.gov.&nbsp; Treasury will evaluate the comments and anticipates publishing a final rule on this matter in the first half of 2026.&nbsp; For information on eligibility criteria, please refer to the &ldquo;Who may participate in a buyback operation?&rdquo; section of Treasury&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.treasurydirect.gov/help-center/faqs/buyback-faqs/">buyback FAQs</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the coming months, Treasury expects to transition its Treasury buyback operations to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York&rsquo;s new trading platform,&nbsp;<a class="external" href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/opolicy/operating_policy_241113" target="_blank" title="https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/opolicy/operating_policy_241113">FedTrade Plus</a>. &nbsp;To support this transition, Treasury intends to conduct a small-value test buyback. &nbsp;Details about this test will be announced at a later date.&nbsp; This small-value buyback should not be viewed by market participants as a precursor or signal of any pending policy changes regarding Treasury&rsquo;s existing processes.</p>
<p>Please send comments or suggestions on these subjects or other subjects related to debt management to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:debt.management@treasury.gov">debt.management@treasury.gov</a>.</p>
<p>The next quarterly refunding announcement will take place on Wednesday, May 6, 2026.</p>

This will allow clients to easily perform best price discovery, filling a structural gap in overnight markets. Axiom will also offer market data access to these ATSs with connectivity currently in development and is expected to be delivered in Q1.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="normaltextrun"><span>The connection to Bruce ATS</span></span><span>&trade;<span class="normaltextrun">, Blue Ocean ATS and MOON ATS will enable market participants to&nbsp;</span></span><span>capture liquidity unavailable on traditional exchange feeds during after-hours markets.

<p><span class="normaltextrun"><strong><span>Arnaud Derasse, CTO of Exegy, said:&nbsp;</span></strong></span><span class="normaltextrun"><span>&ldquo;As participants continue operating across time zones, we are seeing major interest towards extended or after-hours trading venues. The addition of these three ATSs, along with the Exegy live calculated OBBO, will enrich the consolidated market data our clients have access to via Axiom, providing them with a more complete market view with simplified overnight best price discovery.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span>As the market evolves from extended trading hours towards 24/5, the initiative to cover overnight ATSs ensures institutional investors&rsquo; infrastructure is equipped to take advantage of shifting liquidity in US equities. Exegy&rsquo;s data-as-a-service solution, Axiom, currently offers connectivity to&nbsp;</span><span>Blue Ocean ATS, by Blue Ocean Technologies. Bruce ATS&trade;, which utilizes Nasdaq technology, and MOON ATS offered by OTC Markets will become available as Q1 progresses.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;As trading moves toward a true 24/5 market, access to overnight liquidity is essential,&rdquo;&nbsp;<strong>said Matt Fuchs, EVP, Market Data at OTC Markets Group</strong>. &ldquo;With almost 15 years of building and operating ATSs, we&rsquo;re thrilled to bring MOON ATS market data to Exegy&rsquo;s Axiom, giving investors the tools to capture opportunities across US equities anytime, anywhere.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>All three overnight venues will be available through Axiom via Exegy&rsquo;s New York Point of Presence, with Top-of-Book (L1) or Depth-of-Book (L2) options.

<p><span>Expanding coverage to include overnight ATS venues in Exegy&rsquo;s global market data offering is one of several ways Exegy continues to support its growth strategy and reinforce its commitment to proactively address market shifts and evolving client needs.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Solactive is pleased to announce its first collaboration with Indiggo, LLC (Indiggo), resulting in the launch of the Solactive Indiggo ReturnOnLeadership&reg; US Large Cap Index. The new index systematically translates corporate leadership into a rules-based equity benchmark designed to serve as the basis for investment products, marking a new chapter in the evolution of thematic and factor-based investing.</strong></p>
<p><strong>As investors increasingly look beyond traditional financial metrics, leadership quality has emerged as a key factor used to assess organizational alignment, value creation, and execution capability. The index provides differentiated exposure to companies demonstrating these leadership characteristics, representing an alternative thematic approach within the U.S. equity universe.</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>&ldquo;Our collaboration with Indiggo brings a new level of transparency and structure to the concept of leadership, transforming it into a measurable factor that can inform the design of long-term investment strategies.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">commented,</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;Steffen Scheuble</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">, Chief Executive Officer at Solactive,</span><em>&nbsp;&ldquo;This partnership also underscores Solactive&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to delivering innovative indexing solutions that respond to the evolving needs of our clients and the broader investment landscape.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Indiggo, a veteran in the leadership industry, is an AI-driven corporate leadership analytics firm that leverages an objective, proprietary framework to quantify key leadership signals. Its ReturnOnLeadership&reg; (ROL&reg;) score evaluates companies across four core dimensions&mdash;connection to purpose, strategic clarity, leadership alignment, and focused action&mdash;drawing from both structured and unstructured data to deliver measurable insights into leadership quality.</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>&ldquo;We are excited to collaborate with Solactive to provide investors with a way to invest in the eternal factor of leadership&rdquo;,&nbsp;</em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">said Janeen Gelbart, CEO at Indiggo</span>, &ldquo;<em>Today, leadership is more critical than ever, as evidenced by the strong outcomes the ReturnOnLeadership&reg; index generates&rdquo;.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Wedbush Fund Advisers, LLC has filed a registration statement for the first ETF tracking the Solactive Indiggo ReturnOnLeadership&reg; US Large Cap Index, underscoring investor interest in this innovative strategy rooted in corporate leadership performance.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.solactive.com/indices/?index=DE000SL0SYM1">Solactive Indiggo ReturnOnLeadership&reg; US Large Cap Index</a>&nbsp;comprises top 50 constituents from the Solactive GBS United States 500 Index with the highest ROL&reg; scores, provided by Indiggo. Constituents are weighted by ROL&reg; scores rather than market capitalization, emphasizing leadership performance. The index is reviewed and rebalanced quarterly to reflect the most up-to-date leadership assessments and maintain alignment with its rules-based methodology.</strong></p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority And UK Solicitors Regulation Authority Issue Joint Warning To Firms Representing Motor Finance Commission Claims</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The FCA and Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) have today issued a joint warning to claims management companies (CMCs) and law firms involved in motor finance commission claims to make sure consumers don&rsquo;t have multiple representatives for the same claim and are not charged excessive termination fees.</p>
<p><span>The&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/fca-sra-professional-representatives-motor-finance-commission-claims" title="regulators are reminding CMCs and law firms"><span>regulators are reminding CMCs and law firms</span></a><span>&nbsp;that they are expected to have robust checks in place to confirm consumers have not already instructed another representative. The&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/dear-ceo-letters/motor-finance-commission-complaints-multiple-representation.pdf" title="FCA has also written to lenders"><span>FCA has also written to lenders</span></a><span>&nbsp;setting out the potential actions they should take to address this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>If a consumer wishes to switch representatives or terminate an agreement, firms must do so without charging unfair fees. Any fees charged must be reasonable and reflect the work done.</span></p>
<p><span>Fees charged by FCA-regulated CMCs must provide fair value in line with the Consumer Duty. Following scrutiny from the FCA, 2 FCA-regulated CMCs have agreed to change their termination fee policies, protecting 70,000 consumers from excessive charges.</span></p>
<p><span>Similarly, SRA-regulated law firms should act in their clients&rsquo; best interests. They can only bill in line with the agreement the client signed up to before work started and any &lsquo;termination&rsquo; fee must have been clearly stated up-front. Duplicate claims should be resolved through efficient and cost-effective co-operation.</span></p>
<p><span>Sheree Howard, executive director of authorisations, at the FCA, said: 'We&rsquo;ve been clear about our expectations of CMCs. Before starting any case, firms should confirm a customer hasn&rsquo;t already instructed another representative. Where someone signed up without fully understanding what they were agreeing to, we wouldn&rsquo;t expect a termination fee to be charged. If any fee is applied, it must be reasonable, and reflect the work done.'</span><br /><br /><span>Sarah Rapson, chief executive of the SRA, said: 'With potentially millions of claims in this area, protecting consumers is our priority. We expect firms we regulate to abide by the SRA's clear standards and regulations. You must act in the best interest of your clients, including those who may choose to terminate their agreement or who may have signed up to multiple firms.</span></p>
<p>'<span>Firms operating here should be under no illusion as to the requirements. We have reminded them of their responsibilities on a number of occasions, including in a recent Warning Notice and in our updated claims management guidance. We will continue to engage with firms in this area and take action where required.'</span></p>
<p><span>The FCA and SRA will continue to monitor the conduct of CMCs and law firms, and act where poor practices are identified. Poor onboarding and due diligence practices, lack of information to consumers and misleading advertising has contributed to multiple representation.</span></p>
<p><span>The FCA&rsquo;s increased proactive monitoring of financial promotions has led to the removal or amendment of more than 800 misleading adverts by FCA regulated CMCs since January 2024. The FCA&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-opens-investigation-claims-management-company" title="recently opened an investigation into a CMC"><span>recently opened an investigation into a CMC</span></a><span>&nbsp;following concerns about its advertising and sales tactics in relation to potential motor finance commission claims.</span></p>
<p><span>Ahead of the FCA introducing a proposed&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/fca-consults-motor-finance-compensation-scheme" title="motor finance redress scheme"><span>motor finance redress scheme</span></a><span>, it will be launching an advertising campaign on 5 February to warn consumers about scammers pretending to be car finance lenders and falsely claiming that people are owed compensation, despite there being no motor finance compensation scheme in place yet.</span></p>
<h2>Consumer guidance</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consumers do not need to use a CMC or law firm to claim compensation, and they could lose a significant chunk of any money they are owed if they do.</li>
<li>Consumers may choose to be represented, but they must have first had all the relevant information on their options to make an informed choice.</li>
<li>Where claims have more than 1 representative, firms should work together and consult with the customer to agree the sole representative.</li>
<li>Consumers who sign up with more than 1 representative and then choose to cancel may have to pay a fee.</li>
<li>Any termination fee should be reasonable, reflect the work done, and be itemised.</li>
<li>Consumers who believe they weren&rsquo;t given the facts when they signed up or have been unfairly charged by a CMC or law firm should first complain to the firm. If dissatisfied with the response, they should take their complaint to the Claims Management Ombudsman or Legal Ombudsman.</li>
</ul>

<li>Five FCA regulated CMCs have agreed to make changes to their processes following scrutiny, including not taking on new clients until they are able to show they comply with FCA rules.</li>
<li>Separately, using powers under the Consumer Rights Act 2015 and, for the first time, under the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024, the FCA, working closely with the SRA, has required 9 law firms to provide information about their exit fees. Some law firms also provided responses voluntarily. This information has been shared with the SRA.</li>

<title>FSB Warns Of Financial Stability Challenges In Repo Markets</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><span>Repo markets are critical to the functioning of the global financial system and have been involved in several recent episodes of stress, including the March 2020 dash for cash and September 2022 gilt market episode.</span></li>
<li><span>Report warns that leverage, demand and supply imbalances, and high levels of concentration within repo markets have the potential to create strains.</span></li>
<li><span>Report calls on authorities to consider actions to close data gaps, strengthen surveillance, and address vulnerabilities around the build-up of liquidity imbalances and leverage.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) today published a report on&nbsp;<a class="custom-internal-link processed-internal-link" href="https://www.fsb.org/2026/02/vulnerabilities-in-government-bond-backed-repo-markets/">Vulnerabilities in Government Bond-backed Repo Markets</a>.</p>
<p>Repo markets play an important role in facilitating the flow of cash and securities throughout the financial system. The report focuses on the repo markets backed by government bond collateral as this makes up the vast majority of collateral used by market participants. The report estimates that approximately $16 trillion in repo trades backed by government bonds were outstanding, representing around 80% of the total stock of all repo trades, at end-2024.</p>
<p>The report highlights how quickly repo markets were impacted in several recent episodes of market stress and warns that, given the importance of repo markets within the global financial system, it is critical to preserve their functionality, particularly during periods of stress.</p>
<p>The report identifies several vulnerabilities within repo markets that could pose risks to the broader financial system. First, repo markets can facilitate the build-up of leverage in the financial system. Approximately 70% of activity in the non-centrally cleared segment operates with zero haircuts and there are high levels of collateral rehypothecation. Second, demand and supply imbalances can arise quickly in periods of stress if repo lenders are unwilling or unable to provide funds to meet spikes in the demand for liquidity. Third, repo markets are highly concentrated along various dimensions. This concentration could lead to disruptions in the event of failures.</p>
<p>The core nature of repo markets may act as a conduit through several channels in spreading shocks across the financial system. Strains in repo and government bond markets may spill over into each other or across multiple jurisdictions, given the international nature of repo markets. If haircuts are insufficient, they further expose lenders to leveraged counterparties, amplifying risks across the financial system.</p>
<p>The report outlines several measures for authorities to consider in response to these vulnerabilities, including closing data gaps, strengthening surveillance capabilities, and addressing vulnerabilities related to liquidity imbalances and leverage by taking into account the FSB&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a class="custom-internal-link" href="https://www.fsb.org/2025/07/leverage-in-nonbank-financial-intermediation-final-report/">recommendations on leverage in nonbank financial intermediation</a>&nbsp;(NBFI) and&nbsp;<a class="custom-internal-link" href="https://www.fsb.org/2018/03/securities-financing-transactions-reporting-guidelines/">Global Securities Financing Transactions exercise</a>, as well as other relevant international standards.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Background</h2>
<p>This report forms part of the FSB&rsquo;s work programme to enhance resilience in NBFI. Further details on this can be found in its latest&nbsp;<a class="custom-internal-link" href="https://www.fsb.org/2025/07/enhancing-the-resilience-of-nonbank-financial-intermediation-progress-report/">progress report</a>.</p>
<p>The FSB coordinates at the international level the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies and develops and promotes the implementation of effective regulatory, supervisory, and other financial sector policies in the interest of financial stability. It brings together national authorities responsible for financial stability in 24 countries and jurisdictions, international financial institutions, sector-specific international groupings of regulators and supervisors, and committees of central bank experts. The FSB also conducts outreach with approximately 70 other jurisdictions through its six Regional Consultative Groups.</p>
<p>The FSB is chaired by Andrew Bailey, Governor of the Bank of England. The FSB Secretariat is located in Basel, Switzerland and hosted by the Bank for International Settlements.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Disciplinary Committee of Nasdaq Stockholm (the &ldquo;Exchange&rdquo;) has found that Arctic Paper S.A. (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) has breached the rules of Nasdaq Stockholm (the &ldquo;Rulebook&rdquo;) and therefore ordered the Company to pay a fine of three annual fees, corresponding to an amount of SEK 780 000.</p>
<p>On December 27, 2024, the Company issued a press release announcing that the agreement between the subsidiaries Arctic Paper Grycksbo AB and Arctic Paper Munkedal AB and the counterparty S.E.R. Sverige AB had been terminated. The press release stated that the information contained therein was such that the Company was obligated to disclose it under the EU Market Abuse Regulation (&ldquo;MAR&rdquo;).</p>
<p>The Disciplinary Committee notes that, by doing so, the Company has violated Article 17.1 of MAR and Section 3.1.1 of the Rulebook. The Disciplinary Committee considers the breach to be serious, and therefore a fine shall be imposed as a consequence. The Disciplinary Committee sets the fine at three annual fees.</p>
<p>The Disciplinary Committee&rsquo;s decision is available at:</p>

<title>The WFE Creates Listing Stringency Index That Enables Comparison Of Markets</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The World Federation of Exchanges, the global industry association for exchanges and CCPs, has published a paper introducing its Listing Stringency Index (LSI), a standardised framework that can be used to analyse the relative stringency of listing regimes and make informed decisions.</span><br /><br /><span>This unique, survey-based composite measure, developed using data from WFE members, quantifies and compares IPO listing requirements across nine regulatory dimensions. It captures cross-jurisdictional differences and directional regulatory changes, documenting where listing requirements have been tightened or relaxed - particularly in response to ESG-related developments and SME access priorities.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>The index was developed by Dr Ishak Demir, Dr Erfan Ghofrani and Dr Ying Liu, Economists at the WFE, who found that:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>The average LSI score across all exchanges is&nbsp;<strong>58.67</strong>, with scores ranging from&nbsp;<strong>33.33&nbsp;</strong>to&nbsp;<strong>88.89</strong>, where higher scores reflect more stringent IPO listing requirements, suggesting most exchanges adopt a moderately comprehensive regulatory framework.</li>
<li>IPO fees (<strong>92.5%</strong>) and disclosure requirements (<strong>81.25%</strong>) are the most widely enforced dimensions, while financial (<strong>31.25%</strong>) and voting rights (<strong>25%</strong>) are the least commonly applied, reflecting a preference for issuer flexibility in early-stage or high-growth markets.</li>
<li>Exchanges in advanced economies tend to score higher in governance and regulatory approvals, while emerging markets and developing economies often emphasise operational criteria or tax incentives to attract listings.</li>
<li><strong>20&nbsp;</strong>exchanges have implemented more stringent rules over the past 15 years, specifically in ESG disclosure and corporate governance, while&nbsp;<strong>7</strong>&nbsp;exchanges have relaxed regulations, mainly by reducing minimum share price and free float requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /><span>The cross-exchange analysis of the relationship between the LSI and IPO activity found that:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>More stringent listing requirements tend to attract larger IPOs - likely because only more established firms can meet higher regulatory thresholds - they do not significantly impact IPO frequency.&nbsp;<strong>This suggests that stricter listing regimes shape who lists rather than how many firms list, favouring larger and more established issuers.&nbsp;</strong></li>
<li>Conversely, relaxing listing requirements sees increases in both IPO participation and offering size.&nbsp;<strong>This suggests that lowering regulatory barriers, such as minimum share price or free float requirements, can directly expand access to public markets and support larger offerings&nbsp;</strong>- enhancing both the inclusivity and depth of capital formation.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /><strong>Nandini Sukumar, CEO of the World Federation of Exchanges</strong><span>, said, &ldquo;The LSI enables benchmarking and comparative insights to support informed policy dialogue that can enhance inclusivity. By allowing stakeholders to examine how different jurisdictions emphasise accessibility versus investor safeguards, the index helps identify potential regulatory balancing points and supports reflection on how frameworks evolve in response to global trends.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><strong>Dr Pedro Gurrola-Perez, Head of Research at the World Federation of Exchanges</strong><span>, said, &ldquo;Our findings reveal substantial cross-jurisdictional variation in how market entry is regulated, with particularly wide differences in voting rights, financial criteria, and corporate governance rules. With the comparative analysis it allows, the LSI fosters greater transparency, cross-border investment, and regulatory cooperation, while respecting local market conditions.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span>Read the full paper&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://us.list-manage.com/ZfU4dGQui5E?e=979576350c&amp;c2id=74bfd855ac9b4665dc051971f5425071" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a><span>.</span></p>

<title>New SIX White Paper: Swiss Versus US Listings</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-six-white-paper-swiss-versus-us-listings-202624/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-six-white-paper-swiss-versus-us-listings-202624/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>SIX has published a new white paper edition today. It evaluates the aspects of a Swiss versus a US Listing. Created in cooperation with the leading business law firm Homburger, the white paper &lsquo;Evaluating the Aspects of a Swiss versus a US Listing&rsquo; highlights to potential IPO candidates the benefits of SIX Swiss Exchange in the strategically important choice of listing location.</span></p>
<p>Switzerland is uniquely positioned as a listing destination, yet tech companies sometimes gravitate in their listing considerations toward the US in pursuit of higher valuations and broader perceived advantages such as investor access, liquidity, and research coverage. To separate fact from fiction around these factors, SIX has published a new edition of the white paper&nbsp;<a href="https://www.six-group.com/dam/download/sites/exchange-services/listing/us-bias-paper.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&lsquo;Evaluating the Aspects of a Swiss versus a US Listing&rsquo;.</a>&nbsp;The findings reveal that Switzerland&rsquo;s IPO credentials stack up strongly against the US.</p>
<p>Access to US investors does not require a US listing. A listing on SIX Swiss Exchange enables issuers to target US institutional buyers via a Rule 144A offering, which allows securities to be sold to qualified institutional buyers without needing to register with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. At the same time, Switzerland has one of Europe&rsquo;s largest pools of investor capital &ndash; valued at USD 207 billion &ndash; which is second only in size to the UK.</p>
<p>Another misconception is that the US offer unrivalled liquidity, relative to Europe. In reality, the liquidity gap between the leading US exchanges and their European peers is overstated. A comparison of 90-day post-IPO average daily trading volumes relative to market capitalization shows that while US IPOs generally have a higher turnover velocity than their European counterparts, this is only true for US domestic issuers. Smaller foreign private issuers (FPIs), in particular, do not appear to benefit from the same liquidity uplift. European and Swiss markets consistently deliver tighter bid&ndash;ask spreads than US exchanges &ndash; an essential indicator of trading efficiency.</p>
<p>The gulf between analyst coverage in the US and Europe is also narrow. Analysis shows FPIs in the US do not automatically benefit from broader analyst coverage and may struggle for consistent attention without strong brand recognition or a significant US investor base.</p>
<p>And finally, while Switzerland may be one of the more expensive places in the world to live, the cost of going public on SIX Swiss Exchange is relatively low, when benchmarked against other leading markets. Underwriting fees in Switzerland range between 2% to 5% of gross proceeds, whereas in the US they average 4% to 7%. Legal fees and regulatory compliance costs are also reined in by Switzerland&rsquo;s proportionate, principles-based regulatory framework resulting in a more predictable, efficient, and issuer-friendly path to the public markets. These aspects also lower the execution and liability risks for issuers.</p>

<title>New Zealand Financial Markets Authority Issues Market Cleanliness Report</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="element dnadesign__elemental__models__elementcontent" id="e12614">
<div class="col-auto col-lg-6 content-element__content">
<p>The Financial Markets Authority (FMA) - Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko &ndash; has issued its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fma.govt.nz/library/research/market-cleanliness-in-the-new-zealand-equity-market/" title="Link to report page">latest market cleanliness report</a>, which shows continued minor insider trading improvements over the past two decades.</p>
<p>The report compares data from 2004 to 2025 and shows the general trend of a gradual decline in insider trading on the NZX.</p>
<p>Executive Director, Response and Enforcement Louise Unger said, &ldquo;A clean market is one that is free of insider trading. &nbsp;Market cleanliness, reflected by low insider trading rates, is an essential part of any well-functioning market.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The report shows that overall, New Zealand&rsquo;s stock market cleanliness is fairly stable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By measuring market cleanliness regularly, we maintain an aggregate view of overall market conduct. This complements our core work investigating individual cases of insider trading, which are referred to us by NZ RegCo, NZX&rsquo;s oversight firm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because market abuse such as insider trading can erode trust, we are prioritising monitoring, detecting and deterring market abuse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ms Unger said insider conduct was a priority for the FMA, as highlighted in the FMA&rsquo;s most recent Financial Conduct Report.</p>
<p>"As New Zealand&rsquo;s financial conduct regulator, we have a statutory obligation to promote and facilitate capital markets that are fair, efficient and transparent, to provide an environment that encourages investor participation and allows for businesses to raise funds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The importance can particularly be seen in our recent enforcement actions focused on the inappropriate use of material information by insiders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In April 2025 a former treasury accountant with Heartland Bank Limited was sentenced on three charges of insider trading brought against him by the FMA, while in May 2025 the Court of Appeal increased the sentence handed down in an earlier insider trading case, relating to Pushpay. These cases demonstrate the FMA&rsquo;s commitment to holding individuals accountable and reinforcing the integrity of New Zealand&rsquo;s financial markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ms Unger noted market cleanliness measurements were volatile by nature. Rather than providing a definitive signal of the degree of insider trading, this update gave a sense of the overall trends and underscored the value and relevance of continued surveillance, she said.</p>

<title>ASX Announces Collaboration With Bloomberg Indices To Launch ASX-Bloomberg AusBond Index Futures</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASX, in collaboration with Bloomberg Indices, plans to introduce new futures contracts that provide market participants with exchange-listed products to track the Bloomberg AusBond Composite Bond Index (BACM0) and Bloomberg AusBond Credit Index (BACR0), subject to regulatory clearance and industry readiness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These indices are widely recognised as representative benchmarks of Australian fixed income markets and are designed to deliver efficient, transparent, and capital-effective solutions for managing exposure to Australian sovereign and credit fixed income markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ASX-Bloomberg AusBond Index Futures will give market participants the ability to manage interest rate and credit risk, replicate index performance, and implement new hedging and liquidity management strategies.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br clear="ALL" /> Listed on ASX 24, the contracts will have quarterly expiries and be cash‑settled, similar in contract design to ASX&rsquo;s Treasury Bond Futures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ASX 24 interest rate futures trading surged to record highs during calendar year 2025, achieving 17% growth over the previous record calendar year of 2024. This growth highlights the strength and deep liquidity in ASX's interest rate futures which has supported a dynamic marketplace with meeting their hedging and risk management requirements throughout a period of heightened volatility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ASX 24 remains the leading trading venue for Australian and New Zealand interest rate, equity and commodity futures and options, underpinned by some of the world&rsquo;s longest trading hours, a diverse and highly liquid trading community, and the stability of Australia&rsquo;s AAA‑rated market.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Allan McGregor, ASX Head of Rates and Benchmarks</b>, said:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;ASX runs the world&rsquo;s fourth-largest interest rate derivatives market and leads the Asia-Pacific region, providing global access to deep futures liquidity across major trading hours. The ASX-Bloomberg AusBond Index Futures expands and diversifies ASX&rsquo;s fixed income tools, offering an efficient and capital-effective way for participants to manage interest rate and credit risk.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Fateen Sharaby, Head of Index Derivatives at Bloomberg Index Services Limited</b>, said:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bloomberg Indices is proud to support ASX's launch of futures linked to our Bloomberg AusBond Indices, which serve as leading benchmarks for Australia&rsquo;s fixed income markets. Pairing our transparent methodologies and robust governance with ASX&rsquo;s leading derivatives platform will provide market participants with exchange-traded tools for managing credit exposure and represents a natural evolution of index-based solutions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>ASX's expansion into fixed income index futures enhances its current suite of products which enable clients to trade and manage risk across asset classes, including futures, options, cash, and over-the-counter markets.</p>

<title>ASIC Urges Super Trustees To Step Up And Address Serious Gaps In Anti-Scam And Fraud Protections</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC is urging immediate action from superannuation trustees to strengthen anti-scam and fraud practices after its latest review exposed significant gaps in communications for members.</p>
<p>ASIC assessed scams and fraud-related website content across 47 superannuation funds, benchmarking them against comparable website content from the big four banks (ANZ, Commonwealth Bank, NAB, and Westpac).</p>
<p>The review focused on the availability, quality and actionability of anti-scams and fraud content, including by checking the website content for clarity and relevance, prominence on the website and readability. ASIC&rsquo;s review found banks scored positively in over 80% of criteria assessed, whereas most super funds scored positively against just 40&ndash;60% of the same criteria.</p>
<p>ASIC Commissioner Simone Constant said despite being custodians of $4.3 trillion in Australian retirement savings, the superannuation industry has been slow to respond to evolving scams and fraud risks to members.</p>
<p>'Our latest review of superannuation website content confirmed that super funds often lacked clarity, accessibility, and support for scam victims. When benchmarked against other industries, super funds fell short for victims,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is time for super trustees to step up and minimise scam and fraud risks to members, which according to the National Anti-Scam Centre suffered $22 million in losses from super-related scams in 2025.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Super trustees have a clear and unavoidable responsibility to oversee risk and ensure these emerging threats are identified and managed actively. Yet scam and fraud prevention, detection, and response capabilities are still not sufficiently addressing risks to members.&rsquo;</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s review identified key areas for improvement:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Availability:</strong>&nbsp;While most super fund websites included some material on scams and fraud, this information was often hard to find or lacked prominence. Several super funds provided no scam or fraud information on their websites at all.</li>
<li><strong>Quality:</strong>&nbsp;Two-thirds of super fund websites included examples of scams and fraud, but the quality varied. Content was frequently outdated, generic, or overly complex. Only 19% of super funds clearly defined what constitutes a scam, and one-third did not provide messaging on their website on common scam signs.</li>
<li><strong>Actionability:</strong>&nbsp;Only about one third of super fund websites provided actionable information for members to prevent or report scams and fraud. Just one in five offered a dedicated contact method for scam and fraud reporting. Banks consistently outperformed funds in providing clear, detailed action steps and dedicated reporting channels.</li>
</ul>
<p>&lsquo;The superannuation industry must act now to ensure its members are informed, protected, and supported in the face of increasing digital threats,&rsquo; Commissioner Constant added.</p>
<p>ASIC has reached out to selected super trustees, highlighting these concerns and emphasizing the urgent need for improved website communications about scams and fraud.</p>
<p>Superannuation trustees are strongly encouraged to read and consider ASIC&rsquo;s January 2025&nbsp;<a href="https://download.asic.gov.au/media/rucknqex/asic-letter-to-super-trustees-scams-29-january-2025.pdf">letter</a>&nbsp;on protecting Australians against scams and fraud, as well as read and address the baseline measures we set out in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-761-scam-prevention-detection-and-response-by-the-four-major-banks/" title="REP 761 Scam prevention, detection and response by the four major banks">REP 761</a>&nbsp;on scam prevention, detection and response by the four major banks, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-790-anti-scam-practices-of-banks-outside-the-four-major-banks/" title="REP 790 Anti-scam practices of banks outside the four major banks">REP 790</a>&nbsp;on anti-scam practices of banks outside the four major banks.</p>
<p>ASIC also encourages trustees to closely monitor the Commonwealth Government&rsquo;s rollout of the Scams Prevention Framework (SPF), including to inform their own anti-scam practices. While currently excluded from the SPF, the government has said the framework would be&nbsp;<a href="https://ministers.treasury.gov.au/ministers/stephen-jones-2022/speeches/second-reading-speech-parliament-house">open to the future inclusion</a>&nbsp;of the superannuation industry.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s latest review involved a desktop analysis of anti-scam and fraud-related website content across 47 superannuation funds open to members.</p>
<p>Across the whole financial system, technological innovations and data breaches&mdash;including breaches involving identity documents&mdash;continue to heighten the risk of scams and fraud.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ASIC is concerned that the Australian superannuation industry is a growing target for scams and fraud, especially given its size, diverse membership and increasing digital activity. This was also highlighted by ASIC Commissioner Simone Constant in a January 2025&nbsp;<a href="https://download.asic.gov.au/media/rucknqex/asic-letter-to-super-trustees-scams-29-january-2025.pdf">letter</a>&nbsp;to superannuation trustees:&nbsp;<em>'As banks, telecommunications providers and other financial service businesses increase their anti-scam and anti-fraud capabilities, superannuation trustees must do the same or risk becoming a soft target</em>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Supporting better retirement outcomes and member services and improving consumer outcomes remain a core strategic priority for ASIC. Combatting investment scams and reducing their impact on Australian consumers continues to be an ongoing priority for ASIC.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s Moneysmart has a&nbsp;<a href="https://moneysmart.gov.au/online-safety/protect-yourself-from-scams">dedicated webpage</a>&nbsp;to help consumers minimise financial scam risks, which includes important guidance from the National Anti-Scams Centre (NASC).</p>

<title>Artificial Intelligence And The Future Of Investment Management - Remarks At The Investment Company Institute (ICI) Winter Board Meeting, Brian Daly, Director, SEC Division Of Investment Management, Investment Company Institute (ICI) Winter Board Meeting, Manalapan, FL (Virtual Participation), Feb. 3, 2026</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good morning, everyone. I am pleased to join you this morning, although, I must say I am jealous of the Florida weather you are all enjoying. Here in DC it is still well below freezing.</p>
<p>Before I begin, I must inform &ndash; or remind &ndash; you that these remarks are provided in my official capacity as the Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s Director of the Division of Investment Management, but do not necessarily reflect the views of the Commission, the Commissioners, or other members of the staff.</p>
<p>I would like to talk a bit today about how we in the Division of Investment Management are looking at the tremendous changes &ndash; and opportunities &ndash; that artificial intelligence affords both you, as key personnel at investment advisers and investment companies, as well as the ultimate investors &ndash; who often are individual retail investors &ndash; who purchase your investment products and advisory services.</p>
<p>If time permits, I can also share how I see the Division &ndash; as your friendly neighborhood regulator &ndash; fitting into that new worldview.</p>
<p>Ready?</p>
<p><em>Now, when we talk about &ldquo;technology&rdquo; issues, there is often a tendency to focus, as lawyers, on how very specific technological developments will be addressed under the securities laws.</em></p>
<p><em>For example:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Does web posting constitute an adequate mechanism for furnishing information to investors?</em></li>
<li><em>Are e-mails &ldquo;correspondence&rdquo; for regulatory purposes?</em></li>
<li><em>Will storage of records in electronic form satisfy record retention rules?</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Resolution of these issues in a timely and sensible fashion is quite important to the effective operation of the securities laws and the financial markets.</em></p>
<p>If you think my introductory scoping passage was insightful and current, you're right.&nbsp; And wrong.</p>
<p>In fact, that entire passage was an excerpt from a speech by the late Giovanni Prezioso, in one of his last speeches as General Counsel of the Securities and Exchange Commission.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2005.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I began with that passage because it shows that we, both industry and regulators, have not made all that much progress on the three core issues Giovanni mused about twenty years ago:</p>
<ul>
<li>Although we are focused on this topic, we have not, to date, formally proposed a comprehensive &ldquo;e-Delivery&rdquo; rule;</li>
<li>Confusion over what electronic communications fall within the Books and Records Rule (or other retention requirements) remains a live topic; and</li>
<li>The Books and Records Rule is still reflective of an age when advisers typed client letters that were snail-mailed (back then, we just called it &ldquo;mail&rdquo;).</li>
</ul>
<p>Just to underscore how much time has gone by, in that speech Giovanni shared a story on how he watched his two pre-teen daughters vote by phone for the winner of an &ldquo;American Idol&rdquo; episode.&nbsp; Marveling at the use of 2005 technology, he wondered why large public companies could not have instantaneous shareholder votes.</p>
<p>By the way, those two girls, both accomplished lawyers, have kids of their own.</p>
<p>In other words, we are literally looking at a lost generation of limited progress.</p>
<p><em>Let&rsquo;s turn lemons into lemonade.</em></p>
<p>But - instead - let&rsquo;s look at this need to modernize as a generational&nbsp;<em>opportunity.</em></p>
<h2>AI and the Investment Process.</h2>
<p>Today&rsquo;s cutting edge technology centers on artificial intelligence.&nbsp; We can debate whether generative AI will win out against Yann LeCun's "world models,&rdquo; but the point is that AI is here.</p>
<p>And intelligent use of artificial intelligence can, should, and will catalyze a transformation of the technology of investment management.</p>
<p>The fact that AI can improve the investment management process is not news.&nbsp; Many of you are already utilizing AI, but the feedback from numerous industry surveys, from our direct outreach, and from our partners in the Examinations Division is that adoption is still uneven and often tentative.</p>
<p>We hear that the greatest impediment to a more widespread adoption of AI is liability concerns.&nbsp; Many advisers are afraid that using AI creates exposure if (when) there are losses.&nbsp; And I recognize that some of that concern results from SEC examination and enforcement efforts that have accompanied prior waves of technological advancement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But liability concerns should not be insurmountable obstacles.&nbsp; We have dealt with technologically-driven shifts in the past.&nbsp; For example, the advent of algorithmic and quantitative models caused much concern, but after a period of adjustment, the industry settled into a rough equilibrium marked by commonly-used disclosures and accepted compliance practices.</p>
<p>I do recognize that AI is different. With quantitative strategies, a key safeguard was making sure that there was a human &ldquo;in the loop&rdquo; to pull the plug, in real time, if the models began misbehaving.&nbsp; But AI is different &ndash; the goal of AI is to take the human out of loop.&nbsp; At least out of the real-time response loop.&nbsp; There will still be humans involved, to be sure, but if we are being honest &ndash; they are going to be a more remote and supervisory role.</p>
<p>That will present new challenges. No doubt.&nbsp;But these are challenges that need to be addressed, in part because your competitors will incessantly force each of you to deploy more AI in your investment function.</p>
<p>So where does the Division of Investment Management fit into this?&nbsp; Well, we could issue a bunch of rules and guidance on what your fiduciary duties require you to do.&nbsp; But that will take some time and, by the time they take effect, the market and the technology may have moved on, rendering them irrelevant.&nbsp; (&ldquo;WORM retention standards, anyone?&rdquo;)</p>
<p>Or &hellip; we could listen to you.</p>
<p>To the extent that you have concerns about how our existing laws, rules and regulations constrain your deployment of new technologies, please reach out.&nbsp; You have heard our Chairman refer to the SEC as &ldquo;The Innovation Commission.&rdquo;&nbsp;Given that, you should assume that inbound emails that say something like &ldquo;I have a novel approach that is good for investors&hellip;&rdquo; will grab our attention.</p>
<p>So this is a request for engagement.&nbsp; We want to work with advisers, investment companies, and other market participants to enable new technologies to come online, and to work with you on understanding how the industry can do that and still retain traditional investor protections.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>LLMs and Investor Disclosures</h2>
<p>One topic that comes up time and again is:&nbsp;<em>When will the Commission act to modernize fund document delivery?</em></p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not at liberty to comment on initiatives unless they have been published in a RegFlex agenda.&nbsp; But I do want to reflect on the nature of the requests we are receiving.</p>
<p>At their core, the &ldquo;E-&rdquo; requests center around making&nbsp;electronic delivery the default mechanism&nbsp;for delivering prospectuses and other fund documents.&nbsp; And &ldquo;electronic delivery&rdquo; generally is conceived as sending PDFs by email to end retail investors.</p>
<p>And while that could and would be an important step for many in the industry, I&rsquo;d like to offer a broader perspective.</p>
<p>Because what we&rsquo;re really talking about here is using&nbsp;<span>1990s technology</span>&mdash;email and PDFs&mdash;to deliver disclosures to investors in&nbsp;<span>2026</span>. That&rsquo;s not innovation. That&rsquo;s just digitizing paper.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;d like to pose a question:&nbsp;<span>What should the next step in our digital journey look like?</span></p>
<p>From my perspective, this is the right time, with the right leadership in the White House and at the SEC, to think boldly. And to the extent that market participants are ready to innovate and push the envelope, we want to hear from you.</p>
<p>When I shared some of these thoughts with Commissioner Peirce during my pre-hire interview, her response stuck with me. She said something to the effect of:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Innovation is rare in this space because we&rsquo;ve either prohibited it or strangled it with regulation.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a lot of truth in that.</p>
<p>At the same time, history shows that when unelected bureaucrats&mdash;like myself&mdash;try to use the regulatory pen to drive technology forward, the results are mixed at best. The greatest innovations come from the market itself.</p>
<p>So let me offer this idea&mdash;not as a mandate, not as guidance, and certainly not as investment advice&mdash;but as a&nbsp;<span>conversation starter</span>:</p>
<p class="cke5-custom-block-indent-1"><em>What if we reimagined disclosure using&nbsp;<span>large language models</span>?</em></p>
<p>Think about it: Today, a direct-sold mutual fund adviser communicates with retail investors through a massive prospectus, filled with risk factors, financials, biographical data, and investment process descriptions. That&rsquo;s just the beginning. There&rsquo;s also the prospectus supplement, the SAI, periodic reports, and financial statements&mdash;an entire library of information, often written by teams of in-house and external lawyers, and housed in different locations.</p>
<p>Now, imagine the retail investor interacting, not with a 200-page document, but with a&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>fund- or adviser-provided AI agent</span>&nbsp; An autonomous AI agent can be trained on the library of fund documents and then answer - in plain English &ndash; questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>What do you invest in?</em></li>
<li><em>What fees will I pay?</em></li>
<li><em>How do I redeem my shares?</em></li>
<li><em>Do you hold short positions? And what is a short position, anyway?</em></li>
<li><em>Do you have conflicts of interest?</em></li>
<li><em>What benchmarks do you think are useful performance comparisons?&nbsp; Can you generate some comparison charts?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>This kind of tool could be a&nbsp;<span>tremendous bridge</span>&nbsp;between investors and the disclosures that all too often are misunderstood or &ndash; even worse &ndash; go unread.</p>
<p>Yes, there are liability questions. But there are also liability questions for the AI systems used by surgeons, law firms, and logistics firms moving critical goods around the world. These are not insurmountable challenges.</p>
<p>Yes, there are also regulatory questions: Would the model be considered marketing? Would it require registration as an investment adviser? How would we supervise it?</p>
<p>These are real questions. But they&rsquo;re also solvable ones&mdash;with thoughtful legal analysis, regulatory guidance, and, most importantly,&nbsp;<span>collaboration</span>.</p>
<p>So I invite you&mdash;if you have ideas, if you want to explore a pilot program, if you would like to request a no-action letter or staff guidance&mdash;<span>come talk to us</span>. We can&rsquo;t promise every idea will make it to market. But we can promise that every idea will be&nbsp;<span>heard</span>.</p>

<title>Ontario Securities Commission Publishes Research On Using Gamification To Improve Investor Outcomes</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) today published its third behavioural science research report on gamification and retail investing, continuing its extensive work to understand how digital engagement practices influence investor behaviour.</p>
<p>The new report,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/en/investors/investor-research-and-reports/gamification-and-retail-investing-positive-use-cases-and-mitigation-techniques"><em>Gamification and Retail Investing: Positive Use Cases and Mitigation Techniques</em></a><em>,</em>&nbsp;explores situations in which gamification can enhance investor decision-making and outcomes. The report also explores various techniques designed to mitigate the negative influence of gamification on investor behaviour.</p>
<p>As a core component of the research, the OSC conducted an online experiment with over 4,000 Canadians who took part in a simulated trading environment. Participants invested a hypothetical $10,000 across eight stocks while being exposed to one of four gamification techniques designed to increase the diversification of their portfolios:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Diversification Score</span>&nbsp;&ndash; a real-time score (out of 100) based on diversification level</li>
<li><span>Goal Framing</span>&nbsp;&ndash; setting diversification goals and tracking progress in reaching those goals</li>
<li><span>Leaderboards</span>&nbsp;&ndash; comparing diversification scores to other users</li>
<li><span>Rewards (Badges)</span>&nbsp;&ndash; awarding badges for meeting diversification thresholds</li>
</ul>
<p>Results showed that all four techniques had a modest yet positive impact, producing a 3.5% to 4.5% increase in portfolio diversification. Diversification is a strategy to help investors mitigate risk and smooth returns over the long term.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Understanding the behavioural impact of gamification is critical to ensuring that digital engagement practices support, rather than undermine, investor outcomes,&rdquo; said Kevin Fine, Senior Vice President, Thought Leadership at the OSC. &ldquo;Gamification techniques can put investors at risk, but when used thoughtfully, they can encourage positive behaviours like portfolio diversification.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The new report builds on insights found in the OSC&rsquo;s research report&nbsp;<em>Digital Engagement Practices in Retail Investing: Gamification &amp; Other Behavioural Techniques</em>, followed by two additional research reports:&nbsp;<em>Digital Engagement Practices: Dark Patterns in Retail Investing</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Gamification Revisited: New Experimental Findings in Retail Investing</em>.</p>

<title>Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization Issues Guidance On Digital Asset Custody For Crypto-Asset Trading Platforms</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/canadian-investment-regulatory-organization-issues-guidance-on-digital-asset-cus-202623/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/canadian-investment-regulatory-organization-issues-guidance-on-digital-asset-cus-202623/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) published a new&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ciro.ca/newsroom/publications/notice-ciros-digital-asset-custody-framework" target="_self" title="Notice on CIRO&rsquo;s Digital Asset Custody Framework">Digital Asset Custody Framework</a>, setting clear expectations for the custody of digital assets by Dealer Members operating Crypto-Asset Trading Platforms (CTPs) in Canada.</p>
<p>Developed in collaboration with industry stakeholders and informed by regulatory developments in other jurisdictions, the framework reflects the continued evolution of CIRO&rsquo;s approach to crypto-asset regulation, and addresses the technological, operational, and legal risks unique to digital assets, which cover crypto assets and tokenized assets, including stablecoins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Custody is one of the most critical points of risk in the crypto ecosystem,&rdquo; said Alexandra Williams, Senior-Vice President, Strategy, Innovation and Stakeholder Protection. &ldquo;This new framework gives firms the flexibility to operate and innovate responsibly. It reflects what we heard from the industry and demonstrates CIRO&rsquo;s commitment to being an agile and trusted regulator.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The framework enhances expectations for how client assets are held, including through third-party custodians, and builds on existing custody requirements, all of which will be imposed through terms and conditions of membership. This approach allows CIRO to respond quickly to risks highlighted by past failures in the crypto sector, where contributions of losses, such as hacking, fraud, inadequate governance and insolvency, lead to investor vulnerability and losses.</p>
<p>A key feature of the framework is its tiered, risk-based structure, which provides firms with flexibility to diversify their crypto custody arrangements while maintaining strong safeguards for investor protection. Reviewing and enhancing custody and segregation requirements for crypto assets held by CIRO Members operating CTPs was identified as one of CIRO&rsquo;s public regulatory priorities for 2026.</p>
<p>The guidance note is effective immediately.</p>

<hr />
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to think of a more symbolic venue to discuss driving change in the insurance sector than the QEII Centre.</p>
<p>Step outside, and you&rsquo;re in the shadow of both the Houses of Parliament, and Westminster Abbey. Scrutiny, change and serving citizens on one side. Tradition on the other.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where insurance sits, too.</p>
<p>As an industry, you have to balance the new with the non-negotiables &ndash; finding ways to innovate while ensuring outcomes and trust keep pace. Throughout history, you&rsquo;ve done exactly that.</p>
<p>The UK Customer Satisfaction Index shows you understand and care for your consumers.</p>
<p>That, alongside your ability to spot a need and build a market around it, is what makes our insurance markets world-leading.</p>
<p>In our ever-changing world, insurance is critical. It shields millions of consumers from losses that could make them financially vulnerable. Underpins resilience for businesses. Drives growth through effective risk management. And is central to a resilient UK economy.</p>
<p>Insurance attracts huge amounts of investment from across the globe and makes up nearly one-quarter of total financial services exports.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which is why we don&rsquo;t just want you to succeed. We need you to succeed.</p>
<p>But for markets to continue to grow, firms must feel confident enough to explore new ways to unleash innovation.</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<h2>We&rsquo;re here to support you</h2>
<p>Tools like our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/innovation/ai-lab" title="AI Lab">AI lab</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/innovation" title="FCA Innovation Hub">Sandboxes</a>&nbsp;and new&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/authorisation/scale-up-unit" title="Scale-up Unit: supporting fast-growing, innovative firms ">Scale-up Unit</a>&nbsp;are there to support you as you innovate. I encourage you to use them, and use them early &ndash; especially our Sandboxes.</p>
<p>They offer a safe environment to test new products and ideas to find out what does or doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s striking that of the nearly 3,000 firms that have applied across our Innovation Pathways and Sandboxes, just 208 were insurance-related. We&rsquo;d like to see this number increase.</p>
<p>Because when you do apply, you are more successful than other sectors: overall acceptance rates across all sectors are around 31%. For insurance firms, it&rsquo;s 50%.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen some creative, impactful Sandbox work coming from insurance.</p>
<p>For example, a firm developed a new business model for bike insurance. It charged monthly, based on the exact cost of all claims settled by the pool of consumers, but capped premiums so bills would always be predictable. We helped them design a testing plan with appropriate safeguards in the Regulatory Sandbox &ndash; and today, they&rsquo;re delivering the plan on a greater scale.</p>
<p>We know it&rsquo;s tough to innovate in this space.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not impossible.</p>
<p>The door is open. You just have to walk through it.</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<h2>Bring consumers with you</h2>
<p>The market is at its best when innovation is something consumers feel &ndash; not just something firms build.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not enough to create and scale a good product.</p>
<p>To succeed, you have to bring consumers with you when you walk through the door to innovation.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t just assume they&rsquo;ll come along.</p>
<p>Our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/financial-lives/financial-lives-2024" title="Financial Lives 2024 survey">2024 Financial Lives Survey</a>&nbsp;found that 66% of consumers have low trust in the sector, making insurance one of the least trusted parts of retail financial services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not easy to hear, I know. But rather than a rebuke, let&rsquo;s take that as motivation. To work together. Improve those numbers. And build greater trust. Because if insurance underpins resilience, trust underpins insurance.</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t be easy, but it is possible to build that trust by improving the consumer experience.</p>
<p>How? Be clear about coverage and test consumer understanding. Handle claims promptly, fairly and transparently. Test outcomes against the Consumer Duty.</p>
<p>Since the Duty took effect, we have seen higher industry standards and tangible consumer benefits.</p>
<p>And we are acting where firms don&rsquo;t meet our expectations.</p>
<p>We recently stopped one insurer offering unsuitable products to 30,000 consumers &ndash; resulting in &pound;1m paid in compensation.</p>
<p>When consumers were being shortchanged after their car was stolen or written off,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/over-270000-motorists-receive-motor-insurance-compensation-insurers" title="Over 270,000 motorists to receive &pound;200m in motor insurance compensation after insurers improve their claims processes">we secured &pound;200m in compensation for 270,000 consumers</a>.</p>
<p>Our action on Guaranteed Asset Protection insurance&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/freedom-information/information-gap-insurance-november-2024" title="Information on GAP Insurance - November 2024">will save consumers an estimated &pound;70m</a>.</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<h2>Looking ahead for consumers</h2>
<p>Our focus on seeing good consumer outcomes will continue throughout 2026.</p>
<p>In the last few years, we have looked closely at the retail insurance sector. We have used our competition market study tools to analyse how the pure protection market is working, as well as premium finance. And reviewed the motor, home and travel insurance markets.</p>
<p>There is room for improvement.</p>
<p>But there are also examples of the market working well. And changes being made to better support consumers because of the Consumer Duty.</p>
<p>We do not believe we need any new market-wide interventions to drive positive progress. We will achieve our aim, of good consumer outcomes and innovative markets, through the Duty.</p>
<p>For example, we recently acted to ensure&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/falling-cost-premium-finance-saving-consumers-around-157m-year" title="Falling cost of premium finance saving consumers around &pound;157m a year">consumers paying for insurance monthly get fair value from their provider</a>. Many of the firms we looked at were delivering it. But some were not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rather than write new regulation, we used the Duty&rsquo;s fair value rules to get better outcomes for consumers, faster. I&rsquo;m pleased to report that alongside base rate reductions and firms&rsquo; own fair value assessments, this has helped save consumers &pound;157m annually.</p>
<p>There is more to come.</p>
<p>This year, we will complete our work on motor total loss and home and travel to better support consumers. And we will see that firms make the necessary improvements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because trust is built or lost at the point of claim.</p>
<p>Following the Which? super complaint, we will continue our work improving claims handling and consumer understanding of what they&rsquo;re buying.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll also expand our review of firms&rsquo; oversight to outsourced claims processes. This is in addition to our focus on Managing General Agents.</p>
<p>Finally, we will review products and services for indicators of poor outcomes. And look at how firms treat vulnerable consumers.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re not just looking backwards. We&rsquo;re looking forwards, too.</p>
<p>Too many people still lack protection for when things go wrong &ndash; 26%&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://fair4allfinance.org.uk/learning-from-lived-experience-to-build-a-more-inclusive-insurance-and-protection-offering/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)">have no insurance at all<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>. Leaving millions exposed when life hits hardest.</p>
<p>We should all be working to increase access to insurance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/market-studies/ms24-1-1-market-distribution-pure-protection" title="MS24/1: Pure Protection Market Study">Pure Protection Market Study</a>&nbsp;shows the market mostly works well. We see firms delivering good value for consumers. Most can claim successfully, with 98% accepted and &pound;5.4 billion paid out in 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still, 58% of adults don&rsquo;t hold a pure protection product, even though many would benefit from one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a significant protection gap. One that we will work with you and other stakeholders to close.</p>
<p>There is more to come before we conclude our work in this area:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>assessments of income protection claims ratios,</li>
<li>incentives to churn consumers, and&nbsp;</li>
<li>claims experience</li>
</ul>
<p>Our final report will be published later this year.</p>
<p>We welcome your engagement with the&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/financial-inclusion-strategy/financial-inclusion-strategy" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)">Financial Inclusion Strategy<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/motor-insurance-taskforce-final-report" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)">Government&rsquo;s Motor Insurance Taskforce Report<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>. And are committed to playing our part in that work.</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<h2>Looking ahead for wholesale markets</h2>
<p>While our focus on the Consumer Duty remains to drive better consumer outcomes, we also want to enable our wholesale markets to thrive.</p>
<p>These are markets defined by customisation, where specialised risk-taking is enabled.&nbsp;Keith Richards&rsquo; hands. David Beckham&rsquo;s legs. Bruce Springsteen&rsquo;s voice. A sommelier&rsquo;s sense of smell and taste.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That calls for special protections. And proportionality and clarity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have listened carefully to your feedback around the application of the Duty for wholesale firms. And have already acted to remove some disproportionate burdens in your sector.</p>
<p>We are consulting on removing unnecessary data returns, and want to consult on the disapplication of the Duty to overseas consumers in Q2. We&rsquo;ve already received valuable feedback on this and will keep the conversation going in roundtables.</p>
<p>Some want us to move even faster. But we know it isn&rsquo;t sensible to tweak insurance rules without considering how they interact with the Duty.</p>
<p>Which is why we will be consulting on them together. To provide clarity on how the future framework applies.</p>
<p>More broadly, we&rsquo;re committed to re-setting expectations around the application of the Consumer Duty to wholesale markets.</p>
<p>The Duty doesn&rsquo;t apply to purely wholesale activity. Only if firms have a material impact on retail consumers.</p>
<p>Some firms have misunderstood this. Others have had to spend too much time clarifying how it does not apply, and need to know when enough is enough. We also know applying the Duty across distribution chains can be complex.</p>
<p>So, we are taking action.</p>
<p>We have already set out a four-point plan for our work to the Chancellor. Clarified expectations for firms working together. And announced plans to draw clearer lines between retail and professional investors.</p>
<p>In the first half of 2026, we will consult on changes to the Duty&rsquo;s scope and application to reduce duplication and keep requirements lean, and outline our approach to removing businesses with non-UK consumers from its scope.</p>
<p>We will also review how our wider conduct expectations for insurers apply internationally.</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<h2>The FCA&rsquo;s role</h2>
<p>The FCA is here to support the success and integrity of the entire market.</p>
<p>The consumers, who need access to products that will help them navigate their financial lives. And firms, as they grow and innovate.</p>
<p>But a prescriptive one-size-fits-all approach does not support markets to innovate and change.</p>
<p>So, we are taking an increasingly outcomes-focused approach to regulation. And overhauling our supervisory model.</p>
<p>Supervision is there for a reason. It allows us to act before harm becomes systemic, and deliver better outcomes for consumers and markets more quickly than we would through enforcement.</p>
<p>There is still room for us to work more smartly. With a more predictable, purposeful and proportionate approach.</p>
<p>Engagement will change.</p>
<p>We want to increase the number of firms we are in direct contact with and scale the intensity of our ongoing supervision depending on risk. Less intensive supervision for those doing the right thing. Stronger action where harm is highest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To minimise burden, we will ask only for data we need. And use new technology to manage and analyse it.</p>
<p>It is important that I state that we do need data &ndash; the right data, at the right time, helps us spot harm and act early.</p>
<p>Importantly, our supervisory priorities will be more predictable.</p>
<p>We have stopped publishing our routine 'Dear CEO' portfolio letters and moved to new annual market reports that will outline our regulatory priorities predictably and consistently.</p>
<p>These have been piloted in just one sector: yours. A clear sign of how important the insurance market is.</p>
<p>We are testing this approach with firms, our panels and trade associations so we can take feedback.</p>
<p>But keep in mind that we often get different and conflicting views. Some of you want more detail. Others, less. We can&rsquo;t promise to satisfy everyone &ndash; but we can promise to listen and consider every view.</p>
<p>Finally, I&rsquo;ve said before that risk is essential to growth and innovation. Rebalancing it is at the heart of our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/corporate-documents/our-strategy-2025-2030" title="Our strategy 2025 to 2030">five-year strategy</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We want to support responsible, managed risk, enabled by outcomes-based regulation. After all, you are the risk experts &ndash; and central to helping others manage theirs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And we know markets are changing &ndash; that a prescriptive approach does not support consumers or markets to evolve.</p>
<p>Which is why we want those of you in firms to be confident to change your approach, if you can deliver better while maintaining regulatory standards.</p>
<p>We recognise that myths about perceived regulatory blocks &ndash; or what FCA supervisors might say &ndash; put many off changing tack.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those myths hinder progress.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why, in my Chief Risk Officer speech last autumn, I asked firms to help us bust them. To empower their second and third lines to adapt where it supports sensible, managed risk.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m encouraging you now to be confident to change course where it delivers well for consumers.</p>
<p>Finally, if you have any feedback on our supervisory model, now is the time to share it. We are listening.</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So as you move throughout the conference today, remember the setting &ndash; Parliament on one side, Westminster Abbey on the other.</p>
<p>Bring about change. Keep sight of tradition. That is the message.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We want you to succeed. But we need you to be confident to innovate, and bring your consumers with you.</p>
<p>So, here&rsquo;s my ask: engage with us. Early and often.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s my promise: We will be clear about our priorities, and on hand with the practical support you need to innovate with confidence.</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority: Upper Tribunal Finds That Banque Havilland Devised A Plan To Harm The Qatari Economy</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-financial-conduct-authority-upper-tribunal-finds-that-banque-havilland-devis-202623/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-financial-conduct-authority-upper-tribunal-finds-that-banque-havilland-devis-202623/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Upper Tribunal has upheld the FCA&rsquo;s decision that Rangecourt SA (formerly Banque Havilland), Edmund Rowland, the former London CEO and Vladimir Bolelyy, a former Bank employee, acted without integrity.</p>
<p><span>The Tribunal agreed with the FCA that significant fines should be imposed, deciding that fines of &pound;4m, &pound;352,000 and &pound;14,200 were appropriate for Rangecourt SA, Mr Rowland and Mr Bolelyy respectively. The Tribunal also upheld the FCA&rsquo;s decision to ban Mr Rowland and Mr Bolelyy from working in financial services.</span></p>
<p><span>Banque Havilland created a plan (initially titled &lsquo;Setting fire to the neighbour&rsquo;s house fund&rsquo;) to harm the Qatari Riyal through manipulative trading strategies. The aim was to devalue the Qatari currency and break its peg to the US Dollar, harming the economy of Qatar. Banque Havilland intended to present this manipulative trading strategy to a sovereign wealth fund, Mubadala Investment Company. Mr Rowland and Mr Bolelyy were instrumental in this deliberate misconduct. Mr Rowland was trying to impress Mubadala in the hope of securing future financial benefit for Banque Havilland and his family. In making its findings the Tribunal held that Mr Rowland lied to both the FCA and in court. He also persuaded Mr Bolelyy to lie.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Steve Smart, executive director of Enforcement and Market Oversight at the FCA, said:</span></p>
<p><span>'Motivated by greed, Banque Havilland, Mr Rowland and Mr Bolelyy had a plan to seriously damage the Qatari economy. It is right that they have been held to account.'</span></p>

<title>Purdue University/CME Group Ag Economy Barometer: Farmer Sentiment Drops Sharply At Start Of 2026 As Economic Concerns Increase</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Farmer sentiment weakened sharply in January, as the&nbsp;<a href="https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4608902-1&amp;h=870277118&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fageconomybarometer%2F&amp;a=Purdue+University%2FCME+Group+Ag+Economy+Barometer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span class="xn-org">Purdue University</span>/CME Group Ag Economy Barometer</a>&nbsp;fell 23 points from December to a reading of 113. The decline reflected growing pessimism about both current conditions and the future outlook for U.S. agriculture; the Current Conditions Index dropped 19 points to 109, while the Future Expectations Index fell 25 points to 115. The largest shift was in producers' long-term outlook for U.S. agriculture, with the index that measures expectations for widespread good and bad times over the next five years falling to its lowest level since&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">September 2024</span>. Producers also expressed greater concern about agricultural exports than last month. The survey was conducted&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">Jan. 12-16</span>, coinciding with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's release of the World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates report on&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">Jan. 12</span>.</p>
<p>Producers reported worsening farm financial conditions compared with a year earlier. Half of the farmers surveyed indicated that their operations were worse off than a year earlier. Looking ahead to the next 12 months, more producers expect conditions to worsen than to improve. Thirty percent of respondents anticipate weaker financial performance in the coming year, compared with 20% who expect improvement. Reflecting this more cautious outlook, the Farm Capital Investment Index fell 11 points in January to 47, its lowest level since&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">October 2024</span>. Just 4% of producers said they plan to increase farm machinery purchases over the next year.</p>
<p>"What stands out this month is the growing number of producers who report that higher operating-loan needs stem from carrying over unpaid debt from the previous year," said&nbsp;<a href="https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4608902-1&amp;h=3097504057&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fhome%2Fteam%2Fmichael-langemeier%2F&amp;a=Michael+Langemeier" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span class="xn-person">Michael Langemeier</span></a>, the barometer's principal investigator and director of&nbsp;<span class="xn-org">Purdue's</span>&nbsp;<a href="https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4608902-1&amp;h=2814614392&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fhome%2F&amp;a=Center+for+Commercial+Agriculture" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Center for Commercial Agriculture</a>. "That points to increasing financial pressure heading into the year ahead."</p>
<p>Since 2020, each January barometer survey has included questions about farmers' operating loans for the upcoming year. Twenty-one percent of respondents said they expect to have a larger operating loan compared with a year earlier, up from 18% last year. Among producers anticipating an increase, 31% cited carryover of unpaid operating debt from the prior year as the primary reason. This percentage has risen steadily in recent years, increasing from just 5% in 2023 to 17% in 2024 and 23% in 2025. The results align with producers' growing concerns about farm financial performance.</p>
<p>Producers also expressed increased pessimism about the outlook for U.S. agricultural exports in January. When asked about export prospects over the next five years, 16% of respondents said they expect exports to decline, up from 5% in December. Concerns were even greater among corn and soybean farmers when the question specifically addressed soybeans, a key agricultural export. This month, 21% of corn and soybean producers said they expect soybean exports to decline over the next five years, compared with 13% the previous month. Increasing competition from&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Brazil</span>&nbsp;is also weighing heavily on producers' minds. Eighty percent of corn and soybean producers said they were concerned or very concerned about the competitiveness of U.S. soybean exports relative to&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Brazil</span>, including 44% stating they were very concerned.</p>
<p>Producers remained optimistic about short-term farmland values in January, while their longer-term outlook became more cautious. The Short-Term Farmland Value Expectations Index was unchanged at 117. After reaching a record high in December, the Long-Term Farmland Value Expectations Index fell 14 points in January to a reading of 152. Respondents cited alternative investment opportunities, net farm income and interest rates as the factors expected to have the greatest influence on farmland values.</p>
<p>The January survey asked corn and soybean producers how they expect to use payments from the Farmer Bridge Assistance Program announced in late December. More than half of respondents said they plan to use the payments to pay down debt, while 25% indicated the funds would be used to improve working capital. The remaining respondents said the payments would go toward family living expenses (10%) or investment in farm machinery (12%).</p>
<p>Producers' broader outlook for the U.S. economy also softened. As in recent months, respondents were asked whether the U.S. is headed in the "right direction" or on the "wrong track." In January, 62% of producers said the U.S. is headed in the "right direction," down from 75% in&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">December 2025</span>.</p>

<title>UK Regulators Announce First Firms To Join Scale-Up Unit</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) have announced the first cohort of banks and building societies to benefit from their joint Scale-up Unit.</p>
<p>The Scale-up Unit announced last year is designed to build stronger ties and provide tailored support for fast-growing and innovative financial firms, helping them to grow sustainably at pace.</p>
<p>The 6 firms that expressed interest and have been accepted to the first cohort are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allica Bank</li>
<li>ClearBank</li>
<li>Monument Bank</li>
<li>Nottingham Building Society</li>
<li>OakNorth Bank</li>
<li>Zopa Bank</li>
</ul>
<p>These firms will receive support designed to help them navigate the regulatory landscape as they develop new products, attract new customers, and move into new markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PRA and FCA officials will meet directly with the firms, both as a group and individually, throughout the coming months. This will also help the PRA and FCA better understand scaling firms&rsquo; experience of the regulatory process, with the aim of improving regulatory processes for the entire sector to help firms expand and innovate.</p>
<p>Charlotte Gerken, executive director for UK Deposit Takers at the PRA, said: 'Welcoming the first cohort to our Scale-up Unit is an important milestone. It shows our commitment to helping firms grow in a sustainable way that benefits the financial services sector and wider economic growth.'</p>
<p>Jessica Rusu, chief data, information and intelligence officer at the FCA, said: 'We look forward to working with the first cohort as we deliver on our strategy to support growth and UK competitiveness. Our joint Scale-Up Unit enhances the support available to firms as they move from start-up to scale up, helping them to grow successfully and sustainably.'</p>
<p>The regulators will be open to expressions of interest from a second cohort of firms later this year, with further detail to follow. The Scale-up Unit is also open to requests for support from smaller, fast-growing&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/prudential-regulation/scale-up-unit/insurance" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Scale-up Unit: insurers | Bank of England (opens in a new window)">insurers<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;on an ongoing basis, rather than through a cohort, in line with the criteria set out on the PRA website.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FCA currently supports new and high growth firms through its Early and High Growth Oversight function. We will further enhance our offer by opening expressions of interest for a new solo regulated Scale-up cohort in the Spring, supporting firms from a wider range of sectors.</p>
<p>Richard Davies, CEO of Allica Bank, said: 'Allica are delighted to be included in the initial Scale-up Unit cohort, having led the call for a dedicated regulatory unit to support firms as they scale. The Unit should provide banks like Allica with more capital certainty and more regulatory support to boost lending to the established SMEs that power the UK&rsquo;s real economy.</p>
<p>'Done well, the Scale-up Unit can support the government&rsquo;s objective to make the UK the location of choice for financial services firms to invest, innovate and grow.'</p>
<p>Rishi Khosla, CEO and co-founder of OakNorth, said: 'We&rsquo;re honoured to be part of the first cohort of the Scale-up Unit. OakNorth was founded to empower breakthrough businesses &ndash; profitable and scaling lower-mid-market companies &ndash; who are too often overlooked by traditional banks, and this tailored regulatory support will help us better deliver on that mission as we continue to scale.</p>
<p>'Having already lent over $21bn to these businesses, supporting the creation of tens of thousands of jobs and homes, we&rsquo;re delighted to work closely with regulators to build an even stronger platform for sustainable growth.'</p>

<li>The Scale-up Unit builds on and complements the regulators&rsquo; existing support for early-stage firms, including through the New Bank and Insurer Start-up Units, Regulatory Sandbox, Early and High Growth Oversight function, Pre-Application Support Service (PASS), and AI Lab. It recognises the different types of support needed for firms at the next stage of their development.</li>
<li>The Scale-up Unit also aligns with changes designed to streamline regulation, including implementing Basel 3.1, Solvency UK, Strong and Simple, and reforms to the Senior Managers Regime. It also aligns with the Office for Investment: Financial Services, which is helping foreign firms enter and adjust to the UK market.</li>

<p>The seasonally adjusted Index declined 1 point to 143. Year-over-year sales grew (+0.7%), but month-over-month sales slipped (-0.5%).</p>
<p>With winter storms impacting much of the country in late January, consumer foot traffic saw its sharpest year-over-year decline (-2.0%) since mid-2022; foot traffic also dropped (-0.8%) month over month.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In January, small businesses faced headwinds as consumers rebalanced their spending following a busy holiday season, and winter weather kept many at home during the latter half of the month,&rdquo; said Prasanna Dhore, Chief Data Officer, Fiserv. &ldquo;As a result, restaurants, hotels and several retail categories saw the sharp slowdowns in sales, while select service-based businesses posted strong sales gains to start the year.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Key Takeaways</span></p>
<p><span>Discretionary spending softened while essentials remained stable</span><br />Discretionary sales fell year over year (‑0.4%) and month over month (-0.7%), driven by foot traffic declines (‑2.4% year over year; -1.1% month over month). Essential sales remained strong year over year (+2.2%) but were flat month over month.</p>
<p><span>Professional and Administrative Services saw pockets of strength</span><br />Administrative and Support Services grew (+1.1%) month over month, helped by growth in storm‑related service categories. Tax Preparation Services also recorded strong seasonal acceleration, growing (+9.3%) year over year and (+5.6%) month over month. Broadly, Professional Services sales were strong, rising (+5.1%) compared to January 2025.</p>
<p><span>Retail held steady, with core categories driving modest growth</span><br />Small business retail sales were essentially flat year over year and month over month. Retail foot traffic rose, suggesting consumers remain active but have become increasingly selective. Core retail (which includes grocery, clothing and furniture) delivered the most gains (+1.5%) year over year, while non‑core retail (gas, motor parts and building materials) declined (‑2.7%) year over year.</p>
<p><span>Restaurant sales declined as foot traffic fell off sharply&nbsp;</span><br />Restaurant sales fell (-1.8%) year over year, driven by significant foot traffic declines (‑3.6%) compared to 2025. Limited‑service restaurants posted the largest sales declines, dropping (‑3.4%) year over year alongside steep traffic losses (‑5.0%). Average ticket sizes rose (+1.6%) year over year, offering only a partial offset. Full‑service dining also softened, though less severely.</p>

<div class="bw-subheadline-wrapper">
<ul>
<li><i>Brings industry-standard clearing model to Treasury markets</i></li>
<li><i style="font-family: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">Prepares for launch of repo clearing later this year</i></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE: ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today announced that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/other/2026/34-104762.pdf" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">approved</a>&nbsp;its application and rulebook for ICE Clear Credit to expand its current registered Covered Clearing Agency (CCA) designation to add U.S. Treasury clearing. ICE Clear Credit&rsquo;s U.S. Treasury clearing service is now fully operationally live, providing market participants with welcome competition and the first ever alternative venue for clearing U.S. Treasury securities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since we first announced plans to launch a U.S. Treasury securities clearing service, we have heard a resounding message that U.S. Treasury market participants want innovation, change and progress,&rdquo; said Paul Hamill, Chief Commercial Officer of ICE Clear Credit. &ldquo;To meet that challenge, our service harmonizes access models, operational workflows, risk management and protection models, across cash, repos, futures and swaps, providing a modernized scalable solution for one of the largest and most important markets in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>ICE&rsquo;s Treasury clearing solution delivers both &lsquo;Done-Away&rsquo; and &lsquo;Done-With&rsquo; implementations, allowing market participants to choose their preferred clearing method. This is the same process that is used daily to clear financial products through ICE&rsquo;s global clearing houses.</p>
<p>ICE leveraged its extensive expertise and proprietary technologies for clearing credit instruments to offer clearing for U.S. Treasury securities, and soon repurchase agreements (repos). Established as a distinct offering from ICE&rsquo;s existing Credit Default Swap (CDS) clearing service, the new Treasury clearing solution has its own rulebook, membership, risk management framework, financial and liquidity resources, and governance structure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With our Treasury clearing service now operationally live and ready to clear cash transactions, we&rsquo;re thrilled to put the final touches on our approach to clearing repos, which we expect to be ready for testing and integration in the second half of the year, and is planned to go live in the fourth quarter,&rdquo; said Stan Ivanov, President of ICE Clear Credit. &ldquo;By extending our CDS solution to U.S. Treasury securities, we have begun the process of bringing our industry-leading risk management services to the U.S. Treasury market, and we will continue to expand with the launch of repo clearing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>ICE Clear Credit was founded during the financial crisis in 2009 to bring confidence and stability to the CDS market. It enables clearing of more than 685 Single Name reference entities, Index and Index Option CDS instruments on corporate and sovereign debt. ICE Clear Credit clearing has reduced counterparty risk exposure for parties to trades whose combined notional amount exceeds $400 trillion, with current open interest at ICE Clear Credit of over $2 trillion. ICE Clear Credit has been designated a systemically important financial market utility (SIFMU) by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, and is a qualified central counterparty under U.S. bank capital rules.</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority: Falling Cost Of Premium Finance Saving Consumers Around £157m A Year</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-financial-conduct-authority-falling-cost-of-premium-finance-saving-consumers-202623/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-financial-conduct-authority-falling-cost-of-premium-finance-saving-consumers-202623/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>People who pay monthly for their insurance are saving around &pound;157m a year, with over half the firms the FCA reviewed as part of a market study lowering the cost of premium finance.</p>
<p>Interest rates for premium finance have fallen by an average 4.1 percentage points since 2022, saving consumers &pound;8 on a typical motor policy and &pound;3 on a typical home policy per year. The changes result from regulatory attention, fair value assessments and base rate reductions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The FCA has seen even more significant changes made by firms it identified as at highest risk of not providing fair value, following direct engagement with them. These firms reduced APRs by 7 percentage points on average &ndash; saving &pound;14 on a typical motor policy and &pound;4 on a typical home policy per year.</p>
<p>Graeme Reynolds, director of competition and interim director of insurance at the FCA, commented:</p>
<p>'For millions, paying for insurance monthly is not a choice: it&rsquo;s a necessity. We found that competition in the market is meeting the needs of many consumers. But where we found issues, we used our Consumer Duty to get people fairer value, without needing to write new rules.</p>
<p>'While we&rsquo;re not planning any market-wide changes, we won't hesitate to act if firms fall short of our expectations as we continue to monitor fair value.'</p>
<p>In 2023, nearly half of motor and home insurance policies (about 23 million) were paid monthly, often because customers couldn&rsquo;t afford annual payments.</p>
<p>The FCA has confirmed it will not introduce a price cap or mandate that premium finance is provided without interest, as this could restrict access to important cover for customers who can only afford to pay monthly.</p>
<p>The regulator expects all firms to consider whether further changes are needed to their premium finance offerings to meet fair value requirements. To help them, it has shared examples of good and poor practice seen across the premium finance market.</p>
<h2>Background&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<ul>
<li>Read our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/market-studies/ms24-2-premium-finance" title="MS24/2 Premium Finance Market Study">final report and interim report</a>. &nbsp;</li>
<li>The estimated savings for individual motor and home insurance customers quoted above, &pound;8 and &pound;3 respectively, refer to reductions in the average cost of premium finance from &pound;49 to &pound;41 (2022 vs 2026) for motor and &pound;18 to &pound;15 for home (2022 vs 2026).

<title>CFTC: Texas Resident To Pay Over $14 million For Misappropriation Of Confidential Information, Illegal Kickbacks</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission announced today the following enforcement update.</p>
<p><span>The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas entered a consent order against&nbsp;<strong>Matthew Clark</strong>&nbsp;of Houston for misappropriation of confidential information and directing business in exchange for illegal kickbacks in schemes to defraud his employer.</span></p>
<p>Under the order, Clark must pay $7,709,509 in restitution, representing his employer&rsquo;s losses from the kickback scheme, and $6,532,360 in disgorgement, representing Clark&rsquo;s gains from both schemes. The order also permanently bans Clark from trading and CFTC registration.</p>
<p>The consent order resolves all claims the CFTC brought against Clark in the complaint filed in February 2022 [See CFTC Press Release No.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8490-22">8490-22</a><span>].</span></p>
<p>The CFTC previously charged and settled with a broker, Mathew Webb for his role in the misappropriation of information and kickback schemes on June 15, 2021 [See CFTC Press Release No.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8396-21">8396-21</a>]. The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas entered a consent order against Peter Miller, a proprietary trader, for his participation in the misappropriation scheme on Dec. 22, 2025 [See CFTC Press Release No.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/9168-26">9168-26</a>].</p>
<p>In a related criminal case, the Department of Justice charged Clark in February 2022 with conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud, insider trading, and prohibited commodities transactions based on the same conduct alleged in the CFTC&rsquo;s complaint. [United States v. Matthew Clark, No. 4:22-cr-00055 (S.D. Tex. Feb. 3, 2022)]. Clark pleaded guilty and, in June 2024, was sentenced to six years and six months in prison and ordered to pay $7,709,509 in restitution and $6,532,360 in criminal forfeiture.</p>

The Federal Reserve occasionally conducts one or two additional surveys during the year. Questions cover changes in the standards and terms of the banks' lending and the state of business and household demand for loans. The survey often includes questions on one or two other topics of current interest.</p>

<title>CFTC Staff Issues Interpretation On Legacy Swap Status</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cftc-staff-issues-interpretation-on-legacy-swap-status-202622/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission&rsquo;s Market Participants Division and Division of Clearing and Risk today issued an interpretive letter addressing the effect of a merger conducted as part of an internal reorganization at Morgan Stanley, a CFTC-registered swap dealer, on the status of legacy swaps.</p>
<p>Based on the facts and circumstances of the merger as described in the letter, the divisions concluded the swaps at issue retain their legacy swap status under the Commission&rsquo;s uncleared swap margin and swap clearing requirements.</p>
<p>MPD staff specifically determined Morgan Stanley&rsquo;s legacy swaps retain their status as legacy swaps for any counterparties subject to the CFTC&rsquo;s uncleared swap margin requirements and, thus, remain exempt from them.</p>
<p>DCR staff specifically determined the merger will not cause Morgan Stanley&rsquo;s legacy swaps to lose their legacy status with respect to the CFTC&rsquo;s swap clearing requirement.</p>

<title>Comment On What Bitcoin Is Struggling With In The Short Term - James Butterfill, Head Of Research At CoinShares – Europe’s Largest Digital Asset Manager</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The current market environment is challenging for Bitcoin and digital assets in general.</p>
<p>First, capital flows remain unfavorable. Since October, large Bitcoin investors have sold holdings worth around USD 29 billion. This behavior aligns with historical patterns in the middle of a halving cycle, where selling phases often last several months. While smaller investors continue to accumulate, their demand so far is insufficient to fully absorb the selling pressure. At the same time, institutional inflows remain weak: digital asset ETPs have seen net outflows year-to-date.</p>
<p>Second, Bitcoin is currently decoupled from global money supply trends. Historically, the price closely followed the growth of global M2 liquidity. This relationship is currently disrupted, which could indicate either a misjudgment by investors or an upcoming liquidity tightening. Given the still-expansive monetary policy, the latter seems unlikely in the short term.</p>
<p>Third, geopolitical tensions weigh on the market environment. During periods of acute uncertainty, investors favor traditional safe havens such as gold, while Bitcoin suffers from its hybrid role as both a risk asset and a store of value.</p>
<p>Additionally, monetary policy uncertainty in the US is a factor. The designated Federal Reserve Chair, Kevin Warsh, is seen as a proponent of a tighter interest rate policy, further clouding Bitcoin&rsquo;s short-term outlook.</p>
<p>In the long term, however, the outlook remains constructive, as structural concerns about currency depreciation persist and the current lag behind liquidity trends signals potential for catch-up.</p>

<title>ACER Grants Regulators More Time To Decide On The Minimum Activation Period Of Frequency Containment Reserves Providers</title>

This concerned the minimum activation period that frequency containment reserve providers with limited energy reservoirs must ensure in order to remain available during the alert state.</p>
<p>On 30&nbsp;January 2026, with its&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsBBwAFUAdWVUxaVQIBHVZcVFQdUAgCBBpTUlUGVQYBAQNQVAMdAlNRUwkGVgIdUgpUAx0GXwZVGgxSVwEZCg0BAVIHAQVWAQIARQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Decision 01/2026</a>, ACER granted the extension requested by the NRAs, who now have until 17 June 2026 to reach an agreement on the TSOs&rsquo; proposal.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is it about?</span></p>
<p>EU&rsquo;s electric power systems operate at the frequency of 50 Hz. Any imbalance between electricity supply and demand causes the frequency to deviate. If not corrected quickly, this can lead to blackouts.</p>
<p>Frequency containment reserve is the first line of automatic response to such deviations. It is activated within seconds to stabilise the frequency and is provided continuously by power-generating or consuming assets (like batteries, hydro plants&nbsp;or demand response systems).</p>
<p>Some of these providers, especially batteries or demand-side resources, have limited energy reservoirs and can only respond for a short duration. The&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtVAFQDVVZcBUwLVVFUHVYPBAYdCwxQVBpUBgsBBFVRAAAJAFAdAlNRUwkGVgIdUgpUAx0GXwZVGgxSVwEZCg0BAVIHAQVWAQIARQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">System Operation Regulation</a>&nbsp;therefore requires a minimum activation time to ensure these resources remain available during the alert state.</p>

<h2>A payments system that works for everyone</h2>
<p>Just before Christmas I was in Billericay for the opening of the 200th banking hub.</p>
<p>I got to chat to local people and business owners about the difference the hub will make to their everyday lives. It was great.</p>
<p>Although if I&rsquo;m honest, the biggest talking point was probably the giant chocolate coins made specially for the occasion.</p>
<p>Roman coins. Medieval coins. Old two shilling pieces. All the size of dinner plates.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve seen people genuinely happy to eat into their funds!</p>
<p>As educational &ndash; and tasty &ndash; as the coins were, banking hubs aren&rsquo;t about nostalgia for cash.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re one part of making sure the UK payments system works for different people, different businesses, and different moments in life.</p>
<p>Sometimes that will mean cash, so it&rsquo;s positive to see the acceleration in delivery of hubs.</p>
<p>That is alongside nearly 150 other cash solutions across the UK, and pledges from banks to maintain their networks - or even in some cases, to open new branches.</p>
<p>But other times it might mean cards, digital wallets, open banking, or even stablecoin and tokenised deposits.</p>
<p>In reality, all of these methods co-exist and need to work alongside one another.</p>
<p>Our job as regulators isn&rsquo;t to pick winners. It&rsquo;s to make sure the system as a whole is trusted, coherent and future-proof, whatever form a payment takes.</p>

<h2>The National Payments Vision</h2>
<p>That&rsquo;s where the&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-payments-vision" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)">National Payments Vision<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;comes in.</p>
<p>An estimated 1,500 payments were made per second in the UK last year.</p>
<p>Buying a lunch meal deal, transferring a house deposit, filling up the car with petrol, drawing a pension.</p>
<p>Payments quietly sit underneath everything we do.</p>
<p>So clearly it has to be a priority for policymakers to ensure that those essential services are safe, accessible, deliver good value, and meet users&rsquo; needs.</p>
<p>And at the PSR and FCA, we are working closely with the Bank of England and Treasury through the&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-payments-vision/payments-vision-delivery-committee-update" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)">Payments Vision Delivery Committee<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>&nbsp;(PVDC) on a coordinated approach that maximises our collective impact.</p>
<p>But we know this isn&rsquo;t just a user story. It&rsquo;s also a growth one.</p>
<p>Payments are at the heart of how our national economy functions &ndash; both as an enabler, and a source of, growth.</p>
<p>UK payments systems moved &pound;107 trillion in 2023 &ndash; that&rsquo;s equivalent to 44 times GDP.</p>
<p>So, by building on our track record as a global leader in payments, we can not only serve customers better; we can drive the innovation and growth our country needs at the same time.</p>
<p>And we should recognise that this is a resilience story too.</p>
<p>In a world becoming more connected, more digital, and in many ways more volatile, payments systems must be dependable.</p>
<p>Resilience doesn&rsquo;t just come from a single system having strong controls, as important as that is.</p>
<p>It comes from choice - a range of payment options operating alongside one another&hellip;</p>
<p>Giving users flexibility, supporting competition that makes the overall system more robust, and breeding innovation.</p>
<p>This is why the National Payment Vision really matters.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just about today&rsquo;s system working for people in their everyday lives.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also about designing a system fit for the future: one that can cope with scale, complexity and change.</p>

<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-consolidation-isn-t-the-story-collaboration-is" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Consolidation isn&rsquo;t the story &ndash; collaboration is</h2>
<p>Having a foot in both the PSR and the FCA, I can say very confidently: both organisations are fully committed to delivering that Vision.</p>
<p>I know there&rsquo;s been a lot of commentary about the consolidation of the PSR and the FCA, and I want to be clear about something:</p>
<p>This is an evolution, not a revolution.</p>
<p>The FCA and PSR have been working hand-in-glove for years on the issues that matter most in payments, and together, we&rsquo;ve delivered significant changes. You can see it in our efforts to drive the adoption of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/open-banking-fca" title="Open banking and the FCA">Open Banking</a>&nbsp;&ndash; now at more than 16 million active users.</p>
<p>This has the potential to support growth by making payments faster, cheaper and more efficient, and we will be publishing a roadmap for the roll out of Open Finance by the end of next month.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve made account-to-account payments an FCA-PSR priority, and the framework for commercial Variable Recurring Payments is already in place.</p>
<p>Momentum is building across the market and we expect transactions to be available in the first quarter this year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then there is the&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.psr.org.uk/information-for-consumers/app-fraud-reimbursement-protections/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)">APP fraud reimbursement scheme<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>&nbsp;&ndash; a genuinely major cross-industry effort involving new data-sharing expectations, better fraud analytics, and a clear liability framework.</p>
<p>In the year since the policy came into effect, 88% of money lost to APP scams and claimed back was reimbursed &ndash; that&rsquo;s &pound;112m returned to victims.</p>
<p>Claim volumes are down by 15%, and firms are resolving most claims quickly &ndash; within just five days.</p>
<p>So the legal processes around FCA-PSR consolidation will take their course, but the functional coherence is already there. The Treasury has not yet published the&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/a-streamlined-approach-to-payment-systems-regulation-consultation" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)">consultation response on consolidation<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>, but the direction of travel is clear.</p>
<p>Our shared objectives around competition, innovation, and consumer protection will remain.</p>
<p>And we will retain the scope of the PSR&rsquo;s objective on &lsquo;service-users&rsquo; &ndash; a wider view that considers the interests of all who use payments systems - not just consumers, but merchants and payment services too.</p>
<p>Consolidation offers us a chance to bring the vast expertise of the PSR and the FCA even closer together, and streamline how we deliver. To bring the best of both.</p>
</div>

<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-delivering-the-foundations-of-the-national-payments-vision" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Delivering the foundations of the National Payments Vision</h2>
<p>That collaboration will be key as we look to capitalise on the opportunities ahead for payments and deliver against them.</p>
<p>One of the PVDC&rsquo;s deliverables is to publish the Payments Forward Plan, which will set out a sequence of initiatives in both retail and wholesale payments, as well as certain aspects of digital assets.</p>
<p>This includes milestones in relation to modernising payments regulation, and we expect the Plan to be published in the next couple of months.</p>
<p>Through the PVDC, we have also set out our base strategy and delivered a new mechanism for infrastructure renewal. I know Sarah Breeden will talk more about that later.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been honest that progress on infrastructure has been more modest in recent years, while others have pushed on.</p>
<p>Australia with its New Payments Platform. Singapore with PayNow. India with UPI.</p>
<p>We cannot afford to stand still.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the strategy, and the work to support it, is deliberately designed with public-private partnership in mind, using the right expertise in the right functions so we can drive that transformation.</p>
<p>Not to rip out what works, but to strengthen it &ndash; with a strategic focus on the existing systems people rely on every day, like Faster Payments and Bacs.&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/payment-and-settlement/the-national-payments-vision/retail-payments-infrastructure-board" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)">The Retail Payments Infrastructure Board<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>&nbsp;is responsible for translating the vision and strategy set by PVDC into design, and we are taking a close interest in their work, as an observing member to the Board.</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-national-vision-international-outlook" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>National vision, international outlook</h2>
<p>But modernising infrastructure on its own isn&rsquo;t enough &ndash; it&rsquo;s about joining things up, both domestically and internationally.</p>
<p>It might be called the National Payments Vision, but payments don&rsquo;t stop at borders.</p>
<p>Businesses and consumers increasingly expect money to move seamlessly across systems and jurisdictions. Meeting that expectation means doing two things at once.</p>
<p>First, preserving what works today.</p>
<p>The UK&rsquo;s existing payments systems support enormous volumes of economic activity, and trust in those systems has been built over decades.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been pleasing to see the success of our consumer protection initiatives like&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.psr.org.uk/our-work/app-scams/confirmation-of-payee/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)">Confirmation of Payee<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>, which now covers more than 99% of payments.</p>
<p>There are an average of 26 checks every second, which has had a direct impact in reducing misdirected payments and fraud.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s good to see this is inspiring others, including the EU and Australia, to develop similar systems to protect users and nurture trust.</p>
<p>Second, building the next generation, and building it well.</p>
<p>Interoperability &ndash; between systems, and across borders - is not just a technical ambition.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about designing systems to genuinely solve problems for the people and businesses expected to use them.</p>
<p>Is it intuitive? Is it reliable? Is it trustworthy?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen internationally that adoption doesn&rsquo;t happen by accident. In some countries, new payments systems have scaled rapidly because they were aligned with wider economic or social policy.</p>
<p>There are certainly lessons for us to observe from other jurisdictions, and we will continue to work closely with, and learn from, our international partners. Something we hope will be helped by the FCA&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-establishes-presence-united-states-and-asia-pacific" title="FCA establishes presence in the United States and Asia-Pacific">growing international presence</a>: in the US and Asia-Pacific already, Singapore and more to follow.</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-harnessing-new-technologies" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Harnessing new technologies</h2>
<p>Because when we get the basics right &ndash; the rails, the connections, the trust &ndash; that is when we can really see innovation fly.</p>
<p>Payments innovation is already a big part of what comes through the FCA&rsquo;s doors. Between 2019 and June last year, nearly a quarter (22%) of firms using our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/innovation/innovation-pathways" title="Innovation Pathways">Innovation Pathways</a>&nbsp;were working on payments or open banking solutions.</p>
<p>We want to support the development of that new tech at pace, while protecting the fundamental trust and market integrity we know UK financial services relies on.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been clear on crypto: we are open for business, and we want crypto firms to succeed in the UK.</p>
<p>The gateway opens in September, and work is well underway on building a proportionate and competitive regime. In the last fortnight we&rsquo;ve published our final&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/guidance-consultations/gc26-2-application-consumer-duty-cryptoasset-firms" title="GC26/2: Application of the Consumer Duty to cryptoasset firms">Consultation Paper</a>&nbsp;for crypto regulation, which outlines proposals for how the Consumer Duty and other conduct rules will apply.</p>
<p>We will set out our final rules and framework in early summer, so please do share your views by the March 12 consultation deadline &ndash; we want innovators, regulators, government and industry all involved in shaping the future of crypto in the UK.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elsewhere, we recently launched an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/innovation/ai-lab" title="AI Lab">AI Supercharged Sandbox</a>, giving firms space to test early proof-of-concept models in a safe environment with regulatory support.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ve added a stablecoin-specific cohort in our Regulatory Sandbox to support issuers testing UK-issued stablecoins.</p>
<p>Done well, stablecoins have huge potential to unlock faster, cheaper and more reliable payments. It&rsquo;s an exciting area. To help make the most of that opportunity, we are running a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/techsprints/stablecoin-sprint" title="Stablecoin Sprint">stablecoin sprint</a>&nbsp;next month to gather views and inform our regulatory approach.</p>
<p>Applications close on Sunday &ndash; so there&rsquo;s still time to get your form in and take part!</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-conclusion" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>People tend to take payments for granted. They just &lsquo;work&rsquo;.</p>
<p>But we won&rsquo;t maintain that trust without collaboration - not just to build consensus on the problems that need fixing, but to shape a shared vision of the system we&rsquo;re building.</p>
<p>That means bringing the ecosystem together.</p>
<p>We need infrastructure and systems that we can rely on today, and that can flex, scale and compete for the future.</p>
<p>We need them to be efficient, innovative, accessible, and deliver against the expectations of customers &ndash; whether businesses, consumers, merchants, or others.</p>
<p>We need them to work with domestic and international developments, with the ability to provide interoperability, protection and resilience.</p>
<p>And we need an eye to what&rsquo;s next as firms innovate - recognising we may not know quite what &lsquo;next&rsquo; will be.</p>
<p>Bringing the FCA and PSR together strengthens our ability to consider the needs of firms, consumers and systems.</p>
<p>And by working together &ndash; with the Bank, PVDC, users and firms of all types &ndash; we can ensure we deliver that.</p>
<p>A payments system people can rely on &ndash; whatever the moment, whatever the method, whatever comes next.</p>

<div>
<p>Combined trading turnover for SIX Swiss Exchange and BME Exchange reached CHF 149.1bn in the first month of 2026, representing a 13.2% growth on December 2025 and a 16.5% rise in comparison to January 2025.</p>
<p>In Switzerland, activity across all segments contributed to a 23.1% month-on-month (MOM) and 9.8% year-on-year (YOY) rise in overall trading turnover. In Spain, overall turnover increased by even 38.7% in comparison to January 2025.</p>
<p>With regards to trading turnover in individual segments, structured products surged in January 2026 on SIX Swiss Exchange with a 86.6% increase over December 2025 and 76.7% over January 2025.

<p>ACER has published its&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsFU1QEAFVUU0wABVJaHVZfAAAdU1pUABoEAQZRAQJRAFAFAAgdVlRbWQhXBFAdBl8NUx0GWgFeGlRTAwYZCg1VBgMBVwUAVlQERQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Rules of Procedure</a>&nbsp;setting out how it will conduct cross-border investigations into suspected energy market abuse.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why do the new rules for cross-border probes matter?</span></p>
<p>Europe has an EU-wide framework (called REMIT) to detect and deter abuse in wholesale energy markets. Breaches of REMIT are enforced at national level by energy regulators. However, market manipulation and abuse often transcend national borders and cases can be sophisticated.</p>
<p>In 2024, EU legislators updated the REMIT framework giving ACER additional tasks, including the mandate to investigate cross-border cases.</p>
<p>ACER&rsquo;s expanded role helps build a stronger regulatory framework, promoting openness and confidence in EU energy markets, and strengthens trust that wholesale energy prices are transparent and fair.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ACER&rsquo;s Rules of Procedure for REMIT investigations</span></p>
<p>ACER&rsquo;s new Rules of Procedure establish the procedural framework within which ACER carries out its investigatory tasks under REMIT. They set out the main stages of ACER&rsquo;s investigations, the related decision-making and the rights and obligations of the persons concerned.</p>
<p>These rules mark an important milestone. As ACER and national regulatory authorities (NRAs) continue to work closely together, they will play a key role in ensuring robust, consistent and legally sound enforcement across borders.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What&rsquo;s next?</span></p>
<ul>
<li>ACER moves into action on cross-border investigations from the second half of 2026.</li>
<li>The annual REMIT workshop, organised jointly by ACER and the European Commission, will take place in the summer.</li>
<li>ACER&rsquo;s upcoming&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtVA1UCVFcGB0wPUAIFHVYOAA4dU10AVhpWVQtWBwEFVFMCDgEdVlRbWQhXBFAdBl8NUx0GWgFeGlRTAwYZCg1VBgMBVwUAVlQERQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">public consultation</a>&nbsp;on REMIT transaction reporting will gather input from market participants to help shape practical guidance under the revised REMIT framework.</li>

<p><span><strong><span>Mark Williamson has been appointed Chief Commercial Officer.</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Mark will lead Product Management, Sales &amp; Marketing, and Strategy, to help ClearToken deliver institutional‑grade digital market infrastructure.</span></span></p>

Other roles included three years as COO of Gresham Computing and three years at Deutsche Bank, where he worked as a Project Manager and Business Analyst.</span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Chris Smith has become Chief Operating Officer,</span></strong><span>&nbsp;where he will lead&nbsp;</span><span>the Group's operational delivery and execution, ensuring ClearToken's infrastructure, processes and controls operate effectively and efficiently as the company transitions into live service.

<p><span>Chris brings more than 25 years of senior operational leadership across financial market infrastructure and post-trade operations.

Earlier in his career, he helped establish the LME Clear CCP from inception and has held senior leadership roles spanning clearing operations, post-trade infrastructure, collateral management, risk controls, and data governance, as well as prior positions at ICAP and J.P. Morgan.</span></p>
<p><span>The news follows the recent appointments of Kristi Tange as Group Chief Risk Officer and Clare Weaver MBA, as Chief Legal Officer. This further strengthens ClearToken&rsquo;s leadership team as it continues to execute its development strategy to bring traditional and trusted legal clearing and settlement to the world of digital assets.</span></p>

<title>The Dubai Financial Services Authority Fines Reinsurance Broker USD 455,176 For Engaging In Misleading And Deceptive Conduct</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA), the independent banking, financial services, and markets regulator of Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) has imposed a fine of USD 455,176 (AED 1,671,633) on reinsurance brokerage Ed Broking (MENA) Limited (the Firm), for a number of contraventions of DFSA legislation, including engaging in misleading and deceptive conduct.</p>
<p>The Firm agreed to settle the matter and pay a fine which comprises disgorgement of USD 175,343 (USD 148,039 plus interest of USD 27,304) and a penalty of USD 279,833. The fine was reduced from USD 575,104 (AED 2,112,069) as a result of the settlement.</p>
<p>The DFSA determined that the Firm:</p>
<ul>
<li>respectively provided cedent insurers (the Firm&rsquo;s Clients) &ndash; being the original insurers issuing the underlying policies &ndash; and reinsurers with two different premiums in respect of the same reinsurance placement;</li>
<li>misled reinsurers about the deductions applied on the premium and the brokerage commission earned by the Firm; and</li>
<li>misled a client about the brokerage earned by the Firm from 121 placements, as well as the deductions to the premium from some of those placements.</li>
</ul>
<p>The misconduct was facilitated by the Firm&rsquo;s practice of not disclosing brokerage commissions to its clients and its failure to adhere to its own systems and controls. Further, the misconduct involved the use of altered documents.</p>
<p>The DFSA also found that the Firm:</p>
<ul>
<li>failed to take reasonable steps to ensure that the communications with cedent insurers and reinsurers were clear, fair, and not misleading; and</li>
<li>failed to act with due skill, care, and diligence.</li>
</ul>
<p>The DFSA acknowledges that the Firm promptly reported the misconduct to the DFSA, conducted an internal investigation, and paid restitution to Clients in respect of placements in which altered documents were used.</p>
<p>Alan Linning, Managing Director, Enforcement, of the DFSA, commented: &ldquo;The Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) expects financial services firms within Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) to uphold the highest standards of conduct in their business dealings. In misleading clients and reinsurers as it did, Ed Broking (the Firm) failed to meet these expectations. The fine imposed on the Firm reflects the seriousness of its misconduct and serves to warn others against engaging in similar conduct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The DFSA remains committed to developing, administering, and enforcing world-class regulations of financial services within DIFC. As part of its strategy and ongoing mission, the Authority will continue to implement stringent enforcement measures and provide clear regulatory guidance to ensure that all entities operating within the Centre adhere to the highest standards of regulation and ethical conduct.</p>

<title>ASIC Updates Information Available Through Purchased Extracts</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-updates-information-available-through-purchased-extracts-202622/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-updates-information-available-through-purchased-extracts-202622/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Company extracts purchased through the ASIC website will no longer contain the residential addresses of company officeholders.</p>
<p>ASIC implemented this change in response to broader privacy and safety concerns including the potential to access personal information, heightened concerns around personal safety and to reduce the risk of identity theft and cyber-crime.</p>
<p>This change is a sensible precaution that balances the need to reduce easily accessible personal information while maintaining effective and transparent registers.</p>
<p>This action does not remove residential address information entirely but introduces a barrier at the most widely available access point.</p>
<p>Law enforcement agencies, government departments, and those who require address details for regulatory compliance and business purposes will still have access to this information.</p>
<p>ASIC will engage registry intermediaries to help them understand how this change affects them and continue to monitor the implementation to assess any impacts upon users.</p>
<p>Customers accessing ASIC registers via the website can visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/online-services/search-asic-registers/company-and-organisation-registers/" title="Company and organisation registers">Company and organisation registers</a>&nbsp;for more information.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s ongoing RegistryConnect program will strengthen the quality and integrity of registry data, including through the future linking of director IDs to the companies register which allows the further reduction of personal information being stored on the registers.</p>
<p>RegistryConnect will also introduce stronger methods to validate and authenticate users without exposing private details. These improvements will support the accuracy and availability of business information and provide greater assurance to the public that people interacting with the registers are who they say they are.</p>
<p>A Treasury consultation on draft laws to improve Australia&rsquo;s business registers is open until 10 February 2026. ASIC will continue to engage closely with Treasury on any future work to enhance the integrity and reliability of ASIC&rsquo;s registers.</p>

<title>ASX Marks 50 Years Of Australia's Options Market</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Fifty years on, Australia&rsquo;s options market shows how education can build one of the world&rsquo;s safest, most disciplined investing cultures. For decades, Australians have used options as &ldquo;portfolio insurance&rdquo;, a practical way to lock in prices, manage risk and protect wealth. That mindset has supported the strong growth of the market, now worth $2 billion AUD. &nbsp;</p>
<p>What started out as a tool for institutions and asset managers has steadily opened to everyday retail investors, through the electronification of trading and ASX&rsquo;s focus on education. With greater access and understanding, more Australians than ever are using options to hedge volatility, diversify portfolios, and adopt more sophisticated investment strategies with confidence. &nbsp;</p>
<p>ASX is proud to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Australian equity options market. Established on 3 February 1976, this market has evolved from an innovative idea into a fundamental part of Australia&rsquo;s financial sector, supporting investors, traders, and institutions.</p>
<p>The origins of options trading in Australia commenced with a limited selection of blue-chip stocks. As the first equity options market outside of North America, investors quickly recognised the flexibility and protection offered by options, leading to significant market expansion throughout the 1980s. During this period, ASX played a pivotal role in standardising contracts and enhancing transparency.</p>

<p><br clear="ALL" /> Technological modernisation in the 1990s and 2000s brought options trading online, opening the market to everyday Australians and supporting a broader range of investment strategies. Today, ASX&rsquo;s options market stands as one of leading markets in the Asia-Pacific region, underpinning how institutions and retail investors alike manage risk, navigate volatility, and pursue growth opportunities.</p>
<p>Options provide investors with flexible tools for tailoring market exposure, effective risk management through protective strategies, income generation and leveraged access to asset price movements. With retail investors now comprising two-thirds of market activity, ASX continues to drive engagement in options through education, outreach, and product innovation - including weekly options and options over ETFs. Initiatives such as online education videos and Australia&rsquo;s first options trading game have helped make options more accessible for more investors.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Graham O&rsquo;Brien, ASX Head of Distribution</b>, said:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The 50th anniversary of the Australian equity options market is a testament to the vision and collaboration of all those across Australia&rsquo;s financial markets who have contributed over the years. As the market enters its sixth decade, we are proud of our legacy and excited for what&rsquo;s to come. The options market is a dynamic tool for investors, with options offering flexibility, risk management and portfolio diversification. As global markets evolve, options are set to remain central to Australian investing, with ongoing innovation and education ensuring their continued relevance and growth.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Statement On Jury’s Verdict In Trial Of R. Brian Watson And Northstar Commercial Partners, Margaret Ryan, Director, SEC Division Of Enforcement, Jan. 30, 2026</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today, after a five-day trial, a jury in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado found defendants R. Brian Watson and his company, Northstar Commercial Partners, liable for intentional securities fraud.</p>
<p>As shown by the evidence at trial, Watson and Northstar defrauded investors in 11 different offerings over the course of about 36 months. Defendants told investors that Watson &ldquo;co-invested&rdquo; in every real estate offering by investing his personal funds in Northstar-sponsored real estate projects alongside investors who were also investing in common equity. The statements were false and misleading because Watson did not co-invest his personal funds as promised. These repeated misstatements over time facilitated a scheme and course of business that defrauded investors.</p>
<p><span>Statement of SEC Enforcement Director Margaret A. Ryan:</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;We are pleased with the jury&rsquo;s verdict holding Mr. Watson and Northstar liable for fraud for making material misrepresentations to investors in multiple real estate projects. This case demonstrates the SEC&rsquo;s continued commitment to protecting investors and holding accountable those who seek to mislead and defraud them. I thank the trial team for its hard work and professionalism.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Outlook For The Economy And Monetary Policy, Federal Reserve Vice Chair For Supervision Michelle W. Bowman, At The SW Graduate School Of Banking At SMU Cox: 161st Assembly For Bank Directors, Oahu, Hawaii</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good morning, and thank you for the invitation to join you today.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20260130a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;It is a pleasure to be with you for the Southwestern Graduate School of Banking's 161st Assembly for Bank Directors. Before we get started on the fireside chat, since the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) concluded its January meeting earlier this week, I think it would be helpful to summarize my views on the recent policy decision. I will then offer some remarks on the economy and also share my perspective on the outlook for monetary policy.</p>
<p>As we enter 2026, the economy has continued to grow, and I see inflation moving closer to our goal. But beneath the surface, the labor market is fragile. I will provide some perspective on why I think that fragility poses the greater risk and what that means for the path of policy.</p>
<p><span>Update on the Most Recent FOMC Meeting</span><br />At our FOMC meeting this week, my colleagues and I voted to hold the federal funds rate target range at 3-1/2 to 3-3/4 percent. Let me explain why I agreed to support this decision. I continue to see policy as moderately restrictive, and, looking ahead to 2026, my Summary of Economic Projections includes three cuts for this year. In my mind, the question at this meeting was about the timeline for implementing these cuts, essentially choosing between continuing to remove policy restraint and arriving at my estimate of neutral by the April meeting, or moving policy to neutral at a more measured pace throughout this year.</p>
<p>I do not consider downside risks to the employment side of our mandate to have diminished, and I see several indications that the labor market remains vulnerable. I could have voted in favor of continuing to remove policy restraint in order to hedge more against the risk of further labor market deterioration. But we have seen some signs of stabilization, and, after lowering the policy rate by a total of 75 basis points in the latter part of last year, in my view, we can afford to take time and "keep policy powder dry" for a little while in order to carefully assess how the lower degree of policy restraint is flowing through to broader financial conditions and strengthening the labor market. I am also reluctant to take meaningful signal from the latest data releases given the statistical noise introduced by the government shutdown. And, given that by the time of our March meeting we will have received two additional inflation and employment reports, I saw merit in waiting to take action.</p>
<p>It was not a straightforward decision. Ultimately, also considering that inflation remains somewhat elevated, at this meeting I decided to lean in favor of waiting for the upcoming sequence of data releases in order to gain more certainty about how the economy is likely to evolve in the coming months.</p>
<p><span>Current Economic Conditions</span><br />Since I presented a detailed assessment of economic conditions in a speech two weeks ago, today I will mention a few highlights and some new data points.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20260130a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;As the flow of official economic reports has been normalizing, my views on the economy have not changed appreciably, in part because I am not taking much signal from the employment and prices data given increased measurement challenges in the wake of the government shutdown. The U.S. economy has been resilient and has continued to expand at a solid pace, but I remain concerned about fragility in the labor market. I am also confident that inflation will come down toward 2 percent as tariff effects on goods inflation continue to wane in coming months.</p>
<p>GDP growth strengthened in the third quarter of last year as consumer spending accelerated. However, growth likely slowed in the fourth quarter, reflecting the government shutdown and softer momentum in consumer spending, consistent with recent weakness in personal income. Disappointingly, residential investment seems on track to decline again in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p><em>Labor Market Conditions</em><br />Turning to the labor market, we have seen conditions gradually weaken over the past year, as unemployment rose and payroll employment flattened out. Private payroll employment growth slowed further to about 30,000 per month in the fourth quarter, and weekly ADP data show job gains remaining at a similarly subdued pace through early January, well below earlier last year and below the level necessary to keep unemployment stable.</p>
<p>Although the unemployment rate edged down to 4.4 percent in December and has moved sideways in recent months, it has increased by 1/4 percentage point since the middle of last year. Moreover, the Conference Board job availability index dropped sharply in January to its lowest value since early 2021, suggesting that the unemployment rate could move back up in the first quarter.</p>
<p>The labor market has become increasingly fragile over the past year and could continue to deteriorate in the near term. Despite some tentative signs of the unemployment rate leveling off, it seems too early to say that the labor market has stabilized, especially with the added statistical noise from the government shutdown and the sharp drop in the CPS survey response rate to below the pandemic lows. Job gains have been concentrated in just a few nonbusiness service industries that are less cyclically sensitive, with health care accounting for all private job gains last quarter.</p>
<p>With a less dynamic low-hiring, low-firing labor market, which some have said is giving rise to a "jobless expansion," we could see layoffs rise quickly if firms begin to reassess their staffing needs in response to weaker activity. Although initial claims for unemployment insurance have remained low, private job cut announcements increased considerably last year, and there has been news of significant additional layoffs in January, as we heard this week from two large employers.</p>
<p><em>Inflation Developments</em><br />On inflation, we have seen considerable progress in lowering the underlying trend, considering that still-elevated inflation mostly reflects tariff effects on goods prices that I expect will fade this year. After removing these effects, core PCE inflation would have hovered close to 2 percent in recent months. The underlying trend in core PCE inflation appears to be moving much closer to our 2 percent target than is currently showing in the data.</p>
<p>Based on the latest consumer and producer price reports, 12‑month core PCE inflation likely stood at or a little below 3 percent in December, up somewhat since September. However, the Dallas and Cleveland Fed trimmed-mean measures of PCE and CPI price indexes suggest that 12-month core inflation has continued to decline. The discrepancy between these alternative measures of core inflation seems to reflect increased volatility in the recent data, with unusually large price increases in small categories, like software and video streaming, largely explaining the pickup in the core PCE inflation measure since September.</p>
<p><span>Outlook for the Economy</span><br />Looking ahead, my baseline expectation is that economic activity will continue to expand at a solid pace and the labor market will stabilize near full employment as monetary policy moves closer to a neutral setting. Less restrictive regulations, lower business taxes, and a more favorable business environment will continue to boost supply&mdash;largely due to higher productivity&mdash;and more than offset any negative effects on economic activity and inflation from other policies. I expect that the supply-side policies that I just mentioned, along with strength in AI-related investment, will continue to boost productivity gains and help ensure that inflation remains on a downward path.</p>
<p><span>The Path&nbsp;</span><span>Forward</span><br />On the outlook for monetary policy, with inflation close to 2 percent, after excluding one-off tariff effects, and with unemployment near estimates of its natural rate but at risk of deteriorating, I continue to see policy as moderately restrictive. Downside risks to the labor market have not diminished, and we should not overemphasize the latest reading on the unemployment rate.</p>
<p>I appreciated and supported the language in the post-meeting statement about the recent data, which reflects an appropriate characterization of the unemployment data as showing "some signs of stabilization."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20260130a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;It will take time to get a clear signal about stability in the labor market. My view is that we should continue to focus on downside risks to our employment mandate, and the description of the labor market is helpful to communicate that we are not overly confident. History tells us that the labor market can appear to be stable right up until it isn't.</p>
<p>As I think about the upcoming data, I am aware that first-quarter data tend to be more volatile. Therefore, in my view, we should not rely on these data as a reason to delay policy action if we see a sudden and significant deterioration in labor market conditions. We should also not immediately react if we see inflation go up in January, which has been common in recent years and could reflect residual seasonality or additional statistical noise from the government shutdown and ongoing measurement challenges.</p>
<p>I recognize and appreciate that other FOMC members may be concerned that inflation remains somewhat elevated and that we have not achieved our inflation goal for some time. However, absent a clear and sustained improvement in labor market conditions, we should be ready to adjust policy to bring it closer to neutral. We should also not imply that we expect to maintain the current stance of policy for an extended period of time because it would signal that we are not attentive to the risk that labor market conditions could deteriorate.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is important to remember that monetary policy is not on a preset course. At each FOMC meeting, my colleagues and I will evaluate incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks to our dual-mandated goals of maximum employment and price stability. I will also continue to meet with a broad range of contacts to inform my assessment of economic conditions and the appropriate stance of policy.</p>
<p><span>Closing Thoughts</span><br />As the economy continues to evolve, policy must evolve with it. My focus will remain on acting early enough to preserve both price stability and a strong labor market. Thank you again for the invitation to share my views with you today. It is a pleasure to join you.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the appointment of Demetrios (Jim) Logothetis, as Chairman, and Mark Calabria, Kyle Hauptman, and Steven Laughton, as Board members, of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). George Botic will continue his service as a Board member and will remain as Acting Chairman until Mr. Logothetis is sworn in.</p>
<p>The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 established the PCAOB to oversee the audits of public companies and broker-dealers in order to protect the interests of investors and further the public interest in the preparation of informative, accurate, and independent audit reports. The PCAOB accomplishes these goals through registering public accounting firms, setting auditing standards, conducting inspections, and pursuing disciplinary actions. The PCAOB is subject to oversight by the SEC.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am confident that this new Board will usher in a new day at the PCAOB&mdash;one of sensible, efficient oversight of auditors,&rdquo; said SEC Chairman Paul S. Atkins in a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/statement-atkins-appointment-new-pcaob-chairman-board-members-013026" title="statement-atkins-appointment-of-new-pcaob-chairman-board-members-013026">statement</a>. &ldquo;The newly appointed Chairman and Board members have already demonstrated a profound commitment to protecting investors and responsible use of such funds by accepting compensation much more in line with the ethos of public service. I look forward to working with this Board as it refocuses on the PCAOB&rsquo;s core statutory mission&mdash;protecting investors and furthering the public interest in the preparation of informative, accurate, and independent audit reports.&rdquo;</p>
<p>SEC Chief Accountant Kurt Hohl said, &ldquo;We look forward to working with the new Board in connection with furthering the PCAOB&rsquo;s central mission of promoting investor protection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chairman Atkins added, &ldquo;I would like to thank George Botic for his leadership in serving as Acting Chairman for the last six months. I also would like to thank Christina Ho, Kara Stein and Anthony Thompson for their dedicated service as members of the Board.&rdquo;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I am pleased that the Commission has appointed four new members, including a new Chairman, to the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (&ldquo;PCAOB&rdquo;). George Botic, who has served as Acting Chairman since July 2025, will continue to serve as a Board Member. I am confident that this new Board will usher in a new day at the PCAOB&mdash;one of sensible, efficient oversight of auditors.</p>
<p>When we began the search process for new PCAOB Board members in July 2025, I highlighted the role that the PCAOB plays in serving the public interest by helping to protect the integrity of public companies through oversight of auditing firms, and thus the broader public markets, in a manner that minimizes unnecessary costs for the public companies and broker-dealers who ultimately fund the PCAOB&rsquo;s budget.<a class="ck-anchor" id="ftnref1"></a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/statement-atkins-appointment-new-pcaob-chairman-board-members-013026?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;The newly appointed Chairman and Board Members have already demonstrated a profound commitment to protecting investors and responsible use of such funds by accepting compensation much more in line with the ethos of public service.</p>
<p>I look forward to working with this Board as it refocuses on the PCAOB&rsquo;s core statutory mission&mdash;protecting investors and furthering the public interest in the preparation of informative, accurate, and independent audit reports.&nbsp;Demetrios (Jim) Logothetis,&nbsp;Mark Calabria,&nbsp;Kyle Hauptman, and&nbsp;Steve Laughton bring a wide variety of experiences to their service on the Board, and I look forward to their fresh perspectives on how to best drive improvements in audit quality and fulfill the Board&rsquo;s statutory responsibilities.</p>
<p>I want to thank the current Board members for their dedicated service in advancing the PCAOB&rsquo;s important mission. Acting Chairman George Botic, and Board members Christina Ho, Kara Stein, and Anthony Thompson have carried out their many important responsibilities with diligence and professionalism. I expect the transition to the new Board will occur very quickly over the next few weeks. I also want to thank SEC staff, especially in the Office of the Chief Accountant and Office of the General Counsel, for their assistance with the Board selection process.</p>
<p>The SEC and the PCAOB often work closely on matters important to our capital markets. I intend to actively engage with the new Board as it pursues the PCAOB&rsquo;s priorities and objectives over the coming years.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Long-term review into AI</h2>
<p>Before we begin, take a look around this room. This is the Supercharged Sandbox. 23 firms at the frontier of retail financial services, chosen from 132 applications. If anyone still doubts the pace of AI change in our sector, this room is the answer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Board has asked me to lead the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/calls-input/review-long-term-impact-ai-retail-financial-services-mills-review" title="Review into the long-term impact of AI on retail financial services (The Mills Review) ">long-term review into AI</a>&nbsp;and retail financial services. I will report to the FCA Board in the summer, setting out recommendations to help the FCA continue to play a leading role in shaping AI-enabled financial services. This will culminate in an external publication to support informed debate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of you know me from my work on competition and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/consumer-duty" title="Consumer Duty">Consumer Duty</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Those seven years taught me something simple but crucial: the real challenge in regulation isn&rsquo;t dealing with what we already understand &ndash; it&rsquo;s preparing for what we don&rsquo;t.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s exactly what this review is about. Designing for the unknown.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-outcomes-based-and-technology-neutral" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Outcomes-based and technology-neutral</h2>
<p>Let me make one thing absolutely clear from the start. This review does not change our regulatory approach. We remain outcomes-based and technology-neutral. We are not unveiling new rules, nor are we prescribing how AI should be deployed today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This approach gives us and firms greater flexibility to adapt to technological change and market developments, rather than setting out detailed and prescriptive rules. We believe that with a fast-moving technology like AI, this is the best way of supporting UK growth and competitiveness, while protecting consumers and market integrity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What we are doing is looking ahead &ndash; deliberately, collaboratively and with open eyes - to understand how AI could reshape consumers&rsquo; lives, how markets might reorganise, and how regulation can stay effective in a world moving faster than any of us have known. And how we strike the right balance between risk or safety and growth and innovation. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>AI is pushing us into territory that nobody, anywhere, has fully mapped. No regulator has a complete picture. No firm does either. But we can do something far more important: we can design systems that adapt even when the path ahead isn&rsquo;t fully visible.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-why-we-need-to-design-for-the-unknown-and-why-now" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Why we need to design for the unknown &ndash; and why now</h2>
<p>AI has been used in financial services for a long time. Fraud models, trading systems, credit decisioning &ndash; nothing new. Even back in 2024, the Bank of England found that three quarters of firms were already using artificial intelligence. But the last two years have been different. Generative AI. Multimodal systems. Emerging AI agents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Millions of people in the UK now use AI tools to interpret information, plan their lives and make decisions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My favourite current use of models is to take a photo of food in my fridge and get some quick recipes for supper. But we also know from a few surveys that financial services consumers are using AI to plan their financial lives. Lloyd&rsquo;s 2025 survey found that one in three customers use AI weekly to manage their money.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of you are already building tools &ndash; from personalising financial guidance, to reinventing customer journeys and better vulnerability identification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, we know firms will continue to invest in AI, and customers will increasingly use AI to access financial services. But we shouldn&rsquo;t pretend we know how all of this plays out. We don&rsquo;t yet know which models will scale. And we don&rsquo;t know which risks will matter most &ndash; or which mitigations will actually work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What we do know is that the UK has a choice: shape the future or inherit it. Designing for the unknown is how we choose leadership, not drift.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-exploring-uncertainty-through-a-considering-a-plausible-scenario" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Exploring uncertainty through a considering a plausible scenario</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s consider a shift in what AI is capable of and what consumers and firms expect from it. The development of a 'proxy economy' in which, over time, consumers may increasingly use AI as an intelligent intermediary between themselves and firms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assistive AI is here today. Tools that explain products, compare options, prefill forms and highlight risks. They support consumers without taking decisions away from them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Advisory AI is emerging. Systems that nudge, recommend and encourage action &ndash; switching suppliers, reshaping budgets, refinancing at better rates. These tools promise better outcomes, but they also raise questions about transparency, neutrality and the basis of advice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Autonomous AI is coming into view. Agents that act within the boundaries of the consumer sets &ndash; shifting money, negotiating renewals, reallocating savings, or spotting risks before the consumer even sees them. For many households, this will be transformative. It reduces admin, improves decisions and cuts costs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me make this concrete. Imagine Sarah, a working parent in 2030. Her AI agent manages household finances within agreed boundaries by moving money to higher-rate savings, flagging uncompetitive insurance renewals, even switching current accounts on her behalf.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Sarah, this is transformative. She spends less time on admin, pays less for comparable products, and makes fewer costly mistakes.</p>
<p>But agent autonomy brings deeper questions.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>What happens when an AI agent makes a mistake?&nbsp;</li>
<li>How do we ensure consumers understand enough to stay in control?&nbsp;</li>
<li>And what happens if commercial incentives quietly shape the recommendations people see?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the questions we must ask before agent autonomy becomes normal &ndash; because once consumer behaviour shifts, it shifts fast. That is why this review matters.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-consumer-outcomes-matter" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Consumer outcomes matter</h2>
<p>Many of you are already exploring how AI can support better outcomes with more accessible guidance, adaptive tools for those who struggle with financial confidence, and proactive identification of vulnerability. I&rsquo;m excited by these opportunities. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We want to understand how firms can unlock these opportunities safely. And so designing for the unknown means looking squarely at the risks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consumers may delegate decisions they don&rsquo;t understand. People with patchy data histories may face new exclusions. Scammers may exploit AI to mimic voices, create synthetic identities or manipulate communications at scale. Even a year ago, Experian found that over a third of UK businesses reported being targeted by AI-related fraud, and the capabilities of fraudsters will only continue to grow. Firms will have to combat this with technological advances themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are also risks that are less visible day-to-day, but just as important. AI can embed or amplify bias, leading to systematically worse outcomes for some groups. It can be hard to explain to a consumer &ndash; or to ourselves &ndash; why a particular decision was made, especially where models rely on complex data and proxies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And when decisions are powered by ever more data, firms must get transparency and data protection right: using data lawfully, minimising it, securing it, and making sure customers understand what is happening and what choices they have.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And autonomous systems could make decisions that are technically logical but misaligned with a consumer&rsquo;s real-world needs &ndash; because they are optimising for proxies rather than outcomes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We want your insight on what you are seeing now &ndash; and what you suspect is coming next. The biggest failures are often born from what wasn&rsquo;t anticipated.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-competition-market-structure-and-new-entrants" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Competition, market structure and new entrants</h2>
<p>AI could change the drivers of market power in ways we need to understand early.&nbsp;</p>
<p>AI could be the great leveller. Perhaps giving a start-up the analytical power of a global bank. Or it could entrench the biggest players, the ones with the most data and the deepest pockets.</p>
<p>Big Tech firms may capture parts of the value chain without ever becoming regulated providers. Or consumers themselves, through their personal AI agents, may drive much more rapid switching, reshaping who holds power in ways we've not seen before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These dynamics could make markets more open - or more concentrated. They could enhance competition &ndash; or reconfigure it entirely.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We're not taking a view. We do not know which future will dominate. We're asking you to help us see what's coming.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because designing for the unknown means building flexibility now &ndash; while the system is still malleable &ndash; not when the structure is set in stone.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-what-does-all-this-mean-for-regulation-" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>What does all this mean for regulation?</h2>
<p>Our frameworks were built for a world where systems updated occasionally, models behaved predictably and responsibility was clearly located within the firm. AI challenges all three of those assumptions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Models now update continuously. Harms can scale in hours, not months. And responsibility sits across developers, data providers, model hosts and regulated firms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Accountability under the Senior Managers and Certification Regime (SM&amp;CR) still matters &ndash; but what does 'reasonable steps' look like when the model you rely on updates weekly, incorporates components you don&rsquo;t directly control, or behaves differently as soon as new data arrives?&nbsp;</p>
<p>What will the&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financial-stability/financial-market-infrastructure-supervision/fmi-rulebook/critical-third-parties" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)">Critical Third-Party regime<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;look like as AI firms continue to shape the landscape of financial services? And as firms continue to develop AI assurance platforms to monitor, audit, and evaluate AI systems, what should the role of the FCA be?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our approach isn&rsquo;t changing. We remain outcomes-based, technology-neutral and proportionate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But how those principles apply in a world of fast-evolving systems is something we must explore now, not later.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We want to examine how AI will change the way we apply our rules and give you the clarity you need. Designing for the unknown means building a regulatory model that can evolve with the technology &ndash; without compromising clarity or trust.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And we won't do this alone. The FCA doesn't regulate AI as a whole, nor should we. I shall work with the&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://ico.org.uk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)">Information Commissioner's Office<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>&nbsp;(ICO), the&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/competition-and-markets-authority" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)">Competition and Markets Authority<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>&nbsp;(CMA), and international counterparts to ensure a coherent environment for firms innovating in the UK.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-what-we-need-from-you" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>What we need from you</h2>
<p>This review will only be as strong as the evidence and insight we gather from those who are closest to the front lines of AI adoption &ndash; that is, from you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are asking for your views on the opportunities and risks you see as AI becomes more capable, how AI could reshape competition and the customer relationship and how existing regulatory frameworks may need to adapt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me close with this. The decisions we make in the next few years will shape retail financial services for a generation. The UK has built a sector that is trusted, innovative, and globally competitive. AI doesn't change that ambition, but it changes the landscape.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This review is about building a shared understanding, so that we can design for this future landscape together. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm asking you directly: contribute. Challenge our assumptions. Tell us what we're missing. The deadline is&nbsp;<span>24 February 2026</span>. The answers won't come from me alone, they'll come from conversations like the ones we have today.&nbsp;</p>

<title>Comment On Kevin Warsh’s Nomination As Fed Chair From James Butterfill, Head Of Research At CoinShares – Europe’s Largest Digital Asset Manager</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>It is surprising that Kevin Warsh has been chosen as the next Fed Chair given his more hawkish stance on inflation, particularly in light of President Trump&rsquo;s comments just yesterday that &ldquo;we&rsquo;re paying far too much interest in the Fed&rdquo; and that rates &ldquo;should be two points, and even three points, lower.&rdquo; This reinforces the view that there are few near-term catalysts to support Bitcoin prices.</span></p>

<p>The Chicago Business Barometer&trade;, produced with  MNI, jumped 11.3 points to 54.0 in January. The  index is in expansionary territory for the first time  since November 2023, after twenty-five consecutive  months below the key 50 mark.</p>
<p>The rise was driven by increases in Employment,  New Orders, Order Backlogs and Production. A  decline in Supplier Deliveries provided a marginal  offset.</p>
<p>Employment rose 17.5 points to the highest level  since December 2024, and comfortably above the  2025 average, but still below the 50 neutral level.</p>
<p>New Orders climbed 15.8 points to the highest  level since March 2022.</p>
<p>Order Backlogs strengthened 11.5 points, now  above 50 for the first time since December 2022.</p>
<p>Production advanced 9.1 points to the highest  since December 2023. The index sits well above the  2025 average.</p>
<p>Supplier Deliveries dipped 2.1 points, but still  remained above 50 for the twelfth consecutive  month</p>
<p>Inventories grew 14.3 points, now back in  expansionary territory for the first time since April.</p>

<title>Trump Nominates Kevin Warsh To Lead Federal Reserve</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>President Donald Trump has nominated former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh to head the U.S. central bank, replacing Jerome Powell when his term ends in May. Warsh, a frequent critic of the Fed, is known for advocating a "regime change" in monetary policy. His nomination comes as the White House continues to push for more influence over interest rate decisions.</p>
<p>"I have known Kevin for a long time and have no doubt he will go down as one of the great Fed Chairmen, maybe the best," Trump said in announcing his decision. The president added that Warsh "will never let you down."</p>
<p>Markets reacted swiftly to the news. Global stocks rose, the dollar strengthened, and gold prices dropped, as investors see Warsh as likely to support lower interest rates. However, analysts believe he would stop short of the more aggressive rate cuts favored by some of Trump&rsquo;s other potential nominees.</p>
<p>The nomination, which requires Senate confirmation, faces potential hurdles. A Republican member of the Senate Banking Committee has reiterated opposition to any Fed nominee while the Department of Justice continues a criminal investigation involving Jerome Powell, which became public earlier this month.</p>
<p>Trump announced the nomination via social media, with no public events scheduled Friday regarding the Fed. It remains unclear how quickly the nomination will move through a closely divided Senate.</p>

<title>Statement By Federal Reserve Governor Christopher J. Waller</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I dissented at the most recent meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) after concluding that cutting the policy rate by 25 basis points was the appropriate stance of policy. Three cuts to the policy rate last year have moved it closer to a neutral setting but monetary policy is still restricting economic activity, and economic data make it clear to me further easing is needed.</p>
<p>First, in contrast to the continued solid growth in economic activity, the labor market remains weak. Despite ticking down in its most recent reading, the unemployment rate has risen since the middle of last year. Payroll gains in 2025 were very weak. Compared to the prior ten-year average of about 1.9 million jobs created per year, payrolls increased just under 600,000 for 2025. And, last year's data will be revised downward soon to likely show that there was virtually no growth in payroll employment in 2025. Zero. Zip. Nada.</p>
<p>Let this sink in for a moment&mdash;zero job growth versus an average of almost 2 million for the 10 years prior to 2025. This does not remotely look like a healthy labor market. While lower labor supply was surely a factor, it also indicates considerable weakness in labor demand. Employers are reluctant to fire workers, but also very reluctant to hire. I have heard in multiple outreach meetings of planned layoffs in 2026. This indicates to me that there is considerable doubt about future employment growth and suggests that a substantial deterioration in the labor market is a significant risk.</p>
<p>Second, though inflation is elevated from tariff effects, appropriate monetary policy is to "look through" these effects as long as inflation expectations are anchored, which they are. Inflation excluding tariff effects is running close to the FOMC's 2 percent target and on a path to sustainably reach that goal.</p>
<p>With total inflation excluding tariff effects close to our target at just slightly above 2 percent and a weak labor market, the policy rate should be closer to neutral, which the median FOMC participant estimates is 3 percent, and not where we are&mdash;50 to 75 basis points above 3 percent. I favored reducing the policy rate to strengthen the labor market and guard against a deterioration that would be harder to address once it has begun.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE:ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data and the largest market in the world to trade environmental derivatives, today announced that 2025 was another record year for environmental trading on ICE.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steadily over 25 years, ICE has built the largest and most liquid energy and environmental markets in the world, markets where the prices for each are intrinsically linked,&rdquo; said Gordon Bennett, Managing Director of Utility Markets at ICE. &ldquo;2025 marks the fifth consecutive year where ICE&rsquo;s environmental markets have traded the equivalent of $1 trillion in notional value, which is a testament to the liquidity we provide to market participants who need to manage their exposure to carbon price risk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A record 20.9 million environmental futures and options contracts traded on ICE in 2025, up approximately 4% vs the previous record year in 2024, with record participation and record physical delivery of carbon allowances totalling $117 billion.</p>
<p>ICE&rsquo;s environmental markets span the globe and include ICE EU Carbon Allowance (EUA) futures and options, which represent the world&rsquo;s most liquid carbon derivatives market, as well as CORSIA, the first pan-sector carbon credit program for international aviation. 2025 saw the first delivery of ICE CORSIA (CP1) futures as market participants utilize the airline emissions reduction program.</p>
<p>ICE&rsquo;s North American environmental markets traded a record 6.2 million contracts in 2025 with ICE&rsquo;s California Carbon Allowance (CCA) markets trading a record 4.2 million contracts and ICE&rsquo;s Renewable Energy Certificate (RECs) futures and options trading a record 1.3 million contracts.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, ICE&rsquo;S EUA market hit its highest single trading day since 2021 with 193,000 contracts traded on January 20, 2026.</p>

<p class="mcePastedContent"><span><span>I had the privilege of contributing to key policy initiatives, including the development of the FSB SIFI Framework and reporting progress to the G20.

I also oversaw the operations of the Secretariat and coordinated the six FSB Regional Consultative Groups.</span></span></p>

<ul type="disc">
<li><span>An important step in Euronext&rsquo;s strategic plan to expand its SaaS offering and grow subscription-based revenues</span></li>
<li><span>The Admincontrol solutions for governance and secure collaboration ensure GDPR compliance and European data sovereignty</span></li>
<li><span>French companies benefit from local support and efficient, reliable board and transaction management tools, already trusted by 200,000 users</span><br /><br /></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify"><span>Euronext, the leading European capital market infrastructure, today announced the launch of Admincontrol&rsquo;s advanced governance and secure collaboration solutions for companies in France. Following Euronext&rsquo;s acquisition of Admincontrol in May 2025, this launch marks a significant step in scaling up its Software as a Service (SaaS) offering and increasing subscription-based revenues through Euronext Corporate Solutions, as announced in the Group&rsquo;s strategic plan&nbsp;</span><span><i>Innovate for Growth 2027</i></span><span>.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>This strategic expansion brings a suite of innovative digital solutions to companies that are based in France, with a particular focus on supporting listed companies in strengthening governance, ensuring data sovereignty and driving board efficiency.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span><b>Mathieu Caron, Head of Primary Markets at Euronext, said:</b></span><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;</span><span><i>The launch of Admincontrol&rsquo;s digital solutions in France reflects Euronext&rsquo;s commitment to supporting listed and private companies with innovative, European-owned technology. As regulatory requirements increase and data sovereignty becomes ever more important, we can now offer French-based businesses the assurance of tools with the highest level of security as well as the specific expertise of a dedicated local team, ensuring tailored support for clients and partners.&rdquo;</i></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span><b>Julien Tessier, CEO of Euronext Corporate Solutions, said:</b></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span><i>&ldquo;With this launch, Euronext brings French companies a new standard in governance and secure collaboration. The solutions are designed to be simple, reliable and fully compliant with European regulations, helping boards and executives focus on what matters most: effective decision-making and strategic growth.&rdquo;</i></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span><b>A comprehensive suite of solutions for board management and transactions</b></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>Admincontrol&rsquo;s governance suite includes three mission-critical products designed for the needs of boards and executive teams:</span></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><span><b>Board portal:</b></span><span>&nbsp;A secure, user-friendly platform for organising board meetings, sharing confidential documents and facilitating seamless communication among directors.</span></li>
<li><span><b>Board evaluation:</b></span><span>&nbsp;Newly added to Euronext&rsquo;s governance offering, this tool supports annual board assessments, recommended for all listed companies to ensure best practice and regulatory compliance.</span></li>
<li><span><b>Transaction management (data room):</b></span><span>&nbsp;A highly secure shared drive for due diligence processes, essential for IPOs, M&amp;A and other transactions, enabling confidential document exchange and collaboration.</span><br /><br /></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify"><span>These solutions are trusted by more than 7,500 organisations, including over 1,000 listed companies, and 200,000 users across 95 countries, with a strong presence in the Nordics and the United Kingdom. The Admincontrol platform is recognised for its robust security (ISO 27001:2022 and SOC 2 Type II certified), simplicity-first design, and reliability.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>LSEG and ICBC (Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited) today announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to strengthen long‑term strategic cooperation across global financial markets, data and analytics, cross-border RMB, sustainable finance, and financial innovation.<br /><br />The agreement reinforces the long‑standing partnership between two of the world&rsquo;s leading financial institutions and creates a framework for expanding collaboration in capital markets, trading, clearing, data, RMB business and emerging technologies.</p>
<p><span>Fiona Bassett, CEO FTSE Russell, an LSEG business, said</span>: &ldquo;ICBC has been a valued partner of LSEG for many years, and today&rsquo;s agreement marks an important next step in strengthening that relationship further. By combining ICBC&rsquo;s scale and influence with LSEG&rsquo;s global data, trading and post‑trade capabilities, we will be creating new opportunities for issuers, investors and institutions worldwide.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Mr. Zhang Weiwu, Vice President at ICBC, said:</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;As a global systemically important bank, ICBC together with LSEG, as a leading global financial market infrastructure provider, are two highly respected institutions in our respective countries. We look forward to further deepening our relationship with LSEG, jointly advancing financial innovation, market connectivity and cross-border RMB development, and to delivering concrete outcomes for UK-China cooperation and the broader global financial market ecosystem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Memorandum of Understanding on the strategic collaboration was signed in Beijing on 29<span>th</span>&nbsp;January 2026 by Fiona Bassett, on behalf of LSEG and Zhang Weiwu, Vice President of ICBC, during the UK Prime Minister&rsquo;s visit to China.</p>

<title>SGX RegCo Proposes Rule Changes To Facilitate Wider Adoption Of Broker Custody Accounts</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sgx-regco-proposes-rule-changes-to-facilitate-wider-adoption-of-broker-custody-a-2026130/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sgx-regco-proposes-rule-changes-to-facilitate-wider-adoption-of-broker-custody-a-2026130/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Singapore Exchange Regulation (SGX RegCo) is seeking public feedback on proposed rule amendments to facilitate the broader use of broker custody accounts, in line with global practices. This follows the Equities Market Review Group&rsquo;s endorsement of modernising Singapore&rsquo;s post-trade custody infrastructure and its recommendation to introduce supporting measures to ensure a smooth transition for market participants moving towards a broker custody model.</p>
<p>Today, about two-thirds of retail accounts in The Central Depository (Pte) Limited (CDP) are individually-segregated direct accounts, while the remaining one-third are in broker custody accounts. Retail investors who maintain direct accounts in CDP for their SGX-listed stocks also maintain broker custody accounts, usually on an omnibus basis, for their foreign-listed shares.</p>
<p>If investors adopt the same broker custody model for both their SGX-listed and foreign-listed securities, they can view and manage all their holdings together through the same broker. Brokers will also be able to offer investors more value-added services, such as fractional trading, portfolio management, robo-investing, as well as other innovative products and services.</p>
<p>Introducing an omnibus broker custody model could also encourage greater participation by internationally active asset managers and enhance Singapore&rsquo;s competitiveness as a trading and investment hub. These asset managers are accustomed to omnibus structures in other major markets, but must currently maintain a separate system to accommodate individually-segregated accounts when operating in Singapore. Aligning with the omnibus approach will make it easier for them to enter and participate more actively in Singapore&rsquo;s stock market.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The concept of broker custody accounts is not new to Singapore market participants. We believe it is timely for a wider adoption of the broker custody model as it brings meaningful benefits for both investors and brokers. Investors can consolidate both their overseas and local portfolios with a single broker and tap into value‑added services such as customised insights and portfolio management. This streamlined experience supports more active investor engagement, while giving brokers greater ability to offer more value-added services and strengthen their client relationships,&rdquo; said Ng Yao Loong, Head of Equities, SGX Group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As we modernise our market infrastructure, we want to ensure that the standards of our custody framework remain robust. Our proposals seek to provide strong assurance on the integrity of the operational and custody processes that intermediaries employ to service investors. More consistent and reliable processes across the industry will support wider adoption of the broker custody modeland ultimately contribute to a more dynamic and competitive stock market,&rdquo; said Tan Boon Gin, CEO of SGX RegCo.</p>
<p>SGX RegCo is consulting on rule amendments to effect the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>enable the use of omnibus broker custody accounts;</li>
<li>require those who operate broker custody accounts (i.e. brokers and depository agents) to facilitate clients&rsquo; exercise of shareholder rights. This includes requiring them to disseminate to clients notices of meetings and corporate action events, to assist clients in requisitioning meetings and to provide clients sufficient time to give instructions; and</li>
<li>enhance the regulatory framework for depository agents to maintain robust regulatory oversight.</li>
</ul>
<p>The consultation is found&nbsp;<a href="https://regco.sgx.com/public-consultations">here</a>&nbsp;and is open till 27 March 2026.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the proposed changes, retail investors may choose to continue using direct accounts even after the changes take effect.</p>

<title>ASIC: Federal Court Orders Australian Unity Funds Management To Pay $7 Million Penalty For Failing To Confirm Product Suitability For Investors</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-federal-court-orders-australian-unity-funds-management-to-pay-7-million-p-2026130/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-federal-court-orders-australian-unity-funds-management-to-pay-7-million-p-2026130/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Federal Court has ordered Australian Unity Funds Management Limited (Australian Unity) to pay a $7.125 million pecuniary penalty for breaching design and distribution obligations (DDO) by failing to confirm the suitability of one of its products for retail investors.</p>
<p>As responsible entity of the Australian Unity Select Income Fund (Fund), Australian Unity admitted that it failed to take reasonable steps to ensure that interests in the Fund were only distributed to investors who matched the criteria outlined in its three Target Market Determinations (TMDs) for the Fund.</p>
<p>As a result, hundreds of retail investors were able to invest in the Fund even though the product may not have been suitable for them under those TMDs.</p>
<p>Australian Unity, also known as AUFM, admitted that it issued interests in the Fund to retail clients:</p>
<ul>
<li>on 89 occasions without requiring them to submit, as part of their application, a completed questionnaire with answers to questions to determine whether they were within the target market described in the Fund TMDs, and</li>
<li>on 239 occasions without reviewing submitted questionnaires that had been completed by them to determine whether they were within the target market described in the Fund TMDs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Deputy Chair Sarah Court said, &lsquo;Australian Unity breached the design and distribution obligations and failed to take reasonable steps to ensure its retail product distribution conduct, in this case, the issuing of interests in the Fund, aligned with its target market determinations.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is no value to investors if product issuers develop a target market determination for a product but fail to take steps to ensure that those products are distributed consistently with the target market determination.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In this case, of 328 non-advised investors who applied to acquire an interest in the Fund, 89 were not required to submit a questionnaire to assess their suitability. Of the other 239 who&nbsp;<em>did</em>&nbsp;submit responses, up to 144 of them provided at least one response that suggested they were not in the target market for the Fund.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The failure to assess product suitability for investors can expose them to products which are not appropriate for them and create the potential for financial loss.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This outcome sends a clear message to product issuers that there are significant consequences for failing to take reasonable steps to ensure that investors are within a product&rsquo;s target market before they issue interests in the product&rsquo;, the Deputy Chair said.</p>
<p>His Honour Justice Moshinsky said in his reasons published today that Australian Unity&rsquo;s &lsquo;failings are serious. Moreover, there is no satisfactory explanation for how they came about.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&hellip;[T]he explanation is essentially that the person tasked with ensuring compliance with the DDO regime (the DDO Project Manager) did not have appropriate experience or training.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This reflects poorly on the &lsquo;compliance culture&rsquo; of AUFM at the time. It suggests that AUFM did not take its regulatory obligations sufficiently seriously.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, His Honour observed that specific investors identified in the judgment:</p>
<p>&lsquo;...were exposed to the risk that they might have obtained a financial product that was not appropriate to their objectives, financial situation or needs, and to the risk of financial loss&hellip;,&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In addition to the pecuniary penalty, the Court has ordered that Australian Unity publish a written adverse publicity notice and send the notice directly to the last known email or postal address of impacted investors, being those who were either not required to submit a completed questionnaire as part of their application, or whose submitted questionnaires were not reviewed by Australian Unity and included at least one response which indicated that they were not in the target market for the Fund.</p>
<p>Australian Unity has also been ordered to pay ASIC&rsquo;s costs of these proceedings.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Orders were made by the Federal Court of Australia in December 2025, and written reasons were published on 30 January 2026.</p>
<p>Australian Unity is the responsible entity of the Fund and between 5 October 2021 and 5 October 2023, it made three TMDs identifying the class of suitable investors for the Fund.</p>
<p>Australian Unity admitted that it contravened s 994E(3) of the&nbsp;<em>Corporations Act 2001&nbsp;</em>(Cth).</p>
<p>On 6 October 2023, Australian Unity updated the Fund TMD to include new distribution conditions which require Australian Unity to review responses to questionnaires prior to issuing interests in the Fund to prospective investors. Since October 2023, it has made the questionnaire compulsory for prospective investors and from July 2024, the questionnaires included &lsquo;knock out questions&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The DDO regime requires financial product issuers and distributors to develop and maintain effective product governance arrangements across the life cycle of financial products. It requires product issuers to make a TMD by, among other things, identifying the class of retail clients that comprise the target market for their products. The maker of the TMD must take reasonable steps to ensure that the product is issued and distributed consistently with the TMD.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Green and Sustainable Finance Cross‑Agency Steering Group (Steering Group) convened its 12<span>th</span>&nbsp;meeting yesterday (29 January 2026), setting out its strategic priorities for 2026-2028 to further strengthen Hong Kong&rsquo;s role as a competitive and future‑ready sustainable finance centre.</p>
<p>Building on the solid foundation of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sustainablefinance.org.hk/en/news-insights/cross-agency-steering-group-announces-priorities-to-further-strengthen-hong-kongs-sustainable-finance-ecosystem">2023-2025 plan</a>, the Steering Group&rsquo;s strategic priorities for the next three years are anchored around two key pillars:</p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;</span><span>Consolidate and strengthen efforts to solidify Hong Kong as a sustainable finance centre</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Strengthening the sustainability disclosure ecosystem, including sustainability assurance, supporting high-quality transition plan disclosure, and the effective use of technology.</li>
<li>Expanding and deepening sustainable finance markets through facilitating sustainable capital flows through Hong Kong and strengthening cross border carbon market collaboration.</li>
<li>Strengthening external engagement via events and participation in global dialogues.</li>
<li>Supporting talent development through capacity building initiatives.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;</span><span>Develop Hong Kong&rsquo;s strengths in emerging areas</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Scaling transition finance with practical guidance, enabling tools and case studies, while encouraging wider industry adoption of transition planning.</li>
<li>Supporting adaptation finance by building market readiness, identifying capability gaps, and supporting product innovation and development, while strengthening physical risk assessment capabilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Julia Leung, Co-Chair of the Steering Group and Chief Executive Officer of the Securities and Futures Commission said, &ldquo;These updated priorities underscore our ongoing commitment to ensuring Hong Kong remains globally aligned, forward‑looking, and responsive to market needs. Enhancing disclosures and scaling transition finance are essential to supporting credible outcomes, transparent and science‑based pathways across the financial system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eddie Yue, Co-Chair of the Steering Group and&nbsp;Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, said,&ldquo;Hong Kong&rsquo;s sustainable finance market has witnessed significant development in the past few years. The 2026-2028 priorities will reinforce our groundwork for building a robust sustainable finance ecosystem, while positioning Hong Kong to capture the emerging opportunities in Asia&rsquo;s transition to a low-carbon and climate-resilient economy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the meeting, members also reviewed the progress made on the implementation of the Roadmap on Sustainability Disclosure in Hong Kong (Note 1), including ongoing work on sustainability assurance (Note 2) and initiatives to strengthen the sustainability disclosure ecosystem. They also acknowledged the significant strides in establishing Hong Kong as a leading hub for sustainable and transition finance, including enhancing the Hong Kong Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance (Note 3), developing transition planning guidance for the banking sector, developing carbon market, and hosting major sustainable finance events in Hong Kong.</p>

<title>ASIC Proposes Updates To Legislative Instruments About Financial Reporting</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-proposes-updates-to-legislative-instruments-about-financial-reporting-2026130/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC is seeking feedback on its proposals to remake three legislative instruments relating to financial reporting relief and allow another instrument to sunset.</p>
<p>The three legislative instruments, which are due to sunset on 1 April 2026, are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2016L00442/latest/text"><em>ASIC Corporations (Rounding in Financial/Directors' Reports) Instrument 2016/191</em></a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2016L00452/latest/text"><em>ASIC Corporations (Electronic Lodgment of Financial and Sustainability Reports) Instrument 2016/181</em></a>, and</li>
<li><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2016L00327/latest/text"><em>ASIC Corporations (Disregarding Technical Relief) Instrument 2016/73</em></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have determined these instruments are operating effectively and continue to form a necessary and useful part of the legislative framework. The effect of these instruments will remain unchanged when remade.</p>
<p>As part of this work, we are proposing to withdraw Regulatory Guide 28&nbsp;<em>Relief from dual lodgement of financial reports&nbsp;</em>(<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/regulatory-guides/rg-28-relief-from-dual-lodgment-of-financial-reports/" title="RG 28 Relief from dual lodgment of financial reports">RG 28</a>), which provides redundant guidance about dual lodgement relief.<strong><br /></strong></p>
<p>ASIC is also seeking feedback on a proposal to allow&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2016L00344/latest/text"><em>ASIC Corporations (Offer Information Statements) Instrument 2016/76</em></a>&nbsp;to sunset on 1 April 2026. Offer information statements (OIS) are rarely used, and it is unlikely that a financial report in an OIS would cover a period other than 12 months.</p>
<p>The four instruments impacted are part of the draft proposed instrument consolidation at Attachment B to Report 813&nbsp;<em>Regulatory simplification&nbsp;</em>(<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-813-regulatory-simplification/" title="REP 813 Regulatory simplification">REP 813</a>). We are considering feedback on this and will provide an update later in 2026.</p>
<h2>Providing feedback</h2>
<p>Submissions should be sent to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:rri.consultation@asic.gov.au">rri.consultation@asic.gov.au</a>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<strong>5pm AEDT on 27 February 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>Refer to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/consultations/cs-45-proposed-remake-and-sunset-of-financial-reporting-related-legislative-instruments/" title="CS 45 Proposed remake and sunset of financial reporting-related legislative instruments">CS 45&nbsp;<em>Proposed remake and sunset of financial reporting-related legislative instruments</em></a>.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Under the&nbsp;<em>Legislation Act 2003</em>, all legislative instruments automatically sunset after 10 years, unless ASIC takes action to preserve them.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2016L00442/latest/text">ASIC Instrument 2016/191</a>&nbsp;allows entities to round amounts presented in financial reports and directors&rsquo; reports to the nearest thousand dollars.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2016L00452/latest/text">ASIC Instrument 2016/181</a>&nbsp;allows entities listed on the securities exchanges operated by ASX Limited, National Stock Exchange of Australia Limited and Sydney Stock Exchange Limited to lodge financial reports, sustainability reports and directors&rsquo; reports electronically with the market operator without having to lodge the reports with ASIC.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2016L00344/latest/text">ASIC Instrument 2016/76</a>&nbsp;enables the period for the financial report included in an offer information statement to be longer or shorter than 12 months by up to seven days.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2016L00327/latest/text">ASIC Instrument 2016/73</a>&nbsp;allows entities to prepare a disclosure document or product disclosure statement for &lsquo;continuously quoted securities&rsquo; under sections 713 and 1013FA of the&nbsp;<em>Corporations Act 2001</em>&nbsp;(Corporations Act) and to lodge &lsquo;cleansing notices&rsquo; under sections 708A and 1012DA of the Corporations Act (even when the entity, its director or auditor are covered by ASIC instruments). The coverage of these instruments would disqualify the securities from being &lsquo;continuously quoted securities&rsquo;.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/regulatory-guides/rg-28-relief-from-dual-lodgment-of-financial-reports/" title="RG 28 Relief from dual lodgment of financial reports">RG 28</a>&nbsp;sets out dual lodgement arrangements available under the redundant ASIC Class Order [CO 98/104].</p>

<title>CFTC Chair Selig, SEC Chair Atkins: Team Trump Readies Crypto Plan So Americans Can Count On Their Future - Joint Initiative Aims To Provide Regulatory Clarity As Congress Advances Bipartisan Cryptocurrency Legislation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>America&rsquo;s financial markets are the strongest and most trusted in the world because they were built upon the premises of clear rules and fair enforcement.</p>
<p>Rather than adhere to these principles, the Biden administration chased headlines with flashy enforcement actions and instituted opaque rules that stifled progress. But thanks to the leadership of President Donald Trump, America&rsquo;s financial regulators are returning to the basic tenets that made our markets the envy of the world.</p>
<p>As new technologies reshape the financial services landscape, we must ensure that innovation thrives on American soil and under American law &ndash; in service of everyday Americans.</p>
<p>To that end, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) are re-launching Project Crypto as a joint policy initiative to better prepare U.S. markets for the digital era.</p>
<p>As markets move on-chain, regulators must keep pace. Congress is advancing bipartisan legislation to establish a federal framework for digital asset markets. But legislation alone cannot deliver the clarity that investors and market participants need. We must pair it with disciplined regulatory execution, grounded in merit neutrality and free market principles. These are outcomes that the SEC and CFTC are ready to meet to usher in a new era of coordinated and durable financial regulation.</p>
<p>We have designed Project Crypto to ensure that when Congress acts, the United States is ready to reinforce our global financial leadership. That includes sequencing &ndash; not stacking &ndash; new requirements through sensible implementation roadmaps; creating clear regulatory on-ramps for compliant participants; modernizing surveillance tools to reflect on-chain and hybrid market activity; and engaging transparently with new entrants, incumbents, investors and consumers alike.</p>
<p>We must act quickly to upgrade our rules and regulations to accommodate blockchain technology, digital assets and the legislation to come, or risk ceding these emerging markets to foreign regimes.</p>
<p>At its core, Project Crypto and our broader harmonization efforts reflect a shared philosophy: financial regulation must be precise, not punitive. Rules must be narrowly tailored to address material risks, nimble enough to adapt to technological change and remain anchored in our agencies&rsquo; statutory authorities. This principle guides our approach to registration, disclosure, market oversight, custody, clearing and surveillance in digital asset markets &ndash; while avoiding the reflex to impose ill-suited legacy structures on new technological realities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For too long, bureaucratic regulators have forced market participants to navigate boundaries that are unclear in application and misaligned in design, particularly where economically similar activities are treated differently based solely on legacy jurisdictional silos. This fragmentation is not merely inconvenient; it limits innovation and hampers investor opportunities.</p>
<p>In on-chain markets, where trading, clearing, settlement and custody are integrated, regulatory seams create friction that impairs risk management, margin efficiency and surveillance effectiveness. As markets move, on-chain and participation deepens, these distortions only compound.</p>
<p>Maintaining duplicative or conflicting requirements for the same economic activity undermines market resilience and regulatory clarity. The status quo cannot sustain U.S. dominance in 21st-century finance. Project Crypto aims to address &mdash; and, where possible, eliminate &mdash; these conflicts.</p>
<p>The SEC-CFTC harmonization agenda begins with fundamentals: aligned definitions, coordinated oversight, and seamless, secure data sharing between agencies. Market participants should not be saddled with duplicative agency registrations and sets of regulations in order to offer economically similar products that can be effectively regulated under a unified approach. Harmonization strengthens standards through coherence, predictability, and economic rationality.</p>
<p>Project Crypto represents a modern model of inter-agency coordination, recognizing that today&rsquo;s markets do not conform to 20th-century silos. The SEC and CFTC bring complementary statutory mandates, supervisory capabilities and market expertise. Acting in concert, these capabilities become symbiotic rather than duplicative, delivering clarity and principled oversight as market structures evolve.</p>
<p>The stakes are high. Global jurisdictions compete aggressively to attract digital asset activity - some prioritizing speed over safeguards, others imposing rigidity that stifles growth. America&rsquo;s advantage has always been its ability to balance both.</p>
<p>If we fail to provide clarity, innovation migrates elsewhere. If we regulate with a heavy hand, we do not reduce risk, we encourage it. Project Crypto reflects our shared belief that the United States can lead by doing what it has always done best: pairing strong rule of law with an openness to progress.</p>
<p>The future of finance will be built somewhere. Through Project Crypto, and disciplined, harmonized, minimum-effective-dose regulation, we ensure that it is built here, under rules that protect investors, promote innovation and cement America&rsquo;s leadership in the global financial system.</p>

<title>US Treasury Releases Report On Macroeconomic And Foreign Exchange Policies Of Major Trading Partners Of The United States</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/us-treasury-releases-report-on-macroeconomic-and-foreign-exchange-policies-of-ma-2026129/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/us-treasury-releases-report-on-macroeconomic-and-foreign-exchange-policies-of-ma-2026129/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The U.S. Department of the Treasury delivered its semiannual Report to Congress on Macroeconomic and Foreign Exchange Policies of Major Trading Partners of the United States.&nbsp; In this Report, Treasury reviewed and assessed the policies of major U.S. trading partners, comprising about 78 percent of U.S. foreign trade in goods and services, during the four quarters through June 2025.</p>
<p class="pf0">Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent remarked: &ldquo;President Trump is committed to pursuing economic and trade policies that will spur an American revitalization marked by strong economic growth, the elimination of destructive trade deficits, and countering unfair trade practices.&nbsp;Treasury is closely monitoring whether our trading partners are acting through foreign exchange intervention and non-market policies and practices to manipulate their currencies for unfair competitive advantage in trade. In support of President Trump&rsquo;s America First Trade Policy, starting with this Report, Treasury is strengthening its analysis of trading partners&rsquo; currency policies and practices.&nbsp; These enhanced analyses inform Treasury&rsquo;s assessments of exchange rate policies and practices of the United States&rsquo; major trading partners.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Report highlights that, as part of President Trump&rsquo;s America First Trade Policy, in Spring 2025 Treasury initiated discussions with a number of trading partners that have regularly appeared on the Monitoring List of recent Foreign Exchange Reports.&nbsp; To date, Treasury has released joint statements with the relevant authorities of six major trading partners &ndash; Japan, Switzerland, Malaysia, Thailand, Korea, and Taiwan.&nbsp; These joint statements reinforce close consultations on macroeconomic and foreign exchange matters and reaffirm each party&rsquo;s commitment to avoid manipulating exchange rates to prevent effective balance of payments adjustment or to gain an unfair competitive advantage.&nbsp; They also highlight the importance of transparent exchange rate policies and practices, and improve the frequency and timeliness of trading partners&rsquo; foreign exchange disclosures.</p>
<p>In accordance with the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, Treasury analyzed in this Report the practices of the United States&rsquo; major trading partners and concluded that no major U.S. trading partner manipulated the rate of exchange between its currency and the U.S. dollar for purposes of preventing effective balance of payments adjustments or gaining unfair competitive advantage in international trade during the four quarters through June 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Body">While Treasury has not designated China as a currency manipulator in this Report, China stands out among our major trading partners in its lack of transparency around its exchange rate policies and practices.&nbsp;This lack of transparency will not preclude Treasury from designating China if available evidence suggests that it is intervening through formal or informal channels to resist RMB appreciation in the future.&nbsp; Given China&rsquo;s extremely large and growing external surpluses, and its substantially undervalued exchange rate, it is important that the Chinese authorities allow the RMB exchange rate to strengthen in a timely and orderly manner in line with market pressure and macroeconomic fundamentals.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Body">In this Report, Treasury found that no major trading partner met all three criteria for enhanced analysis under the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 during the four quarters ending June 2025.&nbsp; However,&nbsp;ten economies are on Treasury&rsquo;s &ldquo;Monitoring List&rdquo; of major trading partners whose currency practices and macroeconomic policies merit close attention:&nbsp;China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam, Germany, Ireland, and Switzerland.&nbsp; All except Thailand were on the Monitoring List in the June 2025 Report.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As noted above, this Report for the first time contains strengthened analysis of these economies.&nbsp;Specifically:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In addition to its assessment of whether a trading partner is engaging in persistent, one-sided intervention as required under the 2015 Act, Treasury is now monitoring more broadly the extent to which economies that choose to smooth exchange rate movements do so to resist depreciation pressure in the same manner as they do to resist appreciation pressure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Treasury is also increasing its vigilance about other policies beyond foreign exchange intervention employed by U.S. major trading partners that may influence foreign exchange markets such as through the use of capital controls and macroprudential measures and through other government investment vehicles such as government pension funds.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because central banks may use foreign exchange swaps to sterilize or offset spot interventions so as not to affect domestic monetary conditions, Treasury is also now looking more closely at trading partners&rsquo; net forward positions.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Today&rsquo;s Report is submitted to Congress pursuant to Section 3005 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, 22 U.S.C. &sect; 5305, and Section 701 of the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015, 19 U.S.C. &sect; 4421.&nbsp;</p>

<title>New Zealand Financial Markets Authority Issues A Warning To Insurance Company For Failure To Apply Advertised Discounts</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-issues-a-warning-to-insurance-company-fo-2026129/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-issues-a-warning-to-insurance-company-fo-2026129/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Financial Markets Authority (FMA) - Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko &ndash; has issued a public warning to Aioi Nissay Dowa Insurance (AIOI) for failure to apply advertised discounts to customers purchasing their motor vehicle insurance policies.</p>
<p>In March 2024 Aioi Nissay Dowa Management New Zealand Limited (the subsidiary responsible for providing services to customers in New Zealand) notified the FMA of a discount issue relating to policies that did not receive their multi-vehicle discount and/or multi-policy discount, resulting in overcharges to customers on their motor vehicle insurance policies. The policies were sold through various vehicle dealerships and online.</p>
<p>AIOI overcharged 5,055 customers almost $700,000 over nine years.</p>
<p>FMA Executive Director of Response and Enforcement Louise Unger says: &ldquo;Manual processes used to identify customers with more than one policy failed and customers eligible for discounts were not identified. This resulted in AIOI issuing incorrect invoices and contravening the fair dealing provisions set out in Part 2 of the FMC Act, with a significant number of customers impacted by the issue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Customers should rightly expect to be treated fairly and that promises made to them will be honoured. We expect financial institutions to invest in quality systems and controls that enable them to deliver on advertised promises and to also identify issues and be capable of resolving those issues effectively and quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We also expect that financial institutions are proactively reviewing their products and services to ensure that they perform in the way they are described.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over the past several years, the FMA has clearly communicated its expectations around ensuring premiums are accurate, transparent, and administered correctly. &nbsp;However, we continue to encounter issues with discounts and premiums not being correctly applied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this case, AIOI acted responsibly in notifying FMA at its earliest opportunity, self-reporting the matter three days after it became aware of the issue. They have taken proactive steps to identify all affected policy holders, notify them and make remediation payments. They have also taken steps to prevent the issue reoccurring.</p>
<p>"There is no evidence of deliberate misconduct, and the root cause of the issue can be attributed to either poor controls or ineffective systems.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The FMA has a number of tools available, and we consider that a public warning, is appropriate in this case.&rdquo;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good afternoon. Thank you, Chairman Atkins, for your kind introduction. And, to our guests, welcome to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Before I begin, I must note that the views I share today are my own as Chairman and do not necessarily reflect those of the Commission.</p>
<p>I am pleased that my first public remarks as Chairman could be here at the CFTC, an institution with a rich and distinguished heritage of overseeing markets that facilitate price discovery, risk management, and reliable commodity prices for everyday Americans.</p>
<p>As these are my first public remarks, I would like to begin with a few words of thanks:</p>
<p>First, to President Trump, I am grateful for the trust and confidence you have placed in me to lead the Commission during this historic time.</p>
<p>Second, to Chairman Atkins, it was the honor of a lifetime to work with you and Commissioner Peirce at the SEC. You are a principled and inspiring leader. And I am thrilled to work with you in this new role to modernize and harmonize our agencies&rsquo; regulatory frameworks.</p>
<p>Third, to the dedicated staff of the CFTC, thank you for the warm welcome. This agency&rsquo;s reputation is a direct reflection of your expertise, professionalism, and public service. I look forward to partnering with you as we carry that responsibility forward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today marks the beginning of a new chapter for the CFTC. One that builds on the Commission&rsquo;s legacy while sharpening its focus on regulatory clarity, inter-agency coordination, and permissionless innovation.</p>
<p><strong>From Open Outcry to Open Source: A Tradition of Market Innovation</strong></p>
<p>For more than a century and a half, America&rsquo;s commodity futures markets have served a proving ground for innovation&mdash;not just in what is traded, but in how risk is managed, prices are discovered, and trust is established among market participants.</p>
<p>That tradition began in earnest in 1848, with the founding of the Chicago Board of Trade. What started as a physical meeting place for merchants trading grain and livestock quickly evolved into something more consequential: a system for standardizing contracts, aggregating dispersed information, and enabling producers and consumers to manage price risk over time.</p>
<p>As trading activity expanded in the late nineteenth century, new distribution technologies&mdash;telegraph lines, railroads, and printed quotations&mdash;dramatically broadened access to market prices. Alongside organized exchanges, informal venues known as &ldquo;bucket shops&rdquo; emerged&mdash;offering retail customers exposure to commodity prices without requiring physical delivery. While these operations often lacked quality and integrity, their popularity underscored a growing public appetite for participation in price discovery and risk-taking tied to real economic activity.</p>
<p>In response, organized exchanges moved to reinforce the distinction between transparent, rules-based markets and purely speculative imitation. Litigation over access to price quotations culminated in judicial recognition of the exchanges&rsquo; role in safeguarding market integrity. In the end, the Board of Trade obtained a victory at the U.S Supreme Court<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opaselig1?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;and trading in the future price of commodities migrated onto organized trading venues that came to be known as &ldquo;pits&rdquo; because of their unique physical design.</p>
<p>The economic dislocation of the Great Depression prompted Congress to formalize this framework. The Commodity Exchange Act required futures trading to occur on organized exchanges and obligated so-called &ldquo;designated contract markets&rdquo; (DCMs) to enforce rules to prevent fraud and manipulation. In 1974, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission was established to oversee these markets as they continued to evolve.</p>
<p>As American ingenuity progressed, innovation again reshaped market structure. Open trading floors gave way to electronic platforms. Without the restriction of limited real estate, the universe of futures contracts exploded as new exchanges proliferated, listing thousands of unique products. Congress responded not by freezing markets in place, but by modernizing market oversight. During this period of rapid transformation, Congress and the CFTC collaborated to craft the Commodity Futures Modernization Act, which embraced self-certification and principles-based regulation, recognizing that markets innovate faster than prescriptive rulebooks&mdash;and that regulatory frameworks must be durable and flexible.</p>
<p>Around this period, the CFTC and SEC were grappling with jurisdictional questions concerning new derivatives products, including single-stock and security index futures. The absence of clear statutory alignment created uncertainty for market participants and constrained domestic development. Over time, however, the agencies, working with Congress, came together to resolve these questions through the &ldquo;Shad-Johnson Accord,&rdquo; restoring clarity and enabling these markets to thrive here in the U.S.</p>
<p>Today, commodity markets are once again experiencing a period of rapid transformation. Blockchains, crypto assets, and smart contracts are introducing new methods for trading, clearing, settling, margining, and collateralizing commodity price exposures. These innovations have the potential to reduce operational frictions by enhancing liquidity and streamlining post-trade processes. At the same time, new products such as prediction markets, &ldquo;mini&rdquo; contracts, and perpetual futures have experienced rapid adoption. We are witnessing the foundation of modern markets take shape.</p>
<p>As this transformation unfolds, the CFTC has an opportunity to build on its historic role as a forward-looking regulator. By applying clear rules, principles-based oversight, and harmonizing with fellow regulators, the Commission can help ensure that the next generation of commodity markets develop onshore&mdash;continuing a legacy that stretches from the grain pits of Chicago to the digital markets of the future.</p>
<p><strong>America at 250: The Crypto Capital of the World</strong></p>
<p>America is home to the most transparent and well-regulated financial markets in the world&mdash;markets that are grounded in market integrity and institutional trust. With thoughtful engagement and a commitment to principled innovation, the U.S. is uniquely positioned to extend its preeminence into the crypto era.</p>
<p>And thanks to the leadership of President Trump, &ldquo;Operation Chokepoint 2.0&rdquo; is history, regulation by enforcement is dead, the GENIUS Act is law, Congress is on the cusp of passing market structure legislation, and the U.S. is now the crypto capital of the world.</p>
<p>But we cannot assume this will always be the case. America&rsquo;s financial regulators must modernize and harmonize their approach to regulation to future-proof our markets for the innovations of tomorrow. And, while market structure legislation will certainly advance these goals, we cannot and will not let this opportunity pass us by while Congress continues its work.</p>
<p>That is why I have already directed CFTC staff to make full use of the agency&rsquo;s existing authorities to begin upgrading our regulations for America&rsquo;s Golden Age. Whether incumbents or new entrants, the CFTC&rsquo;s doors are open to those looking to innovate.</p>
<p><strong>Project Crypto: Modernizing and Harmonizing Financial Regulation for the Golden Age&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Before I share some exciting news, I would like to thank former Commissioner Caroline Pham for her leadership as acting chairman. She took important steps to position the CFTC for the future by launching the Crypto Sprint initiative, which helped orient the agency at a critical moment towards the opportunities and challenges presented by crypto assets.</p>
<p>Today, we are building on that foundation. Rather than running a parallel initiative with the SEC, I am pleased to announce that the CFTC is partnering with the SEC on Project Crypto&mdash;bringing coordination, coherence, and a unified approach to the federal oversight of crypto asset markets.</p>
<p>Project Crypto recognizes that crypto markets span across our agencies&rsquo; respective regulatory boundaries. Chairman Atkins and I view this moment as a generational opportunity for our agencies to collaborate on clear, durable, rules of the road for these markets.</p>
<p>Through this partnership, we will advance a clear crypto asset taxonomy, clarify jurisdictional lines, remove duplicative compliance requirements, and reduce regulatory fragmentation&mdash;ensuring that innovation takes root on American soil, under American law, and in service of American investors, customers, and businesses.</p>
<p><strong>New Accord: Delivering Clarity and Certainty to Crypto Asset Markets</strong></p>
<p>Earlier, I mentioned the historic Shad-Johnson Accord, which resolved one jurisdictional dispute between the CFTC and SEC and was later codified into statute. With a wide range of new crypto assets and on-chain financial markets, we&rsquo;re due for a new cross-agency agreement to govern these markets.</p>
<p>I agree with Chairman Atkins that &ldquo;most crypto assets trading today are not securities.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opaselig1?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;But, for too long, crypto asset market participants have struggled to determine whether they are subject to regulation by the SEC, the CFTC, or both. Instead of leaving the industry trapped in uncertainty, as we witnessed under prior administrations, it is incumbent on us to draw a bright jurisdictional line for our nation&rsquo;s builders and innovators.</p>
<p>Chairman Atkins recently laid out a common-sense crypto asset taxonomy that would make clear that digital commodities, digital collectibles, and digital tools are not &ldquo;securities&rdquo;&mdash;even when they are sold as part of an investment contract.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opaselig1?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;I have directed Commission staff to work together with SEC staff to consider joint codification of this framework as an interim measure while Congress finalizes legislation.</p>
<p><strong>Liquid and Programmable: Expanding Eligible Tokenized Collateral&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>With a clearer taxonomy in place, the next question becomes how blockchain technologies can be harnessed to strengthen market resilience and market functions.</p>
<p>In certain markets, 24/7 trading offers meaningful advantages, particularly where global participation is essential to market efficiency.</p>
<p>High-quality tokenized collateral that can move seamlessly across venues has the potential to make liquidity more dynamic and markets more resilient. As on-chain capabilities mature, they also create opportunities for new tools, including artificial intelligence-driven systems and autonomous software, to interact directly with tokenized collateral. These systems can programmatically monitor risk in real time and execute predefined strategies within established guardrails. In this way, tokenization and automation can begin to fulfill the original promise of blockchain technologies: a more open, transparent, and efficient market infrastructure.</p>
<p>To achieve this work, and to help unleash American innovation, I have directed CFTC staff to develop rules to enable the responsible deployment of additional forms of eligible tokenized collateral.</p>
<p><strong>Limitless: Onshoring True Perpetual Derivatives</strong></p>
<p>The pace of innovation with crypto assets has also led to experimentation with novel types of derivatives.</p>
<p>Derivatives with no fixed maturity date, known as &ldquo;perpetual contracts,&rdquo; have emerged as widely used tools for risk-management and price-discovery. Yet, despite clear market demand, the prior administration failed to create a pathway for these markets to exist onshore.</p>
<p>Reversing this misstep requires transparent and workable frameworks that allow true perpetual derivative products to be offered responsibly in the U.S. under common-sense regulations. And&mdash;under my leadership&mdash;the CFTC will use the tools at its disposal to onshore perpetual and other novel derivative products so that they can flourish across both centralized and decentralized markets, subject to appropriate safeguards.</p>
<p><strong>Safe Harbors for Software Developers and Users: Unleashing Permissionless Innovation</strong></p>
<p>As our markets continue to evolve, digital wallets, decentralized finance protocols, layer-2 networks, and other on-chain software systems are now part of everyday finance. However, uncertainty persists regarding the appropriate regulatory treatment of these technologies under the CFTC&rsquo;s existing framework.</p>
<p>The Commission&rsquo;s existing rules were designed for&mdash;and assume&mdash;a centralized intermediary model. With the advent of on-chain financial markets, we must revisit these design choices and assumptions to facilitate permissionless innovation or risk ceding our global leadership to the many foreign nations that will welcome our builders with open arms&mdash;an unacceptable outcome.</p>
<p>On-chain systems exist on a spectrum of decentralization. In certain instances, there may exist non-custodial digital wallets or user interfaces that merely function as digital rails through which users can directly interact with programmatic, self-executing software code. In other instances, there may be more centralized touchpoints.</p>
<p>Under my leadership, the CFTC will explore ways in which the agency can encourage innovation in software development and support builders as they work toward product market fit, including by assessing whether an innovation exemption may be appropriate in certain circumstances.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At every step, our actions will reflect a commitment to establish clear and unambiguous safe harbors for software developers to ensure that the crypto innovations of today and tomorrow are Made in America.</p>
<p><strong>Leveraged Crypto Asset Trading: Enhancing Optionality for Market Participants</strong></p>
<p>While I share the excitement around decentralized financial systems, intermediated trading will continue to play an important role in crypto markets. That includes trading conducted both on- and off-exchange with leverage, margin, or financing. In that spirit, we are already taking concrete steps to foster these trading activities.</p>
<p>First, I have directed CFTC staff to begin drafting rules clarifying when leveraged, margined, or financed retail commodity transactions in crypto may be offered off-exchange under an &ldquo;actual delivery&rdquo; exception.</p>
<p>Second, I have asked CFTC staff to begin drafting rules codifying requirements for DCMs that choose to offer these transactions on their current platforms. Codification will promote consistency, transparency, and a uniform application of core protections across venues&mdash;hallmarks of the CFTC&rsquo;s regulatory regime.</p>
<p>Finally, I have directed CFTC staff to explore the creation of a new category of DCM registration that is tailored specifically to retail leveraged, margined, or financed crypto asset trading. These venues would perform functions similar to traditional DCMs but operate under a purpose-fit regulatory framework.</p>
<p><strong>Harmonization: Facilitating Substituted Compliance and Super-Apps</strong></p>
<p>Now, our modernized approach will fall short unless it is paired with continued harmonization between the CFTC and the SEC.</p>
<p>Fragmented oversight imposes real economic costs&mdash;raising barriers to entry, reducing competition, increasing compliance expenses, and encouraging regulatory arbitrage rather than productive investment. Recognizing this, I intend for the CFTC to work closely with the SEC to identify opportunities to better align regulatory requirements across markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The objective is not to blur statutory boundaries, but to reduce unnecessary duplication that does not improve market integrity. As part of this harmonization effort, we will examine whether substituted compliance can achieve equivalent or better regulatory outcomes at lower costs for market participants. Within the bounds of the law and where appropriate, market participants should be able to offer multiple products through a single platform without navigating an inefficient patchwork of registrations and overlapping regulatory regimes.</p>
<p><strong>Prediction Markets: Forecasting the Future</strong></p>
<p>Last, but certainly not least, I would be remiss if I did not address prediction markets, or event contracts as we refer to them at the CFTC.</p>
<p>These markets are not new. They have operated within the CFTC&rsquo;s regulatory perimeter for more than two decades. But, despite their history, many view them as novel or unsettled. That uncertainty has not served our markets well, nor has it served the public interest.</p>
<p>It is time for clear rules and a clear understanding that the CFTC supports lawful innovation in these markets. Consistent with my commitment to fostering responsible innovation in crypto asset markets, I will continue to support the responsible development of event contract markets and the important role they play in the broader financial system. Here&rsquo;s how we will be moving forward.</p>
<p>First, I have directed CFTC staff to withdraw the 2024 event contracts rule proposal that would prohibit political and sports-related event contracts<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opaselig1?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;and the 2025 staff advisory,<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opaselig1?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;which cautioned registrants about offering access to sports-related event contracts due to ongoing litigation. While the advisory was issued at the staff level with the intent of bringing awareness to the litigation, it has instead contributed to uncertainty in our markets.</p>
<p>Second, looking ahead, and in the spirit of markets that trade on expectations, I have directed CFTC staff to move forward with drafting an event contracts rulemaking. For too long, the CFTC&rsquo;s existing framework has proven difficult to apply and has failed our market participants. That is something I intend to fix by establishing clear standards for event contracts that provide certainty to market participants.</p>
<p>Third, I have directed CFTC staff to reassess the Commission&rsquo;s participation in matters currently pending before the federal district and circuit courts. Where jurisdictional questions are at issue, the Commission has the expertise and responsibility to defend its exclusive jurisdiction over commodity derivatives.</p>
<p>Finally, I have directed CFTC staff to work with our counterparts at the SEC to develop a joint interpretation on Title VII definitions. This effort would draw clearer lines between certain commodity and security options, CFTC-regulated swaps, and SEC-regulated security-based swaps. Clear, coordinated guidance will allow firms to scale products responsibly and reduce the number of innovations that fall into what Chairman Atkins has aptly described as &ldquo;the no man&rsquo;s land&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opaselig1?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;between our two agencies.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>As the new frontier of finance descends upon us, regulators must relentlessly modernize, harmonize, and future-proof their approach to regulation. But we must not abandon our age-old principles, like investor protection, anti-fraud and anti-manipulation, and market integrity, which remain our north star.</p>
<p>I am honored to partner with Chairman Atkins on Project Crypto and lead the CFTC into this new era&mdash;for our financial markets, and for the new frontier of finance.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your time today. I look forward to the fireside chat to follow.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://shieldfc.com/?utm_campaign=36021580-Portugal_office_opening&amp;utm_source=wire" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Shield</a>, a provider of Digital Communications Governance and Archiving (DCGA) technology, has announced the expansion of its Lisbon office. As a Gartner-ranked top 3 vendor across all Critical Capabilities, this move is part of its broader growth strategy to scale European operations, provide increased customer proximity, and accelerate solution delivery to financial institutions.</span></p>
<p><span>As regulatory complexity across Europe continues to rise and financial institutions increase oversight of digital communications, Shield is growing its Lisbon presence to strengthen regional execution.

<p><span>Lisbon has emerged as a growing financial and technology hub, with an increasing presence of global banks, investment firms, and FinTech organizations operating under complex European regulatory frameworks. Its access to multinational talent, proximity to EU markets, and integration into the European regulatory ecosystem make it a strategic location for Shield&rsquo;s continued growth.</span></p>
<p><span>Over the past two years, Shield&rsquo;s Lisbon team has grown by approximately 40%, expanding across key business functions including Research &amp; Development, Product, Customer Experience, Marketing, and Human Resources. This expansion allows Shield to accelerate the development of governance capabilities and improve engagement across the region.</span></p>
<p><span>Shield&rsquo;s Lisbon office is home to a diverse, international team with deep expertise in compliance, AI-driven analytics, and regulated financial markets. These capabilities are critical to building digital communications governance technology for global financial institutions. This investment in people and infrastructure supports long-term performance, talent retention, and operational resilience.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;Scaling our European operations in Lisbon allows us to stay closer to customers while accelerating execution against real-world regulatory challenges,&rdquo; said Shiran Weitzman, Co-Founder and CEO of Shield. &ldquo;As financial institutions face increasing scrutiny across digital communications, proximity, speed, and regulatory alignment are essential&mdash;and Lisbon enables us to deliver on all three.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>"Lisbon offers a deep talent pool that strengthens our ability to serve customers worldwide," said Tal Raziel-Yosef, Chief People Officer at Shield. "We're building a diverse, forward-thinking team and investing in a high-end, collaborative workspace that empowers them to do their best work. We foster a culture of continuous learning and professional growth, so our people can thrive&mdash;because when they grow, they deliver even greater value and advance their own personal development.&rdquo;</span><span style="font-size: x-small;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Shield&rsquo;s platform enables the world&rsquo;s leading regulated financial institutions to manage communications surveillance, archiving, and governance across digital channels. Powered by advanced AI, including generative and agentic AI, natural language processing, and behavioral analytics, Shield helps firms identify compliance risks more accurately. It also reduces false positives as regulatory expectations continue to expand.</span></p>
<p><span>The Lisbon expansion complements Shield&rsquo;s growing footprint across Europe, the United Kingdom, Asia-Pacific, and North America.

<title>Opening Remarks At Joint SEC-CFTC Harmonization Event – Project Crypto, Paul S. Atkins, SEC Chairman, Commodity Futures Trading Commission Headquarters, Washington D.C., Jan. 29, 2026</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. First, I should like to thank you for your flexibility in light of the wintry weather conditions. I am glad that we are able to reconvene this afternoon, and that so many could still join us here in person and by livestream.<a class="ck-anchor" id="ftnref1"></a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-remarks-joint-sec-cftc-harmonization-event-project-crypto-012926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#ftn1">[1]</a></p>
<p>It is a pleasure to be with all of you today&mdash;especially my friend, former colleague, and now counterpart, CFTC Chairman Mike Selig, from whom we will be hearing momentarily. As SEC Chairman, I am grateful to be a guest at the CFTC&rsquo;s headquarters, standing side by side with Chairman Selig as we launch one of the most ambitious initiatives between our two agencies in a generation.</p>
<p>Of course, as we speak, Congress has never been closer to sending bipartisan market structure legislation to President Trump&rsquo;s desk. A federal framework for markets that have surged ahead with speed and ingenuity is long overdue. But legislation alone cannot deliver the certainty that investors and market participants deserve. That is why I am delighted to have the opportunity to work with Chairman Selig to implement clear and principled rules of the road for crypto asset markets.</p>
<p>As so many observed during his confirmation process, Chairman Selig brings to the CFTC precisely what this moment demands: a deep respect for market integrity, paired with a practical understanding of how innovation drives prosperity for the American people. He appreciates, as I do, that our job as regulators is to apply the minimum effective dose of regulation&mdash;no more, no less. And he recognizes that we are at an inflection point as President Trump assembles a dream team of financial regulators who are united by the common conviction that if we coordinate early, clearly, and in good faith, then we can reduce uncertainty, lower the costs of compliance, and unleash the creative energies of a free people.</p>
<p>During Chairman Selig&rsquo;s time at the SEC, he played an essential role in advancing the agency&rsquo;s efforts, ably led by Commissioner Hester Peirce, to course-correct the Commission&rsquo;s previous approach to crypto. Last year alone, SEC staff provided more clarity on digital assets than in the prior decade combined. For example, the Division of Corporation Finance issued a staff statement on the security status of memecoins, stablecoins, mining, and staking activities. The Division of Trading and Markets, meanwhile, published FAQs clarifying staff&rsquo;s views about broker-dealer financial responsibility and transfer agent obligations. And the Division of Investment Management made clear its staff's view that registered advisers and regulated funds can maintain crypto assets with certain state-chartered financial institutions.</p>
<p>While not exhaustive, this record reflects the rigor and initiative that Chairman Selig brought to his work on the Crypto Task Force. Even before I arrived in April, Commissioner Peirce, Chairman Selig, and their colleagues on the task force helped to restore confidence among innovators that they could engage constructively with the Commission without fear or worry. Although significant work remains, especially as legislation inches closer to President Trump&rsquo;s desk, I could not be prouder of what Chairman Selig accomplished during his time at the SEC.</p>
<p>And now, under his leadership at the CFTC, the agency is embracing a disciplined but open posture toward emerging market structures. I am confident that he will craft a fit-for-purpose regulatory regime rooted in data&mdash;and tempered by humility&mdash;about what regulators can and cannot foresee. There is no one that I would rather have at the helm of the CFTC as our markets move on-chain. And that is why I am so pleased that Project Crypto will now proceed as a joint initiative between our two agencies.</p>
<p>As many of you know, today&rsquo;s markets do not divide neatly along regulatory lines. Trading, clearing, custody, and risk management now flow across asset classes, technologies, and platforms. So, fragmented regulation in an integrated market is not a safeguard for investors so much as a source of confusion among them.</p>
<p>Yet for decades, we have compelled market participants to operate within a maze of overlapping and often inconsistent regulatory frameworks that reflect historical boundaries more than modern realities. That model is no longer sustainable. If the United States is to remain the world&rsquo;s most trusted and dynamic capital market, then we must take a more coordinated approach. In short, the turf war of years gone by must give way to a new era of cooperation.</p>
<p>As a first step, we have designed Project Crypto such that when Congress acts, our agencies are ready to implement any new legislation faithfully and thoughtfully. Moving forward, that means deploying every tool at our disposal to reduce friction, to harmonize standards and definitions where appropriate, and to equip markets with confidence as Congress completes its vital work. Working together with common purpose, we can deliver clearer guidance, consistent standards, and a regulatory framework that reflects how markets actually function instead of how they used to.</p>
<p>So as we pursue this new course, let me close by once again thanking Chairman Selig, both for his leadership and his willingness to choose coordination over competition, progress over turf. Working together, I am optimistic about all that our teams can accomplish, and how our collaboration can promote the long-term dynamism of U.S. markets. After all, the future of finance will be built somewhere. Through Project Crypto, we can help to ensure that it is built here, under rules that protect investors, support innovation, and cement America&rsquo;s leadership in the global financial system.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>Speech</h2>
<p>Good morning,&nbsp;I am&nbsp;very pleased&nbsp;to be at this important event in the innovation calendar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The coming year is going to be fundamental&nbsp;in&nbsp;shaping the UK&rsquo;s digital financial future. The Bank of England (the Bank), working alongside industry, HM Treasury, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)&nbsp;and&nbsp;our wider&nbsp;regulatory family, has&nbsp;a central role&nbsp;to play&nbsp;in&nbsp;ensuring&nbsp;that&nbsp;the&nbsp;future&nbsp;is driven by&nbsp;safe, responsible innovation, underpinned by financial stability.</p>
<p>In particular, we&nbsp;are focussed on pushing forward our work on&nbsp;regulated&nbsp;stablecoins<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/january/sasha-mills-speech-at-the-tokenisation-summit#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[1]</a></sup>, including&nbsp;working with the FCA to&nbsp;test their use as a settlement asset in the Digital Securities Sandbox (DSS)<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/january/sasha-mills-speech-at-the-tokenisation-summit#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[2]</a></sup>, and&nbsp;clarifying our&nbsp;policy on&nbsp;the treatment of&nbsp;tokenised collateral&nbsp;under UK European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR).&nbsp;</p>
<p>We&nbsp;have the opportunity to&nbsp;build truly holistic digital financial&nbsp;markets&nbsp;in the UK, bringing real benefits to the real economy.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s&nbsp;an ambitious goal, but we start from a strong position.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;strengths&nbsp;that make the UK a global financial centre, including trust in our legal system and in our institutions,&nbsp;can be the foundation of our leadership in the&nbsp;digital&nbsp;financial markets of tomorrow.&nbsp;But we need to build on that foundation if we are to&nbsp;realise&nbsp;our ambitions for this sector.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re&nbsp;operating&nbsp;at a time where the financial landscape is evolving at speed, with&nbsp;technological developments bringing huge opportunities but also resulting in an ever-evolving threat landscape. For Financial Market Infrastructures (FMIs), the stakes&nbsp;and consequences of not being resilient&nbsp;are&nbsp;high,&nbsp;for the institutions and&nbsp;financial&nbsp;system,&nbsp;making&nbsp;resilience and innovation critical.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Bank&rsquo;s role can be thought of&nbsp;as&nbsp;akin&nbsp;to an air traffic controller. Our&nbsp;ability to see&nbsp;across the financial system&nbsp;allows us to deliver&nbsp;financial stability&nbsp;by&nbsp;setting the framework for&nbsp;FMIs&nbsp;to&nbsp;navigate safely and ensure a smooth landing,&nbsp;in turbulent times and clear skies alike.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, air traffic controllers reduce systemic risk to enable the risky business of moving&nbsp;very large&nbsp;numbers of&nbsp;people,&nbsp;and&nbsp;huge volumes of&nbsp;goods,&nbsp;at high speed&nbsp;and&nbsp;around the world safely.&nbsp;Each year they&nbsp;facilitate&nbsp;more traffic in the already crowded airspace, allow airports to&nbsp;operate&nbsp;in a wider range of weather&nbsp;conditions&nbsp;and improve efficiency for goods and travellers. Facilitating more and better flights leads to more trade and growth in the real economy.</p>
<p>In much the same way,&nbsp;it&rsquo;s&nbsp;our job to&nbsp;maintain&nbsp;financial stability&nbsp;and&nbsp;also&nbsp;support innovation. Done well, we&nbsp;facilitate&nbsp;more trading,&nbsp;faster and cheaper payments&nbsp;and settlement,&nbsp;and&nbsp;a more efficient use of assets via, for example, tokenised collateral,&nbsp;which&nbsp;ultimately will&nbsp;lead to more growth for the industry and the real economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our role as regulator is to set the framework to help&nbsp;the market&nbsp;innovate safely, keeping the skies safe, and providing confidence that take-offs and landings happen as they should. For us, that means being responsive to emerging trends and working with you&nbsp;through&nbsp;open&nbsp;dialogue so we can embrace this&nbsp;new and changing world together,&nbsp;including, for example,&nbsp;by&nbsp;expanding the range of settlement assets in the DSS, and&nbsp;testing&nbsp;the use of stablecoins for&nbsp;some&nbsp;wholesale settlement.</p>
<p>The certainty that the system works, in good times and&nbsp;in adversity, is the bedrock that innovation can&nbsp;launch&nbsp;from.&nbsp;Air traffic controllers&nbsp;don&rsquo;t&nbsp;close the skies to new aircrafts or new ways of doing things; they create designated corridors and temporary clearances so novel&nbsp;aircraft&nbsp;can test routes&nbsp;and&nbsp;innovate systems,&nbsp;without endangering others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through a flexible, responsive regulatory regime, we&nbsp;are&nbsp;doing the same. Sandboxes, pilot schemes&nbsp;such as the Digital Gilt Instrument (DIGIT)<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/january/sasha-mills-speech-at-the-tokenisation-summit#footnote-4" id="footnote-ref-4"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[3]</a></sup>,&nbsp;interoperable standards,&nbsp;and our new firms&rsquo;&nbsp;approach&nbsp;are enabling safe, responsible innovation - allowing&nbsp;you&nbsp;to test new systems&nbsp;in a meaningful way&nbsp;while safeguarding the wider financial system from disruption.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Clearing the runway for innovation</h3>
<p>Across the sector, there is a clear understanding that failure to innovate means falling behind, whether through advances in new technologies or improvements to existing markets, products, or processes.</p>
<p>We want to work with&nbsp;industry&nbsp;to embrace&nbsp;today&rsquo;s&nbsp;and tomorrow&rsquo;s&nbsp;innovations in a responsible way. In 2026, the Bank will prioritise three key areas of innovation: systemic stablecoins, tokenised collateral and the Digital Securities Sandbox.</p>
<h4>Stablecoins</h4>
<p>Let me start with stablecoins.</p>
<p>Stablecoins&nbsp;have the potential&nbsp;to modernise&nbsp;retail and wholesale&nbsp;payments, enabling faster,&nbsp;cheaper&nbsp;and more efficient transactions.&nbsp;They could offer a valuable choice for individuals and businesses making payments in the UK and they could offer new functionalities &ndash; through programmability &ndash; to&nbsp;deliver real benefits for the UK real economy.</p>
<p>The Bank&rsquo;s remit only extends to stablecoins widely used for payments in the UK &ndash; so-called systemic stablecoins.&nbsp;Such stablecoins will be jointly regulated by the Bank and FCA.&nbsp;Systemic stablecoins need to meet the same standards as existing forms of money used in the UK real economy.&nbsp;In 2025 we consulted on a regime fit for&nbsp;a&nbsp;future&nbsp;where stablecoins are widely used for payments in the UK, setting out the standards&nbsp;we expect systemic stablecoins to meet.</p>
<p>Our regime proposes to provide systemic stablecoins with a deposit account at the Bank of England&nbsp;while also considering putting in place a liquidity facility to provide a backstop for stablecoin issuers.</p>
<p>Our proposed regime also looks to manage&nbsp;some UK-specific risks and&nbsp;to&nbsp;ensure an orderly transition to new forms of money.&nbsp;A growing role in payments for stablecoins could reduce&nbsp;deposits in the banking sector and could&nbsp;lead to a reduction in credit provided to the real economy.&nbsp;Our proposed regime considers&nbsp;the tools that could&nbsp;sufficiently&nbsp;mitigate against this risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will continue to listen to your feedback to the consultation&nbsp;which&nbsp;will be invaluable in helping us shape the regulatory framework. We aim to finalise the&nbsp;regime&nbsp;for&nbsp;systemic&nbsp;stablecoins, working side-by-side with the FCA,&nbsp;by the end of this year.&nbsp;Where stablecoins are used&nbsp;on&nbsp;a&nbsp;non-systemic&nbsp;basis&nbsp;(for example for the purposes of&nbsp;entering and exiting&nbsp;unbacked&nbsp;cryptoasset markets), they will not fall into the Bank&rsquo;s remit.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Tokenised Collateral</h4>
<p>Our second area of focus is tokenised collateral.</p>
<p>Tokenisation (the process of representing traditional financial assets as digital tokens on a shared, programmable ledger) offers opportunities to enhance resilience and efficiency through programmable forms of money and assets&nbsp;by&nbsp;collapsing&nbsp;steps in the trade lifecycle.</p>
<p>It could&nbsp;streamline collateral mobility&nbsp;by enabling near‑instant movement of assets across firms and&nbsp;jurisdictions, improve&nbsp;liquidity management&nbsp;of&nbsp;already eligible collateral,&nbsp;and reduce&nbsp;operational frictions in collateral movement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are already seeing practical applications of tokenisation being piloted in collateral markets,&nbsp;offering greater automation and faster settlement, with the potential to lower firm operating costs and increase system-wide liquidity.</p>
<p>As with stablecoins&nbsp;used for payments, tokenised collateral will need to meet certain standards to support financial stability, just as traditional collateral&nbsp;must&nbsp;meet these standards today.&nbsp;This includes ensuring both the underlying structure of the tokenised asset and the infrastructures supporting it are resilient, so that disruption cannot amplify risks more broadly across the system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A&nbsp;key difference between traditionally accepted assets and those assets that exist&nbsp;on-chain is the additional risks that stem from how&nbsp;the&nbsp;technology&nbsp;is used. These create specific challenges, including operational resilience and legal enforceability.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s&nbsp;not that traditional&nbsp;infrastructure&nbsp;doesn&rsquo;t&nbsp;pose any risks&nbsp;but rather that the mitigants there are&nbsp;more&nbsp;established and better understood by regulators and the market.</p>
<p>The Bank of England aims&nbsp;to avoid mandating or prohibiting specific technologies. Where&nbsp;traditional assets are tokenised and provided the risks of the&nbsp;overall&nbsp;tokenisation&nbsp;arrangement&nbsp;are&nbsp;appropriately mitigated, we&nbsp;don&rsquo;t&nbsp;expect the types of risks from holding tokenised assets to differ in any material way.&nbsp;The tokenised versions of assets which are already acceptable as regulatory collateral by central counterparties could also be eligible under UK EMIR rules.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clarity&nbsp;on&nbsp;these&nbsp;topics&nbsp;in a tokenised world&nbsp;will be&nbsp;key for ensuring confidence in a market.</p>
<p>Some thought is needed on traditional assets that&nbsp;are&nbsp;not already acceptable as regulatory collateral,&nbsp;but tokenised versions of which industry would like to use as&nbsp;collateral.&nbsp;We&nbsp;have&nbsp;been&nbsp;gathering industry data and feedback on whether to broaden eligibility of a wider range of&nbsp;traditional&nbsp;and tokenised&nbsp;collateral.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>Responses to our consultation<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/january/sasha-mills-speech-at-the-tokenisation-summit#footnote-5" id="footnote-ref-5"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[4]</a></sup>&nbsp;supported the Bank&rsquo;s&nbsp;thinking on&nbsp;tokenised&nbsp;collateral, but&nbsp;cautioned that benefits can only be realised with adequate risk assessment and testing. Respondents noted that, while they welcome our direction of travel, there are areas where they are looking to regulators for greater clarity. They highlighted that the safe use of tokenised assets would depend on confidence in how rights to those assets are assured and enforceable when used as collateral.</p>
<p>We are taking this feedback seriously. The UK has already taken steps through recent Digital Assets legislation<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/january/sasha-mills-speech-at-the-tokenisation-summit#footnote-6" id="footnote-ref-6"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[5]</a></sup>&nbsp;to clarify the legal status of digital assets as property. This is an important foundation for providing certainty in collateral contexts which we intend to build on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We&nbsp;welcome firms bringing forward proposals&nbsp;that&nbsp;responsibly&nbsp;support&nbsp;safe and&nbsp;efficient adoption of tokenised collateral,&nbsp;including how they would plan to manage the associated risks, recognising this is an evolving area with significant potential benefits. To provide greater certainty, we&nbsp;will&nbsp;set out further policy later this year on how tokenised collateral can&nbsp;operate&nbsp;under the existing regulatory framework.&nbsp;Ensuring smoother movement of cross-border collateral requires a consistent international approach, so our policy&nbsp;will be shaped&nbsp;by engagement with industry and&nbsp;our international counterparts, using the&nbsp;PFMIs as the&nbsp;guiding framework to anchor our approach.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We encourage firms to reach out and continue the conversation with us &ndash; whether on emerging opportunities or practical challenges.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Digital Securities Sandbox and Stablecoins&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Let me turn to our next area of focus &ndash; the Digital Securities Sandbox&nbsp;and stablecoins within it.</p>
<p>The DSS&nbsp;is an opportunity for firms to responsibly test issuance,&nbsp;trading&nbsp;and settlement on distributed ledgers. Our DSS framework is adaptable as we progress, allowing us to &lsquo;learn as we go&rsquo; from innovators testing different business models within the sandbox.</p>
<p>For example, to accommodate the cross-border nature of FMIs we broadened the sandbox scope to&nbsp;allow&nbsp;sandbox entrants to issue securities denominated in foreign currencies,&nbsp;and to settle directly in those currencies.</p>
<p>Similarly, as wholesale activity in the Sandbox is subject to limits on overall issuance to&nbsp;contain&nbsp;risks to the broader financial sector, it offers&nbsp;a&nbsp;helpful&nbsp;environment to test the use of stablecoins for wholesale settlement in a controlled&nbsp;setting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We&nbsp;are continuing to expand the remit of the DSS to&nbsp;facilitate&nbsp;responsible innovation.&nbsp;We are working&nbsp;at speed&nbsp;with our colleagues at the FCA&nbsp;and HMT&nbsp;to&nbsp;expand the range of settlement assets in the DSS&nbsp;to include regulated stablecoins.</p>
<p>In&nbsp;observing&nbsp;the use of stablecoins in the settlement of real-world digital securities, we&nbsp;will&nbsp;gain&nbsp;a better understanding of the risks,&nbsp;opportunities,&nbsp;and&nbsp;suitability of stablecoins for this&nbsp;potential&nbsp;use case&nbsp;at systemic scale. We will&nbsp;make adjustments&nbsp;as needed&nbsp;as we move towards a permanent regime for stablecoins in the&nbsp;UK, and&nbsp;will&nbsp;work with our international counterparts on equivalent &ndash; and robust &ndash; standards for&nbsp;regulated&nbsp;stablecoins globally.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To&nbsp;facilitate&nbsp;this,&nbsp;we&nbsp;are&nbsp;developing an assessment framework to help us&nbsp;determine&nbsp;a set of&nbsp;regulated&nbsp;stablecoins&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;issued&nbsp;both domestically and in other&nbsp;jurisdictions&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;that meet high enough standards for use in&nbsp;the sandbox.</p>
<p>For example, we will&nbsp;set out&nbsp;criteria&nbsp;around the quality and composition of backing assets, ability to meet redemptions, and capital requirements, among other things.</p>
<p>As regulatory regimes for stablecoin issuers in the UK and internationally are still being developed, this assessment framework may not map exactly to future&nbsp;standards for what may be&nbsp;permitted&nbsp;in wholesale markets.&nbsp;However,&nbsp;ensuring a minimum standard for stablecoins in the sandbox will both ensure some degree of resilience for market participants, and&nbsp;aid transition to&nbsp;a&nbsp;future&nbsp;permanent regime for the use of stablecoins in wholesale markets.</p>
<p>Working with the FCA, we&nbsp;are&nbsp;thinking&nbsp;carefully about&nbsp;the ecosystem around stablecoin use in wholesale markets, and whether certain guardrails are&nbsp;appropriate. For example,&nbsp;we&nbsp;are&nbsp;considering&nbsp;the suitability of different custody solutions, their compliance with proposed FCA custody requirements,&nbsp;and ways of obtaining stablecoins for use in the DSS.&nbsp;Domestic stablecoins which meet the&nbsp;high standards&nbsp;of the Bank&rsquo;s systemic stablecoin regime will be&nbsp;permitted&nbsp;in the DSS.</p>
<p>Last November, the FCA launched a special cohort of stablecoin issuers within its own Regulatory Sandbox<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/january/sasha-mills-speech-at-the-tokenisation-summit#footnote-7" id="footnote-ref-7"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[6]</a></sup>, offering a pathway for&nbsp;UK-issued&nbsp;stablecoins&nbsp;to test their propositions against proposed requirements for issuers. Successful firms in this cohort, which may include Sterling denominated stablecoins, will be well-placed as stablecoins that could&nbsp;be utilised in the DSS prior to the full regime on stablecoins&nbsp;going live in the UK.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>DSS and DIGIT&nbsp;</h4>
<p>HMT&rsquo;s digitally native gilt, DIGIT, will be issued and settled&nbsp;using&nbsp;a Digital Securities Depository&nbsp;operating&nbsp;within the DSS. This pilot aims to enable the Government to explore how DLT can be applied across the lifecycle of the UK sovereign debt issuance&nbsp;process,&nbsp;and&nbsp;catalyse the development of UK based DLT infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We welcome HMT&rsquo;s commitment to use DIGIT to&nbsp;leverage&nbsp;the benefits of the DSS, enabling the Bank and FCA to provide a regulated environment where innovation in capital markets&nbsp;can flourish. Through the DSS, DIGIT will explore on&ndash;chain settlement of both the securities and cash leg, and support interoperability between traditional and DLT-based FMIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our 2025 industry roundtables provided valuable feedback and guidance used to continue developing the DSS. Based on this feedback, we adopted a more flexible approach to firm-specific limits at Gate 2, moving from fixed &lsquo;go-live&rsquo; limits to a flexible range. We will continue to seek out ways in 2026 to gather feedback as we develop our Gate 3 rules and start to see live activity take place within the DSS framework.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Being an efficient,&nbsp;proportionate&nbsp;and looking-forward regulator, fostering international cooperation.</h3>
<p>As the landscape evolves, we continue to refine our supervisory approach for all firms to ensure&nbsp;we&rsquo;re&nbsp;getting the balance right between mitigating risks to financial&nbsp;stability,&nbsp;and&nbsp;supporting the wider economy&nbsp;by&nbsp;enabling responsible innovation. With that in mind we:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are making the recognition process for non-UK FMIs more efficient and proportionate to the size of the firm, introducing a tiering approach which classifies FMIs as systemic or non-systemic.</li>
<li>Are increasing transparency through publishing metrics on timelines for assessing permissions applications, which aligns with our aim for more efficient regulation.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Have&nbsp;set&nbsp;out our supervisory approach for&nbsp;onboarding&nbsp;new FMIs. We want to support market entry and encourage innovation, so we are moving away from the one-size-fits-all model to an approach tailored to the size,&nbsp;complexity&nbsp;and risk model of new entrants.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve&nbsp;talked a lot about our domestic work, but as regulators we&nbsp;can&rsquo;t&nbsp;lose sight of the global picture. Air traffic controllers and airports&nbsp;operate&nbsp;24/7,&nbsp;365 days a year,&nbsp;and across&nbsp;jurisdictions. Similarly,&nbsp;your firms&nbsp;operate&nbsp;round the clock and&nbsp;across borders. International coordination is essential for a safe, resilient financial system.</p>
<p>We will continue to engage with global bodies like the Financial Stability Board (FSB), the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI), the International Organization of Securities Commissions&nbsp;(IOSCO)&nbsp;and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), as well as with regulators worldwide to ensure international standards are robust.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In particular,&nbsp;in&nbsp;September 2025 HMT and the U.S. Treasury launched a Transatlantic Taskforce for Markets of the Future<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/january/sasha-mills-speech-at-the-tokenisation-summit#footnote-8" id="footnote-ref-8"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[7]</a></sup>, drawing on UK and U.S. regulators and industry input.</p>
<p>Its remit is to explore near‑term collaboration on digital assets while regulatory frameworks evolve,&nbsp;identify&nbsp;longer‑term opportunities for wholesale digital‑markets innovation, and strengthen links between our capital markets.</p>
<p>Given digital assets are a focus of the Taskforce, the DSS&nbsp;provides&nbsp;a valuable opportunity to share learnings and&nbsp;identify&nbsp;areas for cross border cooperation.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Conclusion&nbsp;</h3>
<p>In 2025, we worked closely with HMT&nbsp;and the FCA&nbsp;on the Wholesale Financial Markets Digital Strategy to help set out a tokenisation vision for the UK. We&nbsp;remain&nbsp;committed to making that a reality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With so much change ahead,&nbsp;it&rsquo;s&nbsp;worth reminding ourselves of what&nbsp;hasn&rsquo;t&nbsp;changed: our mission of financial stability.</p>
<p>In pursuit of that mission,&nbsp;we&rsquo;ll&nbsp;keep the radar sweeping, the runways clear, and the routes open. While we&nbsp;set the rules to&nbsp;make take‑offs&nbsp;and landings&nbsp;safe,&nbsp;we&rsquo;ll&nbsp;continue&nbsp;working with&nbsp;you&nbsp;to trial new&nbsp;aircraft&nbsp;and&nbsp;redesign airspace so&nbsp;new technologies&nbsp;can fly.</p>
<p>The future is ambitious. But making the changes I outlined today, including finalising the regime for systemic stablecoins; expanding the remit of the DSS to facilitate responsible innovation; and clarifying the use of tokenised collateral under UK EMIR, will support financial stability domestically and internationally.</p>
<p>By working&nbsp;together,&nbsp;we can achieve these goals.&nbsp;I look forward to working with the existing, and new, FMIs and innovators to realise this vision.&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Tradeweb Markets Inc. (Nasdaq: TW), a leading, global operator of electronic marketplaces for rates, credit, equities and money markets, today announced the launch of multi-asset package trading for USD-denominated swaps, marked by the successful execution of the first fully electronic multi-asset package trade for USD-denominated swaps on the Tradeweb swap execution facility (TW SEF) between Barclays and a global hedge fund.</p>
<p>Tradeweb&rsquo;s multi-asset package functionality for USD-denominated swaps enables institutional clients on TW SEF to streamline the simultaneous execution of interest rate swaps, inflation swaps and government bonds within a single trade. This enhancement aims to deliver greater transparency and efficiency and smarter analytics, while providing both dealers and buy-side participants with access to deeper pools of liquidity on a single electronic marketplace.</p>
<p>Bhas Nalabothula, Managing Director, Head of U.S. Institutional Rates, at Tradeweb, said: &ldquo;This enhancement to the TW SEF platform gives clients a more efficient way to trade interest rate swaps. As our market continues to evolve, our clients are increasingly focused on smarter, more streamlined trading solutions. We&rsquo;ve had great success in the adoption of this functionality in Europe, and have now expanded access to the U.S., enabling clients to package and execute large baskets of risk with greater control and simplicity.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan Orlando, Head of U.S. Rates Trading at Barclays, said: &ldquo;Executing the first fully electronic, multi-asset packaged trade for USD-denominated interest rate swaps for Tradeweb reflects the significant investment Barclays has made in building a market-leading, technology-driven execution platform. This milestone demonstrates how our continued focus on innovation is enabling greater automation, transparency and flexibility in swap execution &ndash; and reinforces our commitment to driving the next chapter of advancement across the derivatives market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Institutional investors have been trading swaps electronically on Tradeweb since 2005. As a leading global interest rate swap trading platform, this milestone follows Tradeweb&rsquo;s 2019 launch of the first fully electronic multi-asset package trade on its global interest rate swaps platform using in-competition request-for-quote (RFQ).</p>
<p>Over time, Tradeweb has continued to expand its derivatives offering; announcing a series of &ldquo;firsts&rdquo; for the market, including but not limited to: first fully electronic request-for-market swaption package trade; first fully electronic swap compression trade; first fully electronic two-way market swap; first fully electronic swaption trade and first fully electronic cleared inflation swap.</p>

<p>Today, ACER publishes its&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsPVAEEUVgGUkwMDgcCHVZdUAAdCgAJVhpTVwNRAlAFAQFQV1IdBVIHUVwOAlUdVVgGAB0GCgBfGlQHVlIZC1YFD1UDCQJVU1VZRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Opinion</a>&nbsp;on the Integrated Model report for EU electricity, gas and hydrogen infrastructure planning, submitted by the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) and for Gas (ENTSOG) and prepared with support from the European Network of Network Operators for Hydrogen (ENNOH).</p>
<p>As Europe&rsquo;s energy transition increasingly blurs the boundaries between energy sectors, decisions in one system directly affect infrastructure needs and costs in the others. The Trans-European Energy Infrastructure (<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsAUFdTUANXUUxfVAAHHVZbU1UdUAkDVhoGVlUCVQsFA1QCAVAdBVIHUVwOAlUdVVgGAB0GCgBfGlQHVlIZC1YFD1UDCQJVU1VZRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">TEN-E</a>) Regulation requires ENTSO-E and ENTSOG to jointly develop a consistent and progressively integrated model to support coordinated infrastructure planning across the three sectors and underpin future EU-level Ten-Year Network Development Plans (TYNDPs).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What does ACER say?</span></p>
<p>ACER&rsquo;s Opinion assesses whether the report provides a sufficiently robust basis for more coherent, cross-sector infrastructure planning at EU level.</p>
<p>The report is a useful starting point, with some progress beyond joint scenario development, including the creation of a dedicated cross-sector working group. However, ACER finds that the framework does not clarify how it will contribute to greater consistency and integration of EU infrastructure planning through concrete milestones. Cross-sector requirements remain unclear and stakeholder consultation was limited.</p>
<p>As a result, it remains unclear whether the proposed framework will deliver practical improvements in infrastructure needs assessments, investment decision-making or system-wide cost optimisation.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ACER&rsquo;s recommendations and next steps</span></p>
<p>Among other recommendations, ACER calls on ENTSO-E and ENTSOG, together with ENNOH, to:</p>
<ul>
<li>clearly define assumptions, data and methodologies to be applied consistently across sectors;</li>
<li>strengthen cross-sector needs assessments and harmonised cost-benefit analyses, including within the TYNDP 2028 cycle;</li>
<li>update the roadmap with more ambitious actions and firmer timelines; and</li>
<li>improve stakeholder consultation.</li>
</ul>
<p>ACER expects ENTSO-E and ENTSOG to implement these recommendations before submitting the report to the European Commission for approval.</p>

<title>EBA Launches Consultation On Amendments To Guidelines On The Systemic Risk Buffer</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/eba-launches-consultation-on-amendments-to-guidelines-on-the-systemic-risk-buffe-2026129/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>​The European Banking Authority (EBA) today launched a public consultation on draft amendments to its Guidelines on the appropriate subsets of sectoral exposures to which competent or designated authorities may apply a systemic risk buffer (EBA/GL/2020/13). The revised Guidelines aim to facilitate a more effective use of the systemic risk buffer to address systemic risks stemming from climate change.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>​More specifically, the draft revised Guidelines introduce greater granularity in identifying exposures subject to physical and transition risks related to climate change, through enhanced sectoral and geographical classifications. The amendments also incorporate lessons learned from the implementation of existing systemic risk buffer measures across Member States, with the objective of improving their design, monitoring and reciprocation.</p>
<h4>​Consultation process</h4>
<p>​Comments to the consultation paper can be sent by clicking on the "send your comments" button on the EBA's consultation page. The deadline for the submission of comments is 30 April 2026.</p>
<p>​The EBA will hold a virtual public hearing on 9 April 2026 from 15:00 to 16:00 CET. The EBA invites interested stakeholders to register using this <a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/public-hearing-amendments-guidelines-systemic-risk-buffer" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">link</a> by 1 April 2026 (16:00 CET). The dial-in details will be communicated to those who have registered for the meeting.</p>
<p>​All comments received will be published following the end of the public consultation, unless requested otherwise.​</p>
<h4>Legal basis&nbsp;</h4>
<p>These draft revised Guidelines have been developed on the basis of Article 133 of the Capital Requirements Directive (EU) 2024/1619 (CRD VI), as amended, which clarifies that the systemic risk buffer may be used to address risks arising from climate change.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<title>Decision By The Nasdaq Stockholm Disciplinary Committee Regarding DUG Foodtech AB (publ)</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Disciplinary Committee of Nasdaq Stockholm (the &ldquo;Exchange&rdquo;) has dismissed a disciplinary case concerning DUG Foodtech AB (publ) (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;).</p>
<p>On November 28, 2025, the Exchange requested the Disciplinary Committee to review a disciplinary case against the Company. The Exchange claimed that the Company had violated the rules of Nasdaq First North Growth Market (the &ldquo;Rulebook&rdquo;) essentially as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Company had repeatedly failed to fulfil its obligation to disclose inside information in accordance with the EU Market Abuse Regulation (&ldquo;MAR&rdquo;). 
<ul>
<li>The Company had, on several occasions, failed to disclose inside information about its financial targets as required by MAR.</li>
<li>The Company failed to disclose inside information about the deviation in the audit report for the financial year 2023 in accordance with MAR.</li>
<li>The Company disclosed inside information about its financial situation in the interim report for the first half of 2025 in breach of MAR, which, in the Exchange&rsquo;s assessment, was misleading.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Company&rsquo;s repeated breaches of the information disclosure requirements in MAR demonstrated, according to the Exchange&rsquo;s assessment, that the Company lacked the capacity for providing information to the market as set out in item 2.3.9 (a) of the Rulebook.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Exchange requested that the Disciplinary Committee decide to delist the Company&rsquo;s shares from Nasdaq First North Growth Market.</p>
<p>On December 19, 2025, the Company was declared bankrupt, and its shares were delisted by the Exchange on the same day.</p>
<p>As the Company has been declared bankrupt, the Disciplinary Committee has dismissed the case. The case will therefore not be reviewed by the Disciplinary Committee.</p>
<p>The Disciplinary Committee&rsquo;s decision is available at:</p>

<p><span><span class="xn-person">Adena Friedman</span>, Chair and CEO</span>&nbsp;said, &ldquo;It was an excellent year of execution for Nasdaq, as we achieved strong organic growth, accelerated innovation, and successfully delivered across our three strategic priorities: Integrate, Innovate, and Accelerate. For the first time, Nasdaq exceeded&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$5 billion</span>&nbsp;in annual net revenue and&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$4 billion</span>&nbsp;in annual Solutions revenue, reflecting the power, resilience and adaptability of our platform.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, we are well‑positioned to build on our momentum in 2026 and deliver durable growth by deepening client relationships and unlocking greater value through our unified One Nasdaq platform.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span><span class="xn-person">Sarah Youngwood</span>, Executive Vice President and CFO</span>&nbsp;said, &ldquo;In 2025, Nasdaq delivered outstanding financial results, underscoring the durability and differentiation of our business model. We delivered strong growth across our platform, expanded operating leverage, and generated robust cash flow.</p>
<p>As we move into the new year, we remain focused on serving as a strategic partner to our clients and translating that performance into long‑term value for our shareholders.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>FINANCIAL REVIEW</span></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Net revenue in 2025 was&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$5.2 billion</span>, reflecting 13% growth versus the prior year period. Adjusted net revenue growth was 12%. Fourth quarter 2025 net revenue was&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$1.4 billion</span>, reflecting 13% growth versus the prior year period.</li>
<li>Solutions revenue in 2025 was&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$4.0 billion</span>, an increase of 12% versus the prior year period, or 11% on an adjusted basis. Fourth quarter 2025 Solutions revenue was&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$1.1 billion</span>, up 13% versus the prior year period, or 12% on an organic basis, reflecting strong growth from Index and Financial Technology.</li>
<li>ARR was&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$3.1 billion</span>&nbsp;as of the fourth quarter of 2025, growing 10% year-over-year on both a reported and organic basis. Financial Technology ARR growth was 14%, or 12% on an organic basis, and Capital Access Platforms ARR growth was 8%, or 7% on an organic basis.</li>

<li>Cash flow from operations was&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$2.3 billion</span>&nbsp;in 2025 and&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$625 million</span>&nbsp;for the fourth quarter, enabling the return of capital through Nasdaq&rsquo;s efficient capital allocation framework.

<li>Nasdaq surpassed its expanded efficiency program net expense target, with over&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$160 million</span>&nbsp;in expense efficiencies actioned as of year-end 2025.</li>

</ul>
<p><span>STRATEGIC AND BUSINESS UPDATES</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Financial Technology delivered 12% quarterly organic revenue and organic ARR growth driven by sales momentum across all subdivisions.</span>&nbsp;FinTech signed 129 new clients, 143 upsells, and 12 cross-sells in the fourth quarter, contributing to full-year totals of 291 new clients, 462 upsells, and 25 cross-sells. The strong cross-sell performance in the year brings the total to 42 cross-sells since the Adenza acquisition, reflecting the strength of the One Nasdaq strategy. Fourth quarter and full-year 2025 highlights included: 
<ul type="circle">
<li><span>Financial Crime Management Technology continued its strong sales momentum while launching new product innovations and capabilities.&nbsp;</span>Nasdaq&nbsp;<span class="xn-org">Verafin</span>&nbsp;delivered another strong quarter of new client signings, adding 119 new small-and-medium bank clients and 3 Enterprise deals. Total Enterprise signings in the year represent over four times both the number of signings and total annualized contract value (ACV) compared to the prior year.&nbsp;<span class="xn-org">Verafin</span>&nbsp;expanded its platform capabilities with two strategic partnerships signed during the year, and with the introduction of its Agentic AI Workforce, launched in the third quarter.</li>
<li><span>Regulatory Technology momentum continued with strong performance across Surveillance and AxiomSL driven by successful execution on cross-sells and upsells.&nbsp;</span>The subdivision added 10 new clients, including 5 cross-sells, and 76 upsells in the fourth quarter, contributing to full-year totals of 35 new clients, including 12 cross-sells, and 245 upsells. AxiomSL steadily expanded its global footprint in 2025, which included deepening its partnership with&nbsp;<span class="xn-org">Revolut</span>&nbsp;after they consolidated their&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">UK</span>&nbsp;and European regulatory reporting onto the solution&rsquo;s cloud-managed platform. Surveillance also drove strong client growth, with the business signing 26 new clients across securities exchanges, market participants, regulators, crypto trading venues, and crypto trading participants in 2025 to strengthen their protections across rapidly evolving markets.</li>
<li><span>Capital Markets Technology performance reflects strong client demand and engagement for market modernization solutions.&nbsp;</span>The subdivision signed 9 new clients, including 5 cross-sells, and 67 upsells in the quarter, contributing to full-year totals of 20 new clients, including 8 cross-sells, and 214 upsells. Calypso continued to strengthen its relationship with central banks, ending the year with 24 central banks including 3 signed in the fourth quarter. In Market Technology, the business continued to execute on its blueprint for market modernization, securing a major financial market infrastructure client for a multi-product, cloud-based managed service solution in the fourth quarter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>Index ETP assets under management (AUM) and net inflows reached new records.&nbsp;</span>Index had net inflows of&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$35 billion</span>&nbsp;in the fourth quarter and&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$99 billion</span>&nbsp;over the last twelve months, both records levels. End-of-period ETP AUM was&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$882 billion</span>&nbsp;and average ETP AUM in the fourth quarter was&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$860 billion</span>, also setting new quarterly highs. In 2025, Nasdaq&rsquo;s Index business launched 122 new products, an all-time high, with nearly half of the launches being international products and 32 new products in the institutional insurance annuity space.</li>
<li><span>Nasdaq expanded the distribution of its private market data through partnerships with LSEG and&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Juniper Square</span>.&nbsp;</span>Through its collaboration with LSEG, Nasdaq will provide eVestment private markets datasets for delivery through the LSEG platform. The partnership with&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Juniper Square</span>&nbsp;will make eVestment institutional intelligence available through Juniper Square&rsquo;s fundraising platform, reaching more than 2,000 private market general partners.</li>
<li><span>Nasdaq extended its listings leadership in 2025 with its seventh consecutive year as the top&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">U.S.</span>&nbsp;exchange by proceeds raised and executed the largest exchange transfer ever.&nbsp;</span>For the year, Nasdaq welcomed eligible operating company IPOs that raised over&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$24 billion</span>&nbsp;in total proceeds. Medline, which came to market in&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">December 2025</span>, headlined new listings as the largest IPO of the year. The listings business also welcomed the largest IPO in&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Europe</span>,&nbsp;<span class="xn-org">Verisure</span>. Nasdaq capped a record-setting year for its listings switch program in 2025 with&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$1.2 trillion</span>&nbsp;of market value switching to Nasdaq, including Walmart, the largest exchange transfer on record.</li>
<li><span>Market Services set new net revenue records while launching proposals to advance the modernization of markets.&nbsp;</span>Fourth quarter Market Services net revenue benefited from record industry volumes in&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">U.S.</span>&nbsp;cash equities and&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">U.S.</span>&nbsp;equity derivatives. Growth was also driven by index options revenue more than doubling for the second straight quarter, higher market share in European equities, and strong&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">U.S.</span>&nbsp;Tape Plan revenue. Nasdaq&rsquo;s Closing Cross also set a new daily notional value record of&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$233 billion</span>&nbsp;during the Triple-Witch event in December. This year, Nasdaq launched initiatives to drive the evolution of capital markets, including submitting a filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to facilitate the trading of tokenized securities on its markets and announcing the plan to bring 23/5 trading to the&nbsp;<span class="xn-org">Nasdaq Stock Market</span>&nbsp;in the second half of 2026.</li>

<p><span>NASDAQ TO HOST 2026 INVESTOR DAY</span></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Nasdaq will host its 2026 Investor Day on&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">Wednesday, February 25, 2026</span>. The event will feature presentations on the company&rsquo;s operations and strategy, as well as a question and answer session with members of Nasdaq&rsquo;s senior leadership team including&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Adena Friedman</span>, Chair and CEO, and&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Sarah Youngwood</span>, Executive Vice President and CFO.

</ul>
<p>____________1 Represents revenue less transaction-based expenses. 2 Adjusted and organic change for 4Q25 as compared to 4Q24 are equivalent as they include the same period over period adjustments for changes in foreign exchange rates and divestitures. 2025 as compared to 2024 also adjusts for the AxiomSL accounting change implemented in 3Q24 to recognize on-premises contracts ratably which included a&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$34 million</span>&nbsp;non-GAAP revenue adjustment in 3Q24, and excludes the impact of the previously announced one-time revenue benefit in our Index business in 1Q24 (<span class="xn-money">$16 million</span>). As it relates to ARR, organic changes only exclude the impacts of period over period changes in foreign currency exchange rates and divestitures as the AxiomSL ratable recognition adjustment and one-time revenue benefit had no impact on ARR. 3 Solutions revenue and Annualized Recurring Revenue (ARR) constitutes revenue and ARR from our Capital Access Platforms and Financial Technology segments as well as revenue and ARR from our Solovis business which was sold in&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">October 2025</span>. Solovis revenues and ARR were previously included in our Capital Access Platforms segment, and have been reclassified into &ldquo;Other&rdquo; for all prior periods presented.4 ARR for a given period is the current annualized value derived from subscription contracts with a defined contract value. This excludes contracts that are not recurring, are one-time in nature or where the contract value fluctuates based on defined metrics. ARR is currently one of our key performance metrics to assess the health and trajectory of our recurring business. ARR does not have any standardized definition and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue and is not intended to be combined with or to replace either of those items. For AxiomSL and Calypso recurring revenue contracts, the amount included in ARR is consistent with the amount that we invoice the customer during the current period. Additionally, for AxiomSL and Calypso recurring revenue contracts that include annual values that increase over time, we include in ARR only the annualized value of components of the contract that are considered active as of the date of the ARR calculation. We do not include the future committed increases in the contract value as of the date of the ARR calculation. ARR is not a forecast and the active contracts at the end of a reporting period used in calculating ARR may or may not be extended or renewed by our customers.5 Refer to our reconciliations of&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">U.S.</span>&nbsp;GAAP to non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq, diluted earnings per share, operating income, operating expenses and organic impacts included in the attached schedules.6&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">U.S.</span>&nbsp;GAAP operating expense and tax rate guidance are not provided due to the inherent difficulty in quantifying certain amounts due to a variety of factors including the unpredictability in the movement in foreign currency rates, as well as future charges or reversals outside of the normal course of business.</p>

<p><span>NON-GAAP INFORMATION</span></p>
<p>In addition to disclosing results determined in accordance with&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">U.S.</span>&nbsp;GAAP, Nasdaq also discloses certain non-GAAP results of operations, including, but not limited to, non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP operating expenses, that include certain adjustments or exclude certain charges and gains that are described in the reconciliation tables of&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">U.S.</span>&nbsp;GAAP to non-GAAP information provided at the end of this release. Management uses this non-GAAP information internally, along with&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">U.S.</span>&nbsp;GAAP information, in evaluating our performance and in making financial and operational decisions. We believe our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and supplemental data relating to our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for period-to-period comparisons of results as the items described below in the reconciliation tables do not reflect ongoing operating performance.</p>
<p>These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to,&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">U.S.</span>&nbsp;GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate such measures differently, which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure. Investors should not rely on any single financial measure when evaluating our business. This information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant as a substitute for our operating results in accordance with&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">U.S.</span>&nbsp;GAAP. We recommend investors review the&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">U.S.</span>&nbsp;GAAP financial measures included in this earnings release. When viewed in conjunction with our&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">U.S.</span>&nbsp;GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations, we believe these non-GAAP measures provide greater transparency and a more complete understanding of factors affecting our business than&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">U.S.</span>&nbsp;GAAP measures alone.</p>
<p>We understand that analysts and investors regularly rely on non-GAAP financial measures, such as those noted above, to assess operating performance. We use these measures because they highlight trends more clearly in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">U.S.</span>&nbsp;GAAP financial measures, since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our ongoing operating performance.</p>
<p><em>Organic revenue and expense growth, organic change and organic impact</em>&nbsp;are non-GAAP measures that reflect adjustments for: (i) the impact of period over period changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and (ii) the revenue, expenses and operating income associated with acquisitions and divestitures for the twelve month period following the date of the acquisition or divestiture and (iii) the impact of AxiomSL on-premises contracts for ratable recognition in comparable periods to align with current period presentation. Reconciliations of these measures are described within the body of this release or in the reconciliation tables at the end of this release.</p>
<p><em>Foreign exchange impact:</em>&nbsp;In countries with currencies other than the&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">U.S.</span>&nbsp;dollar, revenue and expenses are translated using monthly average exchange rates. Certain discussions in this release isolate the impact of year-over-year foreign currency fluctuations to better measure the comparability of operating results between periods. Operating results excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations are calculated by translating the current period&rsquo;s results by the prior period&rsquo;s exchange rates.</p>
<p><em>Restructuring programs</em>: In the fourth quarter of 2023, following the closing of the Adenza acquisition, our management approved, committed to and initiated a restructuring program to optimize our efficiencies as a combined organization. We further expanded this program in the fourth quarter of 2024 to accelerate our momentum and further optimize our efficiencies (efficiency program). We have incurred costs principally related to employee-related costs, contract terminations, asset impairments and other related costs and expect to incur additional costs in these areas in an effort to accelerate efficiencies through location strategy and enhanced AI capabilities. Actions taken as part of this program were completed as of&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">December 31, 2025</span>, while certain costs may be recognized in the first half of 2026. We expect to achieve benefits primarily in the form of expense synergies. In&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">October 2022</span>, following our September announcement to realign our segments and leadership, we initiated a divisional realignment program with a focus on realizing the full potential of this structure. As of&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">September 30, 2024</span>, we completed our divisional realignment program. Costs related to the Adenza restructuring and the divisional realignment programs are recorded as &ldquo;restructuring charges&rdquo; in our condensed consolidated statements of income. We exclude charges associated with these programs for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures as they are not reflective of ongoing operating performance or comparisons in Nasdaq's performance between periods.</p>

Starting in the third quarter of 2024, we began recognizing AxiomSL&rsquo;s subscription-based revenues on a ratable basis over the contract term. As a result of this change, we recognized a one-time revenue reduction of&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$32 million</span>&nbsp;in the third quarter of 2024, reflecting the net impact of the accounting change since the date of the Adenza acquisition. The adjustment of&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$34 million</span>&nbsp;reflects the prior year impact of this change.</td>

<td colspan="16">(1) Annualized&nbsp;Recurring&nbsp;Revenue&nbsp;(ARR) for a given period is the current annualized value derived from subscription contracts with a defined contract value. This excludes contracts that are not recurring, are one-time in nature, or where the contract value fluctuates based on defined metrics. ARR is currently one of our key performance metrics to assess the health and trajectory of our recurring business. ARR does not have any standardized definition and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue and is not intended to be combined with or to replace either of those items. For AxiomSL and Calypso recurring revenue contracts, the amount included in ARR is consistent with the amount that we invoice the customer during the current period. Additionally, for AxiomSL and Calypso recurring revenue contracts that include annual values that increase over time, we include in ARR only the annualized value of components of the contract that are considered active as of the date of the ARR calculation. We do not include the future committed increases in the contract value as of the date of the ARR calculation. ARR is not a forecast and the active contracts at the end of a reporting period used in calculating ARR may or may not be extended or renewed by our customers.</td>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority: Emil The Seal Hijacks Waterloo Station To Warn Commuters About Investment Scams</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>FCA stunt launches new Firm Checker tool as around 700,000 people lose money to investment scams.</p>
<p>Morning commuters at London Waterloo got more than their usual caffeine hit today when a mysterious 'ATM' promising to 'give away a fortune' stopped them in their tracks &ndash; and revealed an unexpected surprise.</p>
<p>As curious passers-by approached the machine, the screen slid open to unveil Emil the Seal, the FCA's finance-friendly mascot, delivering a blunt message about the dangers of investment scams.</p>
<p>The playful stunt cut through the rush-hour chaos, cajoling commuters to engage with the ATM with the promise of receiving a 'fortune'. &nbsp;Instead, as they approached the ATM, Emil the Seal delivered a 'fortunate' message urging commuters to 'check it&rsquo;s real before you seal the deal', making them realise that what you see isn't always what you get.</p>
<p>The stunt is part of a new campaign from the FCA to promote its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/consumers/fca-firm-checker">Firm Checker</a>, a tool designed to help people quickly verify whether a financial firm is genuine and authorised before handing over their money.</p>
<p>The light-hearted moment comes against a serious backdrop. In the 12 months to May 2024, according to the latest FCA data, around 700,000 adults experienced an investments-related fraud or scam.</p>
<p>The FCA's pop-up ATM was designed to stop people in their tracks and challenge the instinct to rush into offers that seem too good to be true &ndash; a tactic scammers rely on to pressure victims into quick decisions.</p>
<p>Sheree Howard, executive director of authorisations at the FCA, said:&nbsp;</p>
<p>'Checking isn&rsquo;t hesitation - it&rsquo;s the new power move. Scammers thrive on urgency and excitement, which is why we&rsquo;ve used Emil the Seal to break that spell and remind people to always stop and check whether a financial firm is genuine and authorised before sealing the deal. Our new Firm Checker tool gives consumers a fast and simple way to see if a firm is FCA-authorised and help avoid scams.'&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite growing awareness of fraud, and while most UK adults say they always or usually reject unsolicited contact about pension or investment opportunities (72%), check their bank and credit card statements regularly for any unfamiliar transactions (68%), or ignore unexpected website links, including those sent by family and friends (62%), the data on the number of people losing money suggests people are still skipping this final, crucial step.</p>
<p>The FCA is urging consumers to make firm-checking a habit &ndash; just like locking the front door &ndash; before committing any money.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The quick and easy-to-use tool helps people avoid scammers pretending to be genuine firms. It enables people to check the contact details of financial firms to make sure they match those listed on the Firm Checker.</p>
<p>Bottom line: if the deal looks exciting, urgent or 'too good to miss', stop, check the firm, and only then decide whether to invest.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/consumers/fca-firm-checker">Visit the Firm Checker</a>&nbsp;to check the firm has the correct permissions and always use the contact details listed to ensure the firm is authorised.</p>
<p>To support the campaign, media will be running on&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS5hqBdp0XI" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)">TV<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>, radio and social media platforms.</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Seeks Views On How To Help Close The Protection Gap</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The FCA has called on the insurance industry to help more consumers access products that support them and their families if they become critically ill or die.</p>
<p><span>The&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/market-studies/ms24-1-4-market-study-distribution-pure-protection-products-retail-customers-interim-report.pdf" title="ms24-1-4-market-study-distribution-pure-protection-products-retail-customers-interim-report.pdf"><span>interim findings</span></a><span>&nbsp;of its competition review of pure protection products found that, for those consumers that have taken out protection insurance, the market mostly works well. There are a wide range of products, most consumers can claim when they need to, and the costs of cover have remained stable in the last few years.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But 58% of adults do not hold a pure protection product even though many could benefit from them. The FCA wants to help close this gap.</span></p>
<p><span>Research suggests that the gap exists because consumers aren't aware of their needs and aren't prompted to consider them. Other issues include ability to pay, misunderstandings about the product or improvements needed in the sales process.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The FCA is exploring what more can be done, working with industry and other stakeholders, to better support consumers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Graeme Reynolds, director of Competition and interim director of Insurance at the FCA, commented:</span></p>
<p><span>'These insurance products play a vital role in helping families manage some of the most difficult experiences in life. While competition in the market is mostly working well for consumers, many more people could benefit from protection. We will work with industry to reduce this gap, to help consumers navigate their financial lives.'</span></p>
<p><span>The FCA has seen examples of firms delivering good value for consumers and will look more closely with updated 2025 data ahead of the final report.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The FCA will also consider ways to improve product switching, so firms make sure any switch clearly benefits the consumer and meets their needs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The FCA welcomes feedback on its interim findings by 31 March 2026. A final report will be published in Q3 2026, setting out final findings and an update on progress.</span></p>

<li>Pure protection insurance refers to products that provide financial support if a specified event happens to the policyholder or their dependants. These products do not include any savings or investment component. Premiums are used solely to provide cover. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Pure protection products typically include: &nbsp;<br />a. Life insurance &ndash; pays out on death or terminal illness. &nbsp;<br />b. Critical illness insurance &ndash; pays a lump sum if the policyholder is diagnosed with a specified serious illness. &nbsp;<br />c. Income protection insurance &ndash; provides regular payments if someone is unable to work due to illness or injury. &nbsp;</li>
<li>These products help consumers and their families manage financial shocks associated with bereavement, serious illness or losing the ability to work. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Pure protection products are distinct from policies with an investment or savings element, such as endowments or investment-linked policies. Those products combine protection with a financial return; pure protection products do not.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>SGX Stock Exchange today welcomed the listing of the UOBAM Ping An FTSE ASEAN Dividend Index ETF, offering investors diversified exposure to established regional market leaders with strong dividend profiles. &nbsp;The listing of this ETF reflects growing investor interest in income‑oriented strategies, where dividends can provide a degree of defensive stability alongside participation in equity market upside.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Managed by UOB Asset Management, the ETF tracks the FTSE ASEAN ex REITs Target Dividend Index, featuring 57 large and mid‑capitalisation companies from five key ASEAN markets, namely Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, and the Philippines. &nbsp;With a higher allocation to defensive sectors and low correlation with major global markets, the ETF offers a higher dividend yield relative to the broader FTSE ASEAN Index.&nbsp; Units are available in SGD and USD under the stock codes UPD and UPU, respectively.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ng Yao Loong, Head of Equities, SGX Group, said, &ldquo;ASEAN offers a compelling investment proposition to investors, given its strong structural growth factors and efforts to deepen the domestic and regional capital markets. This ETF provides investors with a simple and cost‑efficient way to access a diversified portfolio of ASEAN equities through a single SGX‑listed vehicle, leveraging Singapore&rsquo;s role as a trusted gateway for global capital into the region. &nbsp;We are pleased to partner with UOB Asset Management to deepen investor access to high quality, dividend-paying companies in the ASEAN region.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thio Boon Kiat, Group Chief Executive Officer, UOBAM, said, &ldquo;ASEAN remains a key driver of wealth creation in Asia, supported by favourable demographics and structural growth. At the same time, the region offers abundant dividend opportunities across a broad base of companies with strong fundamentals and healthy dividend profiles. This ETF provides investors with straightforward access to these income streams alongside ASEAN&rsquo;s long term growth potential. As investors increasingly seek stability and yield in today&rsquo;s uncertain market, UOBAM is well placed to meet these needs, drawing on our decades of experience and extensive on-the-ground presence across the region.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The UOBAM Ping An FTSE ASEAN Dividend Index ETF complements SGX Stock Exchange&rsquo;s growing lineup of Asia‑focused ETFs. With this addition, the ETF product shelf expands to 52 listings, with combined assets under management exceeding S$18 billion.</p>

<title>Monetary Authority Of Singapore Monetary Policy Statement - January 2026</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/monetary-authority-of-singapore-monetary-policy-statement-january-2026-2026129/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/monetary-authority-of-singapore-monetary-policy-statement-january-2026-2026129/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>In its October 2025 monetary policy review, MAS maintained the rate of appreciation of the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate (S$NEER) policy band, with no change to the width of the band or the level at which it was centred. Since then, the S$NEER has strengthened in the upper half of the appreciating policy band.</span></p>
<p><span>Chart 1<br /><span>S$ Nominal Effective Exchange Rate</span><br /><img alt="S$NEER chart for Monetary Policy Statement January 2026" height="364px" src="https://www.mas.gov.sg/-/media/mas-media-library/news/monetary-policy-statements/2026/mps_chart_2026_01.jpg" width="562px" /></span></p>
<h4>GROWTH BACKDROP</h4>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Economic activity in Singapore&rsquo;s major trading partners remained resilient in the last quarter of 2025, buoyed by the AI-related investment boom and reduction in trade policy uncertainty. This year, global growth is expected to ease modestly, as the lagged effects of higher tariffs weigh on final demand and trade. Nevertheless, the extent of the global economic moderation could be mitigated by supportive fiscal and monetary policies. In the near term, the global AI capex upcycle should also continue apace, and provide strong support for economies plugged into the electronics supply chain.</span></p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>In line with the global economic backdrop,&nbsp;advance estimates from MTI show that the Singapore economy grew by 1.9% on a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis in Q4 2025, following the 2.4% expansion in the preceding quarter. Growth came in stronger than projected, largely due to robust performance of the manufacturing and services segments that are closely tied to the global technology cycle.</span></p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>In the near term, Singapore&rsquo;s GDP growth should be resilient, although uncertainties to the outlook remain. The expansion in the trade-related sectors is likely to be underpinned by continuing near-term strength in the global AI-driven capex cycle. Growth in non-technology-related segments is also forecast to be firm: financial services should be supported by steady lending and capital market activity, while the construction sector will benefit from a continuing pipeline of public and private projects. For the full year, GDP growth is expected to ease relative to the stronger outturn in 2025, with the positive output gap projected to narrow over the course of the year.</span></p>
<h4>INFLATION OUTLOOK</h4>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS Core Inflation<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/monetary-policy-statements/2026/mas-monetary-policy-statement-29jan26#1">[1]</a></span>&nbsp;<span>rose to 1.2% y-o-y in Q4 2025, from 0.4% in the preceding quarter. The step-up in inflation partly reflected increases in the cost of private health insurance and holiday expenses, as well as the dissipation of base effects associated with enhanced subsidies. Beyond these temporary factors, inflation momentum also picked up from low levels across most core goods and services, in line with an uptick in regional prices and domestic wage increases. For 2025 as a whole, MAS Core Inflation came in at 0.7%, considerably lower than 2.8% in 2024.</span></p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Core inflation is expected to increase modestly in the near term. This will reflect a pick-up in services unit labour costs growth from its subdued pace earlier in 2025. At the same time, the recent rise in services productivity could be sustained, dampening the extent of cost increases. Meanwhile, imported inflation should remain contained. Global oil and food commodity prices are projected to decline this year, albeit at a progressively slower pace over the quarters. Regional consumer price inflation is forecast to only edge up, as subdued producer prices in Asia continue to dampen cost pressures.</span></p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>The forecasts for MAS Core Inflation and CPI-All Items inflation for 2026 have both been raised to 1.0&ndash;2.0%, from 0.5&ndash;1.5% in the October 2025 Monetary Policy Statement. On average over 2026, core inflation momentum is expected to come in at a pace that is slightly below trend. CPI-All Items inflation would additionally reflect subdued accommodation costs with the continued passthrough of weaker housing rental growth of the past year.</span></p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>The risks to the growth and inflation outlook are tilted to the upside at this point. Persistently stronger-than-expected GDP growth could lead to higher wage growth and boost consumer sentiment, exacerbating demand-pull inflationary pressures. Supply shocks, including those triggered by geopolitical developments, risk lifting imported costs. Nevertheless, some downside risks are also present, reflecting underlying fragilities in the global economy. For instance, a sharp correction in global financial markets or an abrupt pullback in global AI-related investment would&nbsp;</span><span>induce a faster pace of easing in growth and consequently lower inflation.</span></p>
<h4>MONETARY POLICY</h4>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, good morning.</p>
<p>Today is a truly golden moment for Hong Kong&rsquo;s ETF<sup>1</sup> market as we witness the successful listing of Hang Seng Gold ETF. My warmest congratulations to Hang Seng and all the teams who turned this vision into reality. This launch reflects the strength and depth of our market in supporting innovative products that investors need.</p>
<p>Gold is as old as civilisation, yet as relevant as ever. It has always symbolised value, resilience, and trust &mdash; qualities that we continuously strive to uphold in our financial system. This ETF transforms that timeless asset into a modern, accessible investment vehicle. It turns symbolism into substance.</p>
<p>Competition is the crucible where innovation is forged. When firms compete to serve investors better &mdash; with sharper ideas, better structures and lower costs &mdash; they create golden opportunities for both investors and for Hong Kong.</p>
<p>At the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), we want to see more of this: innovation that broadens participation, strengthens market resilience, and uses frontier tools like blockchain to keep our markets future ready. When innovation is anchored in sound regulation and integrity, it becomes a gold standard for others to follow.</p>
<p>At the same time, let us hold fast to one golden rule: innovate boldly, but innovate responsibly. We will be a firm and fair referee, but also an open partner &mdash; we welcome more ideas, more proposals, more products that truly add value.</p>
<p>If we do that together, I am confident we will continue to strike gold for our investors, for our markets, and for Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>

<title>ASIC Acts Against 28 SMSF Auditors, Flags Increased Scrutiny On In-House Audit Breaches</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-acts-against-28-smsf-auditors-flags-increased-scrutiny-on-in-house-audit-b-2026129/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>28 self-managed superannuation fund (SMSF) auditors had their registrations cancelled, conditions imposed on them, or were disqualified by ASIC in the first half of the 25-26 financial year.</p>
<p>SMSF auditors are responsible for providing assurance over the $1 trillion in retirement savings held in Australia&rsquo;s 661,000 SMSF accounts. They must act as trusted gatekeepers who contribute to the integrity and confidence in the SMSF regime.</p>
<p>Between 1 July 2025 and 31 December 2025, ASIC:</p>
<ul>
<li>disqualified 4 SMSF auditors,</li>
<li>imposed additional conditions on 2 SMSF auditors, and</li>
<li>cancelled the registration of 22 SMSF auditors.</li>
</ul>
<p>ASIC took this action after finding breaches of professional obligations and standards, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>failing to comply with auditing and assurance standards, independence and continuing professional development requirements or to hold professional indemnity insurance,</li>
<li>failing to provide ASIC with annual statements,</li>
<li>failing to advise ASIC of changes to their contact details on the public register of SMSF auditors and not responding to regulatory compliance requests, and</li>
<li>failing to carry out enough audit work to meet the practical experience requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Andy Choi, Robert Morey, Andrew Orphanides and Ermis Yianni were disqualified from being SMSF auditors.</p>
<p>John Couroyannis and Dawid Maj had additional conditions imposed on their SMSF auditor registrations. The specific conditions can be viewed by searching the SMSF auditor&rsquo;s name in&nbsp;<a href="https://service.asic.gov.au/search/">ASIC's Professional Registers Search</a>.</p>
<p>Of the 22 auditors who had their registrations cancelled, 9 were cancelled over a failure to perform any significant audit work during the last 5 years. These auditors were referred to ASIC by the ATO,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-040mr-asic-announces-action-against-17-smsf-auditors/" title="25-040MR ASIC announces action against 17 SMSF auditors">further adding to the 11 auditors who had their registrations cancelled last year</a>&nbsp;as part of the ATO's ongoing project to identify auditors who fail to maintain the necessary practical experience. These auditors were Yvonne Ching, Patrick Hoey, Christopher Leech, Rochelle Massih, Barry Mendel, Rick Siew, Thien Siow, John Whiting and Weifeng Zhu.</p>
<p>Ahmed Afifi and Fredel Twum were cancelled for not updating their contact details on the public register and failing to respond to regulatory compliance requests.</p>
<p>The registrations of 11 SMSF auditors were cancelled by ASIC for failing to comply with their obligation to lodge multiple annual statements.</p>
<h2>Increased scrutiny on in-house audit independence breaches</h2>
<p>ASIC has also increased its scrutiny on in-house audits, which occur when auditors audit the financial statements of SMSF clients they or their firm also provide accounting services to.</p>
<p>Two of the 4 auditors disqualified in the last 6 months &ndash; Mr Orphanides and Mr Yianni &ndash; were disqualified because ASIC found they continued auditing SMSFs whose financial statements were prepared by staff in their own firm. ASIC contends that this conduct continued even after ASIC had&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-043mr-asic-acts-against-15-smsf-auditors-performing-in-house-audits/" title="24-043MR ASIC acts against 15 SMSF auditors performing in-house audits">previously imposed extra conditions</a>&nbsp;on their SMSF auditor registrations to address this very issue.</p>
<p>Since 2020, auditors are explicitly prohibited from auditing SMSF financial statements where their firm provides accounting services, including preparing financial statements, unless the accounting services are routine or mechanical and any independence threats created by providing those services are reduced an acceptable level.</p>
<p>However, a 2025 review by the ATO indicated that up to 800 SMSF auditors&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals-and-families/super-for-individuals-and-families/self-managed-super-funds-smsf/smsf-newsroom/in-house-audit-review-results">may still be performing in-house audits</a>, so this risk continues to remain a focus on the ATO&rsquo;s compliance program.</p>
<p>Where SMSF auditor conduct falls short, ASIC will continue to act.</p>

</ul>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Approved SMSF auditors are registered with ASIC under the&nbsp;<em>Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993</em>&nbsp;(<strong>SIS Act</strong>). ASIC and the ATO work closely together as co-regulators of SMSF auditors. The ATO monitors SMSF auditor conduct and may decide to refer matters to ASIC. ASIC also monitors the SMSF auditor population for non-compliance and is empowered to disqualify, suspend, cancel or impose additional conditions on the registration of SMSF auditors.</p>
<p>ASIC may:</p>
<ul>
<li>make an order disqualifying or suspending a person from being an approved SMSF auditor, under section 130F of the SIS Act, if the person has failed to carry out or perform adequately and properly the duties and functions of an auditor or is not a fit and proper person to be an approved SMSF auditor. The order disqualifying a person from being an approved SMSF auditor must be published by notifiable instrument detailed in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/legislative-instruments/notifiable-asic-instruments/" title="Notifiable ASIC instruments">Notifiable ASIC instruments</a>&nbsp;listing. A disqualified SMSF auditor is placed on ASIC&rsquo;s public&nbsp;<a href="https://connectonline.asic.gov.au/RegistrySearch/">banned and disqualified register</a>&nbsp;and is not eligible to reapply for registration unless the disqualification is revoked. Suspension orders are not notifiable instruments, however the approved SMSF auditor status in the register will show &lsquo;suspended&rsquo; during the time of suspension.</li>
<li>impose conditions on an SMSF auditor&rsquo;s registration under section 128D of the SIS Act at any time by giving written notice.</li>
<li>cancel the registration of an SMSF auditor under section 128E of the SIS Act for non-compliance with conditions, ceasing to have the practical experience necessary for carrying out audits of SMSFs, failing to lodge annual statements in the required timeframe or ceasing to be an Australian resident.</li>
</ul>
<p>SMSF auditors have the right to seek review of decisions that ASIC makes in relation to their registration under the SIS Act. They may request that ASIC reconsider a decision it has made against them. If the decision is confirmed or varied the SMSF auditor may apply to the ART for further review of the confirmed or varied decision.</p>
<p>Mr Morey and Mr Yianni requested ASIC reconsider its disqualification decision and in each case the disqualifications were confirmed.</p>
<p>Mr Morey has applied to the Administrative Review Tribunal (<strong>ART</strong>) for review of the decision to disqualify him.</p>
<p>Mr Yianni has advised ASIC that he has applied to the ART for review of the decision to disqualify him.</p>
<p><em>APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards)</em>&nbsp;was restructured effective 1 January 2020 to prohibit auditors from auditing SMSF financial statements where their firm provides accounting services, including preparing financial statements, unless the accounting services are routine or mechanical and any independence threats created by providing those services are reduced an acceptable level.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2><span>Introduction</span></h2>
<p>As part of an effort to provide greater clarity on the application of the federal securities laws to crypto assets,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/corp-fin-statement-tokenized-securities-012826#_ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;the Division of Corporation Finance, Division of Investment Management, and Division of Trading and Markets are providing their views<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/corp-fin-statement-tokenized-securities-012826#_ftn2">[2]</a>&nbsp;on the taxonomies associated with tokenized securities.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/corp-fin-statement-tokenized-securities-012826#_ftn3">[3]</a>&nbsp;A tokenized security is a financial instrument enumerated in the definition of &ldquo;security&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/corp-fin-statement-tokenized-securities-012826#_ftn4">[4]</a>&nbsp;under the federal securities laws that is formatted as or represented by a crypto asset, where the record of ownership is maintained in whole or in part on or through one or more crypto networks. There are a variety of models used to tokenize securities and they vary in terms of structure and the rights afforded to holders. Tokenized securities generally fall into two categories: (1) securities tokenized by or on behalf of the issuers of such securities; and (2) securities tokenized by third parties unaffiliated with the issuers of such securities.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/corp-fin-statement-tokenized-securities-012826#_ftn5">[5]</a>&nbsp;This statement is intended to assist market participants as they seek to comply with the federal securities laws and prepare to submit any necessary registrations, proposals, or requests for appropriate action to the Commission or its staff. We stand ready to engage regarding any questions.</p>
<h2><span>Issuer-Sponsored Tokenized Securities</span></h2>
<p>An issuer may tokenize a security by issuing it in the format of a crypto asset.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/corp-fin-statement-tokenized-securities-012826#_ftn6">[6]</a>&nbsp;To accomplish this, the issuer (or its agent) integrates DLT into the systems that it uses to record owners of the security (the &ldquo;master securityholder file&rdquo;), such that a transfer of the crypto asset on the crypto network results in a transfer of the security on the master securityholder file. Consequently, the only difference between a security issued in this manner and securities issued in traditional format is that instead of maintaining the master securityholder file through conventional, offchain database records, the issuer (or its agent) maintains the master securityholder file on one or more crypto networks, which functionally are onchain database records. As part of this recordkeeping system, the issuer (or its agent) uses onchain database records alongside offchain database records and associates the onchain information (<em>e.g.</em>, wallet address, quantity of security owned, and issue date) with relevant offchain information (<em>e.g.</em>, security holder name and address).</p>
<p>A single class of securities could be issued in multiple formats, including tokenized format. Similarly, an issuer may permit security holders to hold a security in different formats and convert the security from one format to another. The format in which a security is issued or the methods by which holders are recorded (<em>e.g.</em>, onchain vs. offchain) does not affect application of the federal securities laws.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/corp-fin-statement-tokenized-securities-012826#_ftn7">[7]</a>&nbsp;For example, regardless of its format, the Securities Act requires that every offer and sale of a security must be registered with the Commission unless an exemption from registration is available. Similarly, stock is an &ldquo;equity security&rdquo; under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act regardless of its format.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/corp-fin-statement-tokenized-securities-012826#_ftn8">[8]</a></p>
<p>On the other hand, the tokenized security could be of a different class of securities from those issued in traditional format. For example, an issuer could issue one class of common stock in traditional format and issue a separate class of common stock as a tokenized security. However, if the tokenized security is of substantially similar character as the security issued in traditional format and holders of the tokenized security enjoy substantially similar rights and privileges, the tokenized security may be considered of the same class as the security issued in traditional format for certain purposes under the federal securities laws.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/corp-fin-statement-tokenized-securities-012826#_ftn9">[9]</a></p>
<p>Alternatively, an issuer (or its agent) may tokenize a security without a crypto network constituting, or being part of, the master securityholder file. Under this model, the issuer issues the security offchain and issues a crypto asset to security holders. The crypto asset does not convey any rights, obligations, or benefits of the security, and the crypto asset and its onchain database records are not directly integrated into the master securityholder file for the security.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/corp-fin-statement-tokenized-securities-012826#_ftn10">[10]</a>&nbsp;Instead, the crypto asset may be used indirectly to effect transfers of the security on the master securityholder file. In this case, the transfer of the crypto asset, which is a securities transaction, operates to notify the issuer (or its agent) to record the transfer of ownership of the security on the master securityholder file. Because the offchain database records constitute the master securityholder file, the issuer (or its agent) will use the onchain database records to update the offchain database records to record the transfer of ownership of the security.</p>
<h2><span>Third Party-Sponsored Tokenized Securities</span></h2>
<p>In addition to issuer-sponsored tokenized securities, third parties unaffiliated with an issuer of a security could tokenize the unaffiliated issuer&rsquo;s security. The models that third parties are using to tokenize securities vary, and the rights, obligations, and benefits associated with the crypto asset may or may not be materially different from those of the underlying security. In addition, the crypto asset may or may not represent an ownership interest in or contractual obligation of the issuer of the underlying security and, as such, may or may not confer upon the holder of the crypto asset any rights as a holder of the underlying security. Further, holders of the crypto asset may be exposed to risks with respect to the third party, such as bankruptcy, to which a holder of the underlying security would not necessarily be exposed.</p>
<p>We have observed two models where a third party tokenizes securities issued by another person: custodial tokenized securities and synthetic tokenized securities. Under the first model, the third party issues a crypto asset representing the underlying security, such as a tokenized security entitlement.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/corp-fin-statement-tokenized-securities-012826#_ftn11">[11]</a>&nbsp;The underlying security is held in custody, and the crypto asset evidences the holder&rsquo;s ownership interest (whether direct or indirect) in the underlying security being held in custody. Under the second model, the third party issues a crypto asset representing its own security that provides synthetic exposure to the underlying security, such as a tokenized linked security or a tokenized security-based swap.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/corp-fin-statement-tokenized-securities-012826#_ftn12">[12]</a></p>
<h3>First Model: Custodial Tokenized Securities</h3>
<p><em>Tokenized Security Entitlement</em></p>
<p>A third party may tokenize a security issued by another person by creating a security entitlement that is formatted as a crypto asset.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/corp-fin-statement-tokenized-securities-012826#_ftn13">[13]</a>&nbsp;Similar to the issuer-sponsored model discussed above, the third party may accomplish this by integrating DLT into the systems that it uses to record entitlement holders, such that a transfer of the crypto asset results in a transfer of the security entitlement on the third party&rsquo;s records. Under this model, the crypto asset represents the holder&rsquo;s indirect interest in the underlying security via the security entitlement.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/corp-fin-statement-tokenized-securities-012826#_ftn14">[14]</a>&nbsp;The format in which the security entitlement is issued does not affect application of the federal securities laws.</p>
<p>Alternatively, a third party may tokenize a security entitlement without a crypto network constituting, or being part of, the systems that it uses to record entitlement holders. Under this model, the crypto asset may nonetheless be used to transfer the security entitlement on the third party&rsquo;s records similar to the issuer-sponsored model discussed above.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/corp-fin-statement-tokenized-securities-012826#_ftn15">[15]</a>&nbsp;Because the records are maintained offchain, the third party will use the onchain database records to update the offchain database records to record the transfer of the security entitlement.</p>
<h3>Second Model: Synthetic Tokenized Securities</h3>
<p><em>Linked Security</em></p>
<p>A third party may tokenize a security issued by another person by issuing a &ldquo;linked security&rdquo; formatted as a crypto asset. A &ldquo;linked security&rdquo; is a security issued by the third party itself that provides synthetic exposure to a referenced security, but it is not an obligation of the issuer of the referenced security and confers no rights or benefits from the issuer of the referenced security. The return on a linked security is linked to the value of the security it references or events relating to the referenced security. A linked security may be a debt security (such as a structured note<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/corp-fin-statement-tokenized-securities-012826#_ftn16">[16]</a>) or an equity security (such as exchangeable stock). Under certain circumstances, as discussed below, a linked security may be a security-based swap. The crypto asset representing the linked security is similar to the crypto assets discussed under &ldquo;Issuer-Sponsored Tokenized Securities&rdquo; above.</p>
<p><em>Security-Based Swap</em></p>
<p>A third party may tokenize a security issued by another person by issuing a security-based swap formatted as a crypto asset.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/corp-fin-statement-tokenized-securities-012826#_ftn17">[17]</a>&nbsp;A security-based swap is a security that generally provides synthetic exposure to, among other things, either a referenced security or certain referenced events relating to an issuer of a security. A security-based swap typically does not convey to the holder any equity, voting, information, or other rights with respect to the referenced security. The third party may not offer or sell the crypto asset representing the security-based swap to persons who are not eligible contract participants<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/corp-fin-statement-tokenized-securities-012826#_ftn18">[18]</a>&nbsp;unless a Securities Act registration statement is in effect as to the crypto asset,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/corp-fin-statement-tokenized-securities-012826#_ftn19">[19]</a>&nbsp;and the transactions in the crypto asset are effected on a national securities exchange.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/corp-fin-statement-tokenized-securities-012826#_ftn20">[20]</a>&nbsp;The crypto asset representing the security-based swap is similar to the crypto assets discussed under &ldquo;Issuer-Sponsored Tokenized Securities&rdquo; above.</p>
<p>The term &ldquo;security-based swap&rdquo; is defined in Section 3(a)(68) of the Exchange Act. The definition of &ldquo;security-based swap&rdquo; includes any agreement, contract, or transaction that is a swap (as defined in Section 1a of the CEA)<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/corp-fin-statement-tokenized-securities-012826#_ftn21">[21]</a>&nbsp;and is based on: (1) an index that is a narrow-based security index, including any interest therein or on the value thereof; (2) a single security or loan, including any interest therein or on the value thereof; or (3) the occurrence, nonoccurrence, or extent of the occurrence of an event relating to a single issuer of a security or the issuers of securities in a narrow-based security index, provided that such event directly affects the financial statements, financial condition, or financial obligations of the issuer. If a financial instrument formatted as a crypto asset is a swap and it satisfies one of the three prongs of the definition of &ldquo;security-based swap,&rdquo; then the crypto asset may represent a security-based swap. For example, if the crypto asset provides on an executory basis for the exchange, on a fixed or contingent basis, of one or more payments based on the value of a security, but does not also convey a current or future direct or indirect ownership interest in an asset or liability that incorporates the financial risk transferred, that crypto asset may represent a security-based swap.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/corp-fin-statement-tokenized-securities-012826#_ftn22">[22]</a>&nbsp;Similarly, if the crypto asset provides for payments that are dependent on the occurrence, non-occurrence or extent of occurrence of an event or contingency that is associated with a potential financial, economic, or commercial consequence, does not fall within one of the specified exclusions, and meets any of the three prongs of the security-based swap definition discussed above, that crypto asset may represent a security-based swap.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/corp-fin-statement-tokenized-securities-012826#_ftn23">[23]</a></p>
<p>Security-based swaps and linked securities are economically similar, although certain additional or different provisions apply to the regulation of security-based swaps under the federal securities laws, including with respect to transactions with persons who are not eligible contract participants as noted above.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/corp-fin-statement-tokenized-securities-012826#_ftn24">[24]</a>&nbsp;The assessment of whether a financial instrument is a security-based swap or a linked security depends, in part, on the exclusions from the definition of &ldquo;swap.&rdquo; There are several exclusions from the definition of &ldquo;swap&rdquo; relating to securities.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/corp-fin-statement-tokenized-securities-012826#_ftn25">[25]</a>&nbsp;To the extent a financial instrument falls into one of these exclusions, it is not a swap and, therefore, is not a security-based swap. For example, any note, bond, or evidence of indebtedness that is a security, as defined in Section 2(a)(1) of the Securities Act, is excluded from the definition of swap.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/corp-fin-statement-tokenized-securities-012826#_ftn26">[26]</a>&nbsp;Similarly, any put, call, straddle, option, or privilege on any security, certificate of deposit, or group or index of securities, including any interest therein or based on the value thereof, that is subject to the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, is excluded from the definition of swap.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/corp-fin-statement-tokenized-securities-012826#_ftn27">[27]</a>&nbsp;When assessing whether a financial instrument formatted as a crypto asset satisfies one of these exclusions, the economic reality of the instrument rather than the name given to the instrument determines whether it is excluded.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/corp-fin-statement-tokenized-securities-012826#_ftn28">[28]</a></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Available indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace. Job gains have remained low, and the unemployment rate has shown some signs of stabilization. Inflation remains somewhat elevated.</p>
<p>The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. Uncertainty about the economic outlook remains elevated. The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.</p>
<p>In support of its goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 3‑1/2 to 3‑3/4 percent. In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.</p>
<p>In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.</p>
<p>Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chair; John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Michael S. Barr; Michelle W. Bowman; Lisa D. Cook; Beth M. Hammack; Philip N. Jefferson; Neel Kashkari; Lorie K. Logan; and Anna Paulson. Voting against this action were Stephen I. Miran and Christopher J. Waller, who preferred to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point at this meeting.</p>

<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today announced the go-live of its Pillar 3 data hub, marking the first time prudential information from all EEA institutions is made publicly accessible through a single, harmonised digital platform. The hub discloses the data that large and other institutions began submitting on 26 January, and significantly enhances the availability, usability and comparability of prudential information across the EU. By boosting transparency and supporting market discipline, the hub contributes to further strengthening the resilience and soundness of the European financial system.</span></p>
<p>With the first wave of institutions successfully onboarded, Pillar 3 reports can now be submitted to the EBA platform for publication in the data hub. Users gain access to official data submitted by institutions and can explore it through an intuitive visualisation tool that enables easy comparisons across institutions, reference dates, and other dimensions. Bulk data downloads are also available, for deeper analysis and research. The full data set for the three first reference dates - June, September and December 2025 - is expected to be available by June this year.</p>
<p>The launch follows a successful testing phase with a sample of institutions. From now onwards, Institutions are expected to submit via the platform the Pillar 3 reports they have already published on their own websites for 2025 reference dates, in line with the transitional arrangements envisaged under the final draft ITS (<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2025-02/fe98daa0-231d-4e92-b8a4-f1ad42d257e6/EBA_ITS_2025_01%20Final%20Report%20P3DH%20ITS_large%20and%20other%20institutions.pdf">link</a>). This transition period enables institutions to familiarise themselves with the platform and submission process, before moving to the steady state. It will conclude with the submission of reports for the December 2025 reference date.</p>

<h4>Legal basis and next steps</h4>
<p>The new Banking Package (Capital Requirements Regulation/Capital Requirements Directive - CRR3/CRD6), which implements the latest Basel III reforms in the EU, includes a mandate for the EBA to develop a Pillar 3 data hub. The EBA&rsquo;s plan implementation plan for all the mandates under the Banking Package is available on the Pillar 3 data hub webpage (<a href="https://eba.europa.eu/risk-and-data-analysis/pillar-3-data-hub">link</a>).</p>
<p>The EBA intends to introduce in the visualisation tool a dynamic dashboard of key indicators, planned to evolve over time based on industry feedback and emerging needs.</p>

<title>CME Group Named As First-Ever Chicago White Sox Jersey Patch Sponsor - Iconic Chicago Institutions Team Up For Multiyear Agreement Reaching Global Audiences</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Chicago White Sox today announced a multiyear agreement establishing CME Group, the world's leading derivatives marketplace, as the team's inaugural jersey patch sponsor and Official Global Exchange Partner.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the deal, the CME Group logo will be featured on the home, road and alternate jerseys, including the MLB Nike City Connect uniform, for all Spring Training, regular and postseason games.</p>
<p>In addition to the jersey patch, CME Group receives prominent fixed signage behind home plate during home games at Rate Field, as well as other promotional opportunities.</p>
<p>"Partnering with a team known for grit, achievement and perseverance is a natural fit with the CME Group brand, and we are pleased to become the first jersey-patch sponsor of the Chicago White Sox," said CME Group Chairman and Chief Executive Officer&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Terry Duffy</span>. "In our own ways, both of our organizations are strong contributors to the greater&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Chicago</span>&nbsp;community. Yet our reach goes well beyond the city we share, appealing to key constituents around the world. The White Sox are reaching younger, broader and increasingly global audiences, as evidenced by the league's record revenue and increasing viewership. CME Group is similarly expanding into new markets and client segments, particularly in retail. Together, we'll deliver a compelling experience that appeals to our current and prospective clients while elevating both brands."</p>
<p>"Throughout this process, we understood the importance and significance of joining forces with a&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Chicago</span>-based partner whose brand we would literally be sporting every day," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Brooks Boyer</span>, White Sox chief revenue and marketing officer. "The White Sox uniform designs represent so much to our organization, our fans and&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Chicago</span>, and a bold partnership with CME Group&mdash;a&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Chicago</span>-born company with a global footprint&mdash;was a perfect fit. Our organizations share a mentality that is built on ambition, pride and a strong work ethic, and this jersey patch is more than branding; it reinforces the power of&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Chicago</span>&nbsp;both here at home and around the world."</p>
<p>On the home pinstripes uniform, the blue logo will be set against a white background and black border with CME in black lettering. The road grays will have the blue logo on a matching gray background with CME in black lettering. The MLB Nike City Connect and alternate black jerseys will feature the blue logo on a black background with CME in white lettering.</p>
<p>The team will debut the uniform when Cactus League play begins on&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">Friday, February 20</span>&nbsp;when the White Sox take on the Chicago Cubs at&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">2:05 p.m. CT</span>. The team will wear it for the first time in the 2026 regular season during the opener in&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Milwaukee</span>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">Thursday, March 26</span>&nbsp;at&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">1:10 p.m. CT</span>&nbsp;and again for the home opener against&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Toronto</span>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">Thursday, April 2</span>&nbsp;at&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">3:10 p.m. CT</span>&nbsp;at Rate Field.</p>

<title>SIFMA Roundtable: Building The Roadmap To 24/7 Markets, “Money Never Sleeps”, Jamie Selway, Director, SEC Division Of Trading And Markets, Washington D.C., Jan. 28, 2026</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sifma-roundtable-building-the-roadmap-to-247-markets-money-never-sleeps-ja-2026128/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sifma-roundtable-building-the-roadmap-to-247-markets-money-never-sleeps-ja-2026128/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good morning. Thank you for the introduction Steve [Byron], and thank you Ken [Bentsen] and Katie [Kolchin] for the kind invitation to join today&rsquo;s event. I commend SIFMA for today&rsquo;s comprehensive program on an important, timely topic. And I applaud the many senior leaders gathered here to generously contribute time and expertise toward an industry roadmap for 24-by-7 trading.</p>
<p>Please note that my remarks today are made in my official capacity as the Commission&rsquo;s Director of the Division of Trading and Markets and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Commission, the Commissioners, or members of the Division&rsquo;s staff. As you might guess, this disclaimer operates 24-by-7, 365 days a year.</p>
<p>For roughly twenty years, our equity market infrastructure has accommodated trading between 4 AM and 8 PM ET. Recently, in response to interest from retail and non-U.S. investors, a number of platforms have launched &ldquo;overnight&rdquo; trading, including four ATSs. Notably, some non-equity markets, such as those for digital assets, currently operate 24-by-7. A growing consensus of market participants wants the equity markets to follow this course. Before our marketplace takes this step, however, foundational questions regarding common protocols and shared infrastructure must be answered. That is the purpose of today&rsquo;s roundtable.</p>
<p>The Division supports industry efforts to expand trading hours. In November 2024, the Commission approved 24X&rsquo;s Form 1 application, which included an overnight session. The Commission has also approved NYSE Arca&rsquo;s proposal to expand its trading hours, and a similar proposal from Nasdaq is currently out for comment. The equity market data plans have proposed extending the hours of operation for the SIPs by the end of 2026, and we understand that NSCC plans to be ready in June. Some market participants have also expressed an interest in having more timely reporting of TRF data in extended hours.</p>
<p>Based on our conversations with industry, we view these dates as feasible. Acute focus on operational particulars, such as handling corporate actions, is warranted to ensure a smooth expansion. Once deadlines for implementation are established, they should be met without unnecessary delay. My Division colleagues Kelly Riley and Peggy Sullivan are your points of contact for the Division on this issue, and Peggy is here with us today. I encourage you to engage with Kelly and Peggy as needed throughout the year.</p>
<p>It is commonplace to note that our Nation&rsquo;s markets are the envy of the world. It is rare, however, to have an opportunity to increase our global pre-eminence. Done in a way to benefit investors everywhere, and to deepen our capital formation advantages beyond our shores for corporate issuers, 24-by-7 trading may be one such opportunity. I hope you seize it.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and attention. I wish you all the best for a productive roundtable.</p>

<li><i style="font-family: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">i</i><i style="font-family: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">nto actionable market signals for investors to use</i></li>

</ul>
</div>
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE: ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today announced the launch of Reddit Signals and Sentiment, a suite of data and analytical tools that transforms millions of Reddit conversations into structured, actionable market signals for investors.</p>
<p>Conversations on platforms like Reddit can provide unique insights on markets and investing, but often take time to reach institutional investors, who then need to evaluate the value of that information and integrate it into investment decision-making processes. By analyzing anonymized and aggregated trends from the real-time Reddit data stream, and applying AI and ICE&rsquo;s sophisticated data science expertise, the new Reddit Signals and Sentiment service is designed to significantly reduce the time it takes for social signals to surface and be integrated into trading strategies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Reddit community produces a massive amount of complex, unstructured, but often very insightful, information across millions of active user conversations,&rdquo; said Chris Edmonds, President of ICE&rsquo;s Fixed Income and Data Services. &ldquo;By bringing our vast experience working with large, complex datasets, we&rsquo;re able to quickly identify useful market signals, connect them to companies and securities in our entity database, and compress the information cycle to help investors find new alpha-generating opportunities and manage risk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reddit Signals and Sentiment is available over ICE&rsquo;s data platforms, including the ICE Consolidated Feed. It offers real-time and historical sentiment scores, and a daily graph showing which companies, products or entities are trending and being discussed together. These signals are derived from anonymized public data, ensuring no individual user tracking or profiling. The Reddit Signals and Sentiment service leverages ICE&rsquo;s extensive entity identification and reference databases to seamlessly connect market signals to specific securities or companies, allowing customers to integrate it with existing ICE data offerings, including securities pricing, fundamental data and corporate actions.</p>
<p>This new service is part of ICE&rsquo;s comprehensive and proprietary data offerings that can help enhance market insights, manage risks, and uncover investment opportunities.</p>
<p>For more information on Reddit Signals and Sentiment, please visit:&nbsp;<a href="https://ice.com/fixed-income-data-services/data-and-analytics/market-signals-and-sentiment" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">https://ice.com/fixed-income-data-services/data-and-analytics/market-signals-and-sentiment</a>.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><b>Priya Nallan, Head of Product Management at LSEG Risk Intelligence, comments on today&rsquo;s changes to the UK Sanctions List:</b></p>
<p><i>&ldquo;The UK&rsquo;s move to publish a single designations list marks a step toward greater clarity and consistency, particularly for firms operating across multiple jurisdictions. Compliance teams must ensure their systems can reconcile the UK&rsquo;s designations as published on the UK Sanctions List with other regimes such as the US&rsquo;s OFAC - especially where entities are co‑listed under narcotics trafficking, transnational crime, or proliferation‑related sanctions.</i></p>
<p><i>&ldquo;This presents an opportunity to reassess sanctions workflows and exposure analysis holistically. As regulatory expectations rise globally, firms must go beyond simple list matching and build screening programmes capable of detecting indirect risk, hidden ownership structures, and common and shifting designations across all relevant jurisdictions.</i></p>
<p><i>&ldquo;We have already ensured our World‑Check data and screening software is ready to support this transition.&rdquo;</i></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="row-with-description ">
<div class="text-highlight">
<ul class="rte--list">
<li>Assets under management and trading turnover reach new record highs</li>
<li>Active ETFs emerge as a key growth driver for the European ETF market</li>
<li>Investors focus on the defense sector and precious metals</li>
<li>Xetra's retail investor service offers significant advantages for trading ETFs and ETPs</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row-with-picture">
<div class="detailText">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Deutsche B&ouml;rse's segment for Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) and Exchange Traded Products (ETPs) posted new records across all key metrics last year. Trading turnover in ETFs and ETPs on Xetra saw a significant year-over-year increase of 52.7 percent, rising to &euro;352.4 billion (2024: &euro;230.8 billion). At the same time, assets under management (AUM) in the segment reached a new all-time high of &euro;2.27 trillion (+24.5 percent; December 2024: &euro;1.83 trillion).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These developments were accompanied by a further increase in listing activity. In particular, the ETF product category significantly surpassed the previous year's record of 281 newly listed ETFs with 399 new listings last year. This strong growth in products was also supported by new issuers entering the European ETF market: twelve new issuers listed ETFs on Xetra in 2025, more than ever before. Ten of these twelve new issuers were providers of actively managed ETFs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At year-end, ETFs constituted the largest product category in the segment with 2,671 products (2024: 2,328 ETFs). The ETP category included 488 products (2024: 446 ETPs), comprising 203 Exchange Traded Commodities (2024: 197 ETCs) and 285 Exchange Traded Notes (2024: 249 ETNs). This once again made Deutsche B&ouml;rse Europe's largest ETF exchange by trading turnover and number of listed products.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Actively managed ETFs remain a key growth driver</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The dynamic development within the ETF segment is primarily due to the continued strong interest in active ETFs. With 172 new listings, they accounted for more than 43 percent of all newly listed ETFs last year. This increased the number of active ETFs in the segment to 367, representing a 14 percent share. Concurrently, both assets under management and trading turnover on Xetra recorded above-average growth rates of 66.5 percent and 141 percent, respectively, reaching new record highs of &euro;73.6 billion and &euro;6.7 billion.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"The impressive growth of active ETFs on Xetra shows that the efficiency of the product structure is increasingly being leveraged in active investment strategies. More and more providers are recognizing the added value of the exchange as a complementary distribution channel, especially for attracting new, digitally savvy investor groups," says Stephan Kraus, Head of the ETF &amp; ETP segment at Deutsche B&ouml;rse.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Strong demand for defense and mining stocks, as well as precious metals</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Against the backdrop of ongoing geopolitical tensions and rising government spending in the defense sector, defense ETFs became the most-traded theme on Xetra last year. Their trading volume surged by 798 percent to &euro;9.3 billion (2024: &euro;1.04 billion). Simultaneously, assets under management increased by 570 percent to &euro;14.5 billion (2024: &euro;2.17 billion). The product offering in the segment expanded by 15 to a total of 20 ETFs by year-end.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Furthermore, mining stock ETFs also experienced exceptionally high growth rates. Driven by strong price performance in gold and silver, their trading volume on Xetra grew by 313 percent, reaching a new all-time high of &euro;5.91 billion (2024: &euro;1.43 billion). Fund assets rose by 186 percent to &euro;14.2 billion (2024: &euro;4.96 billion), ranking second &ndash; after defense ETFs &ndash; in terms of assets under management among thematic ETFs tradable on Xetra.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The price movements of gold and silver also led to significant turnover increases for precious metal ETCs. The trading turnover of gold ETCs rose by 245 percent to &euro;16.4 billion (2024: &euro;4.7 billion), while that of silver ETCs increased by 407 percent to &euro;4.4 billion (2024: &euro;869 million). Assets under management in both product categories also set new records, with gold ETCs at &euro;115.5 billion (+59.6 percent; 2024: &euro;72.4 billion) and silver ETCs at &euro;6.94 billion (+191.6 percent; 2024: &euro;2.38 billion).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Retail investors benefit from new service offering when trading ETFs and ETPs on Xetra</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In March of last year, Deutsche B&ouml;rse introduced its innovative Xetra retail trading offering for ETFs and ETPs. This service provides automatic price improvements over the current Xetra reference market prices when trading these products. Through a new market maker role that specifically provides liquidity for retail investors in the Xetra order book, their orders receive price improvements or are executed at least at the current Xetra price. Furthermore, trading hours for retail investors on Xetra were extended in December: investors can now trade all ETFs and ETPs listed on Xetra continuously from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For retail investors, the new trading service has led to significant price improvements compared to Xetra reference market prices. Since its launch in March, orders with a total volume of &euro;3.5 billion have already benefited from better execution prices for ETFs and ETPs. Xetra Retail is now supported by 15 banks and brokers, allowing investors to choose from a wide range of Deutsche B&ouml;rse's trading partners.</p>

<title>Seven Points Capital Expands Into London As Demand Grows For Fully Funded, Mentorship-Led Trading Firms - Proprietary Trading Firm Strengthens Global Footprint Amid Industry Reset And Shift Away From Challenge-Based Models</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/seven-points-capital-expands-into-london-as-demand-grows-for-fully-funded-mento-2026128/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/seven-points-capital-expands-into-london-as-demand-grows-for-fully-funded-mento-2026128/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://www.sevenpointscapital.com/" title="Seven Points Capital">Seven Points Capital</a>, a fully funded proprietary trading firm founded in 2007, has expanded into London with the opening of a new office, further strengthening its international presence as demand accelerates for long-term, mentorship-led trading models. The London expansion reflects growing global interest in Seven Points Capital&rsquo;s approach. It coincides with a broader reset across the proprietary trading industry, as challenge-based firms face increased scrutiny and traders seek more sustainable environments built on shared risk, accountability and long-term alignment between trader and firm.</p>
<p>Founded nearly two decades ago, Seven Points Capital has traded through multiple market cycles including the 2008 financial crisis, COVID-era volatility and today&rsquo;s increasingly continuous 24/5 market structure. The firm is frequently referenced as a counterpoint to pay-to-play prop firms, operating instead as a selective, fully funded partnership focused on mentorship, structure and long-term development.</p>
<p>Seven Points Capital operates a hybrid model, combining physical trading offices with a distributed global trader base. In addition to its new London office, the firm maintains offices in New York, Arizona and Fort Lauderdale, while supporting traders operating remotely across Canada and Europe.</p>
<p>Mike Mangieri, Co-Founder of Seven Points Capital, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;London has always been a natural fit for us. We&rsquo;re seeing experienced traders increasingly question short-term, challenge-driven models and look for environments that prioritise mentorship, structure and long-term partnership. Whether traders operate from one of our offices or from their own location, the foundation is the same - alignment, accountability and support.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Michael Katz, Co-Founder of Seven Points Capital, added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;As markets move closer to continuous trading, operational discipline and risk management matter more than ever. Expanding into London allows us to better support traders across time zones while maintaining the standards we&rsquo;ve built since 2007. Growth for us is never about scale for scale&rsquo;s sake - it&rsquo;s about fit, structure and long-term alignment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The London office is already operational and forms part of Seven Points Capital&rsquo;s broader international strategy, enabling closer collaboration with UK- and Europe-based traders while supporting a global trading operation across multiple time zones. The expansion comes as the proprietary trading sector undergoes heightened scrutiny by regulators, traders and market participants examining business models, funding structures and risk practices more closely. Seven Points Capital&rsquo;s fully funded structure, selective recruitment and long-tenured trader base position it firmly within the cohort of firms benefiting from this industry recalibration.</p>

<title>ASX Releases Unaudited 1H26 Results And Updates FY26 Expense Guidance</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li><b>FY26 expense growth guidance, excluding the ASIC inquiry costs, updated to be between 13% and 15% <i>&nbsp;</i></b></li>
<li><b>Including ASIC Inquiry costs, FY26 total expense growth guidance will be between 20% and 23%<i> </i></b></li>
<li><b>ASX is also releasing unaudited 1H26 financial results, showing strong operating revenue growth&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>&nbsp;</i></b></li>
</ul>
<p>On 15 December 2025 ASX <a href="https://www.asx.com.au/content/dam/asx/about/media-releases/2025/78-15-december-2025-asx-commits-to-asic-inquiry-actions-150m-capital-charge.pdf">announced it would implement a strategic package of actions</a><a href="https://www.asx.com.au/content/dam/asx/about/media-releases/2025/78-15-december-2025-asx-commits-to-asic-inquiry-actions-150m-capital-charge.pdf"> </a>agreed with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) following the release of the interim report from ASIC&rsquo;s expert Inquiry Panel. At that time, ASX noted FY26 expense growth guidance was unchanged.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">The Inquiry Panel&rsquo;s interim report contained serious findings and ASX has now had more time to reflect deeply on the Panel&rsquo;s call for a reset that places primacy on ASX&rsquo;s stewardship role as an operator of critical market infrastructure. Since the delivery of the interim report and our last guidance update, we have:</p>
<ol>
<li>progressed development of an implementation plan for the strategic package of actions (&ldquo;the Commitments plan&rdquo;); </li>
<li>revised investment requirements for key strategic priorities informed by the Inquiry Panel&rsquo;s interim report; and&nbsp; </li>
<li>updated our view of FY26 costs associated with trading volumes and the timing of various legal actions.&nbsp; </li>
</ol>
<p>In progressing these pieces of work, ASX has further updated our view on expense growth guidance for FY26.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ASX has previously guided that, excluding the ASIC inquiry related costs, FY26 total expense growth guidance was toward the upper end of between 8% and 11%. Including ASIC Inquiry related costs FY26 total expense growth would be between 14% and 19% compared to the prior corresponding period. This included the operating expenses of between $25 million and $35 million which related to the response to the ASIC Inquiry.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><b>Today we are updating FY26 expense growth guidance, excluding the ASIC inquiry costs, to be between 13% and 15%. Including ASIC Inquiry costs, total FY26 expense growth guidance will be between 20% and 23%.&nbsp; <i>&nbsp;</i></b></p>
<p>To provide further context to this update we have released unaudited 1H26 results information.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><b>1H26 unaudited financial highlights (vs prior corresponding period or pcp)&nbsp; </b></p>
<ol>
<li>Statutory net profit after tax (NPAT) of $263.6 million (up 8.3%)&nbsp;</li>
<li>Underlying NPAT of $263.6 million (up 3.9%)&nbsp;</li>
<li>Operating revenue of $602.8 million (up 11.2%)&nbsp;</li>
<li>Excluding ASIC inquiry related costs, total expenses of $247.0 million (up 12.1%)</li>
<li>Including ASIC inquiry related costs, total expenses of $264.3 million (up 20.0%)&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
<li>Underlying return on equity of 13.5% (flat on pcp)</li>
</ol>
<p align="left"><b>Updated FY26 total expense growth guidance <i>&nbsp;</i></b></p>
<p>FY26 expense growth guidance, excluding ASIC inquiry costs, is updated to be between 13% and 15%. Including ASIC Inquiry costs, FY26 total expense growth guidance is updated to be between 20% and 23%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A key driver for the increase in total expenses has been our decision to make further upgrades to the capacity and capability of resources to uplift risk management and modernise and support our major technology platforms. This reassessment of our investment requirements for key strategic priorities was informed by findings from the Inquiry Panel&rsquo;s interim report.</p>
<p>Slower uptake of e-statements at a time of high trading volumes has also contributed to the increase in expense guidance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The development of the Commitments plan is focused on providing the details to the strategic package of actions agreed with ASIC. The plan includes ASX&rsquo;s proposed approach to key elements such as the reset of the Accelerate Program and the measures we will take to enhance the independence of the clearing and settlement facility licensee boards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ASIC Inquiry related costs are now expected to be at the upper end of the previously provided range for FY26 inclusive of the expected Commitments plan costs. Other one-off costs impacting the FY26 guidance include an increase in expected legal costs in relation to ongoing matters.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>FY27 total expense growth guidance will be provided at our June 2026 Investor Forum.&nbsp;</p>

<p>1H26 operating revenue of $602.8 million reflected strong growth of 11.2% compared to the prior corresponding period. ASX generated revenue growth across all four businesses with strong volumes for cash market trading, clearing and settlement and interest rate futures during the period.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Total expenses, excluding ASIC Inquiry related costs, were $247.0 million, up 12.1% on pcp. This was driven by investment in key programs, including Accelerate and delivery of the technology modernisation program, and a higher depreciation and amortisation charge. Total expenses, including ASIC Inquiry related costs, were $264.3 million, up 20.0%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Underlying net profit after tax of $263.6 million was up 3.9% compared to pcp and statutory NPAT of $263.6 million was up by 8.3% with no significant items reported in 1H26.</p>
<p>Underlying return on equity generated in the period was 13.5%, flat to pcp, reflecting the increase in underlying NPAT offset by higher shareholder&rsquo;s net equity. On 15 December 2025 ASX noted changes to our capital requirements to meet an additional capital charge imposed by ASIC. At the time we stated the increased regulatory capital requirement would impact underlying ROE, with ASX&rsquo;s medium term target range now between 12.5% and 14.0%, having previously been between 13.0% and 14.5%</p>
<p><b>ASX Limited CEO and Managing Director Helen Lofthouse said: </b>&ldquo;Since announcing our five-year strategy in mid-2023, we have been making significant investments in ASX to modernise our technology and secure our pathway to long-term sustainable growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ASIC Inquiry Panel&rsquo;s interim report underscores an even greater urgency to the transformation we are pursuing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alongside the reset of the Accelerate Program and the measures to enhance the independence of the clearing and settlement facilities, we have been reviewing key areas of our strategic investment to support how we address the spirit of the Inquiry&rsquo;s findings. This has underpinned our forecasting activity and contributed to the expense update we&rsquo;ve provided today. Central in our assessment has been ASX&rsquo;s role as an operator of critical market infrastructure that must perform to a very high standard, always striving for excellence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our unaudited results show ASX has experienced a period of strong cash market trading activity and demand for interest rate futures, and we felt it was important to release these additional figures to allow a fuller picture to be considered when providing today&rsquo;s update to expense guidance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We recognise it is a privilege to provide these critical services for our customers and the market, and we are committed to strengthening ASX for tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="left"><b>1H26 results announcement </b></p>
<p>Further details will be provided at ASX&rsquo;s 1H26 results announcement on 12 February 2026.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC is inviting feedback on its proposal to extend relief for superannuation trustees from complying with application form and cooling-off period requirements during an intra-fund transfer.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2016L00205/latest/text"><em>ASIC Corporations (Superannuation: Accrued Default Amount and Intra-Fund Transfers) Instrument 2016/64</em></a>&nbsp;is due to expire on 1 April 2026. The relief will be extended until 1 April 2031.<br /><br />We have assessed that the relief is operating effectively and continues to form a necessary part of the legislative framework.<br /><br />In continuing the relief, ASIC proposes to exclude relief for movements of accrued default amounts to MySuper products, which is now redundant. We will also make minor and technical amendments to simplify the relief.</p>
<h2>Providing feedback</h2>
<p>Please send your feedback to <a href="mailto:rri.consultation@asic.gov.au">rri.consultation@asic.gov.au</a>&nbsp;by 5pm AEDT on 18 February 2026.</p>

<title>SEC Charges ADM And Three Former Executives With Accounting And Disclosure Fraud - ADM Credited For Cooperation And Significant Remediation</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-charges-adm-and-three-former-executives-with-accounting-and-disclosure-fraud-2026128/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-charges-adm-and-three-former-executives-with-accounting-and-disclosure-fraud-2026128/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed settled charges against Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (ADM) and its former executives, Vince Macciocchi and Ray Young, and a litigated action against its former executive Vikram Luthar, for&nbsp;materially inflating the performance of a key ADM business segment, Nutrition, which ADM touted to investors as an important driver of the company&rsquo;s overall growth.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint against Luthar alleges that&nbsp;he directed &ldquo;adjustments&rdquo; to Nutrition&rsquo;s transactions with other ADM business segments when Nutrition was falling short of its operating profit targets for fiscal years 2021 and 2022. According to the complaint, the adjustments included retroactive rebates and price changes not customarily available to ADM&rsquo;s third-party customers that were essentially one-sided transfers of operating profit to Nutrition, with the goal of making it appear that Nutrition was meeting the 15% to 20% per year&nbsp;operating profit growth Luthar and other ADM executives projected to investors.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s settled order against ADM, Macciocchi, and Young finds that Macciocchi and Luthar led efforts to identify and structure adjustments for fiscal years 2021 and 2022, and that Young negligently approved improper adjustments for fiscal years 2019 and 2021. These adjustments also included retroactive rebates and price changes, were targeted to specific dollar amounts to hit Nutrition&rsquo;s operating profit goals or mask a shortfall, and were not provided to third parties, according to the order.</p>
<p>The SEC considered ADM&rsquo;s cooperation and significant remedial measures in accepting its settlement offer. Specifically, the company conducted an internal investigation, voluntarily reported its findings to the staff, and provided the staff with additional analyses from an outside accounting expert.&nbsp; ADM&rsquo;s remedial measures included implementing new internal accounting controls around intersegment transactions, amending its policies and procedures, and testing the effectiveness of its new controls, among other things.</p>
<p>The order creates a Fair Fund to distribute the ordered monetary relief to investors harmed by the violations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Transparent and honest disclosure are key to maintaining market integrity, so when ADM misled its investors, the SEC stepped in to protect them and the market,&rdquo; said Judge Margaret A. Ryan, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;The SEC is steadfast in its commitment to rooting out fraud and holding accountable wrongdoers, while also engaging market participants constructively to ensure the right outcomes are achieved in a timely and fair manner. In this matter, we credit ADM&rsquo;s cooperation and its efforts to avoid future accounting and disclosure violations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The complaint alleges, and the order finds, that the adjustments rendered ADM&rsquo;s annual and quarterly reports false and misleading because the adjustments resulted in transactions inconsistent with ADM&rsquo;s representation that intersegment transactions were recorded at amounts &ldquo;approximating market.&rdquo; Further, the order finds that ADM overstated Nutrition&rsquo;s operating profit for fiscal years 2019, 2021, and 2022, the third quarter of 2019, and all quarters in 2021 as a result of the adjustments.</p>
<p>The complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, charges Luthar with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, aiding and abetting ADM&rsquo;s violations of the antifraud, reporting, books and records, and internal accounting control provisions of the federal securities laws, and failing to reimburse ADM for certain executive compensation as required. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, an officer and director bar, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and reimbursement of certain executive compensation to ADM pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that ADM, Macciocchi, and Young violated the antifraud, reporting, internal accounting controls, and books and records provisions of the federal securities laws, and that Macciocchi and Young caused certain of ADM&rsquo;s violations.&nbsp;Without admitting or denying the findings, ADM, Macciocchi, and Young agreed to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of the relevant provisions of the federal securities laws, and ADM has voluntarily undertaken to cooperate fully with the Commission in the litigation and any other proceedings related to the matters described in the order. ADM agreed to pay a $40,000,000 civil penalty, Macciocchi agreed to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest totaling $404,343 and a civil penalty of $125,000, and Young agreed to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest totaling $575,610 and a civil penalty of $75,000. Macciocchi also agreed to a three-year officer and director bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p>EDX Markets, a leading digital asset firm that combines an institutional-only trading venue with a central clearinghouse, today announced the launch of EDX FlowConnect&trade;, a crypto-as-a-service (CaaS) offering that enables firms to quickly and securely launch crypto trading products for their customers.</p>
<p>EDX FlowConnect&trade; provides access to institutional-grade liquidity, trading infrastructure, clearing and settlement. The fully configurable platform supports trading in spot and perpetual contracts, third-party clearing and stablecoin on-ramp/off-ramp workflows. The offering enables firms to bring a full suite of crypto products to market without the cost or complexity of building and operating their own infrastructure. Clients can choose from the out-of-the-box turnkey solution or a &ldquo;bring-your-own-provider&rdquo; approach &ndash; making it the market&rsquo;s only fully flexible CaaS product. Additionally, by operating exclusively as an institutional-only trading venue, EDX serves as an unconflicted partner for retail firms.</p>
<p>Built on EDX&rsquo;s proprietary matching engine and clearing system, FlowConnect&trade; delivers microsecond-level performance to its deep, aggregated liquidity backed by leading traditional finance and crypto-native market makers. The platform offers flexible connectivity options via the cloud or traditional data center and supports trading and settlement across stablecoins, crypto and other eligible collateral types.</p>
<p>EDX FlowConnect&trade; incorporates advanced risk management and security features, including:</p>
<ul>

<li>Advanced market surveillance and a standardized rulebook</li>
<li>Pre-trade risk controls, including max order size, duplicate order checks, price banding and cancel-on-disconnect</li>
<li>Automated post-trade risk management, including configurable margin calls, liquidations and auto-deleveraging</li>
<li>Bankruptcy-remote collateral and settlement accounts with full subaccount segregation</li>
</ul>
<p><br />&ldquo;Institutions are increasingly demanding infrastructure that reflects the standards of traditional financial markets, and FlowConnect&trade; is designed to help firms quickly launch crypto trading for their clients while meeting those expectations,&rdquo; said Tony Acu&ntilde;a-Rohter, CEO of EDX Markets. &ldquo;By combining established market structure principles with flexible, ready-to-launch capabilities, FlowConnect&trade; enables firms to bring crypto offerings to market faster while operating within the standards institutions rely on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As institutional participation in digital asset derivatives accelerates globally, the market is demanding not just access &mdash; but dependable controls, resilient settlement frameworks, and infrastructure that supports scalable growth,&rdquo; said Kai Kono, CEO of EDXM International. &ldquo;FlowConnect&trade; is built to help qualified institutions and partners deploy spot, perpetuals and multi-asset offerings with robust risk controls, strong market structure discipline and institutional-grade collateral &mdash; enabling faster launches without compromising on governance and safety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>EDX FlowConnect&trade; is highly customizable, enabling clients to define trading pairs, margin and liquidation parameters, leverage levels and fee structures. Firms can also launch fully branded white-labeled crypto exchanges, manage client sub-accounts and scale their offerings as demand evolves, all within a transparent, non-conflicted model in which EDX does not compete for retail flow. EDX&rsquo;s dedicated 24/7 global support team will provide high-touch onboarding, integration and ongoing operational support as firms adopt the offering worldwide.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li>
<div class="elementToProof"><span><i>New premium service positions Puro.earth as leading in the development of on-demand issuance for CDR</i></span></div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="elementToProof"><span><i>Builds on MyPuro 2.0 and Puro dMRV Connect API to improve liquidity, predictability and operational readiness for industrial-scale carbon removal projects.</i></span></div>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="elementToProof">
<div class="elementToProof" id="o_wblog_post_content">
<div class="elementToProof">
<div class="elementToProof"><span>Puro.earth, the leading crediting platform for engineered carbon dioxide removal (CDR), today announced the launch of Puro Issuance Plus, a new premium service designed to help scaled suppliers bring verified carbon removals to market more frequently through the issuance of CO₂ Removal Certificates (CORCs).</span></div>
<div class="elementToProof"><span><br /></span></div>
<div class="elementToProof"><span>Puro Issuance Plus enables more frequent, batch-based issuance cycles when suppliers need them, reducing the time between production and credit availability. By shortening issuance cycles, the service helps suppliers convert removed CO₂ into revenue faster, supporting improved cash flow, planning certainty and market responsiveness. With Puro Issuance Plus, Puro.earth is leading the carbon removal market towards on-demand issuance.</span></div>
<div class="elementToProof"><span><br /></span></div>
<div class="elementToProof"><span>Issuances remain strictly based on completed third-party audits and verified volumes, with no changes to Puro.earth&rsquo;s certification, verification or crediting requirements.</span></div>
<div class="elementToProof"><span><br /></span></div>
<div class="elementToProof"><span>The launch builds directly on the recent releases of MyPuro 2.0 and the Puro dMRV Connect API, further strengthening Puro.earth&rsquo;s infrastructure for scaled carbon removal.</span></div>
<div class="elementToProof"><span><br /></span></div>
<div class="elementToProof"><span><i>&ldquo;Predictability and timing matter just as much as volume in a maturing market,&rdquo;</i></span><span>&nbsp;said&nbsp;</span><b>Jan-Willem Bode, President of Puro.earth.</b><span>&nbsp;</span><span><i>&ldquo;Puro Issuance Plus is about aligning issuance more closely with how mature suppliers actually operate - shortening the path from production to issued CORCs, and ultimately to revenue."</i></span></div>
<div class="elementToProof"><span><i><br /></i></span></div>
<div class="elementToProof"><b>From Digital Infrastructure to Issuance Readiness</b></div>
<div class="elementToProof"><span>Puro Issuance Plus is enabled by MyPuro 2.0 and Puro.earth&rsquo;s expanding digital products, including Puro dMRV Connect - an API that enables dMRV data flows</span><span>.</span><span>&nbsp;By combining structured data submission, audit readiness and streamlined issuance workflows, the service reduces friction between submission, verification and issuance to accelerate credit availability while maintaining Puro.earth&rsquo;s high-integrity standards.</span></div>
<div class="elementToProof"><span><br /></span></div>
<div class="elementToProof"><b>Who Puro Issuance Plus is for</b></div>
<div class="elementToProof"><span>Puro Issuance Plus is available to suppliers that meet defined eligibility criteria, including:</span></div>
<div class="elementToProof"><span><br /></span></div>
<ul>
<li>Industrial-scale production, with a minimum issuance threshold of 1,000 CORCs per audit</li>
<li>Consistent operational and audit performance</li>
<li>Full compliance with Puro.earth&rsquo;s quality, verification and data requirements</li>
</ul>
<div class="elementToProof"><span>The service is particularly relevant for suppliers seeking to optimise liquidity, improve issuance predictability, and build readiness for future real-time issuance models.</span></div>

<p class="text-align-justify"><span>The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor, has signed a&nbsp;Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)&nbsp;with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to facilitate cooperation and exchange of information for the recognition of central counterparties (CCPs) established in India and supervised by RBI.</span></p>

<title>Adaptive Announces Aeron Sequencer: Revolutionising The Architecture And Scalability Of High Performance Trading Systems</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/adaptive-announces-aeron-sequencer-revolutionising-the-architecture-and-scalabi-2026127/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li>Aeron Sequencer, currently in late‑stage development, is designed to enable the delivery of resilient, highly performant distributed trading systems at scale.</li>
<li>It provides out-of-the-box application infrastructure, significantly accelerating and de-risking development of large-scale, complex platforms for broker-dealers and exchanges.</li>
</ul>
<p>Adaptive, the leader in custom trading technology solutions, today announced it is developing Aeron Sequencer, a software infrastructure platform designed to tackle the most persistent challenges in modern trading system development: consistency, scalability, performance, and availability.</p>
<p>Delivering on these requirements demands niche expertise, large-scale investment, and extended delivery timelines. When done poorly, the consequences can be severe&mdash;from regulatory compliance issues to an inability to compete. With the growing demands of 24/7 markets, these challenges are becoming more complex, forcing financial firms to confront a critical issue: their most talented engineers are spending less time on business innovation and more time on foundational infrastructure.</p>
<p>This is where sequenced architectures excel. Unlike some legacy or microservice architectures that use an eventually consistent paradigm, sequenced architectures are a superior way to build institutional trading systems because they are built on a single, global sequence of events. This approach simplifies development, ensures consistency and auditability.</p>
<p>Aeron Sequencer is a great fit for the needs of broker-dealers and exchanges, providing out-of-the-box application infrastructure to deliver complex, high-performance platforms at speed. By cleanly separating infrastructure from business functionality, Aeron Sequencer enables faster delivery, reduces operational risk, and helps firms remain competitive in an increasingly demanding, always-on market.<br />At its core, Aeron Sequencer uses a replicated state machine architecture with a globally ordered, highly available message log. It&rsquo;s capable of processing millions of messages per second at microsecond latency, freeing development teams from the complexity of building and operating this foundational layer themselves.</p>
<p>Key benefits and features that are being developed include:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Performance and reliability:</span>&nbsp;Processes millions of messages per second at microsecond latency, with automatic failover and 24/7 operation.</li>
<li><span>Consistency and auditability:</span>&nbsp;Designed to provide global ordering and a persistent audit trail for compliance and regulatory reporting.</li>
<li><span>Deployment and flexibility:</span>&nbsp;Supports both cloud-native and on-premises environments, with active/active and active/passive availability modes. Systems can operate truly 24&times;365 with zero downtime for releases.</li>
<li><span>Developer productivity:</span>&nbsp;Isolates business logic into separate services, allowing development teams to own their specific domains and release on their own schedules.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Matt Barrett, CEO at Adaptive</span>, said:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Markets are in a period of rapid change, as risk and volatility intensify and changes to global market structure look increasingly likely. Aeron Sequencer is being developed to empower organisations such as broker dealers, exchanges and others, to meet these challenges by de-risking complex tech infrastructure projects and empowering development teams. By providing best-in-class quality attributes for resiliency, performance, and consistency, we enable our clients to own their innovation and build differentiated trading solutions that allow them to capitalize on increasing trading volumes and scale in response to a changing market.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><span>Martin Thompson, Co-creator of Aeron and Chief Architect at Adaptive</span>, adds:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Building resilient distributed systems at scale is a huge challenge. Aeron Sequencer is a game-changer because it brings replicated state machine architectures to capital markets, offering a complete solution for teams to collaborate independently, streamline testing, and ensure total ordering and auditability&mdash;all without the complexity of traditional distributed infrastructure. It&rsquo;s built on proven Aeron technology, already trusted by dozens of leading capital markets firms, so teams can build and deploy with confidence.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><span>Availability &amp; Contact Information:</span><br />Aeron Sequencer is in late-stage development for deployment in both cloud and on-premises environments.<br />To express interest in early‑access, join the waitlist: visit&nbsp;<a href="https://aeron.io/aeron-sequencer" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://aeron.io/aeron-sequencer</a></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">
<p>ACER issues today its <a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsDAQdUWFVUB0xcVwAFHVZcA1AdUwlTBBoMUQRWBQYAD1NXB1QdUlwAVFpUBFodBwBXUB0GClIHGldVB1QZVVZTD1IEB1hVV1NTRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">guidance</a>&nbsp;on  the information to be voluntarily submitted for the monitoring of  operational reliability performance indicators related to cybersecurity  in the electricity sector, under the <a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsGBlADBQJSB0xdBlFRHVYLAAcdCwkHVhpTVVYGDVVXBwVQVVUdUlwAVFpUBFodBwBXUB0GClIHGldVB1QZVVZTD1IEB1hVV1NTRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Cybersecurity Network Code</a>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Who is this guidance for?</span></p>
<p>This guidance is addressed to stakeholders in the electricity sector,  including transmission and distribution system operators (TSOs and  DSOs), generators, organised markets, nominated electricity market  operators (NEMOs) and balancing responsible parties, as well as  providers of critical information and communication technology (ICT)  services and managed security services.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why does it matter?</span></p>
<p>The operational reliability performance indicators for cybersecurity  will measure how effectively electricity sector companies protect their  digital systems and mitigate cybersecurity risks to cross-border  electricity flows. They will track statistical data on high and  critical-impact cyber-attacks, reportable cyber-threats and exploited  unpatched vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>By submitting the requested data, stakeholders will allow ACER to  monitor trends and assess how cybersecurity performance evolves across  the EU electricity sector.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What information is ACER requesting?</span></p>
<p>ACER is requesting the following statistical information, as defined  by the operational reliability performance indicators listed in the  guidance:</p>
<ul>
<li>annual number of reportable cyber threats;</li>
<li>annual number of reportable cyber-attacks; and</li>
<li>annual number of exploited unpatched (zero day) vulnerabilities.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What&rsquo;s the timeline to submit the information?</span></p>
<p>Starting in 2027, ACER will open a submission window once every three  years. In the first submission window in 2027, ACER will request data  for 2026. From 2030 onwards, each submission will cover the three  preceding years.</p>
<p>Unless communicated otherwise, the submission window will be open each reporting year from 15 January to 1 March.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the next steps? </span></p>
<p>To facilitate data collection, ACER will provide access to a secure  online tool. More detailed instructions will be made available prior to  the first submission window.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, ACER will use this collected data (after careful  aggregation to protect sensitive information) as an input to its  triannual reporting, supporting EU-level monitoring and informing future  efforts to strengthen the EU cyber resilience.</p>
<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsDAQdUWFVUB0xcVwAFHVZcA1AdUwlTBBoMUQRWBQYAD1NXB1QdUlwAVFpUBFodBwBXUB0GClIHGldVB1QZVVZTD1IEB1hVV1NTRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Access the guidance.</a></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The FCA has launched a review into the implications of advanced AI on consumers, retail financial markets and regulators.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.62857;">The </span><a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/calls-input/review-long-term-impact-ai-retail-financial-services-mills-review" title="Review into the long-term impact of AI on retail financial services (The Mills Review) "><span style="line-height: 1.62857;">Review</span></a><span style="line-height: 1.62857;"> will be led by Sheldon Mills and builds on the FCA&rsquo;s existing work on AI. This includes its </span><a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/feedback-statements/fs23-6-artifical-intelligence-machine-learning" title="FS23/6: Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning"><span style="line-height: 1.62857;">AI Discussion Paper</span></a><span style="line-height: 1.62857;">, </span><a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/techsprints/ai-sprint-summary" title="AI Sprint summary"><span style="line-height: 1.62857;">AI Sprint</span></a><span style="line-height: 1.62857;">, and </span><a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/innovation/ai-lab" title="AI Lab"><span style="line-height: 1.62857;">AI Lab</span></a><span style="line-height: 1.62857;"> including AI Live Testing and its groundbreaking Supercharged Sandbox supported by NVIDIA.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.62857;">AI  is already embedded across financial services. Rapid advances in  generative, agentic and emerging forms of AI mean the next phase of  change could be profound, having the power to reshape markets, change  the way firms compete and how consumers use retail financial services.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.62857;">Sheldon Mills said:</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.62857;">'AI  is already shaping financial services, but its longer-term effects may  be more far-reaching. This review will consider how emerging uses of AI  could influence consumers, markets and firms, looking towards 2030 and  beyond.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.62857;">'By taking a  forward-looking view, the review will help the FCA continue to support  innovation while promoting the safe and trusted adoption of AI in retail  financial services.'</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.62857;">The FCA is seeking views on 4 interrelated themes:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.62857;"><strong>How AI could evolve in the future</strong>, including the development of more autonomous and agentic systems.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.62857;"><strong>How these developments could affect markets and firms</strong>, including changes to competition and market structure and UK competitiveness.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.62857;"><strong>The impact on consumers</strong>, including how consumers will be influenced by AI but also influence financial markets through new expectations.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.62857;"><strong>How financial regulators may need to evolve</strong> to continue ensuring that retail financial markets work well.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.62857;">While  wholesale markets and broader societal impacts are out of scope, the  Review recognises that developments in these areas may indirectly  influence retail financial services and will be considered where  relevant. The FCA is also separately doing extensive work on the impact  of AI in wholesale markets, in particular through our live testing  partnership.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.62857;">Feedback  will shape a series of recommendations to be reported to the FCA Board  in summer 2026, informing how the FCA can guide and respond to AI-driven  transformation. This will culminate in an external publication.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.62857;">The deadline for comments is <strong>Tuesday 24 February 2026</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.62857;">Any other contributions can be sent to us at </span><a href="mailto: TheMillsReview@fca.org.uk"><span style="line-height: 1.62857;">TheMillsReview@fca.org.uk</span></a><span style="line-height: 1.62857;">.</span></p>

<li>The FCA&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/innovation/ai-approach" title="AI and the FCA: our approach">approach to artificial intelligence</a> is grounded in its principles-based regulatory framework, including the  Consumer Duty.

<li>The FCA launched its <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/innovation/ai-lab" title="AI Lab">AI Lab</a> in 2024 to deepen understanding of AI technologies and their  implications for financial services. The Lab works with industry,  academia, and other regulators to explore responsible AI adoption.</li>

<title>Avelacom Expands Access To Argentina’s Capital Markets For Banks And Financial Institutions - Avelacom Partners With Bolsas y Mercados Argentinos SA (BYMA), Launches A New Buenos Aires PoP, And Builds New Low Latency Routes Across The Latin American Continent</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Avelacom, the global provider of ultra-low latency network and infrastructure solutions, is expanding its presence in Argentina, enabling banks and other financial institutions to connect directly to Argentina&rsquo;s equities and derivatives markets for real-time market data and order execution.</span></p>
<p><span>As part of this expansion, Avelacom is launching a new PoP at BYMA&rsquo;s data center in Buenos Aires and adding new low latency routes across Latin America&rsquo;s west coast (via Chile) and east coast (via Brazil), providing fast and resilient access to the US and other global markets.</span></p>
<p><span>Avelacom has operated in Latin America since 2021, initially supporting global market making firms in expanding their trading activities on the Brazilian Exchange (B3). The new Buenos Aires PoP and expanded regional routes further strengthen Avelacom&rsquo;s connectivity footprint and open access to Argentina&rsquo;s rapidly developing capital markets.</span></p>
<p><em><span>Comments Aleksey Larichev, CEO of Avelacom: &ldquo;Argentina is our natural next step in strengthening our presence in the region. Our clients are showing increasing interest in arbitrage and market making strategies involving Argentina, Brazil and the US. With our new PoP at BYMA and expanded regional routes, we are enabling the lowest latency to BYMA&rsquo;s matching engine and supporting the growth of cross-market trading across the region. Our goal for the next year is to interconnect Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Peru, giving even more opportunities to expand their trading strategies using our ultra-low latency infrastructure.&rdquo;</span></em></p>
<p><span>In recent years, trading volumes on the BYMA exchange have risen significantly, showing increased investor engagement and liquidity. In 2025, fresh daily records were hit in number of trades (+45% yoy) and number of orders (+58% yoy) on the exchange. At the same time, the S&amp;P Merval Index (Argentina's flagship equity index) has seen strong nominal gains, up over 1300% in the last three years. The Argentine capital market is still significantly underpenetrated. In 2024, the market cap-to-GDP ratio was 14%, half of the Latin American average (28%).</span></p>
<p><em><span>Comments Mar&iacute;a Jos&eacute; Del Boca, Chief Product &amp; Client Officer at BYMA: &ldquo;Avelacom&rsquo;s arrival into our ecosystem supports a new wave of international clients interested in trading Argentina&rsquo;s securities, as well as local participants seeking to enhance their strategies across Latin America. This partnership aligns with our long-term vision to position Argentina as a market equipped with sophisticated infrastructure, including low latency connectivity and co-location solutions.&rdquo;</span></em></p>

<title>ECB Paves Way For Acceptance Of DLT-Based Assets As Eligible Eurosystem Collateral</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li>Eurosystem to accept marketable assets issued in central securities depositories (CSDs) using distributed ledger technology (DLT) as eligible collateral for Eurosystem credit operations as of 30 March 2026</li>
<li>Further work is exploring ways to expand eligibility to assets issued and settled entirely on DLT networks</li>
<li>Decision reflects Eurosystem&rsquo;s commitment to innovation and fosters technological progress in European financial markets</li>
</ul>
<p>The Eurosystem will accept marketable assets issued in CSDs using DLT-based services as eligible collateral for Eurosystem credit operations as of 30 March 2026. Like other marketable assets, they must comply with&nbsp;<a class="link-inline arrow" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/mopo/coll/standards/marketable/html/index.en.html">Eurosystem collateral eligibility criteria</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a class="link-inline arrow" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/mopo/coll/coll/html/index.en.html">collateral management requirements</a>. These criteria include availability for settlement in&nbsp;<a class="link-inline arrow" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/mopo/coll/coll/eligiblesss/html/index.en.html">eligible securities settlement systems</a>, which must be compliant with the CSD Regulation and reachable via TARGET2-Securities (T2S). These assets will be mobilised as collateral in line with the Eurosystem&rsquo;s existing collateral management practices, like any other marketable asset.</p>
<p>The Eurosystem will continue to align its collateral framework and collateral management practices with technological advancements in financial markets and support the adoption of innovative solutions, while upholding the principles of adequacy of collateral, safety, efficiency and a level playing field.</p>
<p>To this end, the Eurosystem has launched an ambitious work plan to explore if, how and under what criteria assets issued using DLT and not represented in eligible securities settlement systems could become eligible and be mobilised as Eurosystem collateral in the future. To accelerate the transformation of Eurosystem monetary policy implementation for the digital era, a staggered approach is envisaged. Under this approach, subsets of DLT-based assets could gradually become eligible and be mobilised. The approach will take into account market developments, in particular regarding the issuance of DLT-based assets, as well as legal and regulatory developments, for example in the CSD Regulation, the DLT Pilot Regime Regulation, the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCAR) and securities laws of jurisdictions in the euro area.</p>
<p>These decisions reflect the Eurosystem&rsquo;s continued commitment to encouraging innovation and technological progress, thus enhancing market efficiency, and contributing to the integration of European capital markets.</p>

<p>Euronext, the leading European market infrastructure, today announces the launch of the 2026 edition of its pre-IPO programme IPOready. Building on its unparalleled track record, IPOready is the largest and most comprehensive pre-IPO programme in Europe, now entering its eleventh year.&nbsp;</p>

This trend reflects Euronext&rsquo;s position as Europe&rsquo;s leading exchange for Tech listings, with over 700 technology companies listed and 36% of new listings in 2025 coming from the sector.</p>
<p>Since its inception, IPOready has supported over 1,200 alumni, resulting in 39 successful listings on Euronext markets. These companies have raised more than &euro;1.8 billion at listing, achieving a combined market capitalisation of nearly &euro;7 billion. In 2025 alone, seven IPOready alumni listed on Euronext markets.</p>
<p><span>IPOready Defence, a new dedicated track for aerospace and defence companies&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>IPOready offers a tailored six-month training programme providing participants with a comprehensive roadmap to IPO readiness, with expert-led workshops covering the IPO process, equity story, financial communication, legal considerations, corporate governance and post-listing obligations. Companies also benefit from extensive individual coaching sessions with audit firms, lawyers, communication specialists and investor relations specialists providing customised advice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building on Euronext&rsquo;s set of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.euronext.com/en/about/media/euronext-press-releases/euronext-strengthens-its-support-for-european-strategic">new ESG focused initiatives</a>&nbsp;designed to strengthen Europe&rsquo;s strategic autonomy and technological sovereignty, IPOready 2026 introduces a dedicated track for the more than 30 aerospace and defence companies participating in this year&rsquo;s programme. The track will feature an aerospace and defence IPO case study, sectorial workshops and networking opportunities with IPOready peers and Euronext-listed aerospace and defence companies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>IPOready also welcomes the European Investment Bank (EIB) as a global partner, aligned with Euronext in supporting companies to access capital and scale their growth. The EIB joins INSEAD, Euronext&rsquo;s renowned academic partner and global leader in executive education, and a network of 80+ local partners and sponsors.</p>
<p><span>The leading equity listing venue in Europe</span></p>
<p>In 2025, Euronext confirmed its position as the leading European primary markets venue with over 1,900 issuers representing &euro;6.8 trillion in aggregated market capitalisation on its single stock market covering eight European countries (including Greece, following the&nbsp;successful acquisition of a majority stake in the Athens Stock Exchange in November 2025). Euronext is the venue of choice for ambitious global champions on its markets, having welcomed 42% of international equity listings<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;across Europe in 2025.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://bisonapp.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><b>BISON</b></a><b>, the crypto trading platform backed by Boerse Stuttgart Group, has surpassed one million active users - underscoring its position as a leading crypto trading platform &ldquo;made in Germany.&rdquo; The combination of fee-free trading and regulated custody makes BISON the platform of choice for anyone looking to invest in cryptocurrencies simply and reliably and securely hold their coins in Germany.</b></p>
<p>More than one million active users trust BISON for crypto trading and regulated custody. With this milestone, the trading platform, part of Boerse Stuttgart Group, strengthens its role as Germany&rsquo;s leading provider for secure, regulated access to the crypto market - backed by more than 160 years of financial market expertise and the largest digital business built by any European exchange group. The platform delivers a regulated and secure gateway to the crypto market in Germany, offering a simple and trustworthy way for users to enter the world of crypto.</p>
<p>BISON continues to pursue not only growth but also the highest security standards: its crypto assets are held in fiduciary custody by Boerse Stuttgart Digital Custody GmbH, a regulated subsidiary of Boerse Stuttgart Group. The company is headquartered in Germany and became the first German crypto provider to receive the MiCAR license from the country&rsquo;s financial regulatory authority (BaFin). In addition, the platform holds ISO certification, includes comprehensive insurance for coins in cooperation with Munich Re Group, and uses a multi-layered security system.</p>
<p>Compared to the previous year, BISON grew its number of active users by around 13 percent. Demand for secure, regulated, fee-free crypto trading in Germany remained strong. Especially on days when Bitcoin reached new all-time highs, BISON recorded up to six times more new customer registrations than on typical trading days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we founded BISON in 2019, crypto was still completely unknown to many people in Germany. At the time, Bitcoin was around &euro;2,900. Today, crypto&rsquo;s become an integral part of the financial world. More than a million people use BISON now, which marks a major milestone in our mission to advance cryptocurrency adoption in Germany,&rdquo; says Dr. Ulli Spankowski, Co-Founder &amp; CEO of BISON. &ldquo;The steady growth in our user numbers shows that interest in regulated crypto offerings in Germany continues to rise. From day one, our goal has been to make access to cryptocurrencies simple, secure, and reliable, and we remain committed to that same direction. The past seven years have been a success story shaped by the entire team.&rdquo;</p>

<title>ASIC: BPS Financial To Pay $14 Million In Penalties Over Crypto Qoin Wallet</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-bps-financial-to-pay-14-million-in-penalties-over-crypto-qoin-wallet-2026127/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-bps-financial-to-pay-14-million-in-penalties-over-crypto-qoin-wallet-2026127/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Federal Court has found BPS Financial Pty Ltd (<strong>BPS Financial</strong>) must pay $14 million in pecuniary penalties over its promotion and operation of its &lsquo;Qoin Wallet&rsquo; crypto product.</p>
<p>BPS Financial promoted the Qoin Wallet as a non-cash payment facility linked to a digital crypto token called &lsquo;Qoin&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In 2024, the Federal Court found that BPS Financial engaged in unlicensed conduct over almost three years by issuing and providing financial advice about the Qoin Wallet without holding an Australian Financial Services License. The Court also found that BPS Financial engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct when it made several false and misleading representations about the Qoin Wallet.</p>
<p>In 2025, the Full Federal Court found that BPS Financial engaged in unlicensed conduct over an additional 10-month period because BPS could not rely on the &lsquo;authorised representative&rsquo; exemption under the Corporations Act when issuing the Qoin Wallet.</p>
<p>The Court has today ordered BPS Financial is to pay total penalties of $14 million, made up of:</p>
<ul>
<li>$2 million for unlicensed conduct, and</li>
<li>$12 million for misleading and deceptive conduct in connection with making false and misleading statements.</li>
</ul>
<p>ASIC Chair Joe Longo said the outcome sent a strong message to the crypto industry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The size of these penalties underscores the seriousness of BPS Financial&rsquo;s misconduct and is intended to send a strong message of deterrence to the digital asset industry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Given the nature of these products, providers must have the appropriate licenses and authorisations, and investors must be able to make decisions based on clear and correct statements, especially as crypto products can be highly volatile, inherently risky and complex.</p>
<p>&lsquo;ASIC will not hesitate to act where investors are potentially exposed to unlicensed financial advice, misleading and deceptive conduct, and risky products.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The digital asset industry is well on notice that its products will continue to be a focus for ASIC. We want to encourage innovation and new services for consumers, but not at their expense,&rsquo; the Chair said.</p>
<p>In delivering her judgement, Justice Downes stated BPS &lsquo;engaged in serious and unlawful misconduct during the period from January 2020 until mid-2023&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Her Honour said the $2 million penalty for the unlicensed conduct achieves the primary purpose of deterrence, both to BPS and to the digital asset industry as a whole.</p>
<p>Her Honour also said the cumulative penalty of $12 million for the misleading representations &lsquo;properly reflects the mitigating factors while also accounting for the objective recklessness of the conduct, involvement of senior management, the serious and misleading nature of the representations, the characteristics of the target audience and BPS&rsquo;s inadequate compliance systems&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In addition to the pecuniary penalties, the Court also ordered:</p>
<ul>
<li>BPS be permanently restrained from making any false or misleading representation concerning the number of holders of the Qoin Wallet, the ability of Qoin Tokens to be exchanged for fiat or other crypto-assets, and that the Qoin Wallet has been officially approved and/or officially registered,</li>
<li>BPS be restrained for 10 years from carrying on a financial services business without holding an Australian financial services licence,</li>
<li>BPS publish an adverse publicity notice on the Qoin Wallet application and take steps to request the publisher of the &lsquo;qoin.com&rsquo; website to also publish an adverse publicity notice, and</li>
<li>BPS pay most of the costs incurred by ASIC for the proceeding.</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC is tracking major shifts across Australia&rsquo;s financial system as pressures on consumers, markets and businesses intensify.</p>
<p>In 2026, continued cost‑of‑living strains for vulnerable Australians, rising debt and ongoing geopolitical tensions are adding volatility and uncertainty. At the same time, rapid advances in AI are transforming financial services&mdash;and fuelling a surge in AI‑powered cybercrime that is testing the resilience of companies and undermining public trust in AI‑driven decisions.</p>
<p>Market structure is continuing to evolve, with private markets expanding and digitalisation accelerating. Meanwhile, changes to ASX governance requirements may reshape how listed companies operate, influencing transparency and market confidence.</p>
<p>Global regulatory settings are also diverging, creating growing fragmentation that makes compliance more complex and increases the risk of uneven consumer protections.</p>
<p>These system‑wide forces cut across all sectors ASIC regulates.</p>
<p>Highlighting the key issues for 2026 helps direct attention to where risks are most likely to emerge and underscores where ASIC is focused to safeguard trust, integrity and confidence in Australia&rsquo;s financial system.</p>
<p><em>The issues outlined are not ranked.</em></p>
<h2>Increased retail client exposure to private credit markets</h2>
<p>Retail access to private credit and other private market products is expanding, with investment thresholds as low as ~$2,000, and investment platforms (including superannuation) enabling participation in inherently less transparent and in some case more complex products.</p>
<p>This raises risks of mis‑selling, unsuitable product selection, and decision‑making without adequate disclosure. As&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-821-private-capital-market-reporting-global-practices-and-lessons/" title="REP 821 Private capital market reporting: Global practices and lessons">ASIC identified in November (REP 821)</a>, private markets are opaque, and Australia has limited regulatory reporting outside superannuation, meaning constrained supervision and potential heightened risks for investors.</p>
<h2>Operational failures by superannuation fund trustees leading to member harm</h2>
<p>Member services problems like delays in processing claims, inadequate support and services for customers, poor IT infrastructure and cyber resilience, and escalating risks of fraud and scam activity all underscore superannuation fund operations as a key issue for ASIC in 2026.</p>
<p>Those operational failures by trustees or administrators can result in significant financial losses, compound distress for people facing difficult circumstances, and of course erode trust in the system as a whole.</p>
<p>With nearly three million Australians set to become eligible to access their superannuation over the next decade&mdash;and more than $750 billion expected to move from accumulation into retirement&mdash;it is essential that the superannuation system is prepared to manage potential operational challenges.</p>
<h2>Consumers losing their retirement savings through investments in high-risk products, including as a result of high-pressure sales tactics and inappropriate financial advice</h2>
<p>Aggressive marketing, lead‑generation and &ldquo;cookie‑cutter&rdquo; advice models have been driving switches of superannuation into complex, high‑risk investments that are often unsuitable for average consumers, for example through certain managed investment schemes.</p>
<p>ASIC is working closely with government and consumer groups to address legal and regulatory gaps, and deliver education campaigns to empower Australians to better identify risks to their retirement savings. While the pathway to compensation can be uncertain when these schemes collapse, ASIC has 12 court cases underway related to the Shield and First Guardian matters to hold people and organisations to account.</p>
<h2>Advanced technology harming consumers (including agentic AI)</h2>
<p>We are increasingly seeing consumers face risks from automated decisions, AI-driven interactions, and scams amplified by technology.</p>
<p>The rapid adoption of technology enables new forms of conduct that exploit issues like behavioural bias. As ASIC has found in research, there is variable maturity in how businesses manage AI governance risks. While agentic AI can help people shop around for deals and avoid loyalty penalties, it can also compound risk given its capability to independently plan and act.</p>
<h2>Cyber-attacks, data breaches and/or inadequate operational resilience and crisis management undermine market confidence and harm consumers</h2>
<p>Reporting shows increases in hotline calls to the Australian Cyber Security Hotline, incident responses, and threat notifications, reinforcing the need for vigilance and uplift across sectors.</p>
<p>Digitisation, legacy systems, reliance on third parties, and evolving threat actor capability continue to elevate cyber risk in ASIC&rsquo;s view. ASIC is urging directors and financial services license holders to maintain robust risk management frameworks, test their operational resilience and crisis responses, and address vulnerabilities with their third-party service providers.</p>
<h2>Regulatory gaps related to emerging financial sector participants (digital assets, payments, users of AI) and others on the regulatory perimeter</h2>
<p>Rapid innovation by or for people unfamiliar with financial services - particularly in digital assets and fintechs - continues to create risks including with unlicensed advice, misleading conduct, and the exploitation of unclear regulatory boundaries.</p>
<p>Where a business is currently legitimately unregulated, it is ultimately for government to determine whether a new class of products or services should be brought within a licensing regime.</p>
<p>At the same time, some entities will actively seek to remain outside regulation, contributing to perceived regulatory uncertainty. As a result, ensuring clarity on licensing requirements and maintaining effective perimeter oversight will remain priorities for ASIC in 2026.</p>
<h2>Poor insurance claims handling, particularly following extreme weather events</h2>
<p>The disasters in Victoria and Queensland in recent weeks underscore the pressures insurers face during concurrent and severe events that can lead to poor consumer outcomes including delays, errors, and poor communications.</p>
<p>ASIC has commenced court proceedings concerning serious claim handling failure and will continue to hold the sector to account. The volumes and costs from disasters highlight challenges insurers face, particularly with claims handling.</p>
<h2>Failure or significant outage resulting from the implementation of CHESS replacement or due to the ongoing use of the aging infrastructure of the current system</h2>
<p>CHESS is critical national infrastructure that is fundamental to orderly markets.</p>
<p>While the first phase of its replacement is due this year, the December 2024 outage provided a real-world example of why that replacement cannot come soon enough.</p>
<p>Delays or failures in the CHESS replacement project pose a major risk to market stability, operational resilience, and investor confidence. The risk is heightened by the ongoing reliance on aging technology, which increases the likelihood of technical failures and operational harm.</p>
<h2>Poor quality financial reporting, sustainability reporting and audit quality</h2>
<p>Financial reports and audits are key to maintaining market confidence and informed investor and consumer decision making.</p>
<p>ASIC is concerned with evidence it has found in superannuation financial reports of inconsistent investment disclosures, limited transparency on certain expenses, and insufficient audit evidence for valuations.</p>
<p>As mandatory sustainability/climate reporting expands, there are also risks of misleading or incomplete disclosures.</p>
<h2>Increased risk appetite in the banking sector in response to competitive pressures that results in consumer harm<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br /></span></strong></h2>
<p>ASIC notes that historic low net interest margins in banking may be driving parts of the sector towards riskier strategies.</p>
<p>ASIC is alert to conduct that pushes regulatory boundaries to circumvent the application of the law that would lead to unfair investor losses and consumer harm.</p>
<p>The competitive dynamics at play in Australia could incentivise relaxed credit assessments, larger or unsuitable loans, product changes for lower‑margin customers, and aggressive marketing that steers consumers towards higher‑risk products.</p>

<title>Remarks At The 53rd Annual Securities Regulation Institute - Enhancing The Public Company Disclosure Framework - SEC Commissioner Mark T. Uyeda, Coronado, CA, Jan. 26, 2026</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>Thank you, Dave [Lynn], for that kind introduction.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-securities-regulation-institute-012626?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;I appreciate the opportunity to deliver the Alan B. Levenson Keynote Address, named in honor of the former director of the Division of Corporation Finance&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">(Corp Fin)</span>. Alan started his service at the Commission during the tenure of Chairman Edward &ldquo;Ned&rdquo; Gadsby, who was appointed by President Eisenhower.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-securities-regulation-institute-012626?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2">[2]</a>&nbsp;During his service, the Commission and its staff operated in a very different manner. It is hard to imagine a Corp Fin staff member today questioning a notorious figure such as former Teamsters president Jimmy Hoffa in a public hearing&mdash;but that is what Alan was able to do.</p>
<p>For lawyers involved in capital markets transactions, the annual Securities Regulation Institute organized by the Northwestern School of Law has become an important gathering. For those of us at the SEC, it represents an opportunity to engage with experienced securities law practitioners who can provide valuable feedback needed to develop sound regulatory policies. This is especially true as we revisit our rulebook to promote its effectiveness and reduce compliance burdens where regulatory obligations do not provide commensurate benefits for investors or our markets.</p>
<p>The obligation to weigh burdens versus benefits is not a personal preference or philosophy of mine. In fact, it is a legislative mandate. Congress tasked the SEC with this exact objective when it passed the National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996 (NSMIA).<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-securities-regulation-institute-012626?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3">[3]</a>&nbsp;NSMIA directs the Commission to consider whether an action will promote capital formation &ldquo;whenever we are required to consider the impact of an action upon investor protection pursuant to a rulemaking function.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-securities-regulation-institute-012626?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4">[4]</a>&nbsp;It is unfortunate that the prior administration downplayed this directive, given the many misguided rulemakings that were proposed and adopted during that period.</p>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><span>1981: The U.S. and The SEC at a Crossroads</span></em></p>
<p>Efforts to improve capital formation are not new. After all, capital formation drives economic growth, jobs creation, and innovation. The Commission faced a similar task nearly forth-five years ago. Shortly after President Ronald Reagan&rsquo;s inauguration, the SEC sought to increase capital formation efforts to counter the stagflation and economic malaise of the late 1970s.</p>
<p>At the time, Chairman John Shad wrote to James A. Baker, the Chief of Staff to President Reagan, that: &ldquo;[m]ounting regulatory burdens, rising inflation, corporate and individual taxes, inadequate depreciation allowances, double taxation of dividends, up to 70% taxes on interest and dividends, and one of the highest effective rates of capital gains taxation in the industrialized free world, have been emphatic disincentives to save.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-securities-regulation-institute-012626?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5">[5]</a></p>
<p>In response to these challenges, the Commission &ldquo;embarked on a major internal program to facilitate capital formation by simplifying the processes of raising capital in &hellip; public markets; by reducing excessive corporate registration, reporting and other regulatory burdens; and by maintaining public confidence in [the] securities markets through effective oversight, disclosure and antifraud enforcement.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-securities-regulation-institute-012626?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6">[6]</a></p>
<p>These efforts contributed to the resurgence of growth and prosperity&mdash;and the rectifying of capital market, monetary, economic and fiscal policy&mdash;in the 1980s and beyond.</p>
<p>Today, we are pursuing a substantially similar journey. The Commission is considering how it can further enhance America&rsquo;s capital markets&mdash;both qualitatively and quantitively. We cannot take for granted that our capital markets will remain the most attractive, the deepest, and the most liquid in the world. Complacency invites decline.</p>
<p>We seek to focus our corporate disclosure rulebook squarely on maintaining the quality and reliability of material information. There are a number of areas where we can potentially enhance our public company disclosure framework that will further empower investment choice, price discovery, and investor protection.</p>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><span>Merit or Prudential Regulators We Are Not</span></em></p>
<p>Before I discuss potential reforms to the Commission&rsquo;s disclosure regime, let&rsquo;s remember that there are limits imposed by statute. We are not merit regulators. We do not &ldquo;approve&rdquo; offerings.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-securities-regulation-institute-012626?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7">[7]</a>&nbsp;When reviewing registration statements, the staffs of the Divisions of Corporation Finance and Investment Management do not express a view on whether the offering is qualitatively &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;bad&rdquo;&mdash;or express any similar judgement as to whether the offering is fair to investors or represents a sound investment decision. The SEC does not&mdash;and should not&mdash;substitute its judgment for that of investors or market intermediaries. Our framework, as described by renowned lawyer, judge, and early architect of the SEC, Ferdinand Pecora, is simple: &ldquo;[t]o see it that those who issue securities and offer them for sale to the public, shall first tell the truth and the whole truth to the public with respect to these securities.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-securities-regulation-institute-012626?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8">[8]</a></p>
<p>There are significant downsides to a system where government regulators make the decision as to whether an investment is appropriate for investors&mdash;instead of allowing them to access opportunities that they deem optimal for their own portfolios. In 1980, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts barred the sale of Apple Computer stock as too risky.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-securities-regulation-institute-012626?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9">[9]</a>&nbsp;The basis for denying the application was a regulatory provision, which stipulated that the price per share could not exceed 20 times earnings, while at the time, Apple was offered at 90 times earnings.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-securities-regulation-institute-012626?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10">[10]</a>&nbsp;This decision resulted in Massachusetts investors initially missing out on holding stock in a company that would go on to become one of the most valuable in the technology sector.</p>
<p>State blue sky laws, with merit review provisions, existed prior to the enactment of the federal securities law. However, Congress wisely chose a disclosure-based approach to regulation. Thus, the Commission is not charged with administering the Securities Act of 1933 and Securities Exchange Act of 1934 through a merit-review approach.</p>
<p>Nor is the Commission a prudential regulator or central economic planner charged with evaluating whether the economy or markets are overheated. The Commission is not responsible for deciding if the financial markets are irrationally exuberant.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-securities-regulation-institute-012626?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11">[11]</a>&nbsp;This is not to suggest that we should not be vigilant in terms of observing market trends and concerns. Rather, the Commission should be focused on the quality of financial reporting, the emergence of fraudulent schemes, and market manipulation. Simply put: our mandate is rooted in disclosure rather than subjective qualitative assessments.</p>
<p>We are not supposed to act as &ldquo;chaperones,&rdquo; guiding investors to outcomes we think are more prudent. Rather, our primary focus should be on enhancing the quality of the disclosure framework and minimizing the likelihood that offerings have undisclosed material characteristics that would impact pricing.</p>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><span>Strengthening Public Company Disclosure Frameworks</span></em></p>
<p>Regulation S-K<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-securities-regulation-institute-012626?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12">[12]</a>&nbsp;is a key pillar of our public company disclosure framework. Many attorneys have spent long hours digesting paragraphs, subparagraphs, and romanettes of Regulation S-K. They have also spent countless hours discerning instructions, guidance, and staff comment letters with respect to the S-K items&mdash;aiming to seek clarification of the corresponding provisions&mdash;and their clients, by and large, have footed this bill. Some of the Regulation S-K instructions are as complex and lengthy as their corresponding disclosure item. Further complicating matters, in some instances, subparagraphs of Regulation S-K get their own instructions that are also lengthy. For example, the instruction to subparagraph (a) of Item 404 has over thirty discrete paragraphs or subparagraphs!<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-securities-regulation-institute-012626?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13">[13]</a></p>
<p>As lawyers, we understand the need for precision. However, we should also aim to simplify and streamline our rules where possible. In this spirit, Chairman Paul Atkins has instructed the Division of Corporation Finance to engage in a comprehensive review of Regulation S-K.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-securities-regulation-institute-012626?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14">[14]</a>&nbsp;I strongly support these efforts.</p>
<p>There are areas for improvement. For example, with regard to insider trading arrangements and policies under Item 408,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-securities-regulation-institute-012626?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15">[15]</a>&nbsp;we could consider deleting the requirement in subparagraph (b) that mandates companies explain whether they have an insider trading policy or provide reasons if they do not. This would not change any underlying federal securities law obligations or liability thereunder, but would simplify disclosures.</p>
<p>Similarly, with regard to transactions with related persons under Item 404,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-securities-regulation-institute-012626?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16">[16]</a>&nbsp;we could consider adjusting the de minimis threshold of $120,000 to a higher amount, which might better align the requirement with materiality considerations. Or we could consider replacing a static number with a more principles-based approach to materiality that has worked well in other contexts. Additionally, the narrative description of company policies under subparagraph (b) could be replaced with a requirement for companies to file their policies or make them readily available on their websites. This would maintain transparency while streamlining SEC filings.</p>
<p>In the cybersecurity area, we should re-consider our approach to the current mandated disclosures. We should consider whether Item 106<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-securities-regulation-institute-012626?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17">[17]</a>&nbsp;could be streamlined to simplify the narrative disclosures of cybersecurity policies and governance oversight. Our disclosure rules should generally not be the driver for what a company does or does not, but disclosure requirements such as these and others are likely shaming or indirectly compelling companies to change practices rather than eliciting material disclosure as to what the company is doing.</p>
<p>There are similar areas for potential improvement in Item 701 and disclosure of unregistered transactions.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-securities-regulation-institute-012626?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn18">[18]</a>&nbsp;We could evaluate whether the corresponding Form 10-K item, requiring a 3-year look-back for unregistered sales of securities by the registrant, could be eliminated or otherwise modified.</p>
<p>Simplifications could also be made to Item 201 for disclosures of the number of security holders and performance graphs. Perhaps we could delete the five-year graph of the issuer&rsquo;s total cumulative return compared to a broad index and a line-of-business or peer group index under subparagraph (e). Given the wide availability of evaluative tools on the internet and mobile devices, do investors continue to need such disclosure?</p>
<p>And although not squarely within the scope of Regulation S-K, I would be remiss if I did not mention disclosure related to mine safety in Form 10-Q.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-securities-regulation-institute-012626?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn19">[19]</a>&nbsp;Surely, we can include such disclosure elsewhere than in a recurring quarterly filing&mdash;the most logical place would likely be in Form 8-K or Form SD. One important consideration is that each of these requirements feeds into evaluations under an issuer&rsquo;s disclosure controls and procedures (&ldquo;DCPs&rdquo;), adding one more step in terms of identifying whether any transactions or events are reportable.</p>
<p>These are a few examples where we may be able to improve disclosure requirements to ensure they are relevant and efficient in the current regulatory environment. In the aggregate such revisions may reduce compliance burdens, improve our regulatory roadmap and&mdash;hopefully, minimize late nights spent by lawyers at public companies having nothing to do with mining but nonetheless wondering if they need DCPs for mine safety incidents.</p>
<p>By making these adjustments, we would contribute to a more effective disclosure regulatory regime.</p>
<p class="text-align-center"><em><span>Promoting a Scaled Disclosure Rulebook</span></em></p>
<p>In our efforts to enhance the quality and effectiveness of the SEC rulebook, we should also consider whether it is appropriately tailored and avoids a one-size-fits-all approach. Smaller public companies make significant contributions to the financial markets and the economy more broadly. For context, 50% of all registered equity offerings during the 12-month period ended June 30, 2025 were done by smaller public companies.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-securities-regulation-institute-012626?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn20">[20]</a>&nbsp;Some of these investments may provide higher growth opportunities for investors. As such, we should take care to see that our regulations are not disproportionately burdensome on small businesses.</p>
<p>One approach is through scaled disclosure for smaller companies. Key concepts such as the &ldquo;Emerging Growth Company&rdquo; (&ldquo;EGC&rdquo;) and &ldquo;Smaller Reporting Company&rdquo; (&ldquo;SRC&rdquo;) definitions have important implications for issuers&mdash;and can alleviate regulatory burdens while promoting capital formation.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-securities-regulation-institute-012626?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn21">[21]</a></p>
<p>Over 40% of companies (42.5%) must comply with the full scope of the Commission&rsquo;s disclosure requirements.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-securities-regulation-institute-012626?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn22">[22]</a>&nbsp;If the Commission were to reduce this number to approximately 20%, the total number of additional companies that would be able to provide scaled disclosure requirements would increase by almost 1,400.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-securities-regulation-institute-012626?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn23">[23]</a>&nbsp;From an investor protection standpoint, however, those 20% of the companies still subject to the full scope of our disclosure requirements would represent almost 93.5% of total market public float.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-securities-regulation-institute-012626?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn24">[24]</a></p>
<p>Thus, it is important that the threshold definitions for being an EGC or SRC are appropriately calibrated as they will have a direct impact on the scope of applicable regulatory filing obligations. These definitions are not merely academic or administrative&mdash;they delineate the corresponding regulatory obligations that a company will face.</p>
<p>For instance, SRCs illustrate how investors might expect differing disclosure obligations depending on the size of the company. An established pharmaceutical company with a trillion-dollar market capitalization should not be subject to the same disclosure standards as a biotech company with zero revenues and only one drug candidate in the development pipeline. For the former, there are potentially many Regulation S-K disclosure line items that will provide investors with information material to their investment decisions. For the latter, it is likely that there is primarily one key disclosure that investors are looking to: the milestones and status of the drug&rsquo;s development.</p>
<p>This scaled disclosure is logical given the more limited resources smaller companies frequently operate with. Smaller companies often have limited cash flow and likely have fewer resources than larger entities. Therefore, it is crucial that any regulatory adjustments take into account the circumstances of smaller companies&mdash;while maintaining key investor protection features. Instead of layering on additional requirements for all public companies, we should be thinking about whether existing rules could be further refined.</p>
<p>The EGC definition is a useful example of how to structure a scaled disclosure framework, and potentially a starting point for right-sizing our rulebook. EGCs benefit from reduced disclosure requirements, which have proven to be beneficial for their development and growth. By providing these companies with a lighter regulatory burden, the EGC definition has facilitated their ability to raise capital while minimizing unnecessary regulatory burdens. This model underscores the importance of tailored regulatory approaches that consider the development stage of companies.</p>
<p>There are benefits to being an EGC.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-securities-regulation-institute-012626?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn25">[25]</a>&nbsp;Emerging growth companies include less extensive narrative disclosure than other reporting companies, particularly in the description of executive compensation. They can provide audited financial statements for two fiscal years, in contrast to other reporting companies, which must provide audited financial statements for three fiscal years. They also do not include auditor attestation of internal controls over financial reporting under Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404(b) and are permitted to use test-the-waters communications with qualified institutional buyers and institutional accredited investors.</p>
<p>Extending the time periods in which a company is eligible for scaled disclosure may also benefit public markets. Currently, a company generally continues to be an EGC for the first five fiscal years after it completes an IPO.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-securities-regulation-institute-012626?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn26">[26]</a>&nbsp;Expanding this time period by several years may yield further growth and investment opportunities.</p>
<p>Lastly, expanding the use of Form S-3, which offers a faster and less costly registration process for certain offerings, could further alleviate regulatory challenges for smaller entities. By increasing eligibility for the use of Form S-3, we can provide more flexible options for follow-on offerings.</p>
<p>In summary, careful consideration and thoughtful revisions to these definitions can provide growth and innovation for new companies, without imposing unnecessary constraints. By expanding on the success of the EGC model, and appropriately tailoring the disclosure and filing regimes, we can promote a landscape that supports all three elements of our tripartite mission.</p>
<p class="text-align-center"><span>Reestablish the Focus on Financial Materiality in the SEC Rulebook</span></p>
<p>Finally, the Commission must re-establish its focus on financial materiality in its regulatory regime. During recent years, regulatory agencies have sought to adopt standards based on non-financial social or environmental considerations. Such approaches were fashionable in many circles. Regulatory agencies, however, should strive to adopt standards that are grounded in the statutory authority granted to those agencies and focused on financial materiality. Regulators should aim to adopt neutral standards that are not tied to specific social or political philosophies and objectives and the Commission should not put its thumb on the scale in furtherance of such goals.</p>
<p>This is especially true given that there is considerable skepticism as to whether ESG investment strategies yield superior returns.</p>
<p>To conclude, I would like to acknowledge the efforts of the SEC staff over the past year. In particular, I would like to recognize Cicely LaMothe, who recently retired after 24 years of SEC. I am particularly grateful that Cicely agreed, when I asked her as the incoming Acting Chairman, if she would pull double duty as acting Corp Fin director in addition to her regular role as deputy director for the disclosure review program. I also would like to thank Corp Fin for loaning out one of their staff members &mdash; Gabe Eckstein &mdash; who has ably served for the past year as chief of staff to both me and Chairman Paul Atkins. Gabe now returns to Corp Fin as part of the new senior staff recently announced by Corp Fin director Jim Maloney.</p>
<p>A year ago at this conference, the new Administration was barely in office. One of my first acts as Acting Chairman was to dispatch SEC staff to start the process of re-engaging with, rather than lecturing to, the corporate legal bar. I appreciate that you have accepted our offer to have a robust discussion of ideas rather than one-way edicts from the government. That conversation needs to continue along with hearing the views of investors. Thank you for your attention today, and thank you to the staff at Northwestern University for organizing this event. I look forward to future engagement on these topics.</p>

<p>Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Michael S. Selig today announced Alex Titus as Chief Advisor to the Chairman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am thrilled to welcome Alex to the Commission as my Chief Advisor,&rdquo; said Chairman Selig. &ldquo;Alex is a seasoned professional with deep expertise in economic and financial policy. He brings to the Commission a wealth of experience working with stakeholders throughout President Trump&rsquo;s administration on a wide range of issues from his prior perch at the White House. He will be a huge asset to the Commission as it works together with the White House to ensure that the innovations of tomorrow are Made in America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am excited to join Chairman Selig and the incredible team that he's building at the CFTC," Titus said. "I look forward to supporting his mission to usher in a Golden Age for America's financial markets and create rules of the road for exciting new financial instruments."&nbsp;<br /><br />Titus joins the CFTC after serving as Chief of Staff at the White House Council of Economic Advisers under Chairman Stephen Miran and&nbsp;Acting Chairman Pierre Yared. At CEA, Titus played a pivotal role in President Trump's efforts to rebalance the global trading system, pass historic tax legislation through the One Big Beautiful Bill, and advance one of the most aggressive deregulatory agendas in history.</p>
<p>Before CEA, Titus led a nationwide talent network preparing individuals for public service, served in the first Trump Administration, and was Policy Advisor at President Trump's political group, America First Action. He has held fellowships with The Public Interest Fellowship, Observer Research Foundation, and Claremont Institute.</p>
<p>Titus received&nbsp;his B.S. in Economics from the University of Oregon.</p>

<title>ISDA derivatiViews: A Critical Step To Efficient Treasury Clearing</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>By the end of this year, the first prong of the Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s (SEC) Treasury clearing mandate will come into force. This is part of a regulatory effort to make the financial system more robust, but it will also come with added costs &ndash; which is why recent proposals from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/sites/default/files/2025/12/2025-23150a.pdf">Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-12-29/pdf/2025-23886.pdf">SEC</a>&nbsp;to allow an existing cross-margining arrangement offered by the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC) and CME Group to be extended to clients is so important to ensuring Treasury clearing can be implemented efficiently.</p>
<p>Once implemented, a much wider universe of market participants will be able to take advantage of risk offsets that exist when clearing a portfolio of Treasury securities and Treasury futures, reducing the initial margin (IM) customers need to post by aligning the amount of margin more closely with actual risk. This will not only reduce costs for market participants &ndash; it will also make clearing more efficient as the clearing mandate is rolled out.</p>
<p>Up until now, only clearing members could take advantage of the risk offsets between FICC-cleared US Treasury cash and repo transactions and CME-cleared futures. Under the CFTC and SEC proposals, clients of those clearing members will also be able to benefit, while maintaining existing strong customer protections and legal certainty.</p>
<p>As we pointed out in our responses to the CFTC and SEC, we strongly support the proposals, but it&rsquo;s critical the agencies finalize the changes well in advance of the clearing mandate, which comes into force for certain cash transactions from December 31, with repos following six months later. Market participants need sufficient time to complete account setup, documentation, legal arrangements and end-to-end testing and to operationalize client cross-margining before mandatory clearing requirements take effect &ndash; this cannot be achieved in days or weeks.</p>
<p>Extending cross-margining arrangements to clients is an important step to enabling the smooth implementation of mandatory Treasury clearing, but it&rsquo;s not the only one. US prudential regulators also need to ensure the US capital rules are modified to recognize the risk-reducing benefits of netting across products, including cleared repos and futures, under the standardized approach to counterparty credit risk (SA-CCR).</p>
<p>This lack of recognition is particularly problematic in the context of the Treasury clearing mandate. While cross-margining arrangements will allow clients to benefit from reduced IM amounts that reflect the actual risk of a portfolio of trades, banks could face a hefty increase in capital requirements due to the current design of SA-CCR. Unnecessarily high capital requirements would reduce bank balance sheet capacity to facilitate the clearing of client transactions at a time when volumes of cleared trades will increase significantly.</p>
<p>As US prudential regulators are preparing to release their revised Basel III endgame proposals, we urge them to ensure this important issue is addressed. With the US Treasury market at more than $30 trillion, it&rsquo;s critical the regulatory framework does not hamper market efficiency and liquidity and prevent the ability of banks to provide the intermediation services so vital to the smooth functioning of this market. The CFTC and SEC have taken a very important step &ndash; we hope changes to the capital rules will follow.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent announced the cancelation of all contracts with consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton. The Treasury Department currently has 31 separate contracts with Booz Allen Hamilton totaling $4.8 million in annual spending and $21 million in total obligations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;President Trump has entrusted his cabinet to root out waste, fraud, and abuse, and canceling these contracts is an essential step to increasing Americans&rsquo; trust in government,&rdquo; said Secretary Bessent. &ldquo;Booz Allen failed to implement adequate safeguards to protect sensitive data, including the confidential taxpayer information it had access to through its contracts with the Internal Revenue Service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Most notably, between 2018 and 2020, Charles Edward Littlejohn &mdash; an employee of Booz Allen Hamilton &mdash; stole and leaked the confidential tax returns and return information of hundreds of thousands of taxpayers. To date, the IRS determined that the data breach affected approximately 406,000 taxpayers. Littlejohn has pled guilty to felony charges for disclosing confidential tax information without authorization.</p>

<title>The EBA Outlines The Medium To Long Term Objectives Of Its Interest Rate Risk In The Banking Book Heatmap</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>​The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published a Report on the medium- to long term objectives of its interest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) Heatmap, including key observations and recommendations for institutions and supervisors. ​</span></p>
<div>
<p>In January 2024, the EBA published its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-publishes-its-heatmap-following-scrutiny-interest-rate" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Heatmap following the IRRBB scrutiny</a>, setting out a roadmap for IRRBB monitoring across short- medium- and long-term areas of focus.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Today&rsquo;s Report completes the medium to long term milestones defined in the IRRBB Heatmap and builds on the guidance provided during the first phase of the examination, which was reflected in the first&nbsp;<a href="https://eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2025-02/df2e889e-85e4-40d6-a440-2061f7199252/Report%20IRRBB%20heatmap%20implementation.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">IRRBB Heatmap implementation report</a>&nbsp;on the short to medium term objectives, published in February 2025.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The present publication also provides an analytical review and presents observations and recommendations in several areas, which are designed to inform supervisory dialogue and support institutions&rsquo; practices. All recommendations should be applied in a proportionate manner, reflecting each institution&rsquo;s size, complexity, risk profile, and business model. Importantly, the Report does not introduce new regulatory requirements.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Key areas of focus</h4>
</div>
<div>
<p><span>I. Supervisory outliers test (SOT) analysis</span>. Results suggest a gradual adjustment of banks&rsquo; risk management practices to the new interest rate environment. The number of outliers has improved for both metrics, while changes in Economic Value of Equity (&Delta;EVE) and Net Interest Income (&Delta;NII) continue to show asymmetrical impacts.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span>II. Monitoring of the 5-year cap</span>. The 5-year cap continues to serve as a harmonising benchmark, with limited impact observed so far. The EBA recommends that any deviations from this supervisory default be approved by supervisors, in line with Q&amp;A 2023_6807 and disclosed under Pillar 3.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span>III. Commercial margin modelling</span>. Constant-spread modelling remains widely used across most products except for non-maturing deposits (NMDs) due to their behavioural features. Guidance applicable to NMDs should only be extended to products where behavioural characteristics are material.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span>IV. Credit Spread Risk in the Banking Book (CSRBB) perimeter</span>. Current practices remain heterogeneous. Institutions should work towards for a consistent perimeter across both EVE and NII metrics and avoid excluding instruments ex-ante.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span>V. Hedging strategies.</span>&nbsp;Interest Rate Swap (IRS) continues to be the principal derivative instrument used to mitigate IRRBB exposures, particularly in cases of SOT breaches for &Delta;EVE. Hedge designation should align with product characteristics, economic-hedging frameworks must be well-governed, and effectiveness should be evidenced through regular back-testing and documentation.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Legal basis, background, and next steps</h4>
</div>
<div><ol>
<li>
<p>The regulatory framework on IRRBB has been strengthened through the publication in the Official Journal of:</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2024/856</span>&nbsp;(RTS on SOT),&nbsp;</p>

<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2024/855</span>&nbsp;amending the ITS on reporting, published on 15 March 2024.</p>

</ul>
</div>
<div><ol start="2">
<li>
<p>The latest versions of the EBA Guidelines on IRRBB and CSRBB have been fully applicable across the EU since 31 December 2023.</p>
</li>
</ol></div>

<li>
<p>Ongoing monitoring of IRRBB implementation remains an integral part of the EBA&rsquo;s supervisory responsibilities, with the objective of ensuring consistent application of EU law and promoting common supervisory approaches and practices.&nbsp;</p>

<title>Expert Q&amp;A: Eurex introduces Systematic QIS Index Futures – A New Milestone In Futurization</title>

<div class="dbx-richtext">
<div>
<p class="p--heading-1">Stuart Heath, Director, and Elena Marchidann, Vice&nbsp;President&nbsp;and Global Product Lead for Derivatives Products &amp; Markets at Eurex, share exclusive insights into the launch of systematic QIS index futures, explaining the rationale behind it and what to expect going forward.</p>
</div>

<div class="dbx-row">
<div class="dbx-col-sm-12 dbx-col-md-12 dbx-col-xl-10">
<div>
<p class="p--heading-3">What is behind the launch of systematic QIS index futures at Eurex?</p>
<p>Quantitative Investment Strategies (QIS) have been among the&nbsp;fastest-growing&nbsp;segments among buy-side firms, offering transparent,&nbsp;rule-based access to thematic and factor-based exposures&nbsp;that&nbsp;have traditionally&nbsp;been&nbsp;distributed&nbsp;as&nbsp;OTC swaps or structured notes.</p>
<p>Eurex has a long history in the&nbsp;futurization&nbsp;of OTC derivatives, having pioneered successful products (e.g., dividend futures and TRFs). The new QIS offering marks the next chapter in our&nbsp;futurization&nbsp;strategy and is based on market demand. We have been working closely with our clients and our strategic partner,&nbsp;Premialab, to bring a listed alternative to the QIS space.</p>
<p class="p--heading-3">What are systematic QIS index futures,&nbsp;and what do they&nbsp;offer&nbsp;clients?</p>
<p>Systematic QIS index futures are listed derivatives based on eligible QIS indices, typically designed by a bank or buy-side firm. The QIS futures are&nbsp;very similar&nbsp;to &ldquo;plain vanilla&rdquo; index futures from a product construct perspective and are designed to be easily scalable. We started with long-exposure strategies (two factors and one thematic) based on European equities from the STOXX&reg; Europe 600 universe.</p>
<p>The new products will&nbsp;benefit&nbsp;from the traditional synergies of other listed offerings, in particular the distribution platform for buy-side clients who do not trade swaps or prefer trading listed products, as well as price transparency and portfolio margin offsets.</p>
<p class="p--heading-3">Who are you targeting to trade the systematic QIS index futures?</p>
<p>The new QIS offering will complement Eurex's existing index futures ecosystem by addressing demand for greater customization among sophisticated investors. The target audience includes hedge funds and institutional investors (e.g., asset managers, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds).&nbsp;In particular, institutional&nbsp;investors&nbsp;require execution and product transparency and often face constraints on the instruments they can trade (e.g., listed-only).</p>
<p class="p--heading-3">What were the biggest conceptual or technical challenges in transforming QIS from an OTC structure into a listed&nbsp;futures&nbsp;format?</p>
<p>QIS indices, which underpin OTC swaps and now Eurex futures, are customized, rule-based indices. A key challenge is ensuring robust risk management so that Eurex Clearing can accurately capture risk parameters from index histories or&nbsp;backtests. High turnover or frequent rebalancing can distort results. To address this, we worked closely with the Risk team to develop a framework that defines which indices are acceptable.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p--heading-3">How did collaborating&nbsp;with&nbsp;Premialab&nbsp;influence the development process, and what did we learn from integrating external data and analytics into a Eurex-listed product?</p>
<p>Premialab&nbsp;is a leading player in the QIS data and analytics field and part of the plumbing between buy-side consumers and investment bank providers. So, on a simplistic&nbsp;level,&nbsp;we are tapping into those pipes to consume data.&nbsp;However, working closely with a market-leading partner gives you access to key participants in the QIS market and the insight and ability to focus on the core themes that Eurex products can bring to&nbsp;the&nbsp;market.</p>
<p class="p--heading-3">Looking ahead, how do you see QIS index futures evolving within Eurex&rsquo;s broader futurization strategy?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The introduction of QIS futures is indeed the first step toward providing a clearing/listed product for&nbsp;a very large&nbsp;underlying market.&nbsp;Its development will enable end clients to access investment strategies more easily and help investment banks distribute them through a simple wrapper, while reducing their costs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This aligns with our futurization efforts, which have primarily focused on dealer-to-dealer products to date. Now,&nbsp;we add&nbsp;a&nbsp;dealer-to-client layer&nbsp;to&nbsp;support growth in both&nbsp;our&nbsp;new&nbsp;and existing&nbsp;products&nbsp;by providing&nbsp;dealers with a&nbsp;hedge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our ambition is to expand our offering to include global indices, long-short relative-value strategies, and, ultimately, other&nbsp;asset classes.</p>

<title>Hong Kong Securities And Futures Commission Suspends Choi Sau Wai For Seven Months</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="newsc">
<p>The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has suspended Ms Choi Sau Wai, a former licensed representative of Glory Sun Securities Limited (GSSL), for seven months from 23 January 2026 to 22 August 2026 (Note 1).</p>
<p>As part of an investigation into a suspected ramp-and-dump scheme, the SFC found that, between October 2019 and January 2022, Choi knowingly allowed and facilitated an account executive of another brokerage firm (AE) to operate and carry out personal trades in a client&rsquo;s securities account at GSSL without obtaining the client&rsquo;s written authorisation, nor did she obtain a written consent from the AE&rsquo;s employer, in breach of GSSL&rsquo;s internal policies and the Code of Conduct (Notes 2 and 3).</p>
<p>During the relevant period, the AE, a relative of Choi&rsquo;s client, was allowed to conduct personal trading in the client&rsquo;s account at GSSL. The AE conducted approximately 1,300 securities transactions with an aggregate value of $670 million in the client&rsquo;s account without disclosing them to his employer.</p>
<p>In doing so, Choi&rsquo;s conduct exposed the client to potential losses from the personal trading conducted by the AE and GSSL to potential liability in case the client disputes the trades in her account. Choi also prevented GSSL from discharging its obligations under the Code of Conduct (Note 4).</p>
<p>In determining the sanction against Choi, the SFC has taken into account all relevant circumstances, including her breaches enabled the AE to circumvent his employer&rsquo;s internal controls, her cooperation in resolving the SFC&rsquo;s concerns and her otherwise clean disciplinary record.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choi is licensed under the Securities and Futures Ordinance to carry on Type 1 (dealing in securities) and Type 2 (dealing in futures contracts) regulated activities. She was accredited to GSSL (formerly known as China Goldjoy Securities Limited) as a licensed representative for Type 1 regulated activity from 14 January 2019 to 6 June 2023 and Type 2 regulated activity from 14 January 2019 to 27 September 2022. Since 19 September 2023, Choi has been accredited to SinoPac Securities (Asia) Limited as a licensed representative for Type 1 and Type 2 regulated activities.</li>
<li>The SFC has suspended the AE, Wong Chi Fai, for 27 months. Please refer to the SFC&rsquo;s press release dated&nbsp;<a href="http://apps.sfc.hk/edistributionWeb/gateway/EN/news-and-announcements/news/doc?refNo=26PR9">26 January 2026</a>.</li>
<li>Code of Conduct for Persons Licensed by or Registered with the SFC.</li>
<li>Please refer to the Statement of Disciplinary Action for the relevant regulatory requirements.</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span class="bw-dateline-wrapper">&nbsp;</span>ICE Mortgage Technology, neutral provider of a robust end-to-end mortgage platform and part of Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE: ICE), today released the December 2025 ICE First Look at mortgage delinquency, foreclosure and prepayment trends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;December&rsquo;s numbers show that lower interest rates drove refinance activity and prepayments to near multi-year highs,&rdquo; said Andy Walden, Head of Mortgage and Housing Market Research at ICE. &ldquo;At the same time, there was a divergence in delinquency trends, with early-stage delinquencies improving and late-stage delinquencies continuing to rise. Foreclosure activity also increased, driven mainly by FHA and VA loans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Key takeaways from this month&rsquo;s findings include:</p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li><span>Early-stage delinquencies improved:</span>&nbsp;The national delinquency rate fell by 16 basis points (bps) in December to 3.68% following November&rsquo;s calendar related high. This is down 3 bps from the same time last year and 26 bps below the December 2019 pre-pandemic benchmark.<br /><br /></li>
<li><span>Late-stage delinquencies reached a near two-year high:</span>&nbsp;While earlier-stage delinquencies (30- and 60-day) improved in December, late-stage delinquencies (90+ day) increased by 30,000, reaching their highest level in nearly three years and standing 19,000 above last year&rsquo;s level.<br /><br /></li>
<li><span>Prepayments remain robust:</span>&nbsp;The single month mortality (SMM) rate, which tracks prepayments, rose by 8 bps in December to 0.91%, just 10 bps shy of the October 3.5-year high. Lower interest rates have improved affordability and spurred refinance activity.<br /><br /></li>
<li><span>Foreclosure activity trending upward:</span>&nbsp;December&rsquo;s 40,000 foreclosure starts marks the third highest monthly volume in 2025, up 28% from the year before. Foreclosure inventory is up by 47,000 (+25%) year over year, and foreclosure sales have increased by 2,100 (+41%) from last year's levels.<br /><br /></li>
<li><span>Government loans driving foreclosure growth:</span>&nbsp;While foreclosure activity remains muted by historical standards, the number of loans in active foreclosure again hit its highest level since early 2023, driven by a notable rise in FHA foreclosures (+59% YoY) along with a resumption of VA activity following last year's moratorium.</li>
</ul>
<p>Data as of December 31, 2025<br />Total U.S. loan delinquency rate (loans 30 or more days past due, but not in foreclosure): 3.68%<br />Month-over-month change: -4.20%<br />Year-over-year change: -0.93%</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is it about?</span></p>
<p>TSOs propose to amend how balancing service providers (BSPs) participate in the European balancing markets, by harmonising:</p>

<p>&ldquo;In particular, the launch of our banking service, fully integrated into our digital asset infrastructure is game changing, setting new standards in how institutional clients access, manage and deploy capital across digital asset markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sage Capital Management&rsquo;s new integrated financial network consists of four key pillars, which are available independently but have been designed to deliver maximum value when used together. These are:</p>
<p><b>Banking&nbsp;</b>-<b>&nbsp;</b>Launching today, Sage Capital Management&rsquo;s banking service provides clients with named, multi-currency accounts under their legal entity, with access to UK Faster Payments, SEPA, SWIFT and over 140 global currencies. This private banking style service is integrated with global payment rails from Tier 1 banks and enables clients to send and receive payments globally, just like a traditional bank account but directly connected to digital asset markets. Clients benefit by being able to move quickly between fiat and digital assets, and manage payments and FX. They can also have physical and virtual corporate Mastercard debit cards linked to their account.</p>
<p>A major feature of this new banking service is that every Sage Capital Management client receives an Embedded COO&trade; - a senior operator who acts as an extension of their business. This is the operational backbone of the service, providing clients with a true banking operations partner, not just access to an account.</p>
<p><b>Markets Access&nbsp;</b>- Providing clients with unified access to global spot, derivatives, and OTC liquidity, through a single, regulated counterparty. Sage Capital Management offers real-time settlement, unified risk, and non-internalised execution, with deep liquidity across more than 40 global venues, removing the need to onboard, fund, or manage multiple venues or liquidity providers.</p>
<p><b>Capital Engine -&nbsp;</b>Enabling clients to have centralised access to portfolio margin, institutional credit, and structured financing.&nbsp; Collateral is deployed once and used across the network, supported by Sage Capital Management&rsquo;s multi-provider capital architecture, which routes credit dynamically, maximising collateral efficiency.</p>
<p><b>The Sage Platform&nbsp;</b>- This proprietary technology development, also launching today, provides clients with a unified trading platform for liquidity, execution, margin, risk and TCA. It enables multi-venue, multi-product trading with an aggregated orderbook, advanced algos, and customisable institutional workspaces<b>.</b></p>
<p>Nathan Sage concludes, &ldquo;Our new offering sets us apart from competitors, with one integrated financial network, powered by a unified technology platform and engineered for institutional scale. We are giving institutions the ability to operate end-to-end &ndash; across banking, liquidity, capital, and technology &ndash; without friction, and are ultimately making institutional participation in digital assets more accessible than ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sage Capital Management operates within a multi-jurisdictional framework across the UK, EU and other recognised financial authorities. Banking, payments, custody and credit services are delivered through regulated entities and partners, ensuring institutional-grade governance, compliance, and operational oversight.</p>

<div>
<p class="component-text">Tokyo Stock Exchange, Inc. (TSE) has promoted English disclosure by listed companies in order to enhance convenience for overseas investors and enable them to make appropriate investment decisions based on the disclosed information. As part of this effort, TSE has been conducting surveys on the English disclosure implementation status of listed companies and providing a list of the results on its website to a wide range of people including overseas investors.</p>
<p class="component-text">The survey data is aggregated once per year and published as a report. TSE has now finalized the summary report as of the end of December 2025.<br /><br />As English disclosure became mandatory for companies listed on the Prime Market in April 2025, earnings reports and timely disclosure documents have been, in principle, disclosed simultaneously in Japanese and English. For other types of documents, the English disclosure rates of Prime-listed companies rose to 87.1% (up 4.2% year on year) for IR presentations and 94.9% (up 2.5% year on year) for notices of general shareholders meetings (notices and reference documents), showing that progress has been made in efforts that extend beyond simply meeting mandatory obligations.<br /><br />For more information, please refer to the appendix.</p>

<title>NGX Group, Lagos State, HEI Expand Project BLOOM To Alimosho, Building On Measurable Social Impact</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Nigerian Exchange Group Plc (NGX Group), in partnership with the Lagos State Government and the Health Emergency Initiative (HEI), has extended Project BLOOM (Bringing Life to Our Overlooked Minors) to Alimosho Local Government Area, continuing efforts to address child malnutrition in underserved communities across Lagos State.</p>
<p>The third outreach under the initiative, held in Alimosho within Lagos State Health District I, reached over 120 malnourished children, providing nutritional support, medical screening, and caregiver education. This follows earlier interventions in Yaba and Ajegunle, which have collectively supported over 320 children and 300 caregivers, with monitoring data showing that more than 50% of beneficiaries in the first two phases entered recovery.</p>
<p>NGX Group staff volunteers worked alongside Lagos State health workers and HEI facilitators during the outreach, assisting with screenings and data recording. Structured follow-up visits are scheduled after four weeks to monitor recovery and provide extended care where necessary.</p>
<p>Temi Popoola, Group Managing Director and CEO of NGX Group, linked the initiative to broader economic resilience. &ldquo;Sustainable capital markets are built on strong social foundations,&rdquo; he stated. &ldquo;The recovery rates we see with Project BLOOM prove that targeted, collaborative action between the public sector, civil society, and the private sector can deliver tangible impact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Executive Director of HEI, Achunine Pascal, said child malnutrition remains a major contributor to under-five mortality in Nigeria, adding that Project BLOOM is designed to go beyond immediate food support through structured follow-up and continued care.</p>
<p>Also speaking, the Chairman of Alimosho Local Government Area, Honourable Akinpelu Ibrahim Johnson, said the initiative supports the council&rsquo;s long-term strategy for improving child nutrition through early detection, prevention, and effective management of malnutrition. Representing the Permanent Secretary, Lagos State Health District I, Dr. Solomon Adeyanju commended NGX Group for its commitment to child health, describing Project BLOOM as a valuable complement to the state&rsquo;s primary healthcare efforts.</p>
<p>With additional outreaches planned, the partners reaffirmed their commitment to reducing preventable child mortality while strengthening the social foundations required for sustainable economic growth.</p>

<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>More than twenty years ago, major brokerages entered into the Global Research Analyst Settlement (GRAS) to address allegations of twelve investment banking firms&rsquo; undue influence over research analysts at the time. GRAS imposed necessary but expressly provisional restrictions, including a five-year sunset clause, while the SEC worked to build a stronger, more durable regulatory framework applicable to the full universe of firms and their research departments.</p>
<p>In a recent opinion article, former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt suggests that ending GRAS weakens safeguards against analyst conflicts. We share Mr. Levitt&rsquo;s longstanding concern for market integrity. But GRAS was never intended to be permanent&mdash;and investor protection neither begins nor ends with a single settlement. Today&rsquo;s newer rules are broader in scope, more enforceable in practice, and calibrated to new technologies that enhance information accessible by investors.</p>
<p>Since GRAS, the SEC and FINRA, which has responsibility for all investment firms that conduct analyst research, have implemented a comprehensive set of protections that directly address research analyst conflicts. Regulation Analyst Certification, for example, requires analysts to affirm that their views are their own and to disclose compensation tied to their recommendations. FINRA Rule 2241, meanwhile, governs equity research conflicts; Rule 2242 does the same for debt research. These measures surpass GRAS in scope and provide clear standards and strong oversight.</p>
<p>Mr. Levitt&rsquo;s column also does not take account of FINRA&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure that existing and future rules enable firms to produce quality and objective research in the interest of investors. As FINRA&rsquo;s CEO Robert Cook&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.finra.org/media-center/blog/global-research-analyst-settlement-retirement">emphasizes</a>, current rules exceed GRAS requirements. Where Mr. Levitt focused on GRAS firewalls that helped to shield research analysts from the undue influence of investment banking personnel, Mr. Cook explains that Rule 2241&rsquo;s provisions are intended to provide such protection, doing so with a broader scope while taking into account the complexities of different business models and unique fact patterns. Further, the SEC monitors market practices through examinations and collaboration with FINRA, targeting the very misconduct that led to GRAS.</p>
<p>Markets evolve&mdash;and regulation must keep pace. GRAS was a stopgap, not a permanent solution. Investor protection hasn&rsquo;t ended; it has advanced. Clinging to an antiquated paradigm favors nostalgia over progress. Today&rsquo;s framework surpasses GRAS in scope and provides flexibility to address the future &ndash; with investor protection top of mind.</p>

<p>The CSA strongly urges anyone receiving an email from the CSA to remain vigilant and consider the following:</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Michael S. Selig today announced he will sponsor the CFTC&rsquo;s Agricultural Advisory Committee, and the CFTC is seeking nominations to fill current vacancies on the AAC. Submissions must be received by Feb. 18.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am honored to follow the footsteps of former CFTC Chairmen and sponsor the vitally important Agricultural Advisory Committee,&rdquo; Chairman Selig said. &ldquo;Agricultural futures markets were core to the CFTC&rsquo;s humble beginning 50 years ago and continue to be a central focus today. While the CFTC&rsquo;s regulatory authority continues to evolve, we cannot forget our roots. The viewpoints of America&rsquo;s growers, producers and the broader agricultural community are essential to informing the Commission as we work to support the markets for safe, abundant and affordable food, fiber and fuel for all Americans."</p>
<p>The AAC was created to advise the Commission on agricultural derivatives market regulatory issues and priorities that are important to producers, processors, consumers, and other interested stakeholders. The AAC is authorized to submit reports and recommendations to the Commission.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The public is invited to nominate individuals for the AAC and propose potential topics to prioritize. Each nomination submission should include relevant information about the nominee, such as the individual&rsquo;s name, title, and organizational affiliation as well as information that supports the individual&rsquo;s qualifications for selection. The submission should also include suggestions for potential topics to prioritize as well as the name and email or mailing address of the person nominating the individual. AAC nominations and topic suggestions should be sent to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:AAC@CFTC.gov">AAC@cftc.gov</a>&nbsp;by Feb. 18. Submission of a nomination is not a guarantee of selection.</p>
<p><span><strong>About CFTC Advisory Committees</strong></span></p>
<p>The CFTC oversees five active&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/About/CFTCCommittees/index.htm">advisory committees</a>.

The CFTC will use the information primarily for the administration of its advisory committees and subcommittees, including as part of the member evaluation and selection process. The CFTC may also share your information externally as a &ldquo;routine use&rdquo; with, for example, committee and subcommittee Chairs and co-Chairs to conduct committee and subcommittee activities, the public as permitted or required to provide information about the committee or subcommittee and receive input regarding the work of the committee or subcommittee, and with other Federal agencies and entities as necessary for oversight, litigation, and breach response. For a complete list of routine uses, please see the CFTC's system of records notice CFTC-58 Advisory Committees, available at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/privacy">https://www.cftc.gov/Privacy</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/citation/88-FR-20146">88 FR 20146</a>.

<title>Moomoo Expands Retail Access To The BitGo IPO With Broad Subscriber Participation - 100% Of Moomoo Subscribers Who Requested Shares Received At Least One Share</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p align="left"><a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=o0E8qqI1kVlKBR5Cre7iLhkr2Mdm6tO-W7hJhdvoGYSDDGGGXzO_oByWL1oLMsWmo6UlFYzscyr3p8DAIdv1KQ==" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Moomoo">Moomoo</a>, a leading global investment and trading platform, announced expanded retail access to the Initial Public Offering (IPO) of BitGo (NYSE: BTGO)&mdash;the first crypto IPO of 2026&mdash;with moomoo accounting for just under 10% of the total offering. Moomoo investors overall subscribed for $647.6 million in BitGo shares, which is over three times the total offering, with all moomoo customers who requested shares receiving an allocation, signaling exceptional retail demand. This outcome exceeds typical retail access in competitive, oversubscribed IPOs and underscores moomoo&rsquo;s growing role in bridging retail and institutional access as IPO activity begins to reaccelerate.</p>
<p align="left">BitGo is one of the most closely watched digital asset companies to enter the public markets, and its debut reflects renewed investor interest in the crypto and digital assets sector. For years, retail participation in IPOs has been constrained by limited access. Moomoo is working to change that dynamic by expanding retail participation in high-demand offerings and providing subscribers who requested shares with a more consistent path to allocation. This approach builds on prior subscriber participation by moomoo subscribers in offerings such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=tCfKEfLUsOjqbzmu884GfjFNBQY1A4a3VXGuw9_ukCao9IGtKKVxWRqkiGRwDQu_MkT3A62E-bQk44EBgLB_uQv1SZXjd8rY-TJo0Rqv9392cBLu--jrXnBbnLPGnTHTjJ_MZgdV7VtYVOthMV1a9W_61Mrf7WsmBm_ZyuviRck=" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Bullish">Bullish</a>, Figure, and Gemini.</p>
<p align="left">&ldquo;We are pleased to work with moomoo on our IPO and to make shares available to a broad base of investors,&rdquo; said Mike Belshe, CEO of BitGo. &ldquo;Through our partnership with moomoo, we&rsquo;re expanding access to public market opportunities, which aligns with the ongoing evolution of digital assets, where broader investor participation has been a core principle from the start.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="left">In addition to IPO access, moomoo provides comprehensive research and analytical resources to support informed investment decisions. The platform offers a robust suite of tools, including moomoo AI*, an intelligent investing assistant that delivers professional-grade insights across equities, ETFs, and IPO candidates. Powered by moomoo&rsquo;s extensive data ecosystem, moomoo AI helps users analyze market trends, financial metrics, and broader macro signals related to new listings.</p>
<p align="left">&ldquo;Participating in the BitGo IPO reflects our focus on expanding access to meaningful investment opportunities for our subscribers,&rdquo; said Neil McDonald, CEO of moomoo US. &ldquo;For this offering, we focused on preparation, transparency, and execution to help users participate with confidence as the IPO market begins to reopen.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="left"><em>*Moomoo AI is an AI tool provided by Moomoo Technologies Inc. (&ldquo;MTI&rdquo;). The tool is powered by widely used, publicly available AI solutions.

<title>The EBA Updates Technical Standards To Streamline Resolution Planning And Strengthen Cooperation In Resolution Colleges</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published its updated final draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) on resolution plans and on the functioning of resolution colleges. The revisions aim to simplify and refocus resolution planning while improving the effectiveness of cooperation and coordination among authorities.</span></p>
<p>Drawing on more than a decade of practical experience, as well as insights from crisis cases and simulation exercises, the EBA has completed a comprehensive review of the RTS on resolution plans and resolution colleges, adopted in 2016 and combined under&nbsp;<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02016R1075-20160708">Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1075</a>. The updated standards revise both the structure and the content of resolution plans and enhance the operational framework for resolution colleges for cross‑border groups.</p>
<p><span>Key changes to the RTS on resolution plans and resolvability assessments include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>A more consistent and concise set of essential information for plan summaries</li>
<li>More proportionate and focused plan content, tailored to the specificities of each institution or group.</li>
<li>A clearer separation between the resolution strategy selection and the assessment of resolvability.</li>
<li>A reorganised resolvability assessment structured around seven core dimensions to ensure greater consistency and effectiveness across the EU.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Key updates to the RTS on resolution colleges aim to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Simplify processes&nbsp;to reduce administrative burden.</li>
<li>Improve cooperation and information exchange among authorities involved in planning and execution.</li>
<li>Strengthen coordination mechanisms for the implementation of resolution schemes.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Legal basis</h4>
<p>Under the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) - Directive 2014/59/EU - the EBA is mandated to specify the content of resolution plans (Articles 10 and 12), the assessment of resolvability (Article 15), and the operational functioning of resolution colleges (Article 88). The original RTS were submitted to the Commission in 2014 and adopted in 2016.</p>

<title>Bitcoin In Correction Mode: Geopolitical Tensions And The Fed Succession Puzzle - Comment From James Butterfill, CoinShares’ Head Of Research</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><b><i>James Butterfill, CoinShares&rsquo; Head of Research, comments on current market conditions in the crypto sector. His focus: the ongoing Bitcoin correction, the upcoming nomination of the next US Federal Reserve Chair, and regulatory developments in the United States.</i></b></p>
<p><b>Bitcoin Correction: Geopolitics vs. Market Psychology</b><br />Bitcoin is currently in a correction phase driven by multiple factors simultaneously. Recent geopolitical stress surrounding Greenland and renewed tariff threats, which are similar to the developments with China last October, are weighing on market sentiment. In addition, sustained selling pressure from large market participants (&ldquo;whales&rdquo;) is dragging prices lower in the short term. While the widely cited four-year cycle theory is not fundamentally convincing, it has become increasingly self-fulfilling and is contributing to the current pullback.</p>
<p>Historically, geopolitical shocks tend to follow a similar pattern: events such as the collapse of the Yen carry trade or trade-related disputes initially trigger sharp drawdowns in Bitcoin before a phase of stabilization begins. The trajectory always depends on the specific nature of the event. Against this backdrop, continued short-term pressure followed by recovery appears likely.</p>
<p><b>Fed Succession: Why the Market May Be Wrong<br /></b>A second major headwind is uncertainty around the next Federal Reserve Chair. Markets had recently priced in Kevin Hasset, currently serving as a White House adviser, however President Trump signaled that he prefers to keep him in his current role. As a result, Polymarket has moved strongly toward Kevin Warsh, who is considered a pronounced hawk and skeptical of rate cuts. This expectation is visibly influencing Bitcoin sentiment.</p>
<p>This interpretation is largely misguided: in the current environment, Warsh would be poorly aligned with Trump&rsquo;s repeatedly stated objective of monetary easing this year. A Fed Chair who would categorically rule out rate cuts does not fit the President&rsquo;s policy direction. Futures markets and prediction markets may therefore be mispricing this scenario.</p>
<p>In the short term, geopolitical risks and the Fed succession question remain defining drivers for Bitcoin. In the medium to long term, however, the familiar pattern persists of geopolitical stress causing volatility but not necessarily structural weakness.</p>
<p><b>Regulation: The &ldquo;Clarity Act&rdquo; in Limbo</b><br />On the US regulatory front, delays to the &ldquo;Clarity Act&rdquo; are becoming increasingly apparent. Originally designed to establish clear rules for stablecoins and particularly beneficial for Ethereum, is currently being blocked in the US Senate Banking Committee because of a dispute relating to the rewards that are paid to those who own stablecoins. The bill&rsquo;s original intent risks being diluted by political interests.</p>

<title>Forks In The Curve: Whether And How To Respond To Monetary Policy Divergence - Speech By Megan Greene, Bank Of England, Member Of The Monetary Policy Committee, Given At The Resolution Foundation</title>

<p>In this speech, Megan Greene argues the UK economy is shaped by choices made by other central banks, mainly the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. Using history and fresh evidence, she explains how monetary policy divergence impacts UK inflation and growth, and how UK policy should react to the domestic effects.</p>

<h2>Speech</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s wonderful to be here with you at the Resolution Foundation today. The turn of the year is a time when we often take stock of where the economy has been and look ahead to the next 12 months. It&rsquo;s this annual ritual that has motivated my remarks today.</p>
<p>As a monetary policymaker at an inflation-targeting central bank, I spend a lot of time thinking about the future path for UK inflation when setting policy. But it isn&rsquo;t just the UK&rsquo;s monetary policy that matters for the evolution of inflation&mdash;monetary policy in other jurisdictions can impact our financial conditions and economy as well.</p>
<p>We can determine how markets expect interest rates to evolve by looking at the instantaneous forward OIS curves for the US, UK and euro area (Figure 1). You can see there is difference in the level of policy rates, particularly between the US and UK on the one hand and the euro area on the other, reflecting both cyclical and structural differences in these economies. More importantly, markets are pricing continued rate cuts for the UK and US this year, while the ECB is expected to keep rates on hold. If the markets are to be believed, some monetary policy divergence will emerge in 2026.</p>

<h5>Market capitalisation of &euro;25 billion; &euro;3.8 billion raised&nbsp;</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>2<span>nd</span>&nbsp;listing on Euronext in 2026</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>World&rsquo;s largest defence IPO ever recorded</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Strengthening Europe&rsquo;s strategic autonomy through capital markets&nbsp;</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Supported by Euronext&rsquo;s initiatives to enhance financing and visibility for European aerospace and defence companies</h5>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Euronext today congratulates Czechoslovak Group (&ldquo;CSG&rdquo;), a leading defence group based in Prague, on its listing on Euronext Amsterdam &nbsp;(ticker code: CSG).&nbsp;The listing of CSG underscores the growing role of European capital markets in supporting strategic industries that contribute to Europe&rsquo;s long-term autonomy and security.&nbsp;It is the 2<span>nd</span>&nbsp;listing on Euronext in 2026 and&nbsp;the world&rsquo;s largest defence IPO ever recorded, both in terms of amount raised and market capitalization.</p>
<p>CSG is one of Europe&rsquo;s leading defence companies and a critical long-term supplier to NATO&nbsp;states and partners. It&nbsp;is the second largest medium- and large-calibre ammunition producer in Europe and the largest small-calibre ammunition producer globally. CSG sells its products to key long-term customers, ranging from government bodies to well-established companies&nbsp;in over 70 countries worldwide.&nbsp;Founded in the Czech Republic, the Group&rsquo;s global footprint comprises 39 manufacturing facilities based in the Czech Republic, India,&nbsp;Italy, Serbia, Slovakia, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States.</p>
<p>The admission and issue price of CSG shares was set at &euro;25 per share. Market capitalisation was &euro;25 billion. The Initial Public Offering (IPO) raised a total of &euro;3.8 billion&nbsp;(assuming full exercise of the Over-Allotment Option).&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Michal Strnad, Chairman, Chairman of CSG,&nbsp;said:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<em>Today marks a historic milestone for CSG as we join the Euronext Amsterdam market and we welcome the confidence shown in us by investors. Our successful listing is a testament to the hard work, dedication and ingenuity of our people, and to the trust our customers and partners place in us. Becoming a publicly listed company demonstrates our commitment to high standards of transparency, disclosure and corporate governance and strengthens our ability to invest in innovation, expand our global reach and deliver on our mission to be a critical long-term supplier of advanced defence and industrial solutions to NATO states and Government partners worldwide. We are proud of the combination of our Czech industrial heritage and our global manufacturing footprint, and we look forward to creating long term value for all our stakeholders in the years ahead.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The listing of CSG highlights the importance of Euronext&rsquo;s initiatives to improve access to financing for European aerospace and defence companies. As Europe&rsquo;s leading capital markets infrastructure, Euronext plays a vital role in connecting the financing needs of strategic industries with increasing investor interest across European markets. Through dedicated measures such as the A&amp;D Funding Days, the European Defence Bond Label, the IPOready Defence programme and the European A&amp;D Growth Hub powered by ELITE, Euronext continues to deliver tailored solutions that strengthen Europe&rsquo;s strategic autonomy and competitiveness.&nbsp;<a href="https://gbr01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.euronext.com%2Fen%2Flisting%2Fraise-capital%2Fsector-focused-listing-solutions%2Faerospace-and-defence&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cbguegan%40euronext.com%7C2c7ea3776d8c4f1562a308de0caf80bf%7C315b1ee5c224498b871ec140611d6d07%7C0%7C0%7C638962145105636072%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=FGrddPk%2F1zBSs09RyuEJfaemx75zZ4qv%2F9to98IBbl8%3D&amp;reserved=0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Learn more about Euronext&rsquo;s initiatives to enhance financing and visibility for European aerospace and defence companies</a>.</p>

<title>ASIC: Former Financial Advisor Anthony Torre Sentenced To Six Years Imprisonment For Fraud And Stealing</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The District Court of Western Australia has sentenced former financial advisor, Anthony Paul Torre, to six years imprisonment, backdated to commence on 29 January 2025. Mr Torre will be eligible for parole after serving four years of his sentence.</p>
<p>Mr Torre was sentenced in relation to three counts of stealing and two counts of fraud resulting in the misappropriation of a total of $1,030,000 of clients&rsquo; superannuation funds during the period March 2010 and January 2015, contrary to sections 378 and 409 of the&nbsp;<em>Criminal Code&nbsp;</em>(WA). Mr Torre pleaded guilty to these offences on 28 January 2025, the day his trial for these offences was due to commence.</p>
<p>Mr Torre&rsquo;s victims included a couple over the age of 60 who were defrauded $500,000 and another man over the age of 60 who had $150,000 stolen.</p>
<p>ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said, &lsquo;Mr Torre betrayed the trust of his clients and left many of them financially devastated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The sentence imposed by the Court demonstrates the seriousness of the financial harm Mr Torre caused his clients and sends a clear message that misconduct predicated on trust will not be tolerated,&rsquo; the Deputy Chair said.</p>
<p>When handing down the sentence, Judge Prior remarked, &lsquo;This was a gross breach of trust&hellip;. The victims entrusted you with some of their life savings, their superannuation&rsquo;s funds, which they&rsquo;d worked hard for over the years and were hoping to utilise or enjoy in their retirement&hellip;. The victims in each case were vulnerable because you had easy access to their money and they trusted you as a professional financial advisor... I find your offending was due to a combination of greed, incompetence and arrogance&hellip;. I must impose a sentence that will deter other professionals such as financial advisors who might be minded to think that they can use their client&rsquo;s money inconsistently and against their clients' instructions and authorities.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As a result of Mr Torre&rsquo;s conviction, he is automatically disqualified from managing companies for five years.</p>
<p>The matter was prosecuted by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) following an investigation and referral by ASIC.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>In June 2022, Anthony Paul Torre was charged with five counts of stealing and eight counts of fraud pursuant to sections 378 and 409 of the Criminal Code (WA) (<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2022-releases/22-151mr-anthony-torre-charged-with-stealing-and-fraud/?altTemplate=betanewsroom" title="22-151MR Anthony Torre charged with stealing and fraud">22-151MR</a>).</p>
<p>It was alleged that between March 2010 and January 2015, Mr Torre stole, or with intent to defraud obtained, approximately $1.882 million from his clients. It was alleged that Mr Torre used funds from his clients&rsquo; accounts for his own benefit.</p>
<p>On 28 January 2025, Mr Torre pleaded guilty to five charges (<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-006mr-anthony-paul-torre-pleads-guilty-to-fraud-and-stealing/" title="25-006MR Anthony Paul Torre pleads guilty to fraud and stealing">25-006MR</a>).</p>
<p>Under the Criminal Code (WA), the maximum penalty for each offence of stealing is seven years imprisonment, and for fraud seven years imprisonment or ten years if the person deceived is aged over 60 years.</p>

<title>SGX RegCo Seeks Feedback On Changes To Board Lot Sizes</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sgx-regco-seeks-feedback-on-changes-to-board-lot-sizes-2026123/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Singapore Exchange Regulation (SGX RegCo) is consulting the public on proposed changes to reduce the standard board lot size of certain instruments traded on SGX&rsquo;s stock market.</p>
<p>This reduction was supported by the Equities Market Review Group as part of its recommendations to strengthen the development of Singapore&rsquo;s stock market.</p>
<p>The proposed changes are:</p>
<ol>
<li>reduction in the standard board lot size from 100 units to 10 units for instruments priced above $10 and up to $100; and</li>
<li>reduction in the standard board lot size from 100 units to 1 unit for instruments priced above $100.</li>
</ol>
<p>A smaller standard board lot size will lower the minimum outlay required for investments. This makes higher-priced stocks more affordable and accessible to investors, which could in turn broaden investor participation and increase trading activity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Share prices of some of our largest stocks have risen significantly in recent years, and about 30% of trading activity now comes from stocks priced above $10. This is the segment where we want to enhance accessibility and broaden participation. By reducing the board lot size for these higher-priced stocks, we bring the minimum investment down from a few thousand dollars to just a few hundred &ndash; making such investments more within reach, especially for younger retail investors,&rdquo; said Ng Yao Loong, Head of Equities, SGX Group.</p>
<p>Separately, arising from a regular review of the stock market structure, SGX RegCo is also proposing to remove the requirement to align the minimum bid sizes of securities and futures contracts traded in Hong Kong Dollar, Renminbi or Japanese Yen to those in their home markets.</p>
<p>The consultation is found&nbsp;<a href="https://regco.sgx.com/public-consultations">here</a>&nbsp;and SGX RegCo requests all comments by 13 February 2026. If the market supports the changes, they are expected to be implemented in mid-2026.</p>

<title>ASIC: Former United Global Capital Financial Adviser Milutin Petrovic’s Ban Varied To Three Years</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Former United Global Capital (UGC) (in liquidation) financial adviser Milutin Petrovic has had a six year ban varied to three years by the Administrative Review Tribunal.</p>
<p>Mr Petrovic will be banned from providing financial services, performing any function involved in carrying on of a financial services business and controlling an entity that carries on a financial services business for three years.</p>
<p>In January 2025, Mr Petrovic sought a review of a decision to ban him for six years which was made by a delegate of ASIC. The Administrative Review Tribunal heard the matter in June and July 2025. The decision to vary the ban was issued on 11 December 2025.</p>
<p>ART&nbsp;Decision:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/cth/ARTA/2025/2717.html?context=1;query=Milutin%20Petrovic;mask_path=">Petrovic and Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission ARTA 2717 (11 December 2025)</a>.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Mr Petrovic was banned from providing financial services, performing any function involved in carrying on of a financial services business and controlling an entity that carries on a financial services business for six years effective from January 2025&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-185mr-asic-bans-former-united-global-capital-in-liquidation-financial-adviser-milutin-petrovic-for-6-years/" title="25-185MR ASIC bans former United Global Capital (in Liquidation) financial adviser Milutin Petrovic for 6 years">25-185MR</a>.</p>
<p>Mr Petrovic applied to the Administrative Review Tribunal for a review of ASIC&rsquo;s decision. Mr Petrovic also applied for stay and confidentiality orders and that application has been withdrawn. The substantive review application was heard on 30 June and 1 and 2 July 2025.</p>
<p>The banning took effect from 15 January 2025, was stayed on an interim basis on 28 February 2025, and resumed on 26 March 2025 when that stay was dissolved.</p>
<p>The banning arose from Mr Petrovic&rsquo;s role as a financial adviser of UGC.&nbsp;ASIC was concerned that UGC and its representatives gave conflicted personal advice to clients, specifically those&nbsp;advised to establish&nbsp;a self-managed superannuation fund (SMSF) and invest in highly speculative investments related to Joel Hewish (UGC&rsquo;s director). This included a company called Global Capital Property Fund Limited (GCPF).</p>

<title>ASIC: Fund Manager Sentenced To 6 Years’ Jail In $3 Million Platinum Asset Management Insider Trading Case</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-fund-manager-sentenced-to-6-years-jail-in-3-million-platinum-asset-manag-2026123/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Former investment manager Rodney Forrest has been sentenced to 6 years&rsquo; imprisonment for insider trading and procuring others to trade in more than $3 million of Platinum Asset Management Limited (Platinum) shares (ASX: PTM).</p>
<p>In August 2024, Mr Forrest secretly accessed the computer of the Chairman of Regal Partners Limited (Regal) without permission and photographed confidential takeover documents (&lsquo;Pitch Deck&rsquo;). He then traded and procured others to trade in Platinum shares before leaking details of the takeover to the media, making over $300,000 profit for himself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The Federal Court in Sydney today sentenced Mr Forrest to five years imprisonment for insider trading and two years for procuring others to trade, with one year of the procuring offence to be served cumulatively with the insider trading offence. With a total sentence of six years and a non-parole period of three years, Mr Forrest will be eligible for parole on 22 January 2029.</p>
<p>His Honour Justice Bromwich&rsquo;s sentence also took into account a further offence that Mr Forrest provided unlicensed financial services as an investment funds manager to two entities over a 9-month period.</p>
<p>This marks the first outcome for ASIC&rsquo;s new specialist insider trading team which investigated and finalised the case within 16 months of the offending. The matter was prosecuted by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) (CDPP).</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s market surveillance team detected Mr Forrest&rsquo;s suspicious trading activity in September 2024<strong>.&nbsp;</strong>ASIC&rsquo;s insider trading team quickly launched an investigation, which led to a search warrant being executed on Mr Forrest&rsquo;s home in November 2024 and charges being laid in August 2025.</p>
<p>Prior to being charged, Mr Forrest adopted an agreed statement of facts for sentence and agreed to plead guilty at the first mention of the matter in the Downing Centre Local Court. Mr Forrest also agreed to forfeit the total realised profit from his insider trading of $309,571.84. The matter was committed for sentence to the Federal Court.</p>
<p>ASIC Chair Joe Longo said the prosecution of insider trading was an enduring priority for ASIC.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr Forrest&rsquo;s actions were a brazen breach of trust and exploitation, and his imprisonment today reflects the seriousness of his crime.</p>
<p>&lsquo;While some insider trading cases can take several years, Mr Forrest went from crime to jail time in just over a year, underscoring ASIC&rsquo;s determination to fast-track criminal cases of this type.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Insider trading is a zero-sum game. When somebody profits from inside information, everyone else loses, including every Australian with a superannuation or investment account.</p>
<p>&lsquo;ASIC will continue cracking down on insider trading and other misconduct that damages market integrity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Australia is recognised globally for the integrity of its financial markets, and ASIC is determined to keep it that way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In delivering the sentence, His Honour Justice Robert Bromwich said, &lsquo;This was serious and pernicious offending.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr Forrest ... obtained the Pitch Deck deliberately and dishonestly ... what then followed in relation to the use of that information was plainly premeditated, even if it cannot be known how far in advance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr Forrest ... made a conscious choice to do something he knew was wrong, dishonest and illegal.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was a profound breach of trust to obtain that information, and an even more profound breach of trust to use it for the purpose of illegal share trading.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The whole point of the insider trading prohibition is ... to maintain the integrity of the market by creating and maintaining a level information playing field,&rsquo; His Honour said.</p>
<p>Since 2009, 46 people have been criminally convicted of insider trading following ASIC investigations, including senior executives and company chairs. The maximum penalty for the offence of insider trading is imprisonment for 15 years.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>In line with its 2025 enforcement priorities, ASIC established a dedicated insider trading team in late September 2024 to swiftly progress insider trading investigations and increase the number of criminal briefs referred to the CDPP.</p>
<p>In July 2024, ASIC released Report 787&nbsp;<em>Review of Australian equity market cleanliness</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-787-review-of-australian-equity-market-cleanliness-1-november-2018-to-30-april-2024/" title="REP 787 Review of Australian equity market cleanliness: 1 November 2018 to 30 April 2024">REP 787</a>), which found that Australia&rsquo;s equity markets continue to operate with a high level of integrity and remain consistently among the cleanest in the world.</p>
<p>While the report confirmed strong overall market cleanliness, it did identify a temporary deterioration towards the end of 2023. During this period, an increase in media reports of deal information ahead of takeover, merger and capital-raising announcements suggested potential leaks of inside information, indicating a heightened risk of insider trading at such times.</p>
<p>Management of inside information does not only matter to public companies. Industry participants involved in corporate transactions, including market intermediaries, corporate and professional advisers, fund managers and entities operating in private markets play a crucial role in supporting market cleanliness. These parties often have access to inside information and are responsible for maintaining confidentiality, supervising their representatives and handling that information with appropriate care.</p>
<p>Rodney Forrest pleaded guilty to charges in August 2025 at the first mention of the matter in the Downing Centre Local Court, following a six-month investigation by ASIC&rsquo;s insider trading team (<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-163mr-charges-laid-in-platinum-asset-management-insider-trading-case/" title="25-163MR Charges laid in Platinum Asset Management insider trading case">25-163MR</a>).</p>
<p>In the statement of agreed facts filed with the Court in August 2025, Mr Forrest admitted: that while in possession of the inside information he:</p>
<ul>
<li>Acquired around $2.69 million worth of Platinum shares between 29 August to 10 September 2024.</li>
<li>Procured two individuals and an entity (for whom Forrest was the unlicensed investment manager) to also trade in Platinum shares between 6 September to 16 September 2024, in the case of the individuals by encouraging them to buy, and in the case of the entity, by operating its trading account to purchase Platinum shares totalling $457,000.</li>
<li>Leaked the inside information to the media.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Based on the statement of agreed facts filed with the Court, Mr Forrest admitted to the following chain of events:</strong></p>

<title>Hoping For Change: Remarks At The Joint Compliance Outreach Program For Municipal Market Professionals, SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce, Washington D.C., Jan. 22, 2026</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/hoping-for-change-remarks-at-the-joint-compliance-outreach-program-for-municipa-2026122/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/hoping-for-change-remarks-at-the-joint-compliance-outreach-program-for-municipa-2026122/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good afternoon, and welcome to the second day of the Joint Compliance Outreach Program. My views are my own as a Commissioner and not necessarily those of the SEC or my fellow commissioners.</p>
<p>About 100 years ago, my hometown of Cleveland, Ohio, which sits on Lake Erie and is bisected by the Cuyahoga River, was grappling with the growing pains of a new century.&nbsp;The city had grown mightily on both sides of the river, and traffic snarled the existing thoroughfares, which only connected certain parts of the city.&nbsp;Rapid industrial growth had led to massive pollution in Lake Erie, which threatened Cleveland&rsquo;s clean water supply.&nbsp;Faced with these challenges, Cleveland did what municipalities do when encountering an infrastructure challenge: it issued municipal bonds and built.</p>
<p>To handle the traffic, Cleveland built the Hope Memorial Bridge, famous for the Art Deco statutes called the Guardians of Traffic, from which Cleveland&rsquo;s baseball team now draws its name.<a class="ck-anchor" href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-joint-compliance-outreach-program-municipal-market-professionals-012226?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;To handle the water pollution, it built the Baldwin Water Treatment Plant, a groundbreaking technological achievement at the time.<a class="ck-anchor" href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-joint-compliance-outreach-program-municipal-market-professionals-012226?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;Both structures are still standing and operating today, a testament to the importance of what is accomplished by your industry.</p>
<p>Over the past century, the physical structures of the Hope Bridge and Baldwin plant have been updated repeatedly in response to new technologies and innovations.&nbsp;While the municipal securities industry has also adopted new technologies and innovations, we must be honest: the pace of change here has often been slower than in other corners of our capital markets.&nbsp;Today I want to briefly touch on a potentially transformative innovation&mdash;tokenization&mdash;which is drawing a lot of interest in those other corners of our capital markets and may soon come to yours.</p>
<p>Tokenization offers potential benefits, including atomic settlement, facilitation of extended hours trading, and easier pledging of assets as collateral.&nbsp;Some of those benefits may not be relevant to municipal securities, but others, such as the ability to offer smaller minimum purchase amounts or the potential to enhance secondary market liquidity, may be highly appealing to municipal issuers or investors.&nbsp;As many of you likely know, the first tokenized offering of municipal securities in the United States occurred in 2024 in Quincy, Massachusetts.<a class="ck-anchor" href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-joint-compliance-outreach-program-municipal-market-professionals-012226?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" id="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wide-scale tokenization of municipal securities is not inevitable.&nbsp;Unique features of the municipal securities market&mdash;including its retail nature, the sheer number of issuers, and the complex interplay between state law, securities law, and tax law&mdash;may nullify some of the benefits of tokenization.&nbsp;Regulators are not good predictors of&mdash;let alone good drivers of&mdash; innovation. But we ought to work hard to accommodate technological change.&nbsp;So I want to extend an invitation: please come speak to us as the efforts involving tokenization&mdash;or any new technology&mdash;develop.&nbsp;Tell us when you encounter issues or rules that may be obstacles to change because they were written in an era of ink and paper, without these new technologies in mind.&nbsp;Ask us for clarity when needed.&nbsp;Do not wait until that new technology is knocking on your door.&nbsp;Come talk to us when you see it walking down the street toward you.</p>
<p>To highlight an example of what happens when our rules languish unaffected by the changing world they govern, we need only look at the recent off-channel communications cases.&nbsp;During the previous administration, the Commission brought a series of enforcement actions against broker-dealers, municipal advisors, investment advisers, and nationally registered securities rating organizations, which netted billions of dollars in penalties.&nbsp;The SEC claimed that virtually everyone had violated our recordkeeping rules by failing to capture electronic communications like text messages or WhatsApp chats.</p>
<p>I had a lot of issues with these cases, and they are, in my view, a prime example of what happens when regulators fail to accommodate technological and societal changes in how humans actually interact.&nbsp;One of today&rsquo;s discussion panels concerns enforcement, and compliance with these recordkeeping obligations may be a discussion topic.&nbsp;Rather than forcing our registrants to try to figure out how to comply with rules written for a different world, the SEC should work with industry to modernize these rules for all affected entities with a sensible pragmatism.&nbsp;The Commission, firms, investors, and other market participants are all better off when our rule books reflect the realities of the world in which we live.</p>
<p>Thank you again. I hope you have a fascinating and productive discussion today.&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>Good afternoon. Patty [Schuler], thank you for that kind introduction. Congratulations to STAC on your centennial and a hundred years of meaningful contributions to our industry. Your organization holds a special memory for me. Two days and twenty years ago, I joined a STAC panel for the first time&mdash;because who can resist the attraction of Chicago in January? After our panel ended, a friend encouraged me to head to O&rsquo;Hare, as Chicago-style winter weather was on the way. Luckily for me, I listened, and our flight took off just ahead of a slate of cancellations. I made it home late that Friday night. And on Sunday morning, my wife and I welcomed our first child to the world&mdash;four weeks ahead of schedule. Today, I wish Jack Selway a happy 20<span>th</span>&nbsp;birthday.</p>
<p>Before I say more, please understand that I speak today in my official capacity as the Commission&rsquo;s Director of the Division of Trading and Markets. My remarks do not necessarily reflect the views of the Commission, the Commissioners, or members of the Division&rsquo;s staff.</p>
<p>In 1914, Carl Sandburg published &ldquo;Chicago,&rdquo; the poem that gave your great city its well-known nickname. Sandburg wrote:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come and show me another city with lifted head singing so proud to be alive and coarse and strong and cunning.<br />Flinging magnetic curses amid the toil of piling job on job, here is a tall bold slugger set vivid against the little soft cities;<br />Fierce as a dog with tongue lapping for action, cunning as a savage pitted against the wilderness,<br />Bareheaded,<br />Shoveling,<br />Wrecking,<br />Planning,<br />Building, breaking, rebuilding . . .!&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/selway-remarks-commission-of-big-shoulders-012226?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1">[1]</a></p>
<p>More than a hundred years later, progress has replaced Chicago&rsquo;s hog butchers and tool makers with derivatives exchanges and proprietary traders. Your importance as a center for price discovery and risk management is unquestioned. Your deep global markets and expert trading community are strategic assets that ensure our Nation&rsquo;s continued economic pre-eminence. I am therefore pleased to discuss with this audience certain Division priorities for the next three years under the leadership of Chairman Atkins.</p>
<p>Returning to Sandburg, three of our projects involve &ldquo;planning and building.&rdquo; We will endeavor to create a framework for investors to access tokenized securities. We will work to further harmonize SEC rules with those of the CFTC. And we will guide our equity markets to a successful transition to 24-by-7 operation. &ldquo;Breaking and rebuilding&rdquo; describes our fourth project. Here, the Division proposes to modernize legacy rules to drive efficiency, stoke competitive forces, and reduce costs borne by the investing public.</p>
<p>Building on the work of our Crypto Task Force, the Division has engaged with market participants &ndash; both &ldquo;TradFi&rdquo; incumbents and &ldquo;DeFi&rdquo; new entrants &ndash; across the waterfront of tokenized securities operations, such as primary issuance, secondary trading, and custody. Our touchstone is &ldquo;innovation without arbitrage.&rdquo; This means that as we advise the Commission on modernizing policies to facilitate a healthy ecology for tokenized securities, we aim to do no harm to our existing, well-functioning marketplace. Before the holidays, we granted a &ldquo;no action&rdquo; letter to the DTC for its tokenized security services, and we issued staff statements on custody and trading. The Division will continue to consider staff action where appropriate and will soon take up the pen on rulemaking proposals, starting with financial responsibility, record keeping, and market structure. Importantly, we will work with self-regulatory organizations on initiatives to extend their operations to tokenized securities.</p>
<p>A second &ldquo;build&rdquo; is the SEC&rsquo;s effort to further harmonize its rules with our sister regulator, the CFTC. Here, the Division will work shoulder-to-shoulder with CFTC colleagues to ensure our Nation&rsquo;s continued leadership in financial markets, as Chairman Atkins directed us at our roundtable on September 29:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To achieve this ambitious vision, our two agencies must work in lockstep to transform dual regulation from a source of confusion into a source of strength. Together, we can offer the best of both worlds: the investor protections that have defined U.S. markets, combined with the innovation-friendly approach that will keep us at the frontier of financial technology throughout the 21stcentury.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/selway-remarks-commission-of-big-shoulders-012226?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Digital assets and event contracts squarely present opportunities for partnership. But streamlining rules for traditional markets is equally critical. Operational, capital, and compliance efficiencies await&mdash;as well as potential product and protocol innovations. Our work will be vastly improved by your ideas, and I ask that you engage the Division early and often.</p>
<p>Interest in 24-by-7 equity trading continues to grow, in terms of both retail investors and non-U.S. corporate clients attracted to the unmatched breadth and depth of our capital markets. The marketplace for global capital is already 24-by-7, as are many digital asset platforms, and our third project is to support industry initiatives to move our equity markets in this direction. Much work is required to ensure that investors understand, and benefit from, these profound changes to our collective workflow. As with any far-reaching industry effort, collaboration across the wide spectrum of market constituents is the key to success.</p>
<p>Our fourth project is focused not on the promising future, but rather on present challenges, caused by regulations of yesteryear. As we take stock of our rulebook, we find a number of walls to spackle and many weeds to pull. Regular, reasoned review of private sector obligations engendered by our rules is core to responsible regulation. Current examples of the Division&rsquo;s work here include efforts to reduce costs and improve governance of the Consolidated Audit Trail and to streamline the National Market System via modernization of Rule 611, commonly known as the &ldquo;Trade-Through Rule.&rdquo; The list of possibilities here is long. Once again, your feedback will help us prioritize and remain practical.</p>
<p>Best laid plans and multi-year projects require a healthy dose of humility. It is said that philosopher and boxing legend Mike Tyson observed that &ldquo;everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.&rdquo; And there is no tougher sparring partner than the market, as this community well knows. Quite possibly, surprises and challenges will confront the Division in coming years. Should these occur, trust that immediate demands from market exigencies will always be our priority.</p>
<p>Sandburg spoke of Chicago&rsquo;s &ldquo;lifted head singing so proud to be alive.&rdquo; Happy 100<span>th</span>&nbsp;birthday to STAC. This year, we mark our Nation&rsquo;s 250<span>th</span>&nbsp;birthday as well. So let&rsquo;s cut the cake &ndash; and celebrate. And dedicate ourselves anew to turning birthday wishes and plans and projects into an improved future circumstance that benefits the investing public that we together serve.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and attention. I look forward to your questions and your engagement on our priorities in the future.</p>

<title>SEC Approves 2026 PCAOB Budget And Accounting Support Fee</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-approves-2026-pcaob-budget-and-accounting-support-fee-2026122/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-approves-2026-pcaob-budget-and-accounting-support-fee-2026122/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today approved the 2026 budget for the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) and the related accounting support fee.</p>
<p>The 2026 PCAOB budget totals $362.1 million. The 2026 budget reflects a 9.4% ($37.6 million) decrease from the prior year and includes a 52% and 42% reduction in the chairperson and other Board members&rsquo; compensation, respectively. The accounting support fee (ASF) totals $306.0 million, an 18.4% ($68.9 million) decrease from the prior year, of which $280.3 million will be assessed on public company issuers and $25.7 million will be assessed on brokers and dealers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both during my time as a Commissioner and now as Chairman, I have recognized&ndash;and continue to recognize&ndash;the importance of driving improvements in audit quality. Nevertheless, all regulators, including the Commission and the PCAOB, must continually assess how and whether current approaches to fulfilling the Board&rsquo;s responsibilities provide benefits to investors without imposing excessive burdens on businesses. For the Commission, its diligent oversight of the PCAOB is a crucial check on the considerable authority that the Board holds over audit firms and the risks of potentially excessive burdens,&rdquo;&nbsp;said SEC Chairman Paul S. Atkins in a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-statement-pcaob-2026-budget-012226">statement</a>. &ldquo;A significant aspect of this oversight is the Board&rsquo;s budget. The PCAOB must exhibit a strong commitment to responsible stewardship of the accounting support fee, which is its primary source of funding and functions as a tax on public companies and broker-dealers. This includes being mindful of and transparent about material investments so that the Commission can appropriately exercise our budget oversight responsibilities. The decrease in this year&rsquo;s budget does not detract from the significance of the PCAOB&rsquo;s mission, which remains crucial; rather, it underscores that fiscal discipline and regulatory effectiveness complement each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This year&rsquo;s budget decrease represents progress. However, the ongoing initiatives by the Commission and PCAOB to re-assess the PCAOB&rsquo;s strategic plan, operations, and budget remain key priorities for the future,&rdquo; said SEC Chief Accountant Kurt Hohl. &ldquo;The SEC remains committed to robust oversight of the PCAOB and ensuring that its operations are transparent, justified, and worthy of the trust placed in it by investors and the public.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which established the PCAOB, provides the Commission with oversight responsibility over the PCAOB. This includes reviewing and approving the PCAOB&rsquo;s budget and accounting support fee annually.</p>

<title>Canadian Securities Administrators Reduces Regulatory Burden In Continuous Disclosure Regime For Investment Funds</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) today&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asc.ca/-/media/ASC-Documents-part-1/Regulatory-Instruments/2026/01/6265698v1-CSA-Notice-of-Amendments-8-series-re-Modernization-of-the-Continuous-Disclosure-Regime-for.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced final amendments</a>&nbsp;to modernize the continuous disclosure regime for investment funds. These amendments are designed to reduce the regulatory burden on investment fund managers while maintaining the quality and timeliness of disclosure for investors.</p>
<p>The final rules include the following key amendments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exemptions from certain conflict of interest reporting requirements in securities legislation where similar requirements are already satisfied.</li>
<li>Elimination of certain class- or series-level disclosures from investment fund financial statements that are not required under International Financial Reporting Standards.</li>
<li>Minor editorial and other revisions to the simplified prospectus form.</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;These changes reflect our commitment to making regulation more efficient and responsive,&rdquo; said Stan Magidson, CSA Chair and Chair and CEO of the Alberta Securities Commission. &ldquo;We are reducing unnecessary burden on fund managers while preserving the integrity of investor disclosure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The final rules will take effect on April 22, 2026, and are available on CSA members&rsquo; websites.</p>
<p>The original consultation published on September 19, 2024, related to these final rules also included a proposal to replace the existing annual and interim Management Report of Fund Performance (MRFP) with a new annual and interim Fund Report.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The aim of the Fund Report is to create a document that is more streamlined and significantly less burdensome for fund managers to prepare, and more likely to be read and understood by investors compared to the MRFP. Based on stakeholder feedback, the CSA will develop and test a revised Fund Report that will be published at a later date for a subsequent comment period.</p>
<p>The CSA, the council of securities regulators of Canada&rsquo;s provinces and territories, coordinates and harmonizes regulation for the Canadian capital markets.</p>

<div class="container">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The first time I flew was in my teenage years, and like many of my generation, that was a flight to Europe for a family holiday. I didn&rsquo;t make it further afield until I was in my mid to late twenties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, most, if not all of us, would think of international travel as the norm &ndash; especially given the global nature of our business.</p>
<p>It is amazing, therefore, to think that right around this time in 1970, the first jumbo jet with fare-paying passengers landed at Heathrow.</p>
<p>That flight unlocked global travel to and from the UK on a new scale &ndash; and turned Heathrow into a gateway to the world for the majority.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But with this expansion came a new issue. Airport security &ndash; the gateway into the country itself &ndash; had to be reimagined. It needed to keep pace and process passengers on a larger scale and at speed without sacrificing safety.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the FCA, we are in the same business, in a way. We protect consumers and ensure the integrity of the UK&rsquo;s financial market.</p>
<p>And our gateway is the airport security and passport control of financial services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>High standards are non-negotiable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Market participants demand them, just like we do as passengers, and they will stay away if it is not there.&nbsp;But our gateway must not be a barrier to growth.</p>
<p>We know that a thriving, competitive financial services market is the bedrock of a growing economy. Especially ours here in the UK.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, I wanted to start by emphasising that we are open for business, and welcome new applications - including those from overseas.</p>
<p>We are here to support firms &ndash; and those who advise them &ndash; as they embark on their journey to authorisation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Much like airport security, the FCA gateway is evolving to meet today&rsquo;s challenges: innovative business models, international competitiveness and new technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are working hard to handle the scale and complexity of the authorisations journey while maintaining high standards &ndash; without adding time and frustration.</p>
<p>And, while I know that some in the room may have experienced lengthy assessments in the past, we are moving more quickly.</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-misconceptions" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Misconceptions</h2>
<p>So, I&rsquo;d like to cover some common misconceptions.</p>
<p>Although we&rsquo;ve all seen &ndash; or heard about &ndash; lengthy queues and wait times, it may surprise many in this room that the average time to clear security at Heathrow was&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.cntraveller.com/article/uk-airport-security-wait-times" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)">ten minutes<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;last year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Quite impressive, since&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://mediacentre.heathrow.com/pressrelease/detail/24570" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)">84 million passengers<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>&nbsp;passed through!</p>
<p>The same mismatch between real time stats and perceived reality is true with our wait times.&nbsp;Many applicants believe it will be ages before we even consider looking at their application.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a myth I love to bust.</p>
<p>Over 99% of authorisation applications were&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/data/authorisations-operating-service-metrics-2025-26-q2.pdf" title="authorisations-operating-service-metrics-2025-26-q2.pdf">determined within statutory deadlines</a>&nbsp;in the second quarter of 2025/26. And half of all new firm authorisation applications were determined in less than four months.&nbsp;<br />Since making a substantial ongoing investment in digitising Authorisations, we&rsquo;ve seen good progress &ndash; and saved time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, digitised Forms have streamlined Senior Manager Regime application assessments. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Our most&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/data/fca-authorisations-operating-service-metrics" title="FCA Authorisations operating service metrics">recent quarterly metrics</a>&nbsp;show our median determination time for these applications was 28 calendar days, down from 39 days a year prior.&nbsp;I&rsquo;m sure such a drop in wait times would be envied in many regulatory and statutory bodies!</p>
<p>But we are not stopping there. We want to move even faster, and are accelerating our timelines to meet new statutory and voluntary targets.</p>
<p>These will shave months off the authorisation journey, and we&rsquo;ll report against them from February.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, some applicants think we stop the clock whenever we have a question &ndash; or just feel like it &ndash; to make our numbers look better.</p>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s bust another myth &ndash; it&rsquo;s not true.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can only stop the clock for two application types - senior manager or approved persons and Change in Control.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our published lower, median and upper quartile determination times show the total elapsed calendar days for each application, ignoring stop-clock periods.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These give applicants a more accurate picture of end-to-end assessment times.</p>
<p>We engage with applicants early and throughout the process by:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>keeping communication open</li>
<li>answering questions, and</li>
<li>providing regular feedback</li>
</ul>
<p>But we know this isn&rsquo;t enough.</p>
<p>Applicants want to know where they are in the process, and we&rsquo;re committed to strengthening our engagement to tell them.</p>
<p>Like Heathrow&rsquo;s plans for new baggage handling and security screening systems, we&rsquo;re streamlining how we work.&nbsp;I can&rsquo;t promise it will all be seamless, but we&rsquo;re testing new ways to improve our approach, including with new technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, we&rsquo;ve tested using generative AI to sift through large volumes of unstructured application text.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to share that our proof of concept shows it accurately extracts key facts from senior management function documents, which helps case officers evaluate applications faster.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re seeking to integrate this technology into Authorisations alongside broader work to speed up application decisions where appropriate. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We want to lead by example in deploying responsible AI, so we&rsquo;re starting as we mean to go on: with high standards, rigorous testing and an openness to new technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is critical we get this right &ndash; so it will take time.</p>
<p>And so as not to create a new myth, I can assure you that our staff will remain at the heart of all decisions.&nbsp;Our aim is to use technology simply to present the evidence for review, faster.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, we&rsquo;re moving more quickly, but we refuse to lower our standards or blindly wave people through.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t want airport security doing it, and you don&rsquo;t want us to, either.</p>
<p>For instance, an energy firm recently sought approval for long-term payment plans in relation to upgrades such as heat pumps. The plan would be tied to the customer rather than the property.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even after moving house, the consumer could remain liable for payments &ndash; a crucial detail not made clear in financial promotions. We paused the application until their website was updated. Only then was approval granted.</p>
<p>So, I implore you to remember: even when things seem to be slow, it&rsquo;s all about safety.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A spot check at the airport might annoy you in the moment, but it can be the difference between a turbulent flight and a safe landing.</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-we-re-human-too" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>We're human too</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s one more myth I&rsquo;d like to bust: that the FCA is a &lsquo;scary&rsquo; regulator that doesn&rsquo;t like to talk to people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t something we&rsquo;re blind to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Passport control and customs officers face the same perception issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Officials can fluster people, lead to things getting lost in translation, and waste valuable time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But believe it or not, the truth is that we&rsquo;re human, too.</p>
<p>Behind every authorisation decision is a real person &ndash; many of whom have worked in the industry themselves!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me included.</p>
<p>Our job is to assess applications fairly, and to support and work with you to get to the right decision. We want you to take off safely, successfully and on time. So don&rsquo;t be afraid to talk to us! It&rsquo;s what helps us ensure that we fully understand the facts of an application.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many colleagues here today who are eager to speak with you, and I encourage you to do so.</p>
<p>Conversations are a key part of our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/authorisation/pre-application-support-service" title="Pre-application support service (PASS)">pre-application support service</a>&nbsp;(PASS), which we launched in 2023 and extended to all wholesale, payments and crypto applications in April 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recently expanded it even further, including applications for targeted support.</p>
<p>In these free meetings, you can ask an FCA expert &ndash; often the one assessing your application &ndash; any question you have. I promise you, no question is too big or small, so be as open as you wish.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because of PASS, we now receive higher quality applications &ndash; resulting in faster, easier assessments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During these sessions, we have discussed everything from the application process itself to strategic launch options.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We even helped firms identify and proactively resolve legal and technical policy issues that could have otherwise impacted their applications and slowed the assessment down.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re committed to engaging with applicants early &ndash; but don&rsquo;t think you have to be at the point of applying to talk to us.&nbsp;We can adjust our level of detail as needed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, one individual came to us for clarity on the authorisation process for their proposed small business. They weren&rsquo;t ready for authorisation, but they were grateful for the realistic view of what&rsquo;s involved.</p>
<p>These conversations are just one part of our efforts to create a new relationship between regulator and regulated &ndash; one of genuine collaboration.</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-how-to-engage" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>How to engage</h2>
<p>In our January 2025&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/correspondence/fca-letter-new-approach-support-growth.pdf" title="fca-letter-new-approach-support-growth.pdf">letter to the Prime Minister</a>, we set out a number of pro‑growth measures, including several related to authorisations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, our &lsquo;Minded to Approve&rsquo; initiative.</p>
<p>We now give more firms &lsquo;in principle&rsquo; decisions earlier so they can take key next steps &ndash; like finalising capital raising or hiring key staff.&nbsp;In 2025, we gave &lsquo;minded to approve&rsquo; communications in over 250 cases. The vast majority of applications were approved shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>Second, every firm in our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/innovation/regulatory-sandbox" title="Regulatory Sandbox">Regulatory Sandbox</a>&nbsp;now has a dedicated authorisation officer to guide them through testing and authorisation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Third, we&rsquo;ve increased dedicated supervisors in Early and High Growth Oversight by 50% to help new and expanding firms navigate the regulatory landscape.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fourth, we&rsquo;re building a global network to give major international investors and firms easier access to the FCA.</p>
<p>Last year, we established a presence in the US and Asia-Pacific, which is already delivering a positive impact. This year, we&rsquo;ll expand into Singapore and beyond.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll hear more about these initiatives from Laura and Dominic, and others here today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I wanted to stress that each one of these initiatives is in place and working together to support new firms to start up, scale up and grow.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re not stopping there.</p>
<p>In October, we announced the launch of our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/authorisation/scale-up-unit" title="Scale-up Unit: supporting fast-growing, innovative firms ">Scale-up Unit</a>&nbsp;with the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) to support dual-regulated firms during rapid growth. We&rsquo;ll share details for solo regulated firms shortly.</p>
<p>As a key stakeholder in&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-for-investment-financial-services" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)">The Office for Investment: Financial Services<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>, we&rsquo;re providing tailored support to international firms looking to set up and grow their financial services operations here in the UK.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And finally, we&rsquo;re working with HMT to develop a provisional licence regime.</p>
<p>It will give firms time-limited permissions to operate in a controlled environment and under strong regulatory oversight as they work to meet the full Threshold Conditions within 18 months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, you choose to do so, we encourage you to engage and collaborate with us sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re here to help you:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>get a big picture view,</li>
<li>spot any issues you might have missed, and</li>
<li>help fix them before they turn into problems or delays</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s like identifying that rogue item in your hand luggage that just won&rsquo;t pass security. A simple adjustment, in a timely way, can make for a smoother security screening and better travel experience.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-conclusion" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>To conclude, the gateway to growth should be an open door, but also a safeguard &ndash; and that&rsquo;s exactly what we&rsquo;re building.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re here to support you and your clients and make your journey easier.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And we want to hear your thoughts on what we do well and not so well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our aim is to be a regulator that champions sustainable growth for the UK&rsquo;s consumers and economy &ndash; and we&rsquo;re always listening, learning and adapting. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Now is the time to apply for authorisation &ndash; or at least to start planning and talking to us about how best to pack your bags, manage weight limits and arrange your security tray.</p>
<p>I encourage everyone to take advantage of all our services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re here to help, so don&rsquo;t be afraid to engage with us &ndash; both today and beyond.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And have a safe flight.</p>

<title>ECB And ESRB Issue Joint Report Analysing Financial Stability Risks From Geoeconomic Fragmentation</title>

<ul>
<li>Geoeconomic fragmentation and geopolitical risk have become key sources of macro-financial uncertainty, which can affect financial stability</li>
<li>Geopolitical shocks can amplify financial stress and dampen economic growth</li>
<li>Report sets out new monitoring framework integrating geopolitical indicators into financial stability analysis</li>
</ul>
<p>The European Central Bank (ECB) and the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) today published a joint report entitled &ldquo;<a class="link-inline arrow" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/ecb.report202601_financialstabilityrisks.en.pdf?640b4328004d04797e1fd7ebf0e39aa0">Financial stability risks from geoeconomic fragmentation</a>&rdquo; with&nbsp;<a class="link-inline arrow" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/ecb.report202601_financialstabilityrisks_annex.en.pdf?28e1c9105ba3169894aaca32658aceb7">technical annex</a>, which examines how rising geopolitical risks and heightened uncertainty can affect financial stability in the euro area and across the European Union. The report identifies the key transmission channels through which geopolitical shocks can propagate to the financial system.</p>
<p>The following findings indicate that geopolitical shocks and policy uncertainty tend to lead to tighter financial conditions, financial market stress, increased risk premia and reduced loan growth.</p>
<ul>
<li>Geopolitical risks and policy uncertainty have risen markedly since the mid‑2010s, with notable increases in 2024 and 2025. At the same time, financial market volatility has remained contained or short-lived.</li>
<li>Estimates suggest that geopolitical risks lower expected growth outcomes, with significant downside tail risks for the real economy, accompanied by heightened financial stress. Geopolitical events can significantly alter the interconnectedness between bonds, commodities, equities and exchange rates.</li>
<li><a class="link-inline" id="_Hlk219704616"></a>The impact of geopolitical shocks is heterogeneous across EU Member States, whereby more open economies and those with higher public debt ratios tend to be more vulnerable to amplification effects.</li>
<li>In response to geopolitical shocks, banks and non-banks adjust their balance sheets by reducing lending, especially cross-border exposures. While this reduces the financial system&rsquo;s exposure to external shocks, it also limits international diversification.</li>
</ul>
<p>At a time of accelerating geoeconomic fragmentation and persistent geopolitical uncertainty, the ECB and the ESRB stress the importance of enhanced, more harmonised datasets, as well as complementary scenario analyses, for preserving financial stability and increasing economic resilience.<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>The report&rsquo;s insights can help policymakers and financial institutions to better detect and evaluate geopolitical risks for the financial sector and calibrate macroprudential policy responses.</p>

<title>Statement On PCAOB 2026 Budget, Paul S. Atkins, SEC Chairman, Jan. 22, 2026</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/statement-on-pcaob-2026-budget-paul-s-atkins-sec-chairman-jan-22-2026-2026122/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Commission voted today to approve the 2026 budget for the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the &ldquo;PCAOB&rdquo; or &ldquo;Board&rdquo;) and the related accounting support fee. The 2026 PCAOB budget totals $362.1 million, reflecting a 9.4 percent ($37.6 million) decrease from the prior year.<a class="ck-anchor" id="_ftnref1"></a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-statement-pcaob-2026-budget-012226?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;I support this budget and recognize its importance as an initial step in refocusing the PCAOB on its core mission.</p>
<p>Both during my time as a Commissioner and now as Chairman, I have recognized&ndash;and continue to recognize&ndash;the importance of driving improvements in audit quality. Nevertheless, all regulators, including the Commission and the PCAOB, must continually assess how and whether current approaches to fulfilling the Board&rsquo;s responsibilities provide benefits to investors without imposing excessive burdens on businesses. For the Commission, its diligent oversight of the PCAOB is a crucial check on the considerable authority that the Board holds over audit firms and the risks of potentially excessive burdens.</p>
<p>A significant aspect of this oversight is the Board&rsquo;s budget. The PCAOB must exhibit a strong commitment to responsible stewardship of the accounting support fee, which is its primary source of funding and functions as a tax on public companies and broker-dealers. This includes being mindful of and transparent about material investments so that the Commission can appropriately exercise our budget oversight responsibilities. The decrease in this year&rsquo;s budget does not detract from the significance of the PCAOB&rsquo;s mission, which remains crucial; rather, it underscores that fiscal discipline and regulatory effectiveness complement each other.</p>
<p>In 2007, during my final vote on a PCAOB budget before leaving the Commission, I highlighted two main concerns, which I will briefly revisit now.</p>
<p>The first concern was the high salaries of the PCAOB Board members, prompting me to reject the budget that year. I highlighted then that &ldquo;[t]he SEC can and must provide objective oversight with respect to the Board&rsquo;s salaries. If we do not oversee those, nobody else can.&rdquo;<a class="ck-anchor" id="_ftnref2"></a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-statement-pcaob-2026-budget-012226?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2">[2]</a>This budget, I believe, addresses this first concern, reducing the chairman&rsquo;s and other Board members&rsquo; compensation by 52 percent and 42 percent, respectively. This action demonstrates a clear commitment to aligning PCAOB Board pay more closely with the ethos of public service that reinforces trust, demonstrates fiscal responsibility, and affirms the honor of stewardship over the capital markets.</p>
<p>My second concern stemmed from the PCAOB&rsquo;s lack of a long-term strategic plan, which I firmly advocated for, and that the Commission required the PCAOB to develop starting in 2007.<a class="ck-anchor" id="_ftnref3"></a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-statement-pcaob-2026-budget-012226?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3">[3]</a>I believed then and still believe today that a robust strategic plan is necessary to ensure that the PCAOB&rsquo;s growth and budget aligns with its statutory role. Effective budgeting requires a strategic plan that considers the broader context, sets clear objectives, identifies gaps between goals and the current status, and provides an action plan with clear, transparent, and measurable benchmarks.</p>
<p>The development of an updated strategic plan is a key priority for 2026. I look forward to working with the PCAOB Board and the Commission&rsquo;s Chief Accountant to create a comprehensive strategic plan that will get the PCAOB back to basics: focusing on integrity and objectivity of the profession, reducing unnecessarily complex regulations, and re-centering this important institution on its core statutory responsibilities.</p>
<p>The Commission remains committed to robust oversight of the PCAOB and to ensuring that its operations are transparent, justified, and worthy of the trust placed in it by investors and the public.</p>
<p>I would like to thank PCAOB Acting Chairman George Botic, as well as PCAOB Board Members Kara Stein, Anthony Thompson, and Christina Ho, for their hard work in preparing this budget given the time constraints and delays caused by the government shutdown and for their responsiveness to the Commission&rsquo;s feedback.</p>
<p>I would also like to thank my colleagues at the SEC for their dedicated efforts on this matter, including:</p>
<p>Kurt Hohl, Duc Dang, Anita Doutt, Shaz Niazi, Fariba Nasary, Taylor Pross, Greg Hillson, and Mark Jacoby from the Office of the Chief Accountant;</p>
<p>Caryn Kauffman, Crystal Willis, and Adam Salazar from the Office of Financial Management;</p>
<p>Bryant Morris, Dorothy McCuaig, and Eduardo Aleman from the Office of the General Counsel; and</p>
<p>Greg Schulze and Bobby Sharma from the Office of Information Technology.</p>

While the fund is built on businesses advancing themes such as renewable energy, electromobility, medical technology, gender equality, and human rights, it goes beyond thematic exposure by focusing on active ownership and measurable impact. This leads to long-term value creation potential with clear impact objectives.</p>
<p>With this launch, SIX further broadens its offering of actively managed and impact-oriented ETFs for Swiss and international investors. Inyova SICAV is the first new ETF issuer to join SIX Swiss Exchange in 2026, following a record-breaking 2025 with over 300 new products listed and seven new issuers onboarded. SIX Swiss Exchange now hosts 36 ETF issuers offering more than 2,100 ETFs, underscoring its position as one of Europe&rsquo;s most dynamic and diverse ETF marketplaces.&nbsp;Ultumus, a SIX company, provides critical infrastructure services supporting the Inyova ETF's operational workflow for this launch.</p>
<p>Dr. Tillmann Lang, chairman and co-founder of Inyova, elaborates: &ldquo;With this ETF, we enable investors to pursue their financial goals while achieving sustainability impact and staying fully aligned with their values. By listing our ETF at SIX, we are making our active impact approach more accessible, giving private and professional investors a diversified, research-driven portfolio of companies that drive positive environmental and social outcomes with the potential for long-term value creation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Danielle Reischuk, Senior ETFs &amp; ETPs Sales Manager, SIX Swiss Exchange, adds: &ldquo;We are delighted to welcome Inyova SICAV as a new ETF issuer at SIX Swiss Exchange. Their impact-driven, actively managed approach enriches the spectrum of sustainability-oriented investment solutions available on our marketplace. This listing underscores our commitment to offering a robust, efficient venue for innovative issuers and providing investors with access to differentiated strategies.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Bursa Malaysia Integrates Corporate Governance Ratings On MyBURSA To Drive Informed Investment Decisions</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Bursa Malaysia Berhad (&ldquo;Bursa Malaysia&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Exchange&rdquo;) today announced that the independently assessed Corporate Governance (CG) Ratings for Public Listed Companies (PLCs) on the MAIN Market and ACE Market are now published on the MyBURSA platform. This enhancement enables investors and market participants to access each PLC&rsquo;s CG Rating, further advancing market transparency and strengthening the appeal of Malaysian companies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ratings are derived from assessments conducted by the Minority Shareholders Watch Group (MSWG), in its capacity as the Domestic Ranking Body, using the ASEAN Corporate Governance Scorecard (ACGS) methodology which is aligned with the G20/OECD Principles of Corporate Governance, and endorsed by the ASEAN Capital Markets Forum (ACMF). This will enable investors to compare governance standards across markets in line with international standards and best practices.</p>
<p>Julian M Hashim, Chief Regulatory Officer of Bursa Malaysia said: &ldquo;With the CG Ratings now accessible on MyBURSA, investors can evaluate the governance standards of PLCs alongside other key data points, enabling more holistic risk assessments and long‑term value analysis. For PLCs, the visibility of CG Ratings serves as a benchmark for continuous improvement and enhances their competitiveness in attracting domestic and global capital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By integrating the CG Ratings into MyBURSA, complementing the ESG Ratings already available on the platform, Bursa Malaysia aims to elevate governance standards, encourage continuous improvement among PLCs, and enhance the attractiveness of Malaysia&rsquo;s capital market to investors through the provision of comprehensive, decision‑useful and comparable information,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>MSWG&rsquo;s assessment is based on publicly disclosed information, including Annual Reports, Corporate Governance Reports, Sustainability Reports, and other relevant information available in the public domain.</p>
<p align="left">More information on the ACGS methodology and scorecard is available on MSWG&rsquo;s website: <a href="https://mswg.org.my/analytics/">https://mswg.org.my/analytics/</a><a href="https://mswg.org.my/analytics/">.</a></p>

</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row-with-picture">
<div class="detailText">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group and Allfunds have jointly entered into a binding agreement on the terms of a recommended acquisition by Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group (the &ldquo;Acquisition&rdquo;).&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Under the terms of the Acquisition, each Allfunds shareholder will be entitled to receive &euro;8.80 per Allfunds share to be delivered as follows: &nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<ul class="rte--list">
<li>&euro;6.00 per Allfunds share in cash; &nbsp;</li>
<li>0.0122 new Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group shares per Allfunds share, representing &euro;2.60 per Allfunds share based on the volume-weighted average price of &euro;213.40 per Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group share for the ten-day period ended on 26 November 2025; and &nbsp;</li>
<li>a permitted cash dividend of up to &euro;0.20 per Allfunds share (excluding those in treasury) for the financial year 2025.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition, Allfunds shareholders will also be entitled to receive certain further permitted dividends in respect of subsequent financial periods.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The consideration payable under the Acquisition values Allfunds at approximately &euro;5.3 billion and represents a premium of 32.5 percent to the closing price of &euro;6.64 per Allfunds share as at the close of business on 26 November 2025 and a premium of 40.3 percent to the volume-weighted average price for the three-month period ended 26 November 2025 of &euro;6.27 per Allfunds share.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Acquisition is to be effected by means of a Court-sanctioned scheme of arrangement between Allfunds and Allfunds shareholders under Part 26 of the UK Companies Act 2006, requiring the approval by a majority in number representing not less than 75 percent in value of Allfunds&rsquo; Scheme Shareholders present and voting, either in person or by proxy, at the Court meeting.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Allfunds Directors unanimously support the Acquisition and intend to recommend unanimously that Allfunds shareholders vote in favor of the Acquisition.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group has received irrevocable undertakings in support of the Acquisition in respect of 292,376,083 Allfunds shares in aggregate, representing approximately 48.9 percent of the issued share capital (excluding treasury shares) of Allfunds as at 20 January 2026.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group has received irrevocable undertakings to vote in favor of the Scheme at the Court meeting and the resolutions to be proposed at the Allfunds general meeting from LHC3 Limited and BNP Paribas, who hold &nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<ul class="rte--list">
<li>215,907,812 and 76,441,271 Allfunds shares, respectively, representing approximately, &nbsp;</li>
<li>36.1 percent and 12.8 percent, respectively, of the issued share capital (excluding treasury shares) of Allfunds as at 20 January 2026. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group has also received irrevocable undertakings to vote in favor of the Scheme at the Court Meeting and the resolutions to be proposed at the Allfunds general meeting from each of the Allfunds Directors, who hold 27,000 (or, on or prior to the Effective Date, will hold) Allfunds shares, in aggregate representing approximately 0.005 percent of the issued share capital (excluding treasury shares) of Allfunds as at 20 January 2026.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Acquisition represents a highly compelling opportunity to create a truly global world class player in fund services that will combine the companies&rsquo; complementary global footprints with the distribution strength of Allfunds and the custody and settlement capabilities of Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group&rsquo;s Clearstream Fund Services segment.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Allfunds Group and Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group bring excellent complementarity in their respective product suites, client bases, partners, and the key markets served by each of them and the combination is ideally placed to benefit from a number of robust secular growth trends and excel in an evolving industry. &nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The combination and its strategic rationale also align with the interest of Europe and the Savings- and Investments Union (SIU). It strengthens the demand side of the capital markets by bringing end investors closer to investment fund products in an efficient and seamless way and allowing for wider choice of products. The Acquisition is expected to deliver substantial benefits for the European investment fund industry and establish a harmonized platform with global reach, better positioned to support the allocation of retail savings into productive capital solutions such as investment funds. &nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Following the Acquisition, the combined group will benefit from a broader geographic footprint, enhanced reach and a complementary suite of products and expertise, strengthening its ability to serve clients across the fund value chain and supporting accelerated growth. &nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The two businesses also exhibit significant synergy potential which is expected to be delivered across the fund value chain, including fund distribution, custody, settlement and other value-added services such as data and regulatory reporting, enabling provision of best-in-class services to their clients and further enhancing the capacity for innovation, particularly in the digitalization of the fund value chain. Driven by strong secular industry trends, Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group sees double digit revenue growth potential for the combined business in the mid- to long-term.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Annabel Spring, CEO of Allfunds</strong>&nbsp;said: &ldquo;Over the past 25 years, Allfunds has democratised access to investment funds around the world and shaped the wealth management industry. We have grown to be a leading global distribution and dealing platform connecting distributors with fund partners across 66 countries. The combination of deep expertise and exceptional client service and innovation, from alternatives to blockchain, have made Allfunds what it is today. With Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group, our complementary footprints and capabilities create a world-class player with global reach and local relationships, which will better support distributors and fund partners, and propel the wealth management industry forward. The board of Allfunds is confident that the offer represents a compelling opportunity for Allfunds shareholders to realise value, delivering an attractive premium, in cash and shares, allowing future participation in the benefits of the combination.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Stephan Leithner, CEO of Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group</strong>&nbsp;said: &ldquo;We are very pleased to announce the acquisition of Allfunds, which is to be unanimously recommended by its Directors and is supported by its two largest shareholders. We believe that the combination of Allfunds Group's technical expertise and entrepreneurial drive with Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group's capabilities within Clearstream Fund Services will create a leading business in the sector, which better serves the needs of clients, supporting the continuing development of the funds sector in Europe and around the world. This acquisition represents the next step in the development of Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group as a European champion in providing critical infrastructure to the financial markets. It is a testament to our strategy of 'Leading the transformation&rsquo;.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Having analyzed the potential benefits of the Acquisition based on its deep experience of operating in the funds market, Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group believes that the combined group will be able to achieve annual run rate pre-tax cost synergies of approximately &euro;60 million, representing approximately 15 percent of the combined cost base of Allfunds and Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group&rsquo;s Clearstream Fund Service segment. In addition, Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group expects to realize annual run-rate cash savings on capital expenditure of approximately &euro;30 million. &nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These synergies will primarily be delivered through the implementation of the combined operating model across core services, a streamlined regulatory and IT set-up and simplifications of central functions. &nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group expects to deliver approximately 50 percent of the total annual-run-rate synergies, including both cost and capital expenditure savings, by year-end 2028. &nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Reflecting the compelling financial rationale of the transaction, the Acquisition is anticipated to deliver on an annual run-rate basis high single-digit accretion to Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group&rsquo;s Cash EPS within the first full year following completion of the Acquisition, consistent with Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group's disciplined approach to capital deployment and its key financial criteria for value-accretive M&amp;A. Following completion, Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group expects to maintain its AA- long-term rating at the Group level. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group has fully committed funding in place to finance the cash portion of the consideration under the Acquisition.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group plans to start the share buy-back program announced on December 9, 2025 in February 2026 shortly after the publication of the Preliminary Results Q4 and FY 2025. In the period up to end of July 2026, shares of the company at a total cost of up to &euro;500 million will be repurchased. &nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Subject to the receipt of applicable regulatory approvals, the completion of the Acquisition is anticipated to occur in the first half of 2027.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"></div>
<div class="paragraph">

<title>Finansinspektionen Withdraws The Authorisation Of Get Betal</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/finansinspektionen-withdraws-the-authorisation-of-get-betal-2026121/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Finansinspektionen withdraws the authorisation of the payment institution Get betal AB. The company has, in part, provided inaccurate information to FI in its application for authorisation. The decision applies immediately.</span></p>
<div class="editor-content">
<p>Get betal AB (Get betal or the company) is a payment institution that is authorised to provide the payment service money remittance pursuant to Chapter 1, section 6 of the Payment Services Act (2010:751). The company offers money remittance services to, among other countries, Somalia, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda and Turkey, and has notified Finansinspektionen that it conducts cross-border operations in 15 countries within the EU/EEA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In January 2025, Finansinspektionen opened an investigation into Get betal&rsquo;s operations. As part of the investigation, the authority has reviewed the company&rsquo;s compliance with several central provisions of the Payment Services Act and provisions in other regulations that govern the company&rsquo;s business. The investigation shows that the company has been in violation of several of these provisions. Finansinspektionen also reviewed information the company submitted in conjunction with its application for authorisation to conduct business pursuant to the Payment Services Act. This review shows that the company at that time submitted inaccurate information which had a direct impact on the authority&rsquo;s decision to grant the company authorisation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pursuant to Chapter 8, section 11 of the Payment Services Act, Finansinspektionen shall withdraw a payment institution&rsquo;s authorisation if the institution has received the authorisation by submitting inaccurate information. If sufficient, the authority may instead issue the institution a warning. Finansinspektionen makes the assessment &ndash; in part due to the violations that otherwise were identified during the investigation &ndash; that a warning is not a sufficient measure. Get betal&rsquo;s authorisation shall thus be withdrawn. This decision will go into effect immediately.</p>

<title>MNI Indicators - Chicago Business Barometer™ - MNI Chicago Report: December 2025 Seasonal Adjustment Revisions - December Revised Lower  - Weaker Activity In First Quarter Of 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The December Chicago Business BarometerTM was  revised by -0.8 point to 42.7 in December from 43.5,  due to the annual seasonal adjustment recalculation.</p>
<p>Growth in the first half of the year was slightly weaker  than previously estimated as the Barometer in Q1 was  revised 0.7 point lower led by weaker New Orders and  Production indicators. In contrast, activity in the second  and third quarters was a touch stronger than previously  estimated.

<p><a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=6wNKVQBiRrcAwox8aKmJAZXknTfU_ArX9UFYJmfufejxiOe1GM-ePBY7Ni7QfnbZKzCJKf9Jmcl6QFhuZ3iEmG8qNYKGNCaGJer0kAVVDUORy2iAlVOqOPU88hlu1YlJ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="CUSIP Global Services">CUSIP Global Services</a>&nbsp;(CGS) today announced the release of its CUSIP Issuance Trends Report for December 2025. The report, which tracks the issuance of new security identifiers as an early indicator of debt and capital markets activity over the next quarter, found sharp monthly decreases in request volume for new corporate and municipal identifiers. On an annualized basis, total identifier request volume surged in 2025 versus 2024 totals.</p>
<p>North American corporate CUSIP requests totaled 6,723 in December, which is down 21.6% on a monthly basis. On an annualized basis, however, North American corporate requests were up 7.1% over December 2024 totals. Requests for new U.S. corporate equity identifiers fell 3.9% and requests for new U.S. corporate debt identifiers declined 37.7% for the month of December.</p>
<p>The aggregate total of identifier requests for new municipal securities &ndash; including municipal bonds, long-term and short-term notes, and commercial paper &ndash; fell 20.2% versus November totals. On a year-over-year basis, overall municipal volumes were up 14.6% through the end of December. Texas led state-level municipal request volume with a total of 105 new CUSIP requests in December, followed by New York (81) and California (60).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monthly CUSIP request volume may have dropped off significantly in December, but when we take a look back at 2025 in total, we see a significant increase in new issuance activity across most major asset classes, including corporate debt and equity and municipal securities,&rdquo; said Gerard Faulkner, Director of Operations for CGS. &ldquo;As we head into the New Year, with uncertainty over interest rates and the broader economy still looming, the first few months of request volume in 2026 will provide valuable insight into how issuers are thinking about the markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Requests for international equity CUSIPs fell 1.3% in December and international debt CUSIP requests fell 15.8%. On an annualized basis, international equity CUSIP requests were up 12.4% and international debt CUSIP requests were up 10.6%.</p>

<p>During an official Ring the Bell ceremony held at the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (LuxSE) yesterday, a delegation of the leadership of Banco de Ahorro y Credito FONDESA, S.A (BANFONDESA) and the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (LuxSE) gathered together to mark the listing of BANFONDESA&rsquo;s DOP 250 million (equivalent to EUR 3.3 million) sustainability bond on LuxSE.</p>
<p>Supported by technical assistance from the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) and financing from the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg through the Global Trust Fund (GTF), this milestone marks the first sustainability bond ever issued by a Dominican issuer, reinforcing the growing momentum behind sustainable investment in emerging markets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>We are honoured to welcome BANFONDESA and its pioneering sustainability bond to the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. This transaction highlights the important role capital markets can play in mobilising private capital to support microfinance, green investment and social inclusion, and reaffirms our commitment to supporting issuers from emerging markets in accessing international investors</i>,&rdquo; said Arnaud Delestienne, Chief Commercial Officer and Member of the Executive Committee at LuxSE.</p>
<h4>A milestone for sustainable development in the Dominican Republic</h4>
<p>Exclusively dedicated to supporting microfinance and sustainable development in the Caribbean nation, the proceeds of the bond will finance micro- and green loans across key sectors including renewable energy, energy efficiency, sustainable transportation and agriculture. The bond will also finance social projects promoting the growth of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p>Initially listed on the Bolsa de Valores de la Rep&uacute;blica Dominicana (BVRD) in November 2024, the bond also expected to benefit vulnerable communities by improving access to essential services such as energy, water, housing, healthcare and education.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>This bond is not the end of a journey &ndash; it is the beginning of a new era that symbolises trust, partnership and the belief that inclusive green finance can transform lives in the Dominican Republic. We will continue to scale green lending, strengthen climate</i><i>‑</i><i>risk tools, and deepen our partnership with the European Investment Bank and Luxembourg &ndash; a country whose leadership in sustainable finance is shaping real change on the ground</i>,&rdquo; said Cristian Reyna, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors at BANFONDESA.</p>
<p>A long-standing partner of BANFONDESA, the European Investment Bank (EIB) has supported the institution since 2008 through targeted financing to expand access to finance for low-income clients, particularly women, in the Dominican Republic. This partnership was further strengthened in 2018 through an EIB senior loan, aimed at financing green projects for BANFONDESA&rsquo;s clients under the ACP Cotonou Investment Facility and the creation of BANFONDESA Renovable. The loan was complemented by significant technical assistance to support women-focused and environmentally sustainable projects, helping pave the way for the issuance of BANFONDESA&rsquo;s first sustainability bond.</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><span>Annual Resolution Report highlights the FSB&rsquo;s ongoing efforts to strengthen the global resolution regimes for banks, insurers and financial market infrastructures.</span></li>
<li><span>The FSB will undertake further work to support members addressing critical challenges, such as funding in resolution and effective bail-in execution, particularly in cross-border contexts.</span></li>
<li><span>The FSB</span><span>&nbsp;is planning to launch a strategic review of its crisis preparedness activities to ensure that they remain well aligned with emerging risks and changes in the financial sector.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) today published its&nbsp;<a class="custom-internal-link processed-internal-link" href="https://www.fsb.org/2026/01/2025-resolution-report-from-plans-to-practice-operationalising-resolution/">2025 Resolution Report</a>, which reviews global progress in implementing resolution reforms and enhancing crisis preparedness across the financial sector. The report also sets out the FSB&rsquo;s priorities for 2026 to advance the operationalisation of resolution frameworks.</p>
<p>Foundational resolution frameworks are now mostly in place, with significant progress in operational planning and resolvability assessments.</p>
<p>In 2025, the FSB focused on supporting resolution authorities&rsquo; operational readiness by publishing a practices paper on transfer tools, which shares insights and draws lessons from past resolution cases. The FSB also supported knowledge sharing on funding in resolution and advanced work on bail-in execution by forming a dedicated task force. Additionally, the FSB published draft guidance to promote consistency in determining which insurers should be subject to recovery and resolution planning requirements.</p>
<p>Dominique Laboureix, Chair of the Single Resolution Board, and Chair of the FSB Resolution Steering Group, said &ldquo;This Resolution Report highlights the progress achieved in 2025 in enhancing crisis readiness across banks, insurers and CCPs. In 2026, we will build on this momentum, focusing on removing remaining challenges to cross-border bail-in execution and funding in resolution, and advancing cross-sector information sharing and collaboration to further strengthen global financial stability.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the FSB plans to conduct a peer review on public sector backstop funding mechanisms and to publish a practices paper on funding in resolution to further support operational planning. The FSB is also planning to launch a strategic review of its crisis preparedness activities. The review will aim to ensure the FSB&rsquo;s crisis preparedness activities reflect emerging vulnerabilities and structural changes in the financial system as well as to strengthen coordination among the FSB and standard-setting bodies with crisis preparedness mandates.</p>
<p>The FSB has also published an&nbsp;<a class="custom-internal-link processed-internal-link" href="https://www.fsb.org/2026/01/good-practices-for-crisis-management-groups-revised-version/">update to the&nbsp;<em>Good Practices for Crisis Management Groups</em></a>, which was first issued in 2021. The supplementary information aims to enhance crisis coordination between home and host authorities outside of crisis management groups.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Background</h2>
<p>The 2025 Resolution Report has been prepared by the FSB Resolution Steering Group, which is the primary global forum for the development of global standards and guidance on resolution regimes and recovery and resolution planning for systemically important financial institutions. ReSG is chaired by Dominique Laboureix, Chair of the Single Resolution Board.</p>
<p>Crisis Management Groups of global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) have been in place for over 10 years as a core part of the post global financial crisis coordination infrastructure. According to the FSB&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em><a class="custom-internal-link" href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/04/key-attributes-of-effective-resolution-regimes-for-financial-institutions-revised-version-2024/">Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions</a></em>&nbsp;Key Attribute 8, home and key host authorities of all G-SIBs should maintain CMGs to enhance preparedness and facilitate the management and resolution of cross-border financial crises.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FSB coordinates at the international level the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies and develops and promotes the implementation of effective regulatory, supervisory, and other financial sector policies in the interest of financial stability. It brings together national authorities responsible for financial stability in 24 countries and jurisdictions, international financial institutions, sector-specific international groupings of regulators and supervisors, and committees of central bank experts. The FSB also conducts outreach with approximately 70 other jurisdictions through its six Regional Consultative Groups.</p>
<p>The FSB is chaired by Andrew Bailey, Governor of the Bank of England. The FSB Secretariat is located in Basel, Switzerland and hosted by the Bank for International Settlements.</p>

<p>Professor Mervyn E. King , a famous advocate for corporate governance, once said that &ldquo;Governance is about leadership. A board should be a thought partner to management, not just a compliance officer&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Why I start with this quote is to make the point that corporate governance starts from the top of the corporate body, the Board.</p>

<title>CFTC Chairman Selig: America’s Financial Markets Are Ready For A Golden Age</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cftc-chairman-selig-americas-financial-markets-are-ready-for-a-golden-age-2026120/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cftc-chairman-selig-americas-financial-markets-are-ready-for-a-golden-age-2026120/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>We are at a pivotal moment in the evolution of American financial markets. Advances in technology are enabling the creation of entirely new products, platforms and business models, in turn transforming the financial services landscape as we know it.</span></p>
<p><span>And thanks to President Donald Trump&rsquo;s leadership, Congress is now on the cusp of enacting the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, which would provide long-overdue regulatory clarity to an American industry that embodies the promise of the future.</span></p>
<p><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has an important role in developing the rules for this new frontier of finance. The CFTC was initially formed to promote orderly operations in markets for the future delivery of agricultural products. But as innovation has enabled capital to reach ever greater efficiencies, policymakers have recognized that the agency with experience regulating everything from pork bellies to credit default swaps is uniquely capable of overseeing novel and emerging markets.</span></p>
<p><span>Today, innovators are leveraging technologies such as blockchain and artificial intelligence not just to modernize legacy financial systems, but also to build new ones. The same spirit that drove American farmers to cultivate the Great Plains inspires today&rsquo;s entrepreneurs to leave traditional finance behind and conquer new, unexplored territories.</span></p>
<p><span>Anyone with a smartphone and an internet connection can access blockchain-native financial markets that are peer-to-peer and open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. Meanwhile, advancements in artificial intelligence are making it possible to uncover methods for hedging risk even the savviest professionals would overlook. These technologies are lowering barriers to entry, expanding risk-management tools and allowing market participants to tailor strategies to their individual needs and preferences. The excitement surrounding the infinite possibilities created by these technologies is palpable, and we are witnessing increased participation in markets the prior administration sought to overlook&mdash;or eliminate altogether.</span></p>
<p><span>Instead of developing guardrails that foster ingenuity, the Biden administration focused on regulation by enforcement&mdash;subjecting novel products such as digital assets and perpetual futures to legacy rules that could not fit the product, but could fit the prosecutor. This aversion to innovation sent many of the most enterprising businesses offshore, and everyday Americans paid the price.</span></p>
<p><span>Under my leadership, the CFTC is charting a new course.</span></p>
<p><span>Despite the prior administration&rsquo;s missteps, America is still home to the greatest innovators, and our markets remain the deepest and most liquid in the world. Legacies like these are built over decades, but they cannot stand on their own. The CFTC and other financial regulators must develop clear and fit-for-purpose regulations that allow entrepreneurs to build new things, while continuing to protect the public from fraud, scams and market manipulation.</span></p>
<p><span>To future-proof the CFTC for tomorrow&rsquo;s innovations, the agency&rsquo;s regulations must adapt to meet our nation&rsquo;s builders where they are. That is why I have launched the &ldquo;Future-Proof&rdquo; initiative. While decades-old rules designed for agricultural futures contracts may still suit those markets today, they do not contemplate nascent products or trading venues. Just as American businesses are modernizing legacy financial systems by harnessing new technologies, the CFTC must upgrade its approach to unleash innovation. As part of this initiative, the CFTC&rsquo;s staff will undertake a comprehensive review of the agency&rsquo;s existing rules and regulations and modernize these requirements to ensure a level playing field for new entrants and incumbents alike.</span></p>
<p><span>As new asset classes emerge and the CFTC&rsquo;s role evolves, guidelines we establish should not just fit the product, but also serve a tailored regulatory purpose. Prediction markets have exploded in popularity as broad swaths of market participants seek to hedge portfolio risks and test their abilities to forecast truth. Similarly, the digital asset economy has grown from a mere experiment in cryptography to a more than $3 trillion market with ever greater types of assets being generated on blockchain networks.</span></p>
<p><span>Should Congress deliver on making America the crypto capital of the world and send digital asset market structure legislation to the president&rsquo;s desk, the CFTC will have a broad set of new responsibilities. Pass us the torch, and we will ensure that these markets flourish at home with tailored regulatory frameworks that keep American markets the best in the world.</span></p>
<p><span>Arbitrary, cumbersome and opaque rules will not stand the test of time. The CFTC&rsquo;s approach should be to deliver the minimum effective dose of regulation&mdash;nothing more and nothing less. This means an end to policymaking through enforcement. And this means the agency&rsquo;s policymaking divisions will develop clear rules of the road for market participants that will be codified through notice-and-comment rulemaking to ensure that the regulatory requirements do not change wildly from administration to administration.</span></p>
<p><span>The president has assembled a remarkable team in the financial regulatory space, of which I am humbled to be a part. To achieve the golden age of American financial markets, as the president might call it, regulators must break with the rigid and restrictive regulatory practices of the past. The CFTC will seize this generational opportunity to modernize and future-proof its approach to regulation and ensure that the great innovations of today and tomorrow are made in America.</span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>He explained that the QFMA continues to implement its strategy derived from the Third Financial Sector Strategy, which is aligned with Qatar National Vision 2030 and the State&rsquo;s Third National Development Strategy.

<p><span><span><span><span>Dr. Tami Al-Binali highlighted the close cooperation between the QFMA and the QSE, noting that this collaboration represents an integrated model that contributes to enhancing market liquidity and stimulating new listings, while ensuring that growth is underpinned by clear regulatory frameworks, effective disclosure, and the highest standards of investor protection.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>He stressed that the participation of both the QFMA and QSE in this year&rsquo;s Davos Forum reflects the State of Qatar&rsquo;s commitment to continuing the development of its financial markets in line with global best practices, and to strengthening its role as a transparent and efficient regional financial center capable of attracting long-term investments.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>For his part, Mr. Abdulla Mohammed Al Ansari, Chief Executive Officer of Qatar Stock Exchange, emphasized that QSE is playing a central role in advancing Qatar&rsquo;s economic diversification and strengthening the competitiveness of its capital market. He noted that the Exchange is undergoing a comprehensive transformation that focuses on enhancing market liquidity, improving investor access, expanding investment products &ndash; including debt instruments and ESG aligned offerings &ndash; and upgrading digital market infrastructure.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Mr. Al-Ansari explained that QSE&rsquo;s participation in Davos reflects its commitment to broadening the investor base, deepening international connectivity, improving market efficiency, enhancing regional and global cooperation, and showcasing the growing investment opportunities available in Qatar&rsquo;s capital market.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>He added: &ldquo;Qatar Stock Exchange continues to advance initiatives that deepen liquidity, expand the product diversity, integrate sustainability and ESG standards. These efforts support the objectives of the Third Financial Sector Strategy and position Qatar&rsquo;s capital market as a transparent, resilient, and investor-friendly environment capable of attracting long-term global capital.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Mr. Al-Ansari reaffirmed that ongoing coordination with the Qatar Financial Markets Authority and relevant stakeholders remains essential to ensuring market growth within clear regulatory frameworks, strengthening investor confidence, and enhancing connectivity with global markets&mdash;thereby reinforcing Qatar&rsquo;s position as an advanced regional financial center aligned with international best practices.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The panel discussion featured an in-depth exchange on the pivotal role of the QFMA as the regulatory body responsible for governance, oversight, regulatory supervision, and investor protection, and of Qatar Stock Exchange as the principal securities trading venue in the State of Qatar.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>During the discussion, Qatar&rsquo;s experience in developing its capital markets was highlighted, including the achievement of key milestones that have contributed to transforming the market into a dynamic platform attractive to local, regional, and international investors, through deepening liquidity, enhancing transparency, and reinforcing the State of Qatar&rsquo;s position as a trusted investment destination focused on sustainable growth.</span></span></span></span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="paragraph">The Luxembourg Stock Exchange (LuxSE) today announced the acquisition of a business line from Tetrao International, specialised in the extraction of large amounts of sustainable bond data points from a wide range of sources.</p>
<p class="paragraph">&ldquo;<i>This acquisition is a strategic move for the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and demonstrates our unwavering commitment to providing structured and meaningful sustainable bond data. Investors need access to reliable data to make informed investment decisions, and given our long-term strategy in this field, we consider it important to have full oversight of the data collection process and strategy. We have successfully worked with Tetrao for a number of years and see great potential in its technology and expertise</i>,&rdquo; commented Julie Becker, CEO of LuxSE.</p>
<p><b>Large scale data collection powering the LGX DataHub</b></p>
<p>Tetrao powers its technology with artificial intelligence to provide data services including data point extraction, data collection and automatic browser agents. Using proprietary machine learning algorithms combined with generative AI large language models and powerful computer vision, Tetrao&rsquo;s technology implements agents that simulate human behaviour to identify, read and understand complex information from websites and documents, while ensuring the highest quality standard thanks to processes that seamlessly blend human expertise, AI predictions and end-to-end auditable data decisions.</p>
<p class="paragraph">LuxSE initially acquired a minority stake in Tetrao in January 2021 and has relied on the start-up&rsquo;s data collection services to accelerate the development of its market-leading sustainable bond data offering since then. As part of the acquisition, Tetrao&rsquo;s highly experienced ESG data analytics team will join the LuxSE Group and continue to extract and collect sustainable bond data points for the Luxembourg Green Exchange (LGX), using the specialised knowledge, technology and proprietary tools developed by Tetrao. Tetrao will remain a key technology provider for the LuxSE Group.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Pierre Schoonbrodt, CFO of LuxSE, served as board member of Tetrao International: &ldquo;<i>We look forward to bringing Tetrao&rsquo;s ESG data analytics unit into the LuxSE Group. The team offers unique expertise in the field of data collection and has a deep understanding of our processes and business needs</i>. <i>Thanks to the advanced technological solution which was developed for our specific area of activity, this acquisition will strengthen our data services and open opportunities to expand into new areas.&rdquo;&nbsp;</i></p>
<p class="paragraph"><b>A natural next step for Tetrao</b></p>
<p class="paragraph">Tetrao was created by Christian Gillot in Luxembourg in 2014 and started its commercialisation in 2017. In 2019, Tetrao launched an R&amp;D project for the investment fund industry that collected daily documentation and relevant metadata on 85,000 instruments of the fund industry.</p>
<p class="paragraph">The start-up then went on to develop specialised services in the field of sustainability data collection.

<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailhost.mondovisione.com:4443/daymergroup.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Daymer Group</a>, a leading independent fiduciary and consulting company providing services to the Asset Management industry, is expanding its footprint and opening an office in the Dubai International Financial Centre, UAE. The Dubai office is regulated by the DFSA and will be led by senior finance professional Mike Davis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Headquartered in the Cayman Islands, Daymer Group&rsquo;s core business is sourcing experienced, highly competent Independent Non-Executive Board Members for the Asset Management industry (funds, structured products, corporate structures and family offices). In addition, Daymer Group provides consulting and fractional CEO/CFO/COO services. The firm&rsquo;s clients manage over USD 12Bn in AUM.</p>
<p>Daymer Group&rsquo;s directors and consultants include former C-suite executives, partners and senior leaders from multiple sectors, providing independent insight and advice, ensuring improved governance standards and credibility for its clients. The Daymer Middle East team includes Martin Homberger, who led Barclays Bank's ME regional Compliance and Financial Crime functions, with previous experience at Deutsche Bank and Clifford Chance, Mark Emmerson with over 40 years of banking and trade finance experience, and Simon Calder who recently served for six years as the Deputy CEO and Chief Operating Oﬃcer for HSBC in the UAE.

<p><b>Daymer Group Founder&nbsp;</b>Richard Scott-Hopkins said: &ldquo;With existing offices in London and Cayman, Dubai was the logical third location for Daymer Group. New and established Asset Managers are moving to the UAE to take advantage of the attractive tax regimes, developed regulatory network and to be closer to their current and potential investors. Several of our existing clients are moving people or opening offices in the UAE and they have asked Daymer to support them.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Director Mike Davis</b>&nbsp;commented: &ldquo;As the Middle Eastern asset management industry continues to evolve, managers and their investors are putting a higher value on truly independent advice and support. Daymer team members are not only highly qualified themselves, but they can also call on the experience and know-how of the wider, global Daymer Director Network.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="bw-subheadline-wrapper">
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li><span><i>Record 2.4BN Derivative Contracts Traded in 2025 with Record ADV of 9.3M, +13% and +14% vs Previous Records Set in 2024</i></span></li>
<li><span><i>Record NYSE Equities ADV +40% at 3.35BN shares and Record NYSE Options ADV of 10.5M</i></span></li>
<li><span><i>Open Interest Across ICE Ends 2025 +17% vs 2024 With Highest OI in ICE&rsquo;s History set on December 11, 2025, of 113.4M</i></span></li>
<li><span><i>Single Day trading records at NYSE Equities and NYSE Options set in 2025 of 7BN and 18M, respectively</i></span></li>
<li><span><i>ICE&rsquo;s NYSE systems process single day records of 1 trillion+ messages twice in 2025 showing strength of ICE&rsquo;s world-leading technology and infrastructure</i></span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE: ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today announced record milestones reached in 2025 across its world leading derivative and NYSE equity and NYSE options markets.</p>
<p>A record 2.4BN futures and options were traded across ICE&rsquo;s global derivatives markets in 2025, surpassing the previous record trading volumes set in 2024 by 13%. ICE also saw record average daily volumes (ADV) across its markets in 2025 of 9.3M, +14% versus 2024.</p>
<p>Open interest (OI) across ICE&rsquo;s markets ended 2025 at 102.7M, +17% versus the end of 2024. ICE&rsquo;s markets reached their highest open interest in ICE&rsquo;s history on December 11, 2025, at 113.4M, with ICE&rsquo;s benchmark Brent futures market hitting record open interest on December 22, 2025, at 3.2M and ending the year with OI across Brent futures and options +22% at 6M and with record volume of 383.6M.</p>
<p>In 2025, ICE experienced record volumes across its benchmark commodity, energy and interest rate markets, with a record 1.4BN, 1.3BN and 891M contracts traded respectively, with record commodities ADV +13% at 5.4M, record energy ADV +15% at 5M and record interest rates ADV +19% at 3.5M vs 2024. ICE&rsquo;s markets are the largest and most liquid in the world to trade commodities, energy and European interest rate derivatives, routinely offering the most capital efficient venues to trade these products due to the margin offsets available when customers have a well-diversified portfolio. Offsets can be as high as 99% for a well-balanced trading portfolio across energy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in 2025, ICE&rsquo;s New York Stock Exchange equity and options markets experienced their single highest trading days in NYSE history with 7BN shares and 18M NYSE Options traded respectively on a single day, as well as setting new record ADV across NYSE Equities of 3.35BN, +40% vs 2024 and record ADV across NYSE Options of 10.5M, +12.6%.</p>
<p>"ICE&rsquo;s derivatives markets and its equity markets at NYSE set multiple milestones in 2025 reflecting the strength, resilience and capacity of ICE&rsquo;s technology and infrastructure,&rdquo; said Ben Jackson, President of ICE. "For over 25 years, ICE has continually invested in building its technology and markets for the benefit of its customers, methodically building a network of markets to provide the breadth of tools, the supporting data and the infrastructure our customers need to manage their risk as precisely and extensively as they wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2025 Benchmark volume highlights set on ICE included:</p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li>Brent, WTI, Gasoil, Total Oil, TTF, Total Natural Gas, Environmentals, Euribor and SONIA all traded at record levels across futures and options, with Brent ADV +11% in 2025 at 1.5M, ICE WTI ADV +10% and ICE Gasoil ADV +8%.</li>
<li>Total Natural Gas ADV +18% at 1.9M in 2025, with TTF ADV +22% and North American Natural Gas ADV +15% vs 2024.</li>
<li>ICE&rsquo;s U.S. Financial Gas markets traded at record levels in 2025 surpassing the previous record year set in 2024 by 17% with 61.5M traded, and reaching the highest open interest in ICE&rsquo;s history on October 31, 2025, of 12.7M.</li>
<li>ICE&rsquo;s U.S. Power markets traded at their highest levels in ICE&rsquo;s history during 2025 with a record 7.8BN MWh traded, with volumes + over 30% vs 2024.</li>
<li>ICE&rsquo;s NGL markets traded at record volumes through 2025, +39% vs 2024 with 12.5BN barrels traded, with open interest ending 2025 +29%.</li>
<li>Record Interest Rates ADV in 2025 at 3.5M, +19% vs 2024, with record Euribor ADV of 2M +8% and record SONIA ADV of 921K, +28% vs 2024, with Euribor OI ending 2025 +40% vs 2024.</li>
</ul>
<p>2025 highlights across ICE&rsquo;s equity markets at the New York Stock Exchange -- the world&rsquo;s largest equities exchange and the gold standard for trading technology -- included:</p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li>4 of the top 5 highest volume days in NYSE Equities trading history occurred in 2025, setting new single day trading record of 7BN shares.</li>
<li>25 highest NYSE message traffic days occurred in 2025 - on two occasions ICE&rsquo;s NYSE systems processed over 1 trillion messages in a single day.</li>
<li>19 of the top 20 highest volume days in NYSE Options trading history occurred in 2025, setting new single day record of over 18M.</li>
<li>3 largest closing auctions in NYSE history occurred in 2025, setting new single day auction record of over $205BN in value traded.</li>
</ul>
<p>The NYSE Closing Auction remains the single largest daily liquidity event in U.S. cash equities trading, combining the NYSE's state-of-the-art Pillar trading technology with direct market maker facilitation to produce key anchor prices for listed companies which are used for a variety of applications including valuation benchmarks, index calculations, and regulatory reporting.</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority: Regulators Give Clarity In Relation To Open Banking Pricing Models</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-financial-conduct-authority-regulators-give-clarity-in-relation-to-open-bank-2026120/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-financial-conduct-authority-regulators-give-clarity-in-relation-to-open-bank-2026120/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The FCA has issued a joint statement with the Payment Systems Regulator (PSR) giving clarity on open banking pricing models.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We and the PSR have issued the following&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/corporate/fca-psr-prioritisation-commerical-variable-recurring-payments-ukpi.pdf" title="Joint prioritisation statement: commercial variable recurring payments &ndash; UKPI scheme">statement (PDF)</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This confirms we will not, at this stage, prioritise a Competition Act 1998 (CA98) investigation into the centralised &lsquo;access fee&rsquo; pricing model being developed by the UK Payments Initiative (UKPI) for commercial Variable Recurring Payments (cVRPs). &nbsp;</p>
<p>cVRPs are an emerging open banking technology that allow consumers to give trusted third parties secure, recurring access to manage payments on their behalf. They have the potential to offer consumers and businesses control and convenience, while enabling lower-cost, more flexible payment options for businesses.</p>
<p>After engaging with the funders of the UKPI, we and the PSR worked at pace to clarify our enforcement position on the UKPI&rsquo;s proposal for a commercial model and consulted with the CMA about our planned non-prioritisation statement given concurrency arrangements. The statement will give UKPI certainty to continue developing its cVRP product &ndash; including for certain regulated financial services, utilities and public sector payments &ndash; without delay. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This supports our strategy to make cVRPs a reality, giving people more control over their payments and lower processing fees for businesses. &nbsp;</p>
<p>On 15 January 2026, we and the PSR&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/correspondence/fca-psr-letter-cma-open-banking-commercial-variable-recurring-payments.pdf" title="Joint FCA and PSR letter to CMA on open banking commercial variable recurring payments">wrote to the CMA (PDF)</a>&nbsp;to set out our position. &nbsp;</p>
<p>On 16 January 2026, the CMA&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/review-of-banking-for-small-and-medium-sized-businesses-smes-in-the-uk#commercial-variable-recurring-payments---letter-to-the-fca-and-psr" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Letter to the FCA and PSR | Competition Markets Authority (opens in a new window)">confirmed to us and the PSR<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;that, based on the information available to it, it does not intend to take a different position on CA98 prioritisation to that of us and the PSR. &nbsp;The CMA is keen to ensure that businesses are not deterred from collaborating in ways that may be beneficial to consumers or the wider economy because of uncertainty about how competition law applies. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Bridge to a long-term framework</h2>
<p>This is a temporary measure ahead of the government&rsquo;s anticipated legislative framework, expected by the end of 2026. It applies until that framework is in place or until July 2027, whichever comes first.</p>
<p>During this period, we and the PSR will continue to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monitor market developments</li>
<li>Review any changes to the pricing methodology.</li>
<li>Expect UKPI to submit its finalised governance documents. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>All 3 competition authorities &ndash; the FCA, PSR and CMA &ndash; may revise their prioritisation approach if new information emerges or if the expected legislative framework is not implemented by July 2027.</p>

<div class="RichText   ">
<p>LSEG Risk Intelligence has unveiled its new Sanctioned Securities Data File (SSDF), a granular, instrument-level dataset engineered to help financial institutions identify and manage securities with direct or indirect links to sanctioned entities.</p>
<p>Developed in partnership with BIGTXN, a recognised leader in advanced data analytics, the SSDF links global sanctions designations and ownership and control relationships directly to financial securities, providing a structured view of how sanctions translate into real exposure at the instrument level.</p>
<p>Early analysis from the dataset shows that approximately one-third of all sanctions-linked instruments are captured through ownership and control pathways, rather than explicit legal designations. For example, a company may not be sanctioned itself, but if a sanctioned parent owns or controls it, the securities it issues still fall within scope.</p>
<p>Further analysis indicates that sanctions exposure is not confined to historic or inactive positions. Around six in ten sanctions-linked instruments identified through the SSDF remain active, underscoring that sanctions risk represents an ongoing operational challenge for trading, investment and post-trade teams.</p>
<p>At the instrument level, sanctions impact is concentrated in the mechanisms of capital formation and corporate restructuring. Rights and entitlements, debt instruments and structured products collectively account for approximately 80% of sanctions-linked issuance, demonstrating that exposure is embedded within market infrastructure rather than isolated to traditional equity listings.</p>
<p>From a jurisdictional perspective, Russia-imposed measures continue to dominate the sanctions-instrument landscape, accounting for approximately 60% of affected issuance. Sanctions regimes administered by the European Union, United States, New Zealand and Ukraine also contribute materially to the volume of impacted instruments, highlighting the growing importance of managing sanctions exposure across multiple jurisdictions simultaneously.</p>

<div class="RichText   ">
<p>As global sanctions regimes expand, diverge and update at increasing frequency, firms face mounting complexity in determining whether the securities they trade, hold or service fall within regulatory scope. The Sanctioned Securities Data File systematically links sanctions designations from LSEG&rsquo;s World-Check platform to real, tradable instruments enabling compliance teams to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Detect exposure beyond simple name‑based lists</li>
<li>Screen across multi‑asset‑class portfolios</li>
<li>Embed structured sanctions intelligence into front‑to‑back workflows</li>
<li>React faster to evolving geopolitical and regulatory developments</li>
</ul>
<p>Chris Moyser, Head of Strategy at LSEG Risk Intelligence, comments:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sanctions regimes today extend far beyond simple lists of designated names. Financial institutions need a systematic way to understand how those designations translate into real exposure across securities, ownership structures and corporate actions. The Sanctioned Securities Data File is designed to bring that clarity - helping firms identify risk that is often difficult to detect using traditional screening approaches.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="VerticalSpacing VerticalSpacing--m">
<div class="RichText   ">
<p>What is the Sanctioned Securities Data File (SSDF)?<br />The Sanctioned Securities Data File (SSDF) is an instrument-level dataset from LSEG Risk Intelligence that links global sanctions designations and ownership and control relationships directly to financial securities. It is designed to help financial institutions identify and manage sanctions exposure across global markets.</p>
<p>Why does ownership and control matter for sanctions exposure?<br />Sanctions regimes increasingly apply through ownership structures and control relationships, not just through direct designation of issuers. This means a security may be linked to sanctions even if the issuing company is not explicitly sanctioned, provided it is owned or controlled by a sanctioned entity.</p>
<p>What does &ldquo;ownership and control relationships&rdquo; mean in practice?<br />Ownership and control relationships refer to situations where a sanctioned entity owns, controls or exerts influence over another company. In these cases, the securities issued by the non-sanctioned company may still fall within sanctions scope due to that relationship.</p>
<p>What proportion of sanctions-linked securities are connected through ownership and control?<br />Early analysis from the Sanctioned Securities Data File shows that approximately one-third of sanctions-linked securities are connected through ownership and control pathways, rather than direct legal designation alone.</p>
<p>Are sanctions-linked securities still actively traded?<br />Yes. Analysis indicates that around 60% of sanctions-linked instruments identified through the SSDF remain active, highlighting that sanctions exposure is an ongoing operational consideration rather than a purely historical issue.</p>
<p>Which types of financial instruments are most affected?<br />Sanctions-linked exposure is concentrated in rights and entitlements, debt instruments and structured products, which together account for approximately 80% of sanctions-linked issuance identified in the dataset.</p>
<p>Which jurisdictions contribute most to sanctions-linked securities exposure?<br />Russia-imposed measures account for the largest share of sanctions-linked securities identified. Sanctions regimes administered by the European Union, United States, New Zealand and Ukraine also contribute materially to the affected instrument universe.</p>
<p>How does the SSDF differ from traditional sanctions screening?<br />Traditional sanctions screening typically focuses on matching names against sanctions lists. The SSDF goes further by systematically linking sanctions designations and ownership and control relationships to financial instruments, enabling firms to identify indirect exposure that may not be visible through name-based screening alone.</p>
<p>Who is the Sanctioned Securities Data File designed for?<br />The SSDF is designed for financial institutions involved in trading, investment management, custody, clearing, settlement and risk management that need to identify and manage sanctions exposure across securities and portfolios.</p>
<p>How is the Sanctioned Securities Data File delivered?<br />The dataset is delivered via a centralised, structured data feed that can be integrated into existing compliance, risk and trading workflows. It supports screening across a broad range of asset classes and is updated in line with evolving global sanctions designations.</p>
<p>What does this analysis show about the future of sanctions risk?<br />The findings highlight that sanctions risk is increasingly embedded in the structure of financial markets through ownership, control and instrument design. This underscores the need for more granular, instrument-level approaches to sanctions screening and exposure management.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li> New industry champions to turn rapid AI adoption into safe, scalable growth. &nbsp; </li>
<li> Around three-quarters of UK financial firms already use AI, with the technology expected to boost the economy, cut costs for&nbsp;firms&nbsp;and transform services for customers.&nbsp; </li>
<li> Champions will focus on helping firms seize opportunities at pace while protecting consumers and financial stability, reporting directly to the Economic Secretary.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<p>AI is already widely used across financial services, with around three-quarters of UK firms now deploying AI, up sharply from just over half in recent years. Independent analysis suggests AI could add tens of billions of pounds to the financial and professional services sector by 2030, as well as transforming services for consumers, underlining both the pace of adoption and the scale of the opportunity ahead.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>The new Champions, Harriet Rees from Starling Bank and Dr Rohit Dhawan from Lloyds Banking Group, will help turn this momentum into practical delivery through their extensive experience of working in this field. They will report directly to the Economic Secretary Lucy Rigby - helping firms seize the&nbsp;huge potential&nbsp;of AI in financial services, and exploring ways to accelerate safe adoption at scale, identify where innovation can move faster, and tackle barriers holding firms back. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Their focus will be on ensuring firms can seize the opportunities AI presents with confidence &mdash; improving customer outcomes, boosting productivity and competitiveness, and maintaining trust, resilience and strong consumer protection &mdash; while reinforcing the UK&rsquo;s position as a global hub for financial services, technology and investment. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Economic Secretary to the Treasury Lucy Rigby KC MP said:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="last-child">Harriet and Rohit bring deep, real-world experience of deploying AI safely at scale, and they will help turn rapid adoption into practical delivery &ndash; unlocking growth while keeping our financial system secure and resilient.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Harriet Rees, Group Chief Information Officer &ndash; Starling Bank, said: </strong></p>

<p class="last-child">Being appointed AI Champion for Financial Services is an exciting opportunity as the sector faces a pivotal moment to become a world leader in AI. I look forward to working with HM Treasury and the industry to create a world-class ecosystem in which innovation exceeds customers&rsquo; expectations and the transformative power of AI unlocks growth. In turn, this will reinforce the UK&rsquo;s status as the world&rsquo;s most technologically advanced financial centre.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Dr Rohit Dhawan, Head of AI and Advanced Analytics &ndash; Lloyds Banking Group, said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="last-child">It is a privilege to have been asked by HM Treasury to take on the role of AI Champion for financial services. AI has the potential to reshape the industry and at Lloyds Banking Group we are already seeing how thoughtful and responsible adoption of AI can transform customer experience and the way a large organisation operates. I look forward to working with HM Treasury, regulators and industry partners to accelerate the trusted and effective use of AI across financial services and support the UK&rsquo;s ambition to remain a global leader in financial innovation.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Harriet Rees is Group Chief Information Officer at Starling, where she leads data, engineering, information security and product development. Having joined Starling in 2018 to found its Data Science practice, she now defines and delivers the Group&rsquo;s technology strategy, including oversight of information and technology assets and ensuring operational resilience at scale. Harriet also plays a leading role in shaping the future of AI in financial services as Co-Chair of the Bank of England&rsquo;s AI Taskforce and a member of the AI Consortium. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr Rohit Dhawan is Group Director and Head of AI &amp; Advanced Analytics at Lloyds Banking Group, a role he has held since 2024. He is responsible for shaping the Group&rsquo;s strategy and roadmap for AI, machine learning and advanced analytics.

<p>Leading regulated digital prime broker&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.gc.exchange/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">GCEX (GCEX Group)</a>&nbsp;serving institutional and professional clients across the UK, EU and UAE, has added Gold Futures CFDs to its product range.</p>
<p>Offering Futures CFDs further strengthens GCEX&rsquo;s multi-asset capabilities, supporting clients seeking greater flexibility in how they manage market exposure. Additional Futures CFDs will follow shortly, marking the next step in GCEX&rsquo;s continued expansion across traditional and digital asset classes.</p>
<p>This addition provides an alternative structure to rolling spot instruments and non-expiring CFDs by offering exposure within a clearly defined contract period. The initial release includes the GCG26 contract (February 2026 Gold Future), giving clients access to CFDs that reference the price of underlying exchange-listed futures.</p>
<p>Lars Holst, CEO of GCEX, said: &ldquo;The introduction of Gold Futures CFDs reflects the ongoing development of our product suite and our commitment to supporting client requirements across both traditional and digital markets. Our focus is on offering institutional-grade instruments underpinned by robust regulatory governance across all GCEX entities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Futures CFDs carry a defined end date (the expiry date), viewable in GCEX&rsquo;s XplorTrader platform. Priced according to the futures curve, these products embed cost-of-carry elements directly into the contract structure, eliminating overnight financial charges. Clients must close their positions before expiry; otherwise GCEX will automatically close the position at the final settlement price to ensure seamless outcome.</p>
<p>GCEX Group empowers institutional and professional clients to access deep liquidity in CFDs on digital assets and FX, alongside spot trading and conversion of digital assets. The company also offers a comprehensive range of Forex brokerage and crypto-native technology solutions under its XplorDigital suite.

True Global Ventures are investors in GCEX.<span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul>
<li><span>Over AED 500k awarded to date and AED 1.5mn confirmed in upcoming challenge value</span></li>
<li><span>Ignyte&rsquo;s challenge-led initiative reinforces Dubai&rsquo;s position as a launchpad for next-generation Web3 start-ups</span></li>
<li><span>Multi-party partnership with Binance, CoinW, Ripple Labs, Solana and Ton Foundation underpin the programme</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Ignyte - the region&rsquo;s leading global digital start-up ecosystem, has successfully concluded major programmes culminated in a landmark Demo Day at the Museum of the Future, where selected start-ups presented their solutions before a panel of industry leaders, investors, and global partners. The challenge tracks were delivered in partnership with du Business, Solana, TON Foundation and Avalanche, providing start-ups with both capital incentives and direct exposure to global innovation ecosystem.</p>
<p>As part of the initiative, Ignyte and Solana&rsquo;s regional community delivered a developer-focused engagement series, providing hands-on opportunities for experimentation, collaboration, and solution testing, which were showcased at the Demo Day.</p>
<p>Building on this momentum, Ignyte is advancing a robust pipeline of forthcoming challenge tracks, with an indicative aggregated value exceeding AED 1.5mn by H1 2026. So far AED 500,000 has been awarded, and the next phase reflects planned contributions totalling AED 1mn. (USD 285,000), involving prominent global and regional partners.</p>
<p>Partners include, Binance, CoinW, Ripple Labs, Solana, and Ton Foundation, established to strengthen Web3 infrastructure within Ignyte ecosystem. Through this multi-party collaboration, start-ups gain access to high-performance, low-cost blockchain networks, liquidity insights, and exchange exposure.</p>
<p><span>Mohammad Alblooshi, Chief Executive Officer of DIFC Innovation Hub, said:&nbsp;</span>"Dubai has become the region&rsquo;s foremost global hub innovation, with DIFC at the centre of this transformation. Ignyte exemplifies our commitment to empowering the region&rsquo;s most promising start-ups and blockchain pioneers by providing them with world-class infrastructure, expertise and networks to accelerate their growth. By bringing together industry leaders we are opening direct access to global blockchain ecosystems, removing barriers to entry, and enabling visionary entrepreneurs to build, launch, and scale the future of Web3 - right here in Dubai, for markets across the region and globally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This first-of-its-kind multi-party challenge initiative marks a new chapter for Ignyte as a bridge between global blockchain ecosystems and the UAE's innovation economy, further reinforcing Dubai&rsquo;s role in shaping the future of Web3 on a global stage.</p>

<p class="component-text">Traditionally, Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) has published the number of listed shares around the 20th of each month, along with factors influencing changes such as capital increases, stock splits, and the exercise of subscription warrants.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC is seeking feedback on a proposal to remake a relief instrument to extend the exemption for securitisation entities from holding an Australian financial services (AFS) licence.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2016L00457/latest/text"><em>ASIC Corporations (Securitisation Special Purpose Vehicles) Instrument 2016/272</em></a>&nbsp;(the Instrument) is due to expire on 1 April 2026.</p>
<p>ASIC proposes to remake the Instrument on largely the same terms for a period of five and a half years.</p>
<h2>Providing feedback</h2>
<p>Please send your submissions to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:rri.consultation@asic.gov.au">rri.consultation@asic.gov.au</a>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<strong>5pm AEDT on Friday 20 February 2026.</strong></p>
<p>Refer to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/consultations/cs-43-proposed-extension-of-instrument-relieving-securitisation-entities-from-holding-an-afs-licence/" title="CS 43 Proposed extension of instrument relieving securitisation entities from holding an AFS licence">CS 43&nbsp;<em>Proposed extension of instrument relieving securitisation entities from holding an AFS licence</em></a></p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2016L00457/latest/text">ASIC Instrument 2016/272</a>&nbsp;exempts a securitisation entity from holding an AFS licence where it holds the securitisation product as a custodian or trustee or is issuing a securitisation product to:</p>
<ul>
<li>an AFS licence holder</li>
<li>an entity that is exempted from holding an AFS licence, or</li>
<li>a wholesale client.</li>
</ul>
<p>Under the&nbsp;<em>Legislation Act 2003</em>, legislative instruments are repealed, or &lsquo;sunset&rsquo;, after 10 years, unless ASIC acts to preserve them.</p>
<p>The Instrument was made in 2016 to continue the relief provided by class orders [CO 04/1526] and [CO 05/1270].</p>

<title>ASIC Secures Nearly $40 Million In Refunds To Investors And Drives Change After CFD Sector Falls Short</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-secures-nearly-40-million-in-refunds-to-investors-and-drives-change-after-2026119/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-secures-nearly-40-million-in-refunds-to-investors-and-drives-change-after-2026119/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC has secured the return of nearly $40 million to more than 38,000 retail investors and driven substantial compliance improvement across Australia&rsquo;s contracts for difference (CFD) sector following a whole of industry review.</p>
<p>CFDs allow investors to speculate on the price movements of assets such as shares, currencies or commodities, without owning them. Between October 2024 and December 2025, ASIC reviewed 52 licensed CFD issuers, requiring them to show how they were distributing their high-risk products.</p>
<p>In the report,&nbsp;<em>Risky business: Driving change in CFD issuers&rsquo; distribution practices</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-828-risky-business-driving-change-in-cfd-issuers-distribution-practices/" title="REP 828 Risky business: Driving change in CFD issuers&rsquo; distribution practices">REP 828</a>), ASIC found widespread weaknesses in how CFD issuers complied with their design and distribution obligations (DDO),&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2022-releases/22-082mr-asic-s-cfd-product-intervention-order-extended-for-five-years/" title="22-082MR ASIC&rsquo;s CFD product intervention order extended for five years">ASIC&rsquo;s CFD product intervention order (PIO)</a>&nbsp;and regulatory reporting requirements.</p>
<p>ASIC found that more than half the CFD sector had contravened the PIO by offering &lsquo;margin discounts&rsquo; to retail clients who took on opposing long and short positions. These investors incurred higher funding costs but could not profit from their opposing CFD positions.</p>
<p>ASIC Commissioner Simone Constant said, &lsquo;Each year, thousands of Australians lose money trading CFDs and through our review we have helped put $40 million back in the pockets of more than 38,000 investors.</p>
<p>&lsquo;These are complex, high-risk products, where most investors face losses, and even profitable trades can be entirely eroded by trading costs.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>Driving improvement in distribution and compliance practices</h2>
<p>&lsquo;ASIC&rsquo;s direct intervention has driven widespread improvements in CFD issuers&rsquo; target market determinations, client onboarding questionnaires, reporting compliance and monitoring of client trading outcomes,&rsquo; Ms Constant said.</p>
<p>Key changes in CFD issuers&rsquo; distribution practices and compliance arrangements achieved in ASIC&rsquo;s review include:</p>
<ul>
<li>39 issuers made changes to their target markets</li>
<li>46 issuers improved website content, with one issuer amending almost 1,000 webpages</li>
<li>44 issuers improved their client onboarding questionnaires, with many issuers making substantial changes</li>
<li>42 issuers implemented new processes for ongoing monitoring of client trading outcomes and behaviours, or made significant improvements to existing processes</li>
<li>48 issuers implemented changes to comply with their over-the-counter (OTC) derivative transaction reporting requirements, after the review identified over 70 million erroneous reports</li>
<li>Reportable situations lodged by issuers increased by 127% compared to the previous year, reflecting greater compliance awareness and responsiveness.</li>

<p>Ms Constant said, &lsquo;While the CFD industry has made important changes, there&rsquo;s still work to do. Issuers must continually monitor, adapt, and strengthen their compliance practices, and we urge Australians to pay close attention to what they are being offered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;ASIC will continue to act decisively, and where appropriate, will take further action to address misconduct and reduce consumer harm.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Driving better outcomes for consumers of financial products and services, including high-risk products, such as CFDs, is one of ASIC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/markets/market-supervision/asic-s-priorities-for-the-supervision-of-market-intermediaries/" title="ASIC&rsquo;s priorities for the supervision of market intermediaries">2025-26 priorities for supervising market intermediaries</a>.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>CFDs are complex, leveraged, over-the-counter (OTC) products that can expose retail investors to significant losses. They allow clients to speculate on the change in value of assets like shares, currencies and commodities. Leverage and associated financing fees can magnify investor losses. A small price change against a leveraged CFD position can have a big effect on trading returns or losses, even loss of the entire investment.</p>
<p>In the 2024 financial year alone, 68% of retail CFD investors lost money, totalling more than $458 million, including $73 million in fees.</p>
<p><a href="https://moneysmart.gov.au/">ASIC&rsquo;s Moneysmart website</a>&nbsp;has further information about&nbsp;<a href="https://moneysmart.gov.au/investment-warnings/contracts-for-difference-cfds">CFDs</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://moneysmart.gov.au/investment-warnings/forex-trading">forex trading</a>.</p>
<p>The DDO, which commenced in October 2021, are intended to help consumers obtain appropriate financial products by requiring issuers and distributors to have a consumer-centric approach to the design and distribution of products.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s review built on two earlier reviews undertaken between 2022 and 2024 of CFDs issuers&rsquo; distribution practices and reports setting out better practices for meeting their obligations and areas for improvement:</p>
<ul>
<li>Report 770&nbsp;<em>Design and distribution obligations: Retail OTC derivatives</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-770-design-and-distribution-obligations-retail-otc-derivatives/" title="REP 770 Design and distribution obligations: Retail OTC derivatives">REP 770</a>)</li>
<li>Report 795&nbsp;<em>Design and distribution obligations: Compliance with the reasonable steps obligations</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-795-design-and-distribution-obligations-compliance-with-the-reasonable-steps-obligation/" title="REP 795 Design and distribution obligations: Compliance with the reasonable steps obligation">REP 795</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>During its review, on 5 December 2025, ASIC also issued an interim stop order against Stratos Trading Pty Limited (trading as FXCM) after it failed to respond to ASIC&rsquo;s concerns regarding deficiencies in its target market determination (<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-295mr-asic-issues-ddo-stop-order-against-fxcm-for-tmd-deficiencies/" title="25-295MR ASIC issues DDO stop order against FXCM for TMD deficiencies">25-295MR</a>). The stop order was revoked after FXCM amended its target market determination to address ASIC&rsquo;s concerns.</p>
<p>On 3 November 2023, ASIC commenced proceedings in the Federal Court against online investment platform, eToro Aus Capital Limited (eToro), regarding its CFD product in the regulator&rsquo;s first design and distribution action (<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2023-releases/23-204mr-asic-sues-etoro-in-its-first-design-and-distribution-action-to-protect-consumers-from-high-risk-cfd-products/" title="23-204MR ASIC sues eToro in its first design and distribution action to protect consumers from high-risk CFD products">23-204MR</a>).</p>
<h3>ASIC&rsquo;s product intervention order (PIO)</h3>
<p>The PIO on CFDs came into effect in 2021 and has been effective in reducing the risk of significant detriment to retail clients resulting from CFDs (<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2022-releases/22-082mr-asic-s-cfd-product-intervention-order-extended-for-five-years/" title="22-082MR ASIC&rsquo;s CFD product intervention order extended for five years">22-082MR</a>).</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s CFD product intervention order will expire on 23 May 2027, unless it is remade. In 2026, ASIC will engage with industry on our proposed way forward.</p>

<title>Alberta Securities Commission Warns Alberta Investors Of The Top Misleading Investment Fraud Tactics To Watch For In 2026</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/alberta-securities-commission-warns-alberta-investors-of-the-top-misleading-inve-2026119/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Alberta Securities Commission (ASC) today published&nbsp;<a href="https://www.checkfirst.ca/2026/01/19/top-investment-scams-to-watch-for-in-alberta-in-2026-how-ai-driven-scams-are-shaping-investment-fraud/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">information on the top three scams and misleading tactics</a>&nbsp;Alberta investors should watch out for this year and how they can protect themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2026, investors now face an ever-evolving landscape of online threats that can put their hard-earned money at risk: deepfakes, finfluencers, and the growing use of private messaging apps. According to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre research, Canadians lost more than $310 million to investment scams in 2024.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tools and technology scammers use are rapidly evolving &ndash; from sophisticated deepfake impersonations to encrypted group chats &ndash; making fraud increasingly harder to detect at first glance,&rdquo; said Hilary McMeekin, Director of Communications and Investor Education. &ldquo;We urge investors to slow down, check registration, and ensure any advice aligns with their investment goals and risk tolerance before investing.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Top three harmful investment tactics to watch out for</strong></p>
<p><strong>Deepfakes or AI-Impersonations:</strong>&nbsp;The ASC has seen deepfake content &ndash; images, video and audio created with artificial intelligence (AI) &ndash; often used to impersonate prominent political figures and select well-known Canadians in promotions for fraudulent investment and crypto schemes. Albertans should be aware of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advertising, websites and social media posts that appear to feature credible public figures endorsing an investment opportunity, especially offerings that promise quick or guaranteed returns.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Attempts by scammers to impersonate local individuals, including deepfakes of Alberta-based business leaders, industry experts, and other credible provincial public figures.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The potential for a more sophisticated AI-driven approach that uses cloned voices and realistic likenesses of well-known financial advisors, finfluencers and virtual public speakers for seminars and online presentations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Private messaging apps:</strong>&nbsp;Private messaging platforms, like WhatsApp and Telegram, are often used by fraudsters to engage with investors and build trust. After grabbing the victims&rsquo; attention through an ad or social media post, scammers use these channels to bring people to group chats where they share promises of exclusive trips as investment incentives and guaranteed investment returns.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once these groups are established, scammers can often exploit the trust that already exists within personal networks by encouraging individuals to invite their contacts to join the chat. When family members or friends pass along invitations to investment groups, it creates a built‑in sense of credibility and lowers skepticism, allowing scammers to reach new victims without having to seek them out directly.</p>
<p>Many of these interactions lead investors to harmful investment schemes such as pump-and-dumps or crypto scams.</p>
<p><strong>Finfluencers and unregistered advice:</strong>&nbsp;Digital creators typically seek monetization of their content through affiliate links, paid agreements, and other strategies that can blur the line between education and unregistered advice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Canadian Securities Administrators and the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) recently&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asc.ca/News-and-Publications/News-Releases/2025/12/11-CSA-and-CIRO-provide-guidance-for-finfluencers-and-firms" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">issued guidance</a>&nbsp;so that finfluencers and the firms they work with can understand and follow securities laws when posting investment information online. Generally, anyone offering investments or personalized investment advice must be registered with the ASC or another provincial securities regulator.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How can Albertans protect themselves?</strong></p>
<p>Investors can easily access all kinds of advice and information online and many of these marketing tactics leverage trust, urgency and perceived credibility to pressure investors into acting fast. The ASC encourages Albertans to pause, step back and take the time to do their own research and make sure an investment opportunity is right for them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verify that the investment professionals, firms and online trading platforms they plan to use are registered by visiting the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.checkfirst.ca/check-registration/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Check Registration</a>&nbsp;page on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.checkfirst.ca/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CheckFirst.ca</a>.</li>
<li>Ask questions when something doesn&rsquo;t feel right, and report suspicious activity to the ASC by calling 403.355.3888 or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asc.ca/Enforcement/File-a-Complaint" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">online</a>. Early reporting helps the ASC act faster and protect others.</li>
<li>Access CheckFirst.ca for unbiased information and resources designed to help investors stay informed and avoid fraudulent schemes.</li>
</ul>
<p>The ASC is the regulatory agency responsible for administering the province's securities laws. It is entrusted with fostering a fair and efficient capital market in Alberta and with protecting investors. As a member of the Canadian Securities Administrators, the ASC works to improve, coordinate and harmonize the regulation of Canada's capital markets.</p>

<title>DGCX Sees 30% Increase In Trade Volumes In 2025 To Surpass USD 46 Billion, DCCC Secures ESMA Counterparty Recognition To Boost Global Dubai Market Confidence</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/dgcx-sees-30-increase-in-trade-volumes-in-2025-to-surpass-usd-46-billion-dccc-2026119/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul type="disc">
<li><em><b>Total traded volumes surpassed 2 million lots, marking a 30% year-on-year increase, with the value of contracts traded reaching USD 46.96 billion</b></em></li>
<li><em><b>DCCC was re-recognised as a third-country CCP by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA),&nbsp;</b><b>reinforcing international confidence in Dubai&rsquo;s market infrastructure</b></em></li>
<li><em><b>DGCX continues to play a central role in strengthening Dubai&rsquo;s financial markets through transparent, well-capitalised and internationally connected trading and clearing services</b></em></li>
</ul>
<p>The Dubai Gold and Commodities Exchange (DGCX) has announced a strong operational and market performance in 2025, with traded volumes rising 30% year-on-year and gold futures activity increasing sharply, reinforcing its role in regional and international derivatives markets.</p>
<p>Total traded volumes reached 2,048,556 lots in 2025, with the total value of contracts traded reaching USD 46.96 billion. Meanwhile, average daily volumes rose to 7,940 lots, and average open interest of 13,015 lots underscored the continued depth and resilience of its markets.</p>
<p>DGCX recorded its highest single-day trading volume of 26,108 lots in April 2025, with gold futures driving growth with volumes rising to 613% year on year and 5,335 lots, reflecting increased demand for hedging and price discovery tools.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Dubai Commodities Clearing Corporation (DCCC), the clearing house of DGCX, was re-recognised as a third-country central counterparty (CCP) by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). The move follows a regulatory assessment process by ESMA and reflects both increased international confidence in Dubai&rsquo;s infrastructure and the UAE&rsquo;s continued progress in strengthening its financial market frameworks.</p>
<p><b>Ahmed Bin Sulayem, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of DGCX,</b>&nbsp;said:&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;DGCX delivered a strong performance in 2025, with total traded volumes rising by over 30% to surpass two million lots and value traded exceeding USD 46 billion. This momentum, reinforced by a sharp increase in gold futures activity, signals the deepening of our markets and the central role we continue to play in effective risk management and price discovery. ESMA&rsquo;s recognition of the Dubai Commodities Clearing Corporation as a third-country CCP, following a rigorous regulatory assessment, highlights the growing international confidence in Dubai&rsquo;s market infrastructure and the UAE&rsquo;s standing as a world-class and trusted hub for global trade and capital flows.&rdquo;</i><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>In November 2025, DGCX was recognised as MENA Exchange of the Year at the 2025 Future and Options (FOW) International Awards. The award reflects DGCX&rsquo;s continued investment in market infrastructure, product development and risk management standards aligned with global best practice.</p>
<p>Together, these developments underscore DGCX&rsquo;s role in supporting the wider financial ecosystem in Dubai by providing market participants with access to transparent and internationally connected trading and clearing infrastructure.</p>

<title>European Banking Authority And Authority For Anti-Money Laundering And Countering The Financing Of Terrorism Complete Handover Of AML/CFT Mandates</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/european-banking-authority-and-authority-for-anti-money-laundering-and-counterin-2026119/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>On 1 January 2026, the European Banking Authority (EBA) and the Authority for Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AMLA) completed the transfer of all AML/CFT mandates and functions from the EBA to AMLA, marking a milestone in the EU's fight against financial crime. The handover concludes the EBA's stand-alone AML/CFT mandate that began in 2020 and is part of the new EU AML/CFT package which established AMLA at the centre of an integrated, European system of AML/CFT supervision.</p>
<p>AMLA and the EBA have worked closely to ensure a seamless and timely transition. Key EBA tools and expertise, including the EuReCa database, supervisory insights, and risk assessments, have been transferred to AMLA. All existing EBA AML/CFT guidelines and standards will remain in force until replaced by AMLA, guaranteeing regulatory continuity for industry and supervisors.</p>
<p>Under the new framework AMLA will complete the EU&rsquo;s Single Rulebook, advance supervisory convergence, and coordinate the work of FIUs to enhance cross-border exchange of financial intelligence. AMLA will also directly supervise 40 of the most complex financial institutions or groups in the EU. The EBA will continue to address money laundering risks through prudential regulation, working hand in hand with AMLA to maintain a coherent framework.</p>
<p>The two authorities have put in place a strong cooperation framework through a formal ESAs-AMLA&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/esas-sign-memorandum-understanding-amla-effective-cooperation-and-information-exchange">Memorandum of Understanding</a>, enabling regular information exchange, joint initiatives and consistent engagement with the private sector.</p>
<p>Together, AMLA and EBA aim to deliver a more effective and consistent EU response to financial crime.</p>

<title>The Joint Bank Reporting Committee Publishes Its 2026 Work Programme And Recommendations To Enhance Semantic Integration On ESG Definitions</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The Joint Bank Reporting Committee (JBRC) published today its Work Programme for 2026, outlining key priorities and deliverables for the year ahead. In parallel, the JBRC released a set of recommendations for all authorities to consider in the development of ESG reporting requirements. The European Banking Authority (EBA) and the European Central Bank (ECB) will follow up on the implementation of these recommendations.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Work Programme 2026</span></span></p>
<p>The JBRC&rsquo;s Work Programme for 2026 sets out the Committee&rsquo;s main priorities as it continues supporting progress towards an integrated European reporting system for banks.</p>
<p>In the coming year, the JBRC will maintain its focus on semantic integration and on developing common definitions and standards across statistical, supervisory and resolution reporting. These efforts contribute to the broader EU initiative to streamline reporting obligations, strengthen data consistency and enhance efficiency for both reporting institutions and authorities.</p>
<p>The 2026 Work Programme is available on the JBRC&rsquo;s dedicated webpages&nbsp; hosted by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/activities/single-rulebook/regulatory-activities/supervisory-reporting/joint-bank-reporting-committee-jbrc">EBA</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/ecb_statistics/reporting/jbrc/html/index.en.html">ECB.</a></p>
<p><span><span>ESG-focused recommendations released</span></span></p>
<p>Alongside the Work Programme, the JBRC issued a set of recommendations on ESG disclosures aimed at supporting greater semantic integration across supervisory, resolution and statistical reporting frameworks. These recommendations represent another important milestone in ensuring more consistent and aligned approaches to ESG data across Europe. They also provide a relevant contribution to the finalisation of the Implementing Technical Standards (ITS) on ESG disclosures, to the preparation of future ESG reporting requirements, and to the development of any new ESG-related definitions.</p>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>The JBRC, established jointly by the European Banking Authority (EBA) and the European Central Bank (ECB), plays a central role in the European initiative to streamline banks&rsquo; reporting frameworks by developing common definitions, semantics and standards for regulatory data reported by banks.&nbsp;</p>

<li><i>Will allow for fractional share trading</i></li>
<li><i>Will offer immediate settlement via tokenized capital</i></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The New York Stock Exchange, part of Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE: ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today announced its development of a platform for trading and on-chain settlement of tokenized securities, for which it will seek regulatory approvals.</p>
<p>NYSE&rsquo;s new digital platform will enable tokenized trading experiences, including 24/7 operations, instant settlement, orders sized in dollar amounts, and stablecoin-based funding. Its design combines the NYSE&rsquo;s cutting-edge Pillar matching engine with blockchain-based post-trade systems, including the capability to support multiple chains for settlement and custody.</p>
<p>Subject to regulatory approvals, the platform will power a new NYSE venue that supports trading of tokenized shares fungible with traditionally issued securities as well as tokens natively issued as digital securities. Tokenized shareholders will participate in traditional shareholder dividends and governance rights. The venue is designed to align with established principles for market structure, with distribution via non-discriminatory access to all qualified broker-dealers.</p>
<p>The launch of the NYSE&rsquo;s tokenized securities platform is one component of ICE&rsquo;s broader digital strategy, which includes preparing its clearing infrastructure to support 24/7 trading and the potential integration of tokenized collateral. ICE is now working with banks including BNY (NYSE: BK) and Citi (NYSE: C) to support tokenized deposits across ICE&rsquo;s clearinghouses to help clearing members transfer and manage money outside of traditional banking hours, meet margin obligations, and accommodate funding requirements over different jurisdictions and time zones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For more than two centuries, the NYSE has transformed the way markets operate,&rdquo; said Lynn Martin, President, NYSE Group. &ldquo;We are leading the industry toward fully on-chain solutions, grounded in the unmatched protections and high regulatory standards that position us to marry trust with state-of-the-art technology. Harnessing our expertise to reinvent market infrastructure is how we&rsquo;ll meet and shape the demands of a digital future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>ICE, parent company of the NYSE and operator of six clearing houses around the world including the world&rsquo;s largest energy clearing house and the world&rsquo;s largest clearing house for credit default swaps, has been at the forefront of market innovation for more than 25 years.</p>
<p>"Since its founding, ICE has propelled markets from analog to digital,&rdquo; said Michael Blaugrund, Vice President of Strategic Initiatives, ICE. &ldquo;Supporting tokenized securities is a pivotal step in ICE's strategy to operate on-chain market infrastructure for trading, settlement, custody, and capital formation in the new era of global finance.&rdquo;</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority: Tribunal Upholds Ban And Fines For Corrupt And Dishonest Adviser</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The FCA's decision to ban Darren Antony Reynolds from working in financial services and fine him &pound;2,037,892 has been upheld by the Upper Tribunal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FCA's decision to ban Darren Antony Reynolds from working in financial services and fine him &pound;2,037,892 has been upheld by the Upper Tribunal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr Reynolds was dishonest when he gave pension transfer advice and investment recommendations to his customers, causing them significant harm.</p>
<p>Mr Reynolds showed a clear disregard for his customers&rsquo; interests. He encouraged British Steel Pension Scheme members to transfer out of their defined benefit pension scheme, despite knowing that the advice was wholly unsuitable. He also advised his customers to invest in high-risk and unsuitable products while at the same time hiding high exit fees and forging documents.</p>
<p>Mr Reynolds&rsquo; misconduct exposed hundreds of people to serious financial loss. Over &pound;17.6m has been paid in compensation to more than 470 affected customers, many of whom suffered losses in excess of statutory compensation limits.</p>
<p>In addition, Mr Reynolds let 2 unapproved people give pension advice, putting customers at risk. When confronted with his misconduct he lied to regulators, allowed important evidence to be destroyed, and moved his family home into a trust to avoid paying his debts.</p>
<p>Therese Chambers, joint executive director of Enforcement and Market Oversight at the FCA, said:</p>
<p>'Mr Reynolds&rsquo; misconduct was the worst we saw out of all the British Steel Pension Scheme cases, and he caused untold damage to his clients. He acted in a way that was corrupt and dishonest, putting his own profits before people&rsquo;s pensions and acting without integrity as he tried to cover his tracks. &nbsp;</p>
<p>'He has spent many years trying to evade responsibility for his actions. The Tribunal&rsquo;s full endorsement of our findings now brings those efforts to avoid accountability to an end. We will pursue recovery of the penalty to the fullest possible extent and will not hesitate to bankrupt him if necessary. We will ensure that he does not retain a single penny of his corrupt profits.'</p>
<p>The Tribunal noted that 'Mr Reynolds is clearly guilty of dreadful misconduct over a protracted period, which had very serious adverse impacts on a large number of retail customers. He is, as the Authority alleged, a corrupt and dishonest man lacking integrity.'</p>

<li>A Defined Benefit (DB) pension is a valuable investment with advantages that cannot be replicated by other investments. Strong reasons are required for it to be suitable for a person to exit a DB pension scheme in favour of another investment.</li>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Twenty-nine Polish capital market leaders have been awarded and recognised at the 2025 Stock Market Review Gala, an event that symbolically closed a record-breaking year for the Warsaw Stock Exchange and the entire Polish capital market.</em></p>
<p>The 2025 Stock Market Review Gala was held on 14 January 2026 at the Warsaw Stock Exchange, the heart of the Polish capital market. The event provided an opportunity to present awards and distinctions and offered a space for discussions about the future of the capital market in Poland. The Gala brought together key representatives of the financial community, including Minister of Finance and Economy Andrzej Domański and Minister of State Assets Wojciech Balczun, as well as representatives of brokerage houses, banks, issuers, and GPW&rsquo;s partners. During the event, 29 awards and special mentions were presented to entities which made a major contribution to the development of the Polish capital market in the past year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>The year 2025 exceeded our wildest expectations. We were hoping for a breakthrough and we witnessed the biggest bull market of the century. The WIG index crossed the symbolic mark of 100,000 points in April and set a record for gains in the 21<span>st</span>&nbsp;century at the last trading session of the month. The historic index performance, huge turnover, and deals which attracted billions of zlotys of new capital to the Warsaw Stock Exchange are owed to the efforts of all capital market participants because we set new records together. Key reforms are ahead, including the launch of Personal Investment Accounts (OKI). The market is keeping its fingers crossed for the smooth implementation of OKIs as we believe that they will drive further market development and, above all, ensure that Poles profit from the success of the Polish economy,</em>&rdquo; said Tomasz Bardziłowski, President of the Management Board of the Warsaw Stock Exchange.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Scila, the leading independent provider of trade surveillance and risk management technology, today reports a significant expansion in the energy and commodities sector. During the second half of 2025, the company achieved a combined total of more than 10 new contract wins and successful deployments, reinforcing its position as a preferred partner for complex energy market participants.<br /><br />The surge in demand in this customer segment is largely driven by the implementation of the REMIT II regulation, a comprehensive EU framework designed to increase market integrity and transparency. As this regulation demands more sophisticated monitoring of algorithmic trading and order book data, energy players are increasingly seeking Scila&rsquo;s robust, engineering-first platform to ensure full domain specific adherence to the new standards.<br /><br />Scila&rsquo;s recent successes span the entire energy value chain, from commodity trading houses and international producers to major utilities and prominent interdealer brokers (IDBs). The company&rsquo;s solutions also continue to serve as the benchmark for leading energy exchanges and regulators worldwide.<br /><br /><em>&ldquo;This high volume of commercial activity and successful go-lives is a clear validation from the market on our ongoing more than decade-long commitment to providing world-class technology to the energy sector,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;says Mikko Andersson, CEO of Scila.&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Energy market participants realize that navigating the complexities of REMIT II and modern trading requires an organization that is as robust and scalable as the systems we deliver. With nearly 90% of our staff dedicated to R&amp;D and delivery, we provide a level of direct technical expertise that is unique in this industry.&rdquo;</em><br /><br />Scila has a long-standing history of attracting and retaining the world&rsquo;s largest and most influential trading organizations. Originally established as a pioneer in trade and market surveillance, the company has successfully expanded its offering to include innovative and high-performance solutions within risk management, capable of handling massive data volumes across regional and global markets in real-time with true multi-asset capabilities.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Regarding our recent inflow of energy-focused customers and the REMIT II driver, we are seeing a distinct trend where organizations that initially utilized rudimentary solutions are now turning to Scila after encountering operational limitations,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;says Lars Gr&auml;ns Rohde, Chief Revenue Officer at Scila.&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Our ability to deliver unified, high-performance solutions to global supermajors and the most demanding commodity traders proves that our technology is built for the deepest challenges of the global energy markets.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><span>Bj&oslash;rn Sibbern</span>, Chief Executive Officer, said:<br />&ldquo;On behalf of the Board of Directors and the Executive Board, I would like to thank Daniel for his great commitment. He has shaped SIX over many years through his high level of professional expertise and personal engagement. His reliability and strong sense of responsibility have contributed significantly to the development of SIX. We look forward to Daniel supporting the Group during the transition of responsibilities over the coming months and thank him for his continued contribution.&rdquo;</p>

This change reflects the firm&rsquo;s ongoing growth across jurisdictions and the continued development of its senior partner model. The new name aligns with how MKI operates today, supporting institutional investors and listed companies in complex, event-driven situations shaped by stakeholder behaviour and judgement.</span><br id="isPasted" /><br /><span>MKI&rsquo;s work increasingly spans multiple geographies, with a presence in both Europe and the United States. The advisory group&rsquo;s approach is grounded in experience, accountability, and independent judgement, delivered by a team of senior partners.</span><br id="isPasted" /><br /><span>"I&rsquo;m delighted that we are now operating as MKI Global Partners. The name reflects how the business has evolved and the international nature of our work,&rdquo; said&nbsp;</span><span>Mark Kelly, CEO of MKI Global Partners.</span><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Our industry is full of opinions. We focus on fact-based intelligence. Our clients don&rsquo;t need more noise; they need relevant, connected and genuinely new information that helps them make better decisions in complex situations.&rdquo;</span><br id="isPasted" /><br /><span>MKI applies a consistent discipline when gathering and delivering intelligence. Insights must be relevant, connected to the client&rsquo;s priorities, and not already understood by the client.</span><br id="isPasted" /><br /><span>This approach supports investors who face rapidly changing event-driven scenarios. It also benefits corporates, where boards and leadership teams need quality intelligence to understand likely responses from key parties and therefore connect perspectives across advisory disciplines.</span><br id="isPasted" /><br /><span>The firm&rsquo;s remit increasingly extends beyond shareholders to include a broader set of stakeholders such as creditors, regulators, governments, unions, professional services firms and other influencers whose motivations can be decisive in high-stakes situations.</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced the following enforcement updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>CFTC Obtains Federal Court Order Imposing Civil Monetary Penalties and Trading Bans on Precious Metals Spoofers&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois entered two consent orders against&nbsp;<strong>Gregg Smith&nbsp;</strong>of New York and&nbsp;<strong>Michael Nowak&nbsp;</strong>of New Jersey for spoofing in the precious metals futures markets while employed at a major bank.</p>
<p>Under the orders, Smith must pay a $200,000 civil monetary penalty and is barred from trading in CFTC markets or registering with the CFTC for three years. Nowak must pay a $150,000 civil monetary penalty and is barred from trading and registration for six months. Both defendants are also required to cease and desist from further violating the spoofing prohibition in the Commodity Exchange Act.</p>
<p>The consent order resolves a CFTC enforcement action filed in September 2019 [<em>See</em>&nbsp;CFTC Press Release No.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8013-19">8013-19</a>].</p>
<p><span>In a related criminal case, Smith and Nowak were convicted of fraud, attempted price manipulation, and spoofing. In August 2023, Smith was sentenced to two years in prison and ordered to pay a $50,000 fine, and Nowak was sentenced to one year and a day in prison and ordered to pay a $35,000 fine.&nbsp;</span><em>United States v. Smith</em><span>, No. 19 Cr. 669 (N.D. Ill.).</span></p>
<p><span>See&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/12886/ENFSmithConsentOrder122225/download"><span>Smith Order</span></a><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/12881/ENFNowakConsentOrder122225/download"><span>Nowak Order</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><strong>CFTC Secures Federal Court Order Requiring Florida Resident, Firm to Pay Over $335,000 for Misappropriating Confidential Information, Fictitious Trading</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas entered a consent order imposing permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement, and civil monetary penalties against&nbsp;<strong>Peter Miller&nbsp;</strong>of Miami, and his firm&nbsp;<strong>Omerta Capital LLC</strong>.</p>
<p>Under the order, the defendants, jointly and severally, must pay $135,788 in disgorgement, representing their unlawful gains, and a $200,000 civil monetary penalty. The order also bans the defendants from registration and all trading for 18 months and from block trading for five years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The consent order resolves all claims the CFTC brought against the defendants in the complaint filed in December 2021 and amended in December 2022 [See CFTC Press Release Nos.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8468-21">8468-21</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8634-22">8634-22</a>].</p>
<p>In a related criminal case, the Department of Justice charged Miller in December 2021, with one count of conspiracy to commit commodities fraud based on conduct alleged in the CFTC&rsquo;s complaint. [United States v. Peter Miller, No. 4:21-cr-00570 (S.D. Tex. Dec. 10, 2021)]. Miller pleaded guilty and was sentenced in June 2024 to five months in prison and five months of home confinement. He was also ordered to pay $135,788 in criminal forfeiture.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>CFTC Charges Oklahoma Man, His Unregistered Commodity Pool Operator with Fraud, Registration Violations</strong></p>
<p>The CFTC filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma against&nbsp;<strong>Travis Ford</strong>&nbsp;of Oklahoma and his company,&nbsp;<strong>Wolf Capital Crypto Trading LLC</strong>, charging them with fraud and registration violations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The complaint alleges Ford and Wolf Capital fraudulently solicited and accepted the equivalent of more than $10 million from investors for an unregistered commodity pool operated by Wolf Capital.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the complaint, the CFTC seeks restitution, disgorgement, civil monetary penalties, permanent trading and registration bans, and a permanent injunction against further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations, as charged.</p>
<p>In a related criminal case, the Department of Justice charged Ford with conspiracy to commit wire fraud. [<em>See United States v. Ford</em>, No. 4:24-cr-00387 (N.D. Okla. Dec. 10, 2024).]<span>&nbsp;</span>On Nov.13, Ford was sentenced to five years in prison and ordered to pay certain monetary relief.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, President Hasner, for the kind introduction. It is an honor to speak at Florida Atlantic University, and I am glad to have the chance to talk with those here from the American Institute for Economic Research and the Shadow Open Market Committee.</p>
<p>I especially appreciate the opportunity to discuss my economic outlook at the start of the new year. It is a task made considerably easier with the gradual return of federal government data, which was disrupted by last year's lapse in funding. The lack of data reinforced two long-held beliefs for me. One, how grateful I am for the dedicated service of the statistical agencies to keep policymakers, businesses, and the public informed about the state of the economy. And, two, how important it is to have access to an array of data beyond what those agencies provide. That includes data produced by the Federal Reserve System, state governments, and a wide variety of private-sector sources. All of those data sources inform my view of the economy and help me make monetary policy decisions.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-slide2-20260116.jpg" id="fig2">Today</a>, I will start by sharing my outlook for the economy at the start of 2026. Next, I will discuss the implications of that outlook for the path of monetary policy. And, finally, I will discuss some recent developments in monetary policy implementation, which I know is of interest to many of you in this room. As a reminder, these views are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues.</p>
<p><span>Economic Outlook</span><br />I am starting 2026 with a cautiously optimistic point of view. Conditions in the labor market appear to be stabilizing, and I see the economy as well positioned to continue to grow while inflation returns to a pathway toward our 2 percent objective. The most recent data indicate that economic activity has remained strong. In the third quarter of 2025, gross domestic product rose at an annual rate of 4.3 percent. As you can see in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-slide3-20260116.jpg" id="fig3">figure 1</a>, that was a sharp acceleration from the first half of last year, mostly reflecting strong consumer spending and an upward swing in net exports, which can be volatile. Business investment grew at a solid rate in the third quarter, while residential investment continued to be soft. Fourth-quarter growth is likely to be restrained due to the effects of the government shutdown. Still, excluding those effects, I see the economy expanding at a solid pace of about 2 percent in the near term.</p>
<p>Looking at the labor market, job growth moderated last year, and the unemployment rate edged higher. In November and December, employers added about 50,000 jobs to payrolls each month, as you can see in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-slide4-20260116.jpg" id="fig4">figure 2</a>. This came after payrolls declined in October, largely due to an unusually large number of separations from the federal government. However, even setting aside October, the broader trend last year showed slower job creation than in 2024. At least part of the slowdown in the job market reflects a decline in the growth of the labor force due to lower immigration and labor force participation. However, labor demand has softened as well. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate, shown in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-slide5-20260116.jpg" id="fig5">figure 3</a>, ended the year at 4.4 percent, up modestly from 4.1 percent at the end of the previous year.</p>
<p>That said, the labor market is not deteriorating rapidly, as layoffs remain low; however, hiring remains low as well.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-slide6-20260116.jpg" id="fig6">Figure 4</a>&nbsp;shows that there were 0.9 available jobs in November for every unemployed American seeking work. While that level is normally consistent with a solid labor market, the ratio is considerably lower than a few years ago, when labor market conditions were much tighter early in the pandemic recovery. In this less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market, the downside risks to employment appear to have risen. My baseline, however, is for the unemployment rate to hold steady throughout this year.</p>
<p>Considering the other part of our dual mandate, inflation remains somewhat elevated from our 2 percent goal. As you know, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) targets the rate of increase in the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index; however, due to the government shutdown, the most recent available PCE price data are for September 2025. For this reason, I find it informative to review consumer price index (CPI) data to get a timelier sense of the direction of inflation, even if it does not directly translate to our inflation target. Over the longer term, both CPI and PCE measures tell a similar story. Data released earlier this week showed that the CPI rose 2.7 percent over the 12 months ending in December, the same rate as November. Core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, rose 2.6 percent, also matching November's reading. You can see in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-slide7-20260116.jpg" id="fig7">figure 5</a>&nbsp;that both headline and core measures of inflation have eased significantly from their highs in mid-2022. However, that progress slowed over the past year or so, and inflation remains at a level that is above readings consistent with our inflation target.</p>
<p>Looking at the subcomponents of core CPI, shown in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-slide8-20260116.jpg" id="fig8">figure 6</a>, we can see why there has been a slowdown in the pace of disinflation. Over the past year, we have seen further notable declines in services inflation&mdash;rent of shelter as well as other non-energy services&mdash;but these have been offset by an increase in core goods price inflation. Looking at the three buckets separately, shelter inflation, shown by the black dot-dashed line, has continued to decline, and core services inflation excluding shelter, the red dashed line, has also been on a downward trend, albeit on a somewhat bumpier path. Those readings are consistent with overall inflation moving back toward our target. What is inconsistent with a return to 2 percent inflation is the rise in core good prices. Following very high readings during the pandemic, goods inflation fell sharply, reaching its pre-pandemic range in 2023, and fluctuated roughly in that range until 2025. Last year, core goods price inflation picked up markedly, to 1.4 percent over the 12 months ending in December 2025, at least in part reflecting increased tariffs filtering through to certain goods prices.</p>
<p>While some upside risks remain, moving forward I expect to see inflation return to a sustainable path back to our 2 percent target. It is a reasonable base case that the effects of tariffs on inflation will not be long-lasting&mdash;effectively, a one-time shift in the price level. My view that inflation will resume a path toward our goal is consistent with near-term measures of inflation expectations declining from their peaks last year, as reflected in both market- and survey-based measures. And most measures of longer-term expectations remain consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal.</p>
<p><span>Monetary Policy</span><br />Although I am cautiously optimistic about the path ahead, as a monetary policymaker, I do confront a challenging situation. With the downside risks to employment having risen last year, I viewed the balance of risks as having shifted. As a result, I supported the FOMC's decisions to reduce the policy interest rate last year. I viewed that as the right step to balance the upside risk of persistent above-target inflation and the downside risk of a deteriorating labor market. This policy stance puts the economy in a good position moving forward.</p>
<p>As shown in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-slide9-20260116.jpg" id="fig9">figure 7</a>, since the middle of 2024, the Committee has reduced the policy rate by 1.75 percentage points. In my view, those moves have brought the federal funds rate into a range consistent with the neutral rate &mdash; a rate that neither stimulates nor restricts economic activity. I look forward to our upcoming policy meeting, which will be held in less than two weeks. While I do not want to prejudge the decision that will take place there, in my view, the current policy stance leaves us well positioned to determine the extent and timing of additional adjustments to our policy rate based on the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.</p>
<p><span>Monetary Policy Implementation</span><br />Now, let me turn to monetary policy implementation. I'll begin with a bit of history to provide a backdrop for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-slide10-20260116.jpg" id="fig10">recent developments</a>.</p>
<p>In January 2019, following many years of successful implementation along with extensive deliberations, the FOMC formally adopted its ample-reserves implementation framework.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20260116a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;Some key advantages of this framework include successful control of the policy rate in a variety of conditions and effective transmission to other money market rates and broader financial conditions. The FOMC defined this framework as one where "control over the level of the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates is exercised primarily through the setting of the Federal Reserve's administered rates, and in which active management of the supply of reserves is not required."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20260116a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;Therefore, the supply of reserves needs to be sufficiently large to meet the demand for reserves on most days.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, I'll now discuss recent developments in monetary policy implementation. As of December 2025, the FOMC concluded the process of reducing the size of the Fed's balance sheet that began in mid-2022 by halting the reduction of the Fed's asset holdings. During this process, we successfully reduced our securities holdings by about $2.2 trillion. This asset runoff affected not only our assets, but also our liabilities such as the reserves in the banking system and the level of overnight reverse repurchase agreement (repo) operation balances.</p>
<p>At the beginning of balance sheet runoff in 2022, reserves were at an abundant level of around $3.5 trillion. As the balance sheet shrank over the next few years, the federal funds rate remained about 7 basis points below the interest on reserve balances (IORB) rate for most of this period. The decline in the level of reserves from an abundant level toward an ample level exerted upward pressure on money market rates in recent months. As the level of reserves declined, repo rates started to increase and became more volatile. We began to see intensified rate pressures, especially on tax payment days and Treasury securities settlement days, when large flows into the Treasury General Account (TGA), another liability of the Fed, led to corresponding declines in the amount of reserves in the banking system. The federal funds rate started to move up steadily in its target range, and it now stands at 1 basis point below the IORB rate. These and other indicators of tightening money market conditions were what we expected to see as reserves declined toward the range of ample reserves.</p>
<p>It is important to note that while ending the asset runoff slows down the decline in reserves, it does not completely halt this process. Even when the Fed's assets remain constant, trend growth in non-reserve liabilities, particularly currency in circulation, will continue to absorb reserves over time. There is also significant cyclical variation in the supply of reserve balances, reflecting seasonal changes in the TGA and other factors. Furthermore, the demand for reserves is not static but rather dynamic, influenced by various factors including economic growth and changes in the financial system. Consequently, to maintain an ample reserves level&mdash;a key operational objective of our current monetary policy implementation framework&mdash;the FOMC must expand its balance sheet commensurately with the public's demand for its liabilities. This necessitates a nuanced and forward-looking approach to balance sheet management that considers both cyclical and structural factors affecting the demand for and supply of reserves.</p>
<p>With the level of bank reserves judged to have declined to an ample level, the FOMC initiated reserve management purchases in December 2025. This was the crucial next step in balance sheet management to maintain ample reserves and ensure effective interest rate control, as consistent with the plan we adopted in May 2022.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20260116a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a></p>
<p>It is important to note that reserve management purchases are not quantitative easing (QE). Each process has a distinct purpose, with different goals and economic implications. QE represents a monetary policy tool deployed when the federal funds rate is constrained by the effective lower bound. The primary objective of QE is to provide economic stimulus by exerting downward pressure on long-term interest rates. This has been achieved typically through large-scale purchases of longer-term Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities. These purchases are intended to influence the yield curve and broader financial conditions by removing duration risk held by the public for a given setting of short-term interest rate policy.</p>
<p>In contrast, reserve management purchases involve the acquisition of Treasury bills and other short-term Treasury securities in a manner that further normalizes the average maturity of the Federal Reserve's asset holdings. They help implement the short-term interest rate policy decided on by the Committee but do not alter broader financial conditions. These routine purchases are conducted to maintain ample reserves and ensure effective control over short-term interest rates. The pace and size of these purchases are calibrated to meet demand for reserve balances and to adjust reserve supply as other items on the liabilities side of our balance sheet grow over time. These purchases do not have any implications for the stance of monetary policy.</p>
<p>As detailed in the statement released by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at the conclusion of our December 2025 FOMC meeting, reserve management purchases will be front-loaded for the first few months to alleviate potential near-term pressures in money markets.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20260116a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;Thereafter, we expect the pace of reserve management purchases to decline, though the actual size will depend on seasonal fluctuations in non-reserve liabilities and market conditions. In the end, the size of our balance sheet will be determined by the public's demand for our liabilities in our ample-reserves regime.</p>
<p>Before concluding, let me also emphasize that in our ample-reserves regime, standing repo operations are a critical tool that helps provide a ceiling on money market rates. By doing so, these operations ensure that the federal funds rate remains within its target range, even on days of elevated pressures in money markets. Consistent with this view, the FOMC eliminated the aggregate limit on standing repo operations in December 2025.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20260116a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;These operations are intended to support monetary policy implementation and smooth market functioning, and they should be used by our counterparties when deemed economically sensible. This is indeed what we saw over the 2025 year-end period. There was notable upward pressure on repo rates amid substantial net Treasury settlements, as widely expected. Usage increased at the Fed's standing repo operations on year-end as market repo rates increased substantially. Despite the elevated levels of repo rates, trading conditions remained orderly in money markets. I am pleased to see increased usage of our standing repo operations when it becomes economically sensible to do so.</p>
<p><span>Conclusion</span><br />To conclude, I will reiterate that I am cautiously optimistic about the path of the economy while acknowledging that we face risks to both sides of our dual mandate. Consequently, I will continue to watch incoming data carefully so that we can set policy to achieve our mandated goals: maximum employment and stable prices. A critical aspect of achieving these goals is ensuring that the Fed can efficiently and smoothly implement monetary policy decisions. We have taken the necessary steps to ensure that capability and will continue to do so.</p>
<p>Once again, it has been an honor to be here. Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you, and I look forward to our discussion.</p>

<title>Remarks At The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, Paul S. Atkins, SEC Chairman, Tel Aviv-Yafo, Israel, Jan. 16, 2026</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Sivan, thank you for that generous introduction. Chairman Zinger, Governor Yaron, and Itai, I am honored to stand alongside each of you this morning and to bring greetings from Washington. Before I share a few reflections, I should like to begin by noting that this marks my first visit to Israel, and that I have been struck both by the beauty of your culture and the strength of your people. Thank you all for the warmth with which you have welcomed me.</p>
<p>Today, we commemorate a new trading week whose benefits, I believe, could be transformative. By moving to Monday through Friday trading, the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange has brought Israel&rsquo;s capital markets into closer alignment with those of its global counterparts. And that alignment, I suspect, will enhance liquidity, encourage greater investment, and send a clear signal to the world that Israel is open for business. Yet even as you take this step to further conform with international markets, I encourage you to preserve the spirit that distinguishes your own. A spirit that has astonishingly produced GDP growth in the middle of a war.</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the State of Israel has punched far above its weight in ways that defy easy explanation. A country with fewer residents than my native state of North Carolina, Israel is short on natural resources, surrounded by uncertainty, yet remarkably rich in resilience and resolve. Home to more startups per capita than anywhere around the world. Second globally in venture capital raised per capita. Among the most companies listed on Nasdaq after the United States. Birthplace of breakthroughs like the USB and drip irrigation. Yours is a nation that has never waited for ideal conditions to pursue prosperity.</p>
<p>Which of course brings us to the broader context in which we assemble today. In recent years especially, Israelis have lived with a level of strain that few societies are asked to endure. While children learned to adapt to the wail of sirens; while reservists fled their desks at work and dinner tables at home; while each of you bore the weight of Israel&rsquo;s longest war, your spirit did not dim. You did not close your markets, permit innovation to pause, nor investment to retreat. In short, you did not allow fear to dictate your future. Instead, Israeli indices soared to new highs. The shekel strengthened against major global currencies. Growth rebounded with force. And projections point to continued investment over the coming year. Crisis seems only to have catalyzed the very progress that it could have constrained.</p>
<p>Of course, this kind of resilience has a name:&nbsp;<em>Hatikvah</em>. Hope. After all, it is hope that has helped to make a barren&nbsp;desert bloom. To turn an ancient land into a hub of high-tech. To bend adversity toward prosperity. It is precisely this ethos that has also made our partnership so strong, for the United States and Israel have long shared more than diplomatic ties and billions in bilateral trade. We are bound by a deep and abiding belief in free enterprise; by the conviction that fair and efficient markets are a force for human flourishing. I am confident that cooperation between our two countries will only deepen in the years ahead because the partnership between our markets and our people only makes both stronger.</p>
<p>So thank you for welcoming me so warmly on my first visit to Israel. Thank you for your leadership, your friendship, and resolve. And congratulations once again on attaining this important milestone. As Israel aligns more closely with the world, may you continue to transform it.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<title>Outlook For The Economy And Monetary Policy, Federal Reserve Vice Chair For Supervision Michelle W. Bowman, At Outlook 26: The New England Economic Forum, Foxborough, Massachusetts</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good morning and thank you for the invitation to join you today.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20260116a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;It is a pleasure to be with you here in Boston at the New England Economic Forum to share my outlook on the economy and monetary policy, and I would like to thank Kathleen Murphy, the CEO of the Massachusetts Bankers Association, for inviting me to speak at your first economic forum.</p>
<p>I am also grateful for the kind introduction from Susan Collins. I greatly value her perspective, and I appreciate the opportunity to work closely with her as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and as a fellow member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).</p>
<p>It is good to see so many bank and business leaders from across the Northeast here at Gillette Stadium. Throughout my time at the Federal Reserve&mdash;and earlier in my career as a community banker&mdash;I have made it a priority to engage directly with bankers and business leaders to better understand how economic conditions affect local communities. These conversations provide important context for my views on the economy and monetary policy.</p>
<p>With the FOMC having concluded its final meeting of 2025 a little over a month ago, and with our next meeting at the end of this month, today I will share my perspective on recent policy decisions, discuss how my assessment of the economy evolved over the past year, review current economic conditions, and then outline my outlook for the economy and monetary policy.</p>
<p>As we enter 2026, the economy has continued to grow, and I see inflation moving closer to our goal. But beneath the surface, the labor market has become more fragile. My focus today is why that fragility poses the greater risk and what that means for the path of policy.</p>
<p><span>Update on Recent Monetary Policy Decisions</span><br />At our September meeting last year, the Committee resumed the process of gradually removing policy restraint and bringing the federal funds rate closer to its neutral level. At that meeting, and again at our meetings in October and December, the Committee voted to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, bringing the range to 3-1/2 to 3-3/4 percent.</p>
<p>These decisions were intended to proactively limit the risk of greater and more persistent damage to the labor market, while inflation continued to show signs that it is on a sustained downward trajectory toward our 2 percent objective. The policy rate now reflects a total of 75 basis points of cuts since September and is closer to my estimate of its neutral level.</p>
<p>I voted in favor of each of these actions in light of the weakening in labor market conditions and my expectation that inflation, excluding the effects of tariffs, would soon be within close range of our 2 percent goal. Looking ahead, as we gather additional evidence on economic activity, labor market conditions, and inflation, it will be important to continue assessing the appropriate path of policy and the timing of further adjustments.</p>
<p><span>How My Views on the Economy Evolved over the Past Year</span><br />Before turning to current economic conditions, I would like to spend a few minutes explaining how my views on the economy and monetary policy evolved over the past year. I believe this context is important, particularly at a time when the balance of risks around our dual mandate has been shifting.</p>
<p>At the December 2024 FOMC meeting, my projections for 2025 anticipated that real gross domestic product (GDP) would rise in the mid&ndash;2 percent range, that core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation would slow by a bit less than one-half percentage point, and that the unemployment rate would increase moderately to about its longer-run level. Those projections also included three quarter-point reductions in the federal funds rate over the course of 2025. In hindsight, the economy seems to have evolved largely in line with those expectations, especially if we consider inflation excluding the estimated effect of tariffs.</p>
<p>Throughout much of last year, I reserved judgment on the effects of new policy initiatives and instead maintained an overall optimistic view of the economy. In particular, I did not assume that changes in trade or immigration policy would necessarily lead to persistent inflationary pressures or large negative effects on economic activity. I also considered the potential for positive supply-side effects from other policy developments, including regulatory changes, tax policy, and a business-friendly approach.</p>
<p>With respect to trade policy, I expected that initial tariff proposals would likely be scaled back over time, that there would be little retaliation from trade partners, and that foreign producers, importers, and consumers would adjust in ways that would help limit pass-through to inflation. Substitution across goods and suppliers appeared to play an important role in moderating the effects of tariffs on both economic activity and prices.</p>
<p>On immigration, I anticipated that a reduced inflow of new immigrants would restrain demand for rental and affordable housing and ease upward pressure on housing inflation in the near term. While changes in population affect both supply and demand, I viewed the near-term demand effects as particularly relevant for inflation dynamics. I also expected relatively small effects on GDP growth from lower immigration, despite reduced labor supply and employment growth, as these new immigrants tend to have lower income and be less productive than the overall U.S. workforce.</p>
<p>Although inflation remained a concern for me early in the year, my assessment shifted as I began to see clearer signs of slowing economic growth and increasing fragility in the labor market. I became more confident that the inflationary effects of tariffs would largely be one-off, as I observed growing evidence that businesses were less able to pass through higher costs to consumers. I saw this as a sign of weakness in demand and consistent with the cooling labor market. These developments led me to place increasing weight on risks to employment and to signal a shift in my balance of risks in June, after which I dissented at the July meeting favoring a 25-basis point reduction to reflect this shift.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20260116a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a></p>
<p>Economic activity seems to have been supported by a surge in equity prices and investment activity related to artificial intelligence (AI). Although stock market valuations may appear stretched, expected earnings growth for AI-related companies has been high, and, so far, a substantial part of the investment has been self-financed. I am concerned that disappointing news on AI investment returns could lead to a sharp correction in equity prices, but the economy continues to show elevated productivity growth likely due, in part, to increased adoption of AI technologies.</p>
<p>Higher productivity gains have helped ease inflationary pressures and encouraged me to support cutting the policy rate last year, especially since we have not seen consistent signs that the labor market is stabilizing.</p>
<p><span>Current Economic Conditions</span><br />Turning to current economic conditions, the U.S. economy has been resilient and has continued to expand at a solid pace, but I remain concerned about signs of fragility in the labor market. I am also increasingly confident that inflation will come down toward 2 percent as tariff effects on goods inflation continue to wane in coming months.</p>
<p>Real GDP growth appears to have exceeded 2 percent last year. Although growth was somewhat volatile, it still averaged close to its pace in 2024 despite the drag from lower immigration, especially if we consider the effects of the government shutdown. Growth was supported by strength in business investment, including data center projects and a surge in high-tech AI investment. These types of projects tend to be relatively insensitive to interest rates and have the potential to significantly raise productivity.</p>
<p>At the same time, other areas of demand softened last year. Consumer spending and residential investment weakened, as slower growth in real disposable income and house prices weighed on demand. The weakness in housing activity and prices over the past year likely reflected some pullback in housing demand. Elevated mortgage rates may have exerted a more persistent drag as income growth expectations declined and house prices remained high relative to rents. Given very low housing affordability, existing home sales have remained depressed since 2023 and at levels only comparable with the early 2010s following the financial crisis. But the recent firming in house prices and home sales seems encouraging, suggesting less restraint on housing demand following the decline in mortgage rates since the middle of last year.</p>
<p>The latest data releases show that GDP significantly increased in the third quarter, as consumer spending accelerated, but likely slowed in the fourth quarter, reflecting a drag from the government shutdown and softer momentum in retail sales through November, consistent with recent weakness in personal income. Disappointingly, residential investment seems on track to decline again in the fourth quarter. Although home sales are rising in response to lower mortgage rates, residential improvements and new construction activity have remained slow.</p>
<p><em>Labor Market Conditions</em><br />Over the past year, as unemployment rose and payroll employment flattened out, we saw labor market conditions gradually weaken. During that time, the unemployment rate increased substantially to 4.4 percent in December, reflecting a decline in hiring rather than a sharp increase in layoffs, as many firms appeared focused on retaining workers rather than expanding payrolls. Payroll employment growth slowed significantly, and job gains became increasingly concentrated in a relatively small number of nonbusiness service industries. Private job gains averaged only about 30,000 per month in the fourth quarter, well below what is needed to keep the unemployment rate from rising, with job gains more than accounted for by the health-care and social services industries, suggesting that labor demand has continued to gradually soften since early last year. Wage growth has slowed to a pace consistent with 2 percent inflation, reflecting both easing labor demand and strong productivity growth, and the labor market is no longer a significant source of inflationary pressure.</p>
<p>Although the labor market is still near full employment, it has become increasingly more fragile and could continue to deteriorate in the coming months. The rise in unemployment has been experienced mostly by demographic groups that tend to be more affected by the business cycle. The share of those working part time for economic reasons, meaning not by choice, has increased considerably over the past two months. This has coincided with a rise in the share of multiple job holders, suggesting that an increasing number of workers struggle to make ends meet.</p>
<p>Job gains have been concentrated in just a few services industries that tend to be less affected by the business cycle. The share of industries with positive job growth over the past six months has been hovering around historically low levels. Private payroll employment may have started to fall in recent months, as the sizable upward bias in the published data implied by the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages seems to have persisted at least through the second quarter.</p>
<p>Although initial claims for unemployment insurance have remained low, there are signs that layoffs may have increased as Challenger private job cut announcements have reached their highest 12‑month level since 2010, outside of the pandemic. We could see layoffs rise quickly since job openings have softened and hiring rates are already low. The share of long-term unemployed workers reached 26 percent in December, the highest since early 2022, reflecting a less dynamic, low-hiring, low-firing labor market that some have said is giving rise to a jobless expansion.</p>
<p>All of these indicators point to growing labor market fragility, and this configuration of the labor market raises the risk that conditions could deteriorate further if demand does not strengthen. With hiring rates already low, layoffs could rise more quickly if firms begin to reassess their staffing needs in response to weaker activity.</p>
<p><em>Inflation Developments</em><br />On inflation, we have seen considerable progress in lowering the underlying trend, considering that still-elevated inflation mostly reflects tariff effects that I expect will fade this year. When those effects are taken into account, core PCE inflation appears to be much closer to 2 percent.</p>
<p>Based on the latest consumer and producer price reports, 12‑month core PCE inflation likely stood at 2.9 percent in December. However, after removing estimated tariff effects, core PCE inflation would have hovered close to 2 percent in recent months, well below the 3 percent reading at the end of 2024. This progress in the underlying trend of inflation reflects a considerable slowing in core services inflation, consistent with the easing in labor market pressures and housing inflation given the weakness in market rents.</p>
<p>The underlying trend in core PCE inflation appears to be moving much closer to our 2 percent target than is currently showing in the data. Core services inflation is already roughly consistent with our target, and only core goods inflation remains elevated, but I expect it to start moving down in coming months as the effects of earlier price increases and one-time tariff-related adjustments fade.</p>
<p><span>Economic Outlook and Risks</span><br />Looking ahead, my baseline expectation is that economic activity will continue to expand at a solid pace and the labor market will stabilize near full employment as monetary policy becomes less restrictive. Less restrictive regulations, lower business taxes, and a more favorable business environment will continue to boost supply&mdash;largely due to higher productivity&mdash;and more than offset any negative effects on economic activity and inflation from tariffs. As the tariff effects continue to wane, these supply-side policies, along with strength in AI-related investment, will continue to boost productivity gains and help ensure that inflation remains on a downward path.</p>
<p>That said, the outlook is subject to risks on both sides of our mandate, and those risks are not symmetric. On the inflation side, potential upside risks include renewed pressures in services prices, a change in firms' pricing behavior, or disruptions to global supply chains stemming from trade or geopolitical developments. This could include changes to oil prices based on reactions to recent events in Venezuela and in the Middle East.</p>
<p>While the risks merit close monitoring, I currently view them as less likely to materialize in a sustained way. First, there has been willingness to negotiate trade policy, and supply chains have largely been unaffected thus far. Second, foreign suppliers and importers have been adjusting to the new tariffs, and there are many anecdotes of businesses being unwilling to raise prices because of higher consumer price sensitivity, especially among low-income consumers. Reduced immigration will also continue to lessen demand, especially for housing, and will be a drag on inflation.</p>
<p>On the employment side, I continue to see downside risks. Continued softness in hiring, combined with already low hiring rates, means that even a small decline in demand could translate into a larger increase in unemployment. Once firms begin to shift from slowing hiring to reducing head count, labor market conditions could quickly deteriorate.</p>
<p>Memories of pandemic worker shortages are still fresh, and, so far, businesses have mostly maintained, rather than reduced, their workforce. They also seem to be more willing to compress profit margins, since consumers are less willing to accept higher prices. Without a broad improvement in demand conditions, businesses may need to begin to lay off workers, recognizing that it will not be as difficult to rehire given the shift in labor market conditions.</p>
<p><span>The Path Forward for Monetary Policy</span><br />With inflation on a sustained trajectory toward 2 percent and signs of fragility in the labor market, my view is that we should continue to focus on risks to our employment mandate and preemptively stabilize and support labor market conditions. Over the second half of last year, I frequently pointed to a shift in economic conditions and in the balance of risks to our employment and inflation goals. I also noted the signs of weakening labor market conditions shown in the flattening of payroll employment gains and the rise in the unemployment rate. But with a rising unemployment rate and inflation remaining slightly above target, our maximum-employment and price-stability goals have been in tension. With our goals in tension, our framework calls for a balanced approach&mdash;taking into account not only the size of deviations from our goals, but also the likelihood that those deviations could become persistent.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20260116a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a></p>
<p>In considering the appropriate path for monetary policy, my approach remains intentionally proactive and forward looking. It takes time to see the full effects of monetary policy on the economy. Placing too much weight on the most recent data can result in an inherently backward-looking assessment of economic conditions. In my view, that approach increases the risk of falling behind the curve and ultimately requiring more abrupt and larger policy adjustments than would otherwise be necessary.</p>
<p>Instead, we should rely on forecasts that are informed by a broad set of indicators and by ongoing engagement with businesses and communities across the country. In my view, this approach is more likely to capture how the economy will evolve over time. Acting in a timely and measured way, based on how we expect the economy to evolve, can help support employment and price stability while limiting the risk of unnecessary volatility.</p>
<p>With inflation pressures easing&mdash;after excluding one-off tariff effects&mdash;and with the risk that labor market conditions could weaken further, I see policy as moderately restrictive. The labor market can appear to be stable right up until it doesn't. Absent a clear and sustained improvement in labor market conditions, we should remain ready to adjust policy to bring it closer to neutral. We should also avoid signaling that we will pause without identifying that conditions have changed. Doing so will indicate that we are not attentive or responsive to the recent and expected path of the labor market.</p>
<p>At the same time, I want to emphasize that monetary policy is not on a preset course. At each FOMC meeting, my colleagues and I will evaluate incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks to our dual-mandated goals of maximum employment and price stability. I will also continue to meet with a broad range of contacts to inform my assessment of economic conditions and the appropriate stance of policy.</p>
<p><span>Supervisory and Regulatory Priorities</span><br />Before I conclude my remarks today, I would like to briefly touch on the Federal Reserve's supervisory and regulatory agenda, which I know is of particular interest to many of you here today.</p>
<p>While monetary policy often takes center stage, effective supervision and regulation are essential to maintaining a safe, sound, and resilient banking system&mdash;one that supports economic growth and serves communities across the country.</p>
<p>Since the President appointed me as Vice Chair for Supervision last June, we have made meaningful progress on several priorities that will improve transparency, efficiency, and focus within our supervisory and regulatory framework. My objective is to ensure that supervision and regulation are appropriately tailored, risk focused, and grounded in our statutory responsibilities.</p>
<p>Congress has also taken several steps in this regard. The passage of the GENIUS Act (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act), along with ongoing consideration of banking and other digital assets legislation, underscores the importance of regulatory clarity as innovation enables the banking and financial systems to continue to evolve. We are actively working to implement the Federal Reserve's responsibilities under this new law.</p>
<p>Last week, I shared my agenda and provided an update on our work to modernize bank supervision and regulation.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20260116a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;I will highlight a few of these and the concrete steps we have taken since last June to enhance supervision and regulation. We have</p>
<ul>
<li>finalized changes to rationalize the large financial institution ratings framework, to better reflect a firm's condition based on material financial risks</li>
<li>finalized revisions to the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio, returning it to its traditional role as a capital backstop and helping to reduce the risk of market disruptions</li>
<li>proposed recalibration of the community bank leverage ratio to the statutory minimum, providing greater flexibility for eligible community banks</li>
<li>removed reputational risk from the examination toolkit, allowing examiners to focus on material financial risks</li>
<li>issued, for the first time, a set of supervisory operating principles to enhance transparency, accountability, and consistency in examinations&mdash;to benefit both examination staff and the banks we supervise</li>
<li>published a request for information on payments fraud to support a more coordinated and effective response</li>

<title>Spain Investors Day Marks The Start Of 2026 For Spanish Markets</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/spain-investors-day-marks-the-start-of-2026-for-spanish-markets-2026116/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/spain-investors-day-marks-the-start-of-2026-for-spanish-markets-2026116/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The 16th edition of Spain Investors Day (SID) showed that the stock market is back in vogue. BME has participated in SID since its inception, whose objective is to promote Spain as an investment destination, and this year, with the IBEX 35 at record highs and attractive stock market multiples, this is more justified than ever. King Felipe VI presided over the opening ceremony, and Prime Minister, Pedro S&aacute;nchez, made the closing</p>
<p>Spain has established itself as one of the most attractive investment destinations in Europe in a complex international context. The Spanish economy has shown high resilience, combining sustained growth, inflation control, record job creation, and improved public finances with a notable reduction in the risk premium and a recovery in international confidence.</p>
<p>In this context, Spanish companies are doing very well. The IBEX 35 is at historic highs and valuations remain clearly attractive: the P/E ratio (times that the profit is reflected in the share price) is 13 times, 2.3 points below its average for the last 37 years and the lowest in Europe (the US is above 28 times). &ldquo;Our average dividend yield of 4.1% is among the highest in the world, and national and international managers indicate that Spain will continue to attract investment after several years off the radar. In short, the stock market is in vogue.&rdquo; With these words, Juan Flames, CEO of BME, referred to the favorable moment for the Spanish stock market during the official SID dinner. Also participating in the opening ceremony were Jos&eacute; Manuel Albares, Minister of Foreign Affairs; Carlos San Basilio, Chairman of the CNMV; and Juan Pablo Garc&iacute;a-Lliber&oacute;s, CCO of AON Spain.</p>
<p>BME has supported this initiative since its inception and, at its 16th edition, had the opportunity to promote the attractiveness of the Spanish market through Bjorn Sibbern, CEO of SIX and Chairman of BME. Sibbern took part in the group photo at the opening ceremony presided over by the King and attended the closing ceremony with the Prime Minister, Pedro S&aacute;nchez.</p>
<p>He also took part in one of the main panels of the meeting: &ldquo;The role of large investors in the development of the Spanish economy.&rdquo; The debate was attended by Manuel de la Rocha, Secretary of State and Director of the Office of Economic Affairs and G20 for the Presidency of the Government; Davies of Abersoch, former UK Minister of Trade and Investment and Chairman of Letterone; Joseph Oughourlian, Chairman of Amber Capital and Grupo PRISA; and Javier Valle, Senior Managing Director of Apollo Global Management. The panel was moderated by Lara Hemzaoui, partner at Linklaters.</p>
<p>In his speech, Bjorn Sibbern highlighted Spain's appeal as an investment destination. "At the last SID, I was optimistic about Spain, but I did not foresee that the IBEX 35 would exceed a 49% increase in value. Trading volume has increased, share prices have risen, and the outlook for 2026 is favorable. I am proud to lead one of the most attractive stock exchanges in Europe.&ldquo; He concluded by saying that &rdquo;we must encourage retail participation so that they can be part of this fantastic market."</p>
<p><span>International context</span></p>
<p>During the various panels, it was identified that institutional stability, commitment to multilateralism, a stronger and more integrated Europe, openness to international trade, and Spain's strategic role as a bridge to Latin America, reinforced by the agreement with Mercosur, are key factors that explain the country's attractiveness. Added to this are the strength of the business fabric, sectoral and geographical diversification, and, notably, the talent of Spanish human capital, considered an essential competitive advantage for attracting productive and long-term investment.</p>
<p>Alongside this positive diagnosis, the debates also identified the main challenges facing the Spanish economy in order to consolidate this favorable cycle. These include the need to accelerate the reduction of public debt, close the productivity gap with Europe and the United States, boost growth, and increase the size of companies. They also include simplifying regulation and improving access to housing. Likewise, the importance of strengthening energy self-sufficiency, advancing investment in defense and innovation, and deepening European integration&mdash;especially in the union of capital markets&mdash;was noted in order to better channel savings toward investment. The final consensus was that Spain is starting from a solid and attractive position, but must take advantage of this moment to continue with structural reforms that guarantee sustainable and competitive growth in the long term.</p>
<p>During the closing ceremony of the SID, Prime Minister Pedro S&aacute;nchez highlighted the solid prospects for the Spanish economy, which is on track to achieve six years of growth and job creation. Finally, he reaffirmed Spain's openness to productive investment, the importance of the agreement with Mercosur, and announced the creation of the &ldquo;Espa&ntilde;a Crece&rdquo; Sovereign Fund to maintain the momentum of the European Next Generation funds, which end this year, and to continue supporting investment in strategic sectors. The Fund will have a base of &euro;10.5 billion and aims to mobilize a further &euro;120 billion through private debt and national and international investments.</p>

<h2>Speech</h2>
<p>Can I start by extending my welcome to all participants in the Bellagio Group, and congratulate the organisers on a timely and highly relevant choice of subject. My role today is some scene setting. I am going to cover three points. First, a reminder of the benefits of open economies and why they need to be supported by an international&nbsp;rules-based system which gives important roles to multilateral institutions. Second, I will set out some of the conditions that help to make this system work. And, finally I will highlight a number of the specific big challenges we face today and must take on.</p>
<p>The benefits of trade and openness in terms of specialisation and larger markets are very well known. So, too, is the need to have rules of the game and some form of commitment and co-ordination device to put these rules into effect and protect legitimate national interests. This may sound reasonable enough, but defining exactly such national interests has been hard, not least because their precise nature and force can change over time. Bretton Woods was a defining moment in terms of institution creation, but it was, of course, context specific &ndash; in the context of beggar my neighbour policies in the inter-war period when the institutional fabric of the gold standard broke down, and then a global war.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of the international rules-based system has a number of key general dependencies.</p>
<p>First, it depends on domestic national support and license&nbsp;<a id="_Hlk219108797"></a>&ndash; it cannot operate in isolation. The goals of international co-operation must sit alongside domestic national policy objectives, but there also must be scope for the international goals to shape those domestic objectives. It cannot be a one-way street and this principle must apply to all participants.</p>
<p>It follows that there is a natural tension between economic globalisation and domestic objectives and economic welfare. We cannot assume this away. Take the case of global imbalances. Our shared objective should be to tackle persistent and excessive imbalances. Effective cooperation should focus on policies that are demonstrably welfare‑improving at home and that, in turn, help to rebalance the global economy. We may not reach the first‑best global outcome (the rarely attainable &lsquo;global planner&rsquo;s optimum&rsquo;), but this approach should bring us materially closer to a mutually beneficial result.</p>
<p>Second, the system must be robust to all states of the world. I will come back to this later in some thoughts on the current context. This requires a considerable degree of flexibility in the design and operation of the institutions and thus the system. In fact, the IFIs I would argue have been pretty good at inventing and re-inventing themselves.</p>
<p>This flexibility of re-invention depends critically on the collective leadership of member countries &ndash; which takes us back to the inbuilt national versus international tension. And, today, we face the challenge of re-invention in a multi-polar world, and one where the nature of the poles is shifting with the revealed tensions. One of the lessons of economic history, going back at least to the nineteenth century and probably further, is that such shifts in polarity invariably strain the operation of the system.</p>
<p>My third point here is that the focus of attention, and tensions, has shifted over time. The outcome of Bretton Woods was more designed around international monetary relations, and that was the focus of the initial decades<sup>1</sup>. I don&rsquo;t want to trivialise the importance of monetary relations today, but the focus of disagreement is now much more on trade. Trade I would argue is more susceptible to domestic pressures than international monetary relations. Why? It raises issues of fairness and equality in domestic political economy much more directly, and thus there is likewise a much more direct link to domestic well-being and domestic interest groups. Trade is more directly blameable &ndash; for instance for changes in relative wages between groups in national economies.</p>
<p>So, I take three points from this opening description of the international system: it depends on domestic license; it must be robust to changing states of the world, and we are seeing change happening; and it is for the moment more about trade, though as a central bank governor I can&rsquo;t wash my hands and say &ldquo;trade doesn&rsquo;t affect my world&rdquo;, it does.</p>
<p>I will now turn to the second theme, namely a number of important conditions which shape the operation of the international system, and how they look in the current setting. I will focus on four such conditions.</p>
<p>The first is that &ndash; put simply &ndash; it is easier to operate the international system during conditions of strong growth in a critical number of the member countries, and more so strong productivity growth which feeds directly living standards. It is easier to liberalise trade and resist protectionism in conditions of more rapid growth, and where that growth acts to alleviate redistributive tensions &ndash; in other words, the growth is inclusive. Broadly speaking, this assisted the relative success of the GATT system of trade agreements<br />post-war.</p>
<p>Today, slower growth, and headwinds to that growth, complicate achieving domestic consensus to support international co-operation and free trade. While it is true that openness supports growth and has reduced global poverty, it can have, and has had, distributional consequences in economies, and there has been an undermining of social capital so-called and domestic cohesion. And, in turn, this creates opposition to openness.</p>
<p>I mentioned headwinds which operate to restrict growth. Today, I see four such headwinds, which is a high number and thus a strong counter&ndash;current to growth. The first is that in terms of productivity cycles &ndash; and to borrow Schumpeter&rsquo;s phraseology &ndash;industrial development involves changes that &ldquo;occurs in discrete rushes&rdquo; separated from each other by spans of comparative quiet<sup>2</sup>. Today, in terms of technology, we have been between such discrete rushes for around the last 15 years. My assumption is that AI and robotics will be the next &ldquo;rush&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The second headwind is that most countries are facing populations that are on average ageing, and this contributes to lower growth and increased demands on fiscal resources.</p>
<p>The third headwind is that for many countries the demands for defence expenditure are increasing. This can contribute to growth, but also adds to fiscal pressures.</p>
<p>And, the fourth headwind comes from Climate-related economic shocks and the consequences of the policies chosen to tackle these shocks.</p>
<p>Taken together, these headwinds to growth are a powerful force to complicate the operation of the international system.</p>
<p>The second contextual issue for the operation of the international system concerns domestic industrial policies. Industrial policy went out of favour in the 1980s, or at least so did the form that was tagged as picking winners and thus anti-competitive. That was then as it were.</p>
<p>Industrial policy is now back with us as an issue &ndash; it has grown in use. But it has &ndash; at least in some of its more modern forms &ndash; also changed in nature. As an example, it can be a response to the headwinds I discussed earlier.</p>
<p>Industrial policy has become a focus of dispute as a potential driver of persistent global imbalances. Preliminary Bank of England Staff work suggests that macro factors remain the dominant drivers, but that industrial policy applied at scale over an extended period &ndash; particularly alongside a relatively closed capital account &ndash; can have material short-to-medium-term effects. Staff are also developing a theoretical framework to clarify the channels through which these effects can arise: industrial policy expands what a country produces, but if domestic absorption is simultaneously suppressed, the excess flows abroad as a current account surplus. Meanwhile, absorbing countries see employment drawn away from tradables into lower-productivity sectors.</p>
<p>In sum, we have to accept that in our assessment of imbalances and their causes, we need to embed both macro and microeconomic perspectives. Surveillance has to keep pace with these changes. The Bank Staff work which we plan to publish this spring, represents an important, if modest, first step in this direction, and we hope it will serve as a call for more empirical analysis on this issue.</p>
<p>This brings me to the third contextual issue. The tension around the assessment and surveillance of imbalances is running high &ndash; that&rsquo;s a statement of the obvious, but has to be said nonetheless. The assessment has to be without fear or favour, and thus has to be objective, and seen to be so. Seeking truth from facts sounds easier than it is in practice. Theory alone will not get us there. Practice is necessary for achievement, and that practice has to be backed up by our support. Part of the purpose of international agencies is that from time to time they have to tell us what we don&rsquo;t want to hear, let alone act upon. Of course, they have to be accountable for the accuracy and quality of the assessment. But, accepting that, we have to call out messenger shooting.</p>
<p>This brings me to the fourth and final contextual issue. The rise of so-called populism makes the whole task harder. Three features of populism stand out in this respect. First, a tendency to emphasise domestic production and wealth distribution as in opposition to international openness rather than as complementary. Second, a tendency to attribute unfavourable conditions to outside forces, rather than to point to shared challenges. And, third, encouraging a decline in trust such that institutions &ndash; domestic and international &ndash; are viewed as distant, unresponsive and acting for the benefit of powerful and uncontrollable interests.</p>
<p>For those of us who are institutionalised, the answer is that we have to challenge back, in deeds more than just words. But, we have to ensure our houses are in order too.</p>
<p>This brings me to the end &ndash; all that is left is to point to four things that we have to assert and demonstrate continually.</p>
<p>First, to emphasise the benefits of robust economic openness for growth and well-being. Now is not the time to close the world to the benefits of trade. But to do this, we have to be realistic and assertive in defining and achieving robust openness.</p>
<p>Second, recognise the importance of, and invest in the broadest sense, in the multilateral institutions. We should not pretend that all has been perfect, and we must be prepared to make changes where they are called for, as was done in the past. But we must be clear and agreed that a world without effective institutions is unlikely to be stable.</p>
<p>Third, we should seek to enable the next major contribution to global productivity growth &ndash; the next discrete rush &ndash; likely to be AI and robotics &ndash; but to do so in a way that is sensitive to managing the consequences, and particularly invest in developing skills.</p>
<p>Fourth, I am going take a free shot because I also chair an international organisation, the Financial Stability Board. Financial Stability is a condition of growth. Acceptance of this, and interpretation of and agreement on what it means, is not as well grounded as it needs to be. But that would be another speech, or alternatively I can recommend the 88 page assessment of bank capital requirements that the Bank of England published in December.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I would like to thank Sarah Breeden, Ambrogio Cesa-Bianchi, Dan Christen, Peter Denton, Mark Joy, Karen Jude, Clare Lombardelli, Martin Seneca, James Talbot and Matt Trott for their comments and help in the preparation of these remarks.</p>

<ul>
<li><span>It is the&nbsp;first&nbsp;company to join BME&rsquo;s growth markets&nbsp;in 2026</span></li>
</ul>
<p>BME Growth today welcomed<span>&nbsp;Treelogic</span>. The traditional bell ringing ceremony held at the Madrid Stock Exchange was led by&nbsp;<span>Enrique&nbsp;Berdayes&nbsp;&Aacute;lvarez,&nbsp;</span>COO,&nbsp;<span>Ignacio&nbsp;Morate&nbsp;del Fresno,</span>&nbsp;CHRO&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span>Pablo&nbsp;Pi&ntilde;era&nbsp;&Aacute;lvarez,&nbsp;</span>CFO of the company, who was accompanied by<span>&nbsp;Juan Flames</span>, CEO of BME, and Jes&uacute;s Gonz&aacute;lez, managing director of BME Growth.</p>
<p>The company, which is the first to debut on&nbsp;BME&rsquo;s growth markets&nbsp;so far this year, took a reference price of&nbsp;2.50&nbsp;euros per share, implying a total valuation of the company of&nbsp;15&nbsp;million euros.</p>
<p>"We are starting the year in the best possible way, with a new addition to our growth markets. It is essential that&nbsp;more&nbsp;companies use these markets as a lever to grow,&nbsp;consolidate&nbsp;and give greater visibility to their projects and initiatives. Furthermore, this case is particularly significant, as&nbsp;Treelogic&nbsp;is a company that supports others in their processes and projects, which will contribute even more significantly to the industrial development of our country," added Juan Flames.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joining BME Growth marks the beginning of a new phase for&nbsp;Treelogic. It is a natural step in our evolution as a technology company, which will enable us to gain visibility, strengthen our corporate structure, and continue to develop high value-added projects,&rdquo; said Marcelino Cortina, CEO of&nbsp;Treelogic. &ldquo;Joining BME Growth marks the beginning of a new phase for&nbsp;Treelogic.

In 2025, these markets welcomed 14 new companies and now have more than 150 listed firms, which raised 605 million euros last year through 105 capital increases. BME offers alternatives for every type of company&mdash;from those in their early formation stages, via preparatory steps in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.entornopremercado.es/esp/">Pre-Market Environment</a>, to growth markets and the main stock exchange for large corporations. Among the advantages of accessing capital markets for small and medium-sized enterprises are financing, enhanced reputation, greater visibility, support for inorganic growth, and an improved ability to attract and&nbsp;retain&nbsp;talent.&nbsp;</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Fines Oil Rig Consultant £309,843 For Insider Dealing</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA has fined Russel Gerrity &pound;309,843 for using inside information to net himself &pound;128,765.</p>
</div>
</section></p>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>As a consultant, Mr Gerrity had access to information about whether oil and gas had been discovered during the drilling of wells. Between October 2018 and January 2022, he took advantage of this and used inside information to buy shares in Chariot Oil &amp; Gas Limited and Eco (Atlantic) Oil and Gas Plc ahead of announcements that increased their price. &nbsp;</p>
<p>On another occasion, he used inside information to avoid a loss. He sold shares that he already owned ahead of an announcement that no oil or gas had been found, which then resulted in a price fall. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The FCA was initially notified of some of Mr Gerrity&rsquo;s trading through Suspicious Transaction and Order Reports (STORs) submitted by a firm, showing the vital role of industry in uncovering market abuse. &nbsp;</p>
<p>During its subsequent investigation, the FCA&rsquo;s systems detected further suspicious trades placed by Mr Gerrity, over multiple accounts with different brokers, while he was based outside of the UK. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Steve Smart, executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said:</p>
<p>'Mr Gerrity abused his position to line his own pockets. We will take action against those who damage the integrity of our markets, and seek to recover any ill-gotten gains.&rsquo;&nbsp;</p>

<li>Mr Gerrity engaged in insider dealing in breach of Article 14(a) of the UK Market Abuse Regulations. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Mr Gerrity agreed to solve this matter and qualified for a 30% (stage 1) discount under the FCA&rsquo;s settlement procedures. Were it not for this discount, the FCA would have imposed a financial penalty of &pound;387,448.</li>

<title>Speech By Mr Loh Boon Chye, CEO SGX Group, At The Launch Of SID Chairpersons Guild</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Mr Chee Hong Tat, Minister for National Development and Deputy Chairman of MAS<br />Mr Yeoh Oon Jin, Chairman of SID<br />Board chairs from SGX-listed companies<br />Distinguished guests<br />Ladies and Gentlemen</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good morning, and thank you for joining us at the SGX IPO Arena.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This venue is where many entrepreneurs have struck the gong to mark their companies&rsquo; entry into the public markets.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as we all know, the IPO is not the finish line; it is the starting point of a much longer journey.</p>
<p><strong>Why the Guild Matters</strong></p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, as we launch the SID Chairpersons&rsquo; Guild, we recognise that listed companies exist not just for their controlling shareholders, but for their entire investor base.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These investors expect companies to create sustainable value, and that requires strong leadership at the very top.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the CEO of a listed company, I can attest to the difference that wise counsel makes.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At SGX, I have been fortunate to learn from three very distinguished chairmen &ndash; Mr Chew Choon Seng, Mr Kwa Chong Seng and our current chairman, Mr Koh Boon Hwee, all of whom have provided invaluable perspectives to my management team and me.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not every board or CEO has access to such guidance. That is why this Guild matters: it creates a trusted space for chairs to share insights, exchange ideas, and mentor one another, so that every company can benefit from leadership excellence.</p>
<p><strong>Connecting to the National Agenda</strong></p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This initiative aligns closely with the broader Value Unlock agenda that Minister Chee announced in November.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a national effort to strengthen governance, sharpen strategy, and enhance investor confidence. The Guild is a cornerstone of this vision.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By uplifting board leadership, we reinforce Singapore&rsquo;s reputation for trusted, forward-looking companies.</p>
<p><strong>Looking Ahead</strong></p>
<p>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the Guild&rsquo;s forums and peer-learning opportunities, chairs will be able to engage with global experts, regulators and investors &ndash; building the capabilities needed to navigate complexity and unlock long-term value.</p>
<p>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is how we move from compliance to true competitiveness, from meeting expectations to shaping the future.</p>
<p><strong>Closing</strong></p>
<p>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, I congratulate SID for driving this initiative and thank all of you for being part of this journey.</p>
<p>15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together, let&rsquo;s make the Chairpersons&rsquo; Guild not just a network, but a force for excellence &ndash; one that complements national efforts and sets new benchmarks for governance and value creation.</p>
<p>16.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you.</p>

<title>Treasury International Capital Data For November</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/treasury-international-capital-data-for-november-2026115/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/treasury-international-capital-data-for-november-2026115/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The U.S. Department of the Treasury today released Treasury International Capital (TIC) data for November 2025.&nbsp; The next release, which will report on data for December 2025, is scheduled for February 18, 2026.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sum total in November of all net foreign acquisitions of long-term securities, short-term U.S. securities, and banking flows was a net TIC inflow of $212.0 billion. &nbsp;Of this, net foreign private inflows were $167.2 billion, and net foreign official inflows were $44.9 billion.</p>
<p>Foreign residents increased their holdings of long-term U.S. securities in November; their net purchases were $221.8 billion.&nbsp; Net purchases by private foreign investors were $157.8 billion, and net purchases by foreign official institutions were $64.0 billion.</p>
<p>U.S. residents increased their holdings of long-term foreign securities, with net purchases of $1.6 billion.</p>
<p>After including adjustments, such as estimated foreign portfolio acquisitions of U.S. stocks through stock swaps, overall net foreign purchases of long-term securities are estimated to have been $220.2 billion in November.</p>
<p>Foreign residents increased their holdings of U.S. Treasury bills by $0.4 billion.&nbsp; Foreign resident holdings of all dollar-denominated short-term U.S. securities and other custody liabilities decreased by $6.5 billion.</p>
<p>Banks&rsquo; own net dollar-denominated liabilities to foreign residents decreased&nbsp;by $1.7 billion.</p>
<p>Complete data are available on the Treasury website&nbsp;<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/data/treasury-international-capital-tic-system">here</a>.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-center">###</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About TIC Data</p>
<p>The monthly data on holdings of long-term securities, as well as the monthly table on Major Foreign Holders of Treasury Securities, reflect foreign holdings of U.S. securities collected primarily on the basis of custodial data.&nbsp; These data help provide a window into foreign ownership of U.S. securities, but they cannot attribute holdings of U.S. securities with complete accuracy.&nbsp; For example, if a U.S. Treasury security purchased by a foreign resident is held in a custodial account in a third country, the true ownership of the security will not be reflected in the data.&nbsp; The custodial data will also not properly attribute U.S. Treasury securities managed by foreign private portfolio managers who invest on behalf of residents of other countries.&nbsp; In addition, foreign countries may hold dollars and other U.S. assets that are not captured in the TIC data.&nbsp; For these reasons, it is difficult to draw precise conclusions from TIC data about changes in the foreign holdings of U.S. financial assets by individual countries.</p>

<title>CalPERS Hires Shari Slate As Chief Diversity, Equity, And Inclusion Officer</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The California Public Employees&rsquo; Retirement System announced Monday that it has hired Shari Slate as its new Chief Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Officer.</p>
<p>Slate, a Sacramento area resident, has spent nearly two decades helping large companies work toward a purpose-driven culture that considers the needs and experiences of all employees, customers, and other stakeholders. Most recently, she served as Senior Vice President and Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer at CVS Health, whose businesses include not only CVS drugstores but also pharmacy benefits management and Aetna health insurance.</p>
<p>Prior to joining CVS, Slate was Chief Inclusion and Collaboration Officer and Senior Vice President at Silicon Valley giant Cisco Systems Inc., where she helped launch the Office of Inclusion and Collaboration in 2015.</p>
<p>During Slate&rsquo;s tenure at Cisco, she helped the company build a pipeline of talent across the full spectrum of diversity. Fortune Magazine recognized Cisco as No. 1 of the &ldquo;World&rsquo;s 25 Best Places to Work&rdquo; in 2019 and 2020 and Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For&reg; in the U.S. for three consecutive years: 2021, 2022, and 2023.</p>
<p>At CalPERS, Slate will drive the ongoing effort to integrate diversity, equity, and inclusion across the organization and beyond with suppliers, contractors, and investment partners. She will be a member of the Executive Team and report directly to CEO Marcie Frost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shari brings the kind of leadership this moment calls for &ndash; connecting diversity, inclusion, and equity to trust, governance and our core values,&rdquo; Frost said. &ldquo;She will help CalPERS continue to lead with our purpose, which is to deliver the best outcomes for the millions of people who depend on us for their retirement and health care benefits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slate said she joined CalPERS because of &ldquo;its clarity of purpose and the responsibility it carries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;CalPERS shows up for people at one of the most important moments of their lives, when work ends and trust matters most,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I hope to ensure that CalPERS works for all the people it was built to serve &ndash; beginning with our people and extending to every member who depends on this system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A graduate of Mills College, Slate began her career in sales and was an award-winning manager for Xerox Corp. before being hired at Sun Microsystems as one of the youngest diversity officers at a Fortune 500 company.</p>
<p>She has served on numerous boards and councils, including the California State University Foundation Board of Governors and the World Economic Forum&rsquo;s Global Future Council on Systemic Inequalities and Social Cohesion.</p>
<p>Slate represented Cisco on the Business Roundtable&rsquo;s Diversity &amp; Inclusion Working Group after 181 CEOs redefined the purpose of a corporation to serve all stakeholders. She contributed to shaping the group&rsquo;s view of DEI not as a standalone goal, but the connective tissue linking employee well-being, business performance, customer trust, supplier inclusion, and community impact.</p>

<title>Office Of The Comptroller Of The US Currency Announces Enforcement Actions For January 2026</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) today released enforcement actions for January 2026.</p>
<p>The OCC uses enforcement actions against an institution-affiliated party (IAP) to deter, encourage correction of, or prevent violations, unsafe or unsound practices, or breaches of fiduciary duty. Enforcement actions against IAPs reinforce the accountability of individuals for their conduct regarding the affairs of a bank. The term &ldquo;institution-affiliated party,&rdquo; or IAP, is defined in 12 USC 1813(u) and includes bank directors, officers, employees, and controlling shareholders. Orders of Prohibition prohibit an individual from any participation in the affairs of a bank or other institution as defined in 12 USC 1818(e)(7).

<title>UK Prudential Regulation Authority To Streamline Supervision As Part Of 2026 Priorities</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-prudential-regulation-authority-to-streamline-supervision-as-part-of-2026-pri-2026115/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-prudential-regulation-authority-to-streamline-supervision-as-part-of-2026-pri-2026115/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) has today published its supervisory priorities for 2026, outlining in a letter its sector-specific priorities for the coming year to all banks, building societies, insurers and other PRA-regulated firms.</p>
<p>These include important plans to streamline the supervisory process by moving some supervisory activity, including Periodic Summary Meetings (PSMs), to a two-year cycle.</p>
<p>These meetings are an internal, formal review led by the PRA to consider potential risks posed by a regulated firm to the PRA&rsquo;s objectives, and to set the supervisory strategy for the coming period.</p>
<p>Over recent years, the PRA has transitioned some firms to biennial review cycles, reflecting the longer-term nature of supervisory workplans and allowing firms and supervisors to focus resources more efficiently on identifying and remediating key risks.</p>
<p>From 1 March larger firms will begin to move to this two-year cycle, while maintaining a regular cadence for discussion of important matters, alongside ad hoc supervisory meetings. This will result in firms having a more proportionate and efficient set of engagements with the PRA.</p>
<p>The Priorities letters are designed to help firms understand the main areas of supervisory focus over the next year, addressing key risks in each sector while setting out the PRA&rsquo;s priorities to support competition, competitiveness and growth. Other streamlining measures include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accelerating timelines for reviewing senior manager applications, new firm authorisations and internal ratings-based model change pre-approval applications;</li>
<li>Developing the new UK captive regime for insurers, through a summer 2026 consultation with a view to launch the new regime in 2027;</li>
<li>And streamlining and modernising reporting requirements through the Future Banking Data project.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sam Woods, Deputy Governor for Prudential Regulation and Chief Executive Officer of the PRA, said:</p>
<p>'As we set out our priorities for 2026, we are also updating our approach by moving from an annual to a two-year supervisory cycle for firms. This will allow us to make our operations more efficient and help streamline firms&rsquo; interactions with the PRA.'</p>
<p>These priorities build on the PRA&rsquo;s extensive work to maintain stability and promote growth and competitiveness in the financial sector. Recent changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The removal of the Building Societies Sourcebook alongside&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2025/december/regulators-announce-plans-to-support-growth-of-mutuals-sector">new measures</a>&nbsp;to support the growth of the mutuals sector;</li>

<li>The PSM process typically involves the PRA internally setting out the forward-looking supervisory strategy for individual firms, before a letter is shared with the firm&rsquo;s board and management to outline its assessment of key risks, as well as any areas of focus, and request mitigating actions be taken where necessary.</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Lingfeng Capital today announced the forthcoming launch of the&nbsp;Digital Venture Fund (DVF). DVF delivers a regulated, multi-chain tokenised venture fund providing institutional-level access to early-stage fintech and digital infrastructure opportunities. The fund will be launched on&nbsp;<span>LSEG&rsquo;s Digital Markets Infrastructure (DMI)</span>&nbsp;platform during a&nbsp;<span>London Stock Exchange market opening ceremony in March</span>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Designed as a next-generation venture product, DVF combines Lingfeng Capital&rsquo;s established investment capability with LSEG&rsquo;s digital markets infrastructure and Archax&rsquo;s digital exchange and custody framework. Together, this creates an environment where traditional and digital-native investors can participate in the same venture strategy through modernised access rails enabled by distributed ledger technology.</p>
<p>&ldquo;DVF exists to prove that high-quality venture investing can be expanded by tokenised access,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span>Brian McNulty, Partner, DVF at Lingfeng Capital</span>. &ldquo;Investors want diversification, they want innovation&nbsp;and they want regulated structures they can trust. We are now able to offer a product that stays firmly institutional while opening the door to new forms of participation and liquidity. This collaboration is an important milestone in connecting global capital to digital markets infrastructure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;LSEG is pleased that Lingfeng Capital and DVF has chosen to use LSEG&rsquo;s Digital Markets Infrastructure&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span>Darko Hajdukovic, Head of Digital Markets Infrastructure</span>. "We&rsquo;re excited to be working with such an innovative firm, offering professional investors access to exciting new investment opportunities through LSEG&rsquo;s independent, trusted and scaled network.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Archax will provide regulated digital issuance, secondary-market connectivity and custody services, enabling DVF to offer optional token-based access while remaining fully compliant with institutional standards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the first FCA-regulated digital securities exchange, broker and custodian, we are uniquely positioned to provide compliant token issuance, secondary trading and custody within a single regulated environment. DVF showcases how real-world assets and digital rails can operate together to open new markets for investors without sacrificing oversight or trust.&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span>Graham Rodford, CEO and co-founder of Archax</span>.</p>
<p>DVF invests in fintech and digital-infrastructure companies through a traditional venture strategy, with the tokenised structure enabling modern distribution, improved efficiency and offers optional future liquidity. Digital-native investors will also be able to diversify into a fundamentals-driven venture fund through traditional channels.</p>
<p>DVF represents the first institutional-grade venture product designed for cross-participation between traditional investors, digital-asset holders and blockchain foundations, with future phases enabling deeper network integration and expanded investor access.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Transaction Network Services (TNS) has expanded its global market data and infrastructure footprint in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region by adding connectivity to the Japan Alternative Market (JAX). This new connection provides TNS customers with direct, managed access to JAX&rsquo;s market data feeds, delivered across TNS&rsquo; extensive global network.</span><br /><br /><span>JAX began operations in December 2024, adding a new trading venue to Japan&rsquo;s equities market. Through TNS&rsquo; connectivity, global firms can access JAX market data and incorporate it into their trading and analytics workflows.</span><br /><br /><span>&ldquo;The rise of alternative trading venues like JAX represents a significant shift in the Asian financial landscape,&rdquo; said Jeff Mezger, Vice President of Product Management, TNS. &ldquo;JAX is a compelling success story, and by making its market data available to our global customer base, we are helping to lower the barriers to entry for firms looking to capitalize on this competitive shift.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span>While Asian exchanges often require bespoke broker connections for order routing and clearing, TNS simplifies market data access. Firms can leverage TNS&rsquo; expansive extranet, consisting of over 5,000 endpoints for local broker access, and can view JAX market data alongside other major exchanges via TNS&rsquo; low latency&nbsp;</span><a href="https://tnsi.com/solutions/financial/network-maps-global-access/">managed global network</a><span>.</span><br /><br /><span>&ldquo;Partnering with TNS provides JAX with a direct link to a broad, international community of market participants,&rdquo; said a JAX spokesperson. &ldquo;Their global infrastructure and deep experience in market connectivity supports JAX&rsquo;s continued growth as we build a more competitive trading environment in Japan.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span>The JAX integration reinforces TNS&rsquo; continued investment in expanding its APAC footprint and delivering reliable,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://tnsi.com/solutions/financial/market-data/">low-latency market data</a><span>&nbsp;to customers worldwide. TNS&rsquo; Japanese exchange portfolio also includes Japannext, Tokyo Financial Exchange (TFX) and the Japan Exchange Group (JPX), which encompasses the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE), Osaka Exchange (OSE), and Tokyo Commodity Exchange (TOCOM).</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Agentic commerce is accelerating rapidly, reshaping how consumers discover, decide, and buy products and services online. Industry leaders forecast that a significant share of digital commerce will soon be agent-assisted:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-agentic-commerce-opportunity-how-ai-agents-are-ushering-in-a-new-era-for-consumers-and-merchants" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">McKinsey projects that by 2030, agentic commerce could see between $3 trillion and $5 trillion in global retail value.</a>&nbsp;As agentic commerce evolves, it faces a key challenge: securely integrating AI with complex payment systems simply.<b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<h4>New assets to power agentic commerce</h4>
<p><a href="https://docs.connect.worldline-solutions.com/documentation/ConnectAI/worldline-model-context-protocol-mcp-server" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Worldline&rsquo;s Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers</a>&nbsp;on the Global Collect platform address this by acting as a secure bridge and translation layer between LLMs and Worldline&rsquo;s APIs, enabling AI agents to initiate payment actions via natural language. For merchants, the MCP server unlocks innovation avenues and supports agent-initiated actions such as payment creation, refunds, status checks, and payment captures. It also enables AI-driven shopping by allowing agents to share secure payment links while maintaining security and compliance.</p>
<p>The second capability is&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.connect.worldline-solutions.com/documentation/ConnectAI/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="ConnectAI">ConnectAI</a>, a dedicated hub on its&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.connect.worldline-solutions.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Documentation Site">Documentation Site</a>&nbsp;for developers and merchants to explore, build, test, and prepare for agentic commerce. ConnectAI brings together tools, documentation, and guidance for emerging agentic payment protocols.</p>
<p><b>Stijn Gasthuys, Head of Global Commerce at Worldline</b>,<b>&nbsp;</b>commented: &ldquo;Agentic commerce will unlock new waves of innovation, helping merchants deliver better customer experiences. Our investments in this area position Worldline to capture a growing global market for AI-powered transactions, delivering secure, scalable infrastructure that empowers merchants and developers to innovate with confidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Gertjan Dewaele, VP of Product &amp; Technology at Worldline</b>,<b>&nbsp;</b>commented: &ldquo;The shift to agentic commerce is underway, and MCP servers are the first building block for moving merchants from experimentation to real-world deployment. By providing secure, simple access to Worldline&rsquo;s payment capabilities for AI agents, we enable the next generation of agentic commerce and streamline internal operations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Worldline is actively shaping the future of agentic commerce by collaborating across the broader ecosystem with networks, tech leaders, AI platforms, and partners, laying the groundwork for secure, scalable agent-initiated payments. This includes active support for emerging standards such as&nbsp;<a href="https://worldline.com/en/home/main-navigation/resources/blogs/2025/worldline-collaborates-with-google-cloud-on-the-agents-payments-protocol-for-users-merchants-and-payment-providers-to-transact-with-confidence">Google&rsquo;s Agent Payments Protocol (AP2)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/under-the-hood-universal-commerce-protocol-ucp/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP)">Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP)</a>, with a strong focus on European regulatory and trusted requirements.</p>

<title>LSEG Launches Digital Settlement House</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/lseg-launches-digital-settlement-house-2026115/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/lseg-launches-digital-settlement-house-2026115/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>LSEG today announces the launch of a new digital settlement service, Digital Settlement House (LSEG DiSH), an open-access platform which enables programmatic and instantaneous settlement between independent payment networks, both on and off chain. Through commercial bank deposits held on the DiSH ledger (DiSH Cash), the service will enable the 24/7 instantaneous movement of commercial bank money in multiple currencies and jurisdictions, PVP and DVP, providing a real cash leg for FX and digital asset transactions and settlements.</p>
<p>With LSEG DiSH, market participants will be able to conduct PvP or DvP and settlements using any asset, orchestrating payments on any connected network, digital and traditional. DiSH Cash, LSEG DiSH's ledger enabled commercial bank money solution, will operate accounts at commercial banks, providing members with instant ownership of a commercial bank deposit at any bank within the LSEG DiSH network, and a mechanism for the 24/7 movement of commercial bank money. LSEG DiSH can facilitate settlement on its own ledger, or act as notary to facilitate settlement in other networks and assets.</p>
<p>By using LSEG DiSH, users can unlock trapped assets, enabling instantaneous use of cash, securities and digital assets 24/7. They will also be able to optimise liquidity through new tools that enable intraday borrowing and lending to better manage assets and obligations. The service also enables users to reduce settlement risk through reduced settlement timelines, synchronised settlement, and increased collateral availability.</p>
<p>The launch follows a successful Proof of Concept (PoC) in collaboration with Digital Asset and a consortium of leading financial institutions, completing transactions on the Canton Network. Executed across multiple assets and currencies, the transactions leveraged commercial bank deposits at leading commercial banks, with ownership recorded on the LSEG DiSH ledger, enabling the PoC participants to instantaneously transfer commercial bank deposits. The deposits were tokenised on the Canton Network for use as a true cash leg of the transactions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>LSEG DiSH will operate through LSEG&rsquo;s Post Trade Solutions business, utilising a trusted rulebook framework and account structure, supporting a broad network of members across multiple commercial banks and currencies. Instantaneous settlement of cash means that LSEG DiSH can offer dynamic management of intraday liquidity and funding, as well as 24/7 management of settlements and margin.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Daniel Maguire, Group Head, LSEG Markets and CEO, LCH Group</span>, said: &ldquo;LSEG DiSH expands the tokenised cash and cash like solutions available to the market, and for the first time, offers a real cash solution tokenised on the blockchain utilising cash in multiple currencies held at commercial banks. This innovative service will enable users to reduce settlement risk, and integrate existing cash, securities and digital assets across new and existing market infrastructure. We look forward to developing this service in partnership with the market.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<ul class="pr-top-bullets">
<li>Kristi Tange appointed as Group Chief Risk Officer</li>
<li>Clare Weaver MBA, becomes Chief Legal Officer</li>
</ul>
<p>ClearToken, the digital financial market infrastructure firm, today announces two senior appointments to enhance its Senior Leadership Team and further strengthen its legal and risk functions.</p>
<p><span>Kristi Tange has been appointed Group Chief Risk Officer,</span>&nbsp;to lead governance, risk, and strategic oversight, including compliance, communications, and regulatory relations. She brings nearly three decades of experience at Goldman Sachs across operations, risk, and finance in the US, UK, and Japan.</p>
<p>Most recently, Kristi served as Global Head of Operational Risk and Resilience at Goldman Sachs, where she led a strategic uplift of operational risk and UK resilience programmes. Previously, she headed Recovery and Resolution Planning, successfully filing two US Title I resolution plans. Her experience also includes enterprise risk, where she led risk identification, and senior leadership roles in operations across liquidity and collateral, client onboarding (including financial crimes), client assets, data, regulatory reporting, tax, derivatives, and treasury.</p>
<p><span>Clare Weaver, MBA, has become Chief Legal Officer,</span>&nbsp;where she will lead the Legal &amp; Regulatory function for the Group, providing strategic legal and regulatory advisory support to the CEO and Boards and managing the Group&rsquo;s legal affairs. Clare has been ClearToken&rsquo;s legal counsel and Head of Legal &amp; Regulatory and Company Secretary since inception in 2023.</p>
<p>Clare brings over 20 years of experience across specialist Corporate, Commercial, M&amp;A, fintech, and financial regulatory matters both in private practice and in industry, for more than 15 years deeply covering &ldquo;general counsel&rdquo; roles spanning all legal matters (including employment, commercial, corporate and finance). Clare previously established the Nomura Digital Office legal function and was founding interim CLO of Laser Digital (part of Nomura), before joining ClearToken in 2023.</p>
<p class="pr-subheading">Maintaining developmental momentum</p>
<p>These recent appointments are the latest milestones in ClearToken&rsquo;s growth, as the company seeks to unlock the full potential of 24/7 digital markets by offering horizontal post-trade services with the legal certainty offered by a regulated financial market infrastructure (FMI). They are also important steps towards the company&rsquo;s ambition to provide clearing and settlement services across digital asset markets for securities, derivatives and financing transactions.</p>
<p>In 2025, ClearToken achieved&nbsp;<a href="https://cleartoken.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CLEARTOKEN-November-2025-FCA-Authorisation-Press-Release.pdf" target="_blank">FCA Authorisation</a>&nbsp;to launch its delivery-versus-payment (DvP) settlement platform,&nbsp;<a href="https://cleartoken.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ClearToken-Adopts-Nasdaq-Eqlipse-Clearing-Press-Release.pdf" target="_blank">selected Nasdaq</a>&nbsp;as its technology partner, and&nbsp;<a href="https://cleartoken.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/CT-Settle-Go-Live-press-release-6.12.2025.pdf" target="_blank">launched CT Settle</a>, its DvP settlement platform for digital assets. ClearToken is now proceeding with its formal application for authorisation from the Bank of England as a Central Counterparty (CCP).</p>
<p><span>Benjamin Santos-Stephens, CEO of ClearToken, said:</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;We are delighted to welcome Kristi to ClearToken and congratulate Clare on her new role with us. These appointments build on the momentum we achieved in 2025 and are important milestones for us as we continue to build for the future. Such high calibre appointments bring with them a wealth of relevant experience and expertise and are welcome enhancements to our senior leadership team, as we continue with our strategy to create the world&rsquo;s first clearing house and settlement depository for both tokenised traditional and digitally native assets.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Kristi Tange, Chief Risk Officer of ClearToken, commented:</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;It is a very exciting time to join ClearToken, which is well positioned to unify the traditional finance and digital assets worlds and unlock the massive potential of tokenisation. I am looking forward to working with the energetic and visionary team here to build the financial market infrastructure which will underpin the future of global, 24/7 markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Clare Weaver, Chief Legal Officer at ClearToken said:</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Having worked with ClearToken well before joining full time in 2023, I&rsquo;m extremely proud of what we have achieved together so far. As the legislative landscape, and therefore opportunities, for digital assets continues to develop across the globe, I look forward to helping our strong, diverse team deliver on our growth ambitions in 2026 and beyond, and at the same time ensuring that legal certainty and compliance remains at the core of what we do.&rdquo;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) confirms that as a result of a sophisticated phishing attack, first disclosed in August 2025, approximately 750,000 Canadian investors have been impacted.</p>
<p>We deeply regret this occurred and apologize for any inconvenience or concern.</p>
<p>CIRO is reaching out to affected investors to alert them of the incident and offering credit monitoring as an added precaution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are intent on doing right by those who are personally affected,&rdquo; said Andrew Kriegler President and Chief Executive Officer of CIRO. &ldquo;We take our public interest role very seriously. Matters of privacy and security are extremely important to us, as are our guiding organizational values of transparency and accountability. That&rsquo;s why we remain committed to further strengthening our own cybersecurity defences and data security practices and supporting the ongoing efforts of the broader investment industry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following information may have been impacted: dates of birth, phone numbers, annual income, social insurance numbers, government issued ID numbers, investment account numbers and account statements. CIRO does not collect account login detail, such as passwords, security questions and PINs and therefore that information was not at risk.</p>
<p>CIRO received this information in the normal course of carrying out its regulatory mandate to protect investors from improper investment conduct and practices, and through its investigative, compliance assessment and market regulation work.</p>
<p><em>Protecting Canadian Investors</em></p>
<p>CIRO quickly contained the incident and took immediate steps to secure our systems and protect the information in our care. We notified law enforcement and all relevant authorities, including privacy commissioners. A leading third-party forensic IT investigator was retained to determine what information was impacted.</p>
<p>CIRO launched a thorough investigation with the support of external cybersecurity experts. Our preliminary investigation revealed that registration information for member firms and registered individuals had been affected. We immediately shared those findings publicly and directly with our members and impacted registrants. At that time, we noted the investigation was ongoing, and we committed to sharing the final findings of the e-discovery process once the review was complete. After more than 9,000 hours of examination, we can now confirm the full extent of the incident.</p>
<p>There is currently no evidence that the information has been misused. We continue to monitor for malicious activity and have not identified any threat activity or exposure on the dark web.</p>
<p>As a precaution and in order to help detect possible misuse of information, CIRO is providing affected investors two-years of credit monitoring and identity theft protection with both of the major credit agencies. Step by step instructions detailing how to activate protection services will be communicated to those impacted, directly.</p>
<p><em>Additional Information</em></p>
<p>Only some clients or former clients of CIRO dealer members were impacted by the cybersecurity breach. Clients impacted by the cyber incident will be sent a notification letter by CIRO starting on January 14, 2026. If you did not receive a notification letter from CIRO but want to confirm whether you were impacted and should have received a notification letter, you can request this information from CIRO in writing using the contact form available in the cyber incident section of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ciro.ca/ciro-cybersecurity-incident" target="_self" title="CIRO cybersecurity incident">CIRO&rsquo;s website</a>&nbsp;(ciro.ca).</p>

<title>Regulations, The Supply Side, And Monetary Policy, Federal Reserve Governor Stephen I. Miran, At The Delphi Economic Forum, National Gallery – Alexandros Soutsos Museum, Athens, Greece</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/regulations-the-supply-side-and-monetary-policy-federal-reserve-governor-step-2026114/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Madame Ambassador, for the introduction and the opportunity to speak today. My topic is the implications of deregulation for monetary policy, an appropriate one for this setting.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;Greece's recovery from the crisis that began in 2009 was only possible after the Greek people implemented substantial and painful reforms, including alleviating suffocating over-regulation in many sectors. In addition to the other reforms embraced by Greece, deregulation freed businesses to compete domestically and internationally, and promoted individuals' access to the economy. The range of reforms has included liberalizing product and service markets, easing licensing and administrative burdens, opening previously restricted professions, and increasing labor market flexibility. The government liberalized electricity and gas utilities; privatized airports, ports, and utilities; and reformed bankruptcy procedures and other business laws.</p>
<p>While it is challenging to quantify how these deregulatory actions have affected the economy, there is little doubt that these reforms have supported a remarkable return to economic growth and higher living standards. Macroeconomic stability has returned to Greece. Unemployment has fallen to its lowest level since the Global Financial Crisis, and investment and exports have rebounded. Product and labor market reforms helped restore competitiveness, reduce unit labor costs, and encourage firm entry. By easing the ability of supply to respond to prices, these reforms have improved the transmission of monetary policy. While monetary policy is set by the ECB, its transmission varies in part with how national governments manage their economies. Long-term Greek borrowing rates narrowed their spread to Germany's, below 1 percent, compared with 6 percent a decade ago. Greece has a come a long way, impressing the whole world with its recovery.</p>
<p><span>Regulation and the Economy's Supply Side</span><br />For all the conversation around Mario Draghi's report,<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;Greece shows that well-targeted deregulatory reforms can help lay the foundation for more sustained and robust economic growth by expanding the productive capacity of the economy, known as the supply side. Such sustainable increases in actual and potential growth have different implications for monetary policy than purely cyclical growth spurts, which boost growth in the near term without raising economic potential. These jolts can create substantial inflation, undermining growth in the medium term by forcing central banks to raise interest rates, and also in the long term by causing a misallocation of resources.</p>
<p>Recent experiences have reinforced the need for central bankers to fully consider the broad range of nonmonetary factors that could affect the appropriate stance of monetary policy. One such factor that is especially important at this juncture is the regulatory burden borne by businesses and individuals, which has begun to recede in the past year.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;I believe that the sweeping deregulation underway in the United States will significantly boost competition, productivity, and potential growth, allowing faster economic growth without putting upward pressure on inflation. This would support continued easing of restrictive monetary policy, but ignoring these effects would result in monetary policy that is needlessly contractionary.</p>
<p>One challenge for central bankers in fully incorporating deregulation into their economic outlooks is that it is difficult to measure in aggregate. Economists are inclined to study things when there are quantitative data to illuminate their work&mdash;a version of the famous "lamppost problem" of only looking where the lamppost shines. This may have contributed to a tendency to give short shrift to regulation in judging the economic outlook. Quantitatively measuring regulations is more difficult than taxes, subsidies, or interest rates. Regulations that businesses face can vary enormously based on the sector, size, and sometimes even the age of a company. Some regulations ban activities altogether. Some regulations impose fixed or variable costs for complying. Some regulations affect consumption decisions and some affect production. Regulations can vary enormously across jurisdictions and sometimes within jurisdictions. Additionally, enforcement determines how binding regulations are in practice, and enforcement can be even harder to measure than the effects of regulations themselves.</p>
<p>These measurement challenges are evident in the abundance of economic studies on specific regulations but the much smaller volume of work that tries to comprehensively measure the aggregate effects of the accumulation of regulations on the macroeconomy.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;From the perspective of an individual firm, it may be easy to adjust behavior in response to one regulation, known as a "margin of adjustment," but compounding regulations can constrain the ability to shift costs by hitting multiple margins of adjustment.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;One pebble doesn't stop a stream, water can flow around it; but enough pebbles will.</p>
<p>A common approach to quantifying the effects of regulations is to count the number of pages of new regulations, though this does not account for varying economic significance across pages. Another approach is to count the number of work hours required to comply, as reported under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA). However, there is wide variation in how different regulatory agencies produce these costs estimates, even sometimes variation within agencies, and more importantly, the counting of work hours related to the PRA does not capture the full opportunity cost of the regulations&mdash;that is, how that lost hour of work could have been used more productively&mdash;or the firms and industries that don't exist because of the regulation.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;If a firm needs to hire a person to comply with some new regulation and can't hire a sales associate who could generate new business or can't engage in a productive activity at all, then the foregone opportunity can be significantly larger than the wage for compliance hours.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a></p>
<p>There has been some progress in measuring regulation through advances in natural language processing and artificial intelligence, and I expect more of this to come. For instance, Patrick McLaughlin's QuantGov project at Stanford University's Hoover Institution uses computational tools to move beyond regulation page counts toward counting restrictions and obligations imposed by the text and quantifying regulations by industry.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a>&nbsp;In other work, Joseph Kalmenovitz uses machine learning methods to count and separate regulations that are relevant for a firm's core businesses from those that are not relevant.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;These measures show a substantial drop in the number of rules in 2025.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a></p>
<p>Among other deregulatory efforts is the current U.S. Administration's "one-in-ten-out policy" revoking 10 old regulations for every new one adopted.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a>&nbsp;Based on the pace of the Administration's deregulatory efforts in the first part of 2025, I estimate that 30 percent of the regulatory restrictions in the Code of Federal Regulations will be eliminated by 2030, though this may prove an underestimate.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a></p>
<p>Regulations can have far larger consequences for the supply side than, for example, taxes, because they can amount to outright prohibitions and thus function as infinite taxes. Quantity controls are usually far more damaging than those that directly affect prices.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a>&nbsp;Consider agglomeration, when a group of firms in the same general industry benefit from proximity, such as R&amp;D labs and production plants, or clients and customers. An auto parts producer benefits from being close to an automaker.</p>
<p>Environmental or other restrictions that restrict co-location can affect the entire economy's supply side by preventing the agglomeration necessary for an industry to be profitable. Take one piece of an industrial ecosystem away because of a regulation and the rest become harder to sustain. Supply chain ecosystems exist&mdash;or don't&mdash;because of regulations determining what activity can take place and where. I think it is hard to argue that, say, the excess burden of going from a 30 percent to a 33 percent marginal tax rate has the same effect as a regulation preventing an entire industry from existing domestically. Regulations, particularly those that affect physical production, can force the economy from high-productivity sectors to low-productivity sectors by encouraging capital-intensive production to move to less regulated places, such as China.</p>
<p>Research on the effects of regulation on the supply side of the economy has developed along two major lines of inquiry. The first studies regulation's effect on total factor productivity (TFP) and growth by making production more expensive.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn14" title="footnote 14"><span>14</span></a><a name="f14"></a>&nbsp;If regulations make, say, electricity or manufactured goods more expensive to produce, they lower TFP.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn15" title="footnote 15"><span>15</span></a><a name="f15"></a>&nbsp;Regulations can also distort investment decisions across sectors or impede innovation, leading to an economy-wide misallocation of resources with commensurate effects on aggregate productivity levels.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn16" title="footnote 16"><span>16</span></a><a name="f16"></a></p>
<p>An alternative way of modeling regulation is via its effects on free entry and markups. Regulatory costs that appear marginal from an industry perspective often originate as fixed costs from a firm perspective. An existing homebuilder building one more house may be marginal, but for a new entrant to build it, they would have to invest in vast compliance infrastructure. In many jurisdictions, they'd have to learn how to measure carbon emissions, decipher labor regulations, pass various inspections at different stages, and pay other fixed costs. The barriers to building a house have become so burdensome that many builders exit entire markets, leaving numerous large metro areas without desperately needed supply. As such, regulations often serve as barriers to entry, with all the attendant consequences: reduced competition, artificially high returns to scale, higher markups, reduced innovation, and reduced productivity growth. Let's call these "markup regulations."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn17" title="footnote 17"><span>17</span></a><a name="f17"></a></p>
<p>There is abundant evidence both within and across countries that increased regulation causes reduced firm entry, decreased competition, and lower investment, all consistent with elevated fixed costs.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn18" title="footnote 18"><span>18</span></a><a name="f18"></a>&nbsp;Decreased firm entry, competition, and innovation lead to a malaise familiar to many: Formerly dynamic industries calcify, flagship businesses choose to move elsewhere or shutter completely, and communities feel cheated out of their way of life.</p>
<p><span>Implications for Monetary Policy</span><br />Now let me discuss the implications of regulation and deregulation for monetary policy. Most theory and research suggest that increasing the regulatory burden reduces productivity and thus puts upward pressure on prices. This is intuitive: Regulations impede production, and deregulation removes those impediments. More production means lower prices, and vice versa. But gauging the magnitudes of these effects is more difficult.</p>
<p>Work by Dustin Chambers, Courtney A. Collins, and Alan Krause found that a 1 percent increase in U.S. federal regulations in a particular industry is associated with a roughly 10 basis point increase in consumer prices in that industry, and that is only in the near term.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn19" title="footnote 19"><span>19</span></a><a name="f19"></a>&nbsp;Longer-term effects and effects from more substantial changes in regulations are, in my view, likely to be substantially larger, since firm entry and the effects of increased competition develop over time. Supply chain ecosystems can take years to rise or fall. I'd also expect cross-industry spillovers to boost aggregate effects above this level. But even these modest within-industry, short-term effects would be substantial in the context of the potential 30 percent decline in the regulatory code that I projected earlier. This implies a cumulative drag of roughly 3 percent on the consumer price level through 2030, a little over half a percent per year.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn20" title="footnote 20"><span>20</span></a><a name="f20"></a></p>
<p>What happens in the short term depends on various factors&mdash;the types of regulations involved, the way these regulations affect firms and households, and the manner of enforcement. On balance, I believe the substantial deregulation that has occurred in 2025 will continue over at least the next three years and be a large positive shock to productivity that will put downward pressure on prices. On net, this supports a more accommodative stance of monetary policy.</p>
<p>As I have argued, I think the primary effects of deregulation are on the supply side of the economy and have the effect of increasing potential output more than they increase actual output. For example, if the number of goods I can produce is effectively limited by regulation, and that cap is removed, this means I can produce more. If demand increases and production is limited by regulation or some other factor, then prices increase. If demand rises and these shackles have been removed, then output grows and pressure on prices is much smaller.</p>
<p>While I think of regulation as primarily a supply-side factor, it can also affect demand. For instance, the news of planned deregulatory action can stimulate investment now for future production, increasing aggregate demand and prices in the short run, before prices adjust to the lower level that would prevail over the longer run. However, I see little reason to expect the short-run effect on demand will exceed potential. In my earlier speech, I assumed that deregulation immediately increases actual output half as much as potential output, and then the two converge over a few years. While some approaches assume TFP shocks increase actual and potential output by the same amount, work by Olivier Coibion, Yuriy Gorodnichenko, and Mauricio Ulate shows that a structural approach to modeling the supply-side results in potential output overshooting actual output in response to a TFP shock.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn21" title="footnote 21"><span>21</span></a><a name="f21"></a></p>
<p>Of course, this matters because the output gap is a primary input into calculating the appropriate setting for monetary policy. If actual output falls below potential output, there is slack in the economy that could be accommodated by looser monetary policy. If deregulation boosts potential output above actual, the correct response is to cut rates. At the same time, by increasing the marginal product of capital, deregulation may raise the so-called neutral rate of interest at which monetary policy is neither accommodative nor restrictive. I addressed this in my first speech as a member of the Federal Reserve Board.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn22" title="footnote 22"><span>22</span></a><a name="f22"></a></p>
<p>Turning to markups, the second channel for the effects of regulation on the supply side, models indicate that if monetary policy ignores the deflationary effects of deregulation, then we risk causing an unnecessary contraction in the economy. That is the implication of an important 2014 paper by Gauti Eggertsson, Andrea Ferrero, and Andrea Raffo, which models deregulation as a reduction in markups&mdash;increased competition&mdash;in a standard New Keynesian model.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20260114a.htm#fn23" title="footnote 23"><span>23</span></a><a name="f23"></a>&nbsp;They find that the appropriate response of monetary policy is to reduce interest rates in response to this type of deregulation shock and offset its consequent deflation. If for some reason monetary policy fails to do so, then deflation and economic contraction needlessly result. This model implies that, if the Federal Reserve fails to reduce policy rates in response to deregulation, there will be adverse consequences. Greece's experience testifies to this. Had the ECB not implemented exceptionally loose monetary policy and effectively accommodated Greece's structural reforms, the outcome could have been quite different.</p>
<p>I believe that central bankers should be paying close attention to the effects of regulation on productivity, output, and prices. In recent quarters, policy has been tighter than it should have been to reflect significant deregulation lifting potential growth and reducing inflation. Going forward, I expect that the ambitious deregulation underway in the United States will boost growth without boosting inflation and be one factor supporting a further easing of monetary policy. In this regard, Greece and the ECB have lit the path. I have raised this point with my Federal Open Market Committee colleagues and expect to continue to do so in our deliberations.</p>

<p><a name="fn1"></a>1. The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee. I am deeply indebted to Casey Mulligan for many conversations about the economics of regulation, but again, the ideas here reflect only my own views.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="fn3"></a>3. In this speech, I am focusing on general economic regulations, not regulations on the banking sector, which are implemented by the Federal Reserve in conjunction with other regulatory agencies. For more on banking regulations, see Stephen I. Miran (2025),&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20251119a.htm">"Regulatory Dominance of the Federal Reserve Balance Sheet,"</a>&nbsp;speech delivered at the Bank Policy Institute and Small Business &amp; Entrepreneurship Council, Washington, November 19.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn4"></a>4. For example, lots of papers show very clear implications for productivity and "dynamism" of regulations that inhibit labor adjustment (see Steven J. Davis and John Haltiwanger (2014), "Labor Market Fluidity and Economic Performance," paper presented at "Re-Evaluating Labor Market Dynamics," a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, held in Jackson Hole, Wyo., August 22; and David H. Autor, William R. Kerr, and Adriana D. Kugler (2007), "Does Employment Protection Reduce Productivity? Evidence from US States,"&nbsp;<em>The Economic Journal</em>, vol. 117 (June), pp. F189&ndash;217). For a theory approach, Hopenhayn and Rogerson (1993) is a classic&mdash;a tax on firing is a tax on hiring (see Hugo Hopenhayn and Richard Rogerson (1993), "Job Turnover and Policy Evaluation: A General Equilibrium Analysis,"&nbsp;<em>Journal of Political Economy</em>, vol. 101 (5). For land use regulation literature, see Leonardo D'Amico, Edward L. Glaeser, Joseph Gyourko, William R. Kerr, and Giacomo A.M. Ponzetto (2024),&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w33188">"Why Has Construction Productivity Stagnated? The Role of Land-Use Regulation,"</a>&nbsp;NBER Working Paper Series 33188 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, November).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn5"></a>5. For example, a regulation that raises input costs might incent a firm to cut costs by reducing headcount, but the firm may find that response problematic as well because of other regulations.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn6"></a>6. For instance, the Small Business Administration and General Services Administration measure PRA paperwork burdens in dollars, whereas other agencies like FinCEN and parts of the Department of Agriculture measure these burdens in hours. Variation within agencies is usually across units, like the Food and Drug Administration relative to the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services within the Department of Health and Human Services.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn7"></a>7. Standard economics would suggest that, if the compliance associate is seen as a fixed cost but a new salesperson is seen as a variable cost, the optimality condition would ignore the fixed cost and have the firm hire the sales associate anyway. This is well and good for large firms that generate abundant cashflow or have easy access to liquidity, but many smaller firms face more binding cashflow and liquidity constraints and will be unable to hire that salesperson. Moreover, even for large firms, the compliance associate may be a variable cost for expanding an existing line of business, or he or she may be a fixed cost that impedes the firm's expansion into a new line of business or market. See the discussion that follows of "markup regulations" and competition.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="fn12"></a>12. McLaughlin (2025) estimates 2,404 deregulatory actions from the Spring 2025 Unified Agenda of Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions. If the average deregulatory action removes 25.6 restrictions from the CFR, which was the average through July 1 of this year, then 61,542 restrictions will be removed per year. Five years at this rate will remove 28 percent of a total of 1.1 million restrictions. I rounded up to 30 percent because I expect the pace of deregulation to accelerate with the accelerated pace of Senate confirmations due to the Senate's recent adoption of&nbsp;<em>en bloc</em>&nbsp;confirmation; with more personnel, deregulation will be much quicker than it was in the first few months of a fresh administration. Indeed, I think 30 percent will ultimately prove to be an underestimate. As McLaughlin notes, we will soon get the Fall 2025 Unified Agenda, which will allow me to update this calculation. I used McLaughlin's analysis rather than Kalmenovitz's for this exercise because, as of January 5, Kalmenovitz's measure showed a nearly 25 percent reduction in overall federal regulatory burden over the course of 2025, and as optimistic as I am regarding the coming deregulatory trend, that magnitude seems aggressive to me at present. Moreover, Kalmenovitz's measure is prone to revision. See Patrick McLaughlin (2025), "Early Data on Deregulatory Push in Washington," Third Order, October 28, https://thirdorder.substack.com/p/early-data-on-the-deregulatory-push.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="fn14"></a>14. The effects of regulation on TFP were one point I made in my first speech as a Federal Reserve Board member; see Stephen I. Miran (2025)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/miran20250922a.htm">"Nonmonetary Forces and Appropriate Monetary Policy,"</a>&nbsp;speech delivered at the Economic Club of New York, New York, September 22.&nbsp;</p>

Seater (2013), "Federal Regulation and Aggregate Economic Growth,"&nbsp;<em>Journal of Economic Growth</em>, vol. 18 (June), pp. 137&ndash;77.

<p><a name="fn17"></a>17. Of course, antitrust regulations are designed to increase and not decrease competition; but these are a small portion of the overall regulatory code, and I am focused here on regulations outside of antitrust.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="fn20"></a>20. Of course, this predicted decline is relative to what consumer prices would have done in the absence of the deregulatory actions and not a prediction about an absolute change.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn21"></a>21. See Olivier Coibion, Yuriy Gorodnichenko, and Mauricio Ulate (2018),&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Coibion-et-al_final-draft.pdf">"The Cyclical Sensitivity in Estimates of Potential Output," (PDF)</a>&nbsp;Brookings Paper on Econonomic Activity, Fall, pp. 343&ndash;441. Coibion et al. show that in a Blanchard-Quah (BQ) approach to estimating potential output, TFP shocks increase potential output much more rapidly than actual output (figure 12). The BQ approach relies on the uncontroversial theoretical assumption that supply-side shocks affecting potential output are those which have permanent effects on the level of output while demand shocks are restricted to having no permanent effects. It provides a more structural economic grounding for estimating potential output than various filter-based approaches.</p>
<p>The case for actual and potential output moving up the same amount in response to a TFP shock seems more plausible if the TFP shock is driven by a new technology, which requires investment to implement. But not all TFP shocks are the same, and regulations are quite different. If today a regulation limits the amount of carbon a factory can emit, but tomorrow the factory can emit more carbon, it does not require the same amount of new investment as would be required to, say, implement new computer technologies. Letting an existing smokestack run for 24 instead of 8 hours is quite different from having to buy graphical processing units to develop a large language model. In other words, it may be appropriate to consider regulatory TFP shocks as having different consequences for output gaps than technological TFP shocks have. See also Boivin, Kiley, and Mishkin (2011), who observe that the response of actual output to a TFP shock depends crucially on the monetary response, underlining that it is crucial for the Fed to stay abreast of TFP shocks in formulating the appropriate stance of policy (Jean Boivin, Michael Kiley, and Frederic Mishkin (2011), "How Has the Monetary Transmission Mechanism Evolved Over Time?" in Benjmain M. Friedman and Michael Woodford, eds.,&nbsp;<em>Handbook of Monetary Economics, Vol. 3</em>. (Amsterdam: Elsevier), pp. 369&ndash;422).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn22"></a>22. In that speech, I included a boost to neutral rates from deregulation (which was offset by reductions in neutral rates from other sources like reduced population growth and smaller fiscal deficits). I also included a wider output gap because of potential growth increasing faster than actual growth as a result of deregulation. In that speech, I did&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;model an explicit deregulation-driven reduction in prices, either from a TFP boost or a reduction in markups, an oversight partially addressed here.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="text-align-justify"><span>The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor, published today a&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2026-01/ESMA36-429234738_-165_Thematic_notes_on_sustainability-related_claims-_ESG_strategies.pdf">second thematic note</a><span>&nbsp;on sustainability-related claims, focusing on ESG strategies.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>The note concentrates on ESG integration and ESG exclusions, as references to these strategies are often made by market participants and widely referenced in marketing communications directed to retail investors.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>ESG integration and ESG exclusions can mean different things to different market participants. Lack of transparency when using these terms poses a notable greenwashing risk to investors. The aim of the note is not to define these strategies, but to call on market participants to be clear about what they mean when referencing them.</span></p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>Similarly to the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-promotes-clarity-sustainability-related-communications">first thematic note on ESG credentials</a><span>, this publication offers practical do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;ts for making sustainability claims. These are illustrated through concrete examples of good and poor practices that are based on observed market practices.</span></p>

<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>The European Supervisory Authorities (EBA, EIOPA and ESMA &ndash; the ESAs) have today signed a&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2026-01/MoU_DORA_oversight_ICT_CTPPs__EU-UK.pdf">Memorandum of Understanding</a><span>&nbsp;(MoU) with the Bank of England (BoE), the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). This agreement enhances the cooperation between the authorities to oversee critical ICT third-party service providers (CTPPs) as required by the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA).</span></p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>The MoU establishes clear principles and procedures for cooperation, information sharing and coordination of oversight activities between the relevant authorities responsible for EU CTPPs/UK CTPs oversight. The&nbsp;MoU aims at enhancing third-party risk management and contributing to the overall operational resilience of the financial sector in the EU and UK through strong cross-border cooperation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span><span>​​Legal basis and background</span></span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>The MoU has been prepared in accordance with DORA Articles 36, 44, and 49, which cover the ESAs&rsquo; oversight powers, international cooperation, and financial cross-sector exercises, communication and cooperation.</span></p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>​To exchange information with a third-country authority, the ESAs must ensure that the confidentiality and professional secrecy regime in the third country is equivalent to that in the EU. Therefore, before signing this MoU, the ESAs conducted an assessment that confirmed the UK confidentiality and professional secrecy regime&rsquo;s equivalence with that in DORA.</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p dir="LTR">TASE publishes today the list of companies that entered the &ldquo;TASE 100 Club&rdquo;, which includes companies with a market cap exceeding NIS 200 million, that have achieved a share yield of at least 100% in 2025. For the third consecutive year, TASE publishes the &ldquo;TASE 100 Club&rdquo; constituents, this as part of its efforts to improve the public&rsquo;s acquaintance with the TASE-listed companies.</p>
<p dir="LTR">According to TASE&rsquo;s Research Unit, 45 companies achieved a yield of more than 100% in 2025, as compared to only 35 companies in 2024. The highest share yield in 2025 was achieved by Aryt Industries, operating in the defense-military sector, with a price gain of more than 400%. Investment houses, More and Meitav, achieved a yield of 300%, and an additional eight companies achieved a yield in excess of 200%.</p>
<p dir="LTR">Out of the 45 companies included in the &ldquo;TASE 100 Club&rdquo;, 20 companies were awarded 5 stars, having achieved a positive yield in each of the past three years, as compared to only five companies awarded the 5-star top rating in 2024.</p>
<p dir="LTR">25 companies were awarded four starts, having achieved a cumulative positive yield over the past 3 years, as compared to 23 companies in 2024.</p>
<p dir="LTR">The 2025 list includes many major companies, including 29 companies with a market cap in excess of NIS 2 billion. The list comprises 24 companies included in the TA-125 index, as compared to 10 companies in 2024.</p>
<p dir="LTR">The list contains companies from a wide range of sectors, the most prominent</p>
<ul>
<li><span>14 technology sector companies, including 6 defense companies.</span></li>
<li>8 insurance companies.</li>
<li>6 financial services companies.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="LTR">Despite multiple challenges over the past year, the companies exhibited business resilience that was also reflected in the capital market. TASE's leading indices recorded outstanding yields compared to leading global indices: the TA-35 index increased by 51.6% and the TA-90 index increased by 46.6%.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Rating System of the &ldquo;TASE 100 Club&rdquo;</h4>
<p dir="LTR">The TASE staff applies a star system (3-5 stars) to rate the companies that achieved a yield exceeding 100% in 2025, which awards 5 stars to companies that achieved a positive yield in each of the past 3 years, 4 stars to companies that achieved a cumulative positive yield over the past 3 years, and 3 stars to other club members with a yield of more than 100% in the past year.</p>
<p dir="LTR">During the month of January, TASE will host the management of the &ldquo;TASE 100 Club&rdquo; constituents in a special Opening Bell Ceremony.&nbsp;</p>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/clearbid-global-markets-selects-archax-as-partner-for-uk-and-eu-expansion-exte-2026114/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ClearBid Global Markets (CBGM) today announced it has selected Archax as its regulated digital asset partner to expand the reach of its cross-border digital bond trading and data platform into the UK and EU regions.</p>
<p>CBGM is a full-service electronic trading platform and complete securities and data source, that effectively connects global bond markets utilising a digital Dutch Auction. This results in real-time, transparent and market-driven price discovery. It is an innovative substitute for traditional &lsquo;over the counter&rsquo; (OTC) methods, with a direct focus on capital markets-based financing for infrastructure, corporate and asset-backed borrowers.</p>
<p>Archax is a regulated digital asset exchange, broker and custodian, based in the UK, EU, US and UAE. Targeted at professionals and institutions, Archax supports all types of digital assets &ndash; from unregulated cryptocurrencies through to regulated tokenised real-world assets (RWAs).</p>
<p>By selecting Archax as a strategic partner for cross-border expansion, CBGM will initially leverage Archax&rsquo;s FCA regulations in the UK to offer its digital bond pre-issuance, trading and data platform to investors based there. Moving forwards, CBGM then plans to do the same in the EU region by leveraging Archax&rsquo;s permissions there too.</p>
<p><span>Robert Novembre, Founder and CEO of ClearBid Global Markets, comments:&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Our partnership with Archax marks a significant milestone for CBGM as we expand into the UK and advance our global mission to redefine capital markets. By combining our vision for transparent, data‑driven markets with Archax&rsquo;s fully regulated digital infrastructure, we are delivering institutional clients unprecedented visibility and liquidity across global bond markets. This collaboration empowers market participants to navigate complex environments through a single, seamless digital gateway&rdquo;.<span>&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p><span>Nick Donovan, Chief Revenue Officer of Archax, adds:</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Archax is all about being the most credible, institutional and regulated, digital asset solution in the marketplace. We are always on the look-out for potential partners who can leverage our regulatory stack and together expand our digital offerings in the space. As such, we are excited to be working with ClearBid Global Markets with their innovative digital approach for providing access to bonds for capital markets participants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>CBGM&rsquo;s digital bond marketplace is designed to revolutionise how capital is raised and invested by addressing the current market&rsquo;s lack of transparency due to manual, antiquated pricing processes, as well as the lack of efficient accessibility and connectivity between markets, which limits global capital flows and growth for emerging markets.</p>

<title>UK And EU Regulators Sign Memorandum Of Understanding To Strengthen Oversight Of Critical Third Parties</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The FCA, Bank of England and Prudential Regulation Authority have together signed a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/mou/mou-fca-boe-pra-esa-critical-third-parties.pdf" title="mou-fca-boe-pra-esa-critical-third-parties.pdf">Memorandum of Understanding</a>&nbsp;(MoU) with the European Supervisory Authorities to enhance cooperation and oversight of critical third parties (CTPs) that fall under the UK&rsquo;s CTP regime.</p>
<p>The MoU establishes a framework for coordinating and sharing information on the oversight of CTPs under the UK regime and critical third party providers (CTPPs) under the EU&rsquo;s Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), including during incidents such as power outages or cyber-attacks.</p>
<p>The MoU aims to manage potential risks to financial stability and market confidence, as well as strengthen international cooperation. It will also help reduce duplication and regulatory burden on CTPs and CTPPs.</p>
<p>The UK&rsquo;s CTP regime complements similar international standards and is designed to be compatible with DORA. The agreement demonstrates UK regulators&rsquo; commitment to cross-border cooperation and strengthening operational resilience to support growth and promote market stability.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ul>
<li>In 2024, UK regulators introduced&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/policy-statements/ps24-16-operational-resilience-critical-third-parties-uk-financial-sector" title="PS24/16: Operational resilience: Critical third parties to the UK financial sector">new rules</a>&nbsp;to bolster the resilience of critical third parties providing key services to the financial sector.</li>
<li>These rules came into effect on 1 January 2025 and apply once a CTP is designated by the Treasury.</li>
<li>The Treasury is responsible for deciding which third party service providers should fall under the new CTP regime. The rules will require designated CTPs to provide regular assurance, undertake resilience testing and report major incidents.</li>
<li>The designation process has begun and the regulators will continue to work with the Treasury throughout the designation process.</li>
<li>The regime does not reduce the responsibility of financial firms and Financial Market Infrastructures (FMIs) to manage their own operational resilience and third-party risks in line with existing outsourcing rules.</li>
</ul>

<title>The WFE Calls On Regulators To Balance Quantum Computing Risks Against More Immediate Operational Challenges</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The World Federation of Exchanges (&ldquo;WFE&rdquo;), the global industry association for exchange groups and CCPs, has warned of a substantial gap between regulatory expectations and industry expectations around quantum computing risk preparedness.</span><br /><br /><span>Major public authorities, standards bodies, and cross-border policy groups have begun issuing guidance, calling for early preparation and coordinated migration to post-quantum cryptography (PQC). This is driven by two core concerns:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Long lead times required to upgrade cryptographic systems; and&nbsp;</li>
<li>The &ldquo;harvest now, decrypt later&rdquo; threat where attackers steal encrypted data today to unlock it in future once more powerful technologies become available to break the encryption.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /><span>The WFE Global Cybersecurity Working Group recently conducted a preliminary survey on the Quantum Computing Preparedness, the results of which highlight the importance of other competing priorities. In particular, Generative AI risks are viewed as far more urgent and immediate, consuming most organisational attention and investment. Quantum Computing is seen as a longer-term threat, with many firms hesitant to commit too many resources until clearer timelines or stable standards emerge.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>Most WFE members estimate a 5&ndash;10+ year window before cryptographically relevant quantum computers (CRQCs) emerge, in line with NIST FAQs. Consequently, resourcing remains proportionate to a long-term risk, not an imminent one, and shouldn&rsquo;t be prioritised at the expense of more immediate operational concerns such as AI-driven threats and Cyber Resiliency. This is consistent with the WFE&rsquo;s&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://world-exchanges.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=48ddcbc11eb58f141a51219ea&amp;id=a28a86432b&amp;e=979576350c" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">2025 Annual Survey of Risks</a><span>&nbsp;where AI and Cyber Resilience risks continued to be ranked highest by members, as they have consistently for two years. &nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>Although members do not consider Quantum Computing risk to be imminent, they have already begun laying the necessary groundwork for future preparedness, including:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Actively monitoring regulatory guidance, vendor progress, and developments in NIST standardisation. Several are incorporating Quantum Computing discussions into risk committees and cyber governance forums.</li>
<li>Preliminary quantum risk assessments.</li>
<li>Including quantum-safe encryption criteria in procurement and vendor evaluation cycles.</li>
<li>Considering projects to map existing cryptographic assets, as the first step in any migration roadmap.</li>
<li>Working with the WFE to develop a best-practice guide on quantum transition, and a structured roadmap for market infrastructures.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /><strong>Nandini Sukumar, CEO of the World Federation of Exchanges</strong><span>, said, &ldquo;While Quantum Computing readiness is undoubtedly important, the migration to post-quantum cryptography remains a long-term undertaking, and the practical groundwork - planning, asset mapping, and vendor coordination - should be paced appropriately. Whilst exchanges recognise that Quantum Computing is a meaningful risk, regulators must understand that preparation should not deflect from more imminent risks related to AI and Cyber Resilience.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span>Read the full paper&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://world-exchanges.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=48ddcbc11eb58f141a51219ea&amp;id=81015be5c0&amp;e=979576350c" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a><span>.</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The inaugural edition of Dubai&nbsp;Future Finance Week (DFFW) will take place from 11 to 15 May 2026, convening&nbsp;international leaders from the finance, policy, technology and investment sectors through a&nbsp;coordinated programme of high-level forums held across the emirate. As global financial&nbsp;markets undergo accelerated structural change, the Week will provide a strategic platform&nbsp;for dialogue, collaboration and the exchange of insights on the future of the global financial&nbsp;ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organised under the directives and patronage of&nbsp;<span>His Highness Sheikh Maktoum bin&nbsp;Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, First Deputy Ruler of Dubai, Deputy Prime Minister&nbsp;and Minister of Finance of the UAE, and President of the Dubai International Financial&nbsp;Centre (DIFC)</span>, the Week underscores Dubai&rsquo;s role in advancing dialogue on the evolving&nbsp;dynamics of capital markets, innovation, sustainability and governance.</p>
<p>His Highness Sheikh Maktoum bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum said the event reflects&nbsp;Dubai&rsquo;s commitment to playing a key role in shaping a smart and sustainable global economy.&nbsp;The participation of leading decision-makers, thinkers and innovators from the financial&nbsp;services sector in the event provides an important opportunity to bring perspectives closer together, align efforts to address shared global challenges, and support dialogue on the future&nbsp;of the global financial sector, His Highness said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>HH Sheikh Maktoum added that the event also opens new avenues for cooperation and&nbsp;supports innovation. He noted that the gathering encourages effective participation that&nbsp;enables markets to achieve greater growth and prosperity, while supporting the objectives of&nbsp;the Dubai Economic Agenda D33, particularly positioning Dubai among the world&rsquo;s top four&nbsp;global financial centres and building a smart, diversified economy that keeps pace with future&nbsp;requirements.</p>
<p>Designed as an integrated, citywide platform and led by DIFC, Dubai Future Finance Week&nbsp;brings together several major industry forums under a single, cohesive agenda, themed&nbsp;&lsquo;Finance Reimagined: Where innovation meets policy and purpose&rsquo;. At its core is the Dubai&nbsp;FinTech Summit (DFS) with the theme of Connecting Markets &ndash; Transforming Economies,&nbsp;held under the patronage of His Highness Sheikh Maktoum bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al&nbsp;Maktoum, which serves as the Week&rsquo;s main event, shaping its momentum and convening&nbsp;global leaders to advance dialogue on the future of finance.</p>
<p>Over five days, venues across Dubai will host discussions spanning the full spectrum of&nbsp;modern finance, from capital markets, private wealth and institutional investment to digital&nbsp;assets and sustainability-led finance. Each event within the programme explores a distinct&nbsp;area of financial transformation, enabling participants to engage directly with global&nbsp;institutions, industry leaders and policymakers through a set of complementary forums.&nbsp;Together, they provide a structured environment for cross-sector insight and practical&nbsp;engagement on emerging areas of opportunity.<br /><br />By situating these discussions within a single, coordinated week, Dubai Future Financial Week&nbsp;will enable participants to connect themes that are often addressed in isolation. This&nbsp;integrated approach will allow attendees to examine how developments in one area influence&nbsp;progress in another and engage on priorities that cut across traditional boundaries.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>His Excellency Essa Kazim, Governor of DIFC</span>, said: &ldquo;Dubai&rsquo;s vision is to shape the global economy, and Dubai Future Finance Week is a natural extension of that ambition. It highlights the emirate&rsquo;s role as a catalyst for ideas, collaboration and forward-looking growth across international markets, and it underscores our determination here at DIFC to help set the pace for global financial and economic progress. The Week will strengthen this position by enabling engagement across finance, technology, regulation and investment, in support of the ambitions set out under the Dubai Economic Agenda D33.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>His Excellency Arif Amiri, Chief Executive Officer of DIFC Authority,</span>&nbsp;said: &ldquo;Dubai Future&nbsp;Finance Week reflects our commitment to providing platforms that bring the global financial&nbsp;community together to navigate change and identify new opportunities. As the region&rsquo;s&nbsp;leading global financial centre, DIFC is well positioned to offer a unified and focused&nbsp;environment for senior decision-makers to engage on priority issues. As global markets&nbsp;continue to evolve, Dubai plays a key role in shaping the future of finance through the depth&nbsp;of its ecosystem and its international connectivity.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Programme highlights</span><br />A central pillar of the programme, the Dubai FinTech Summit will return to Madinat Jumeirah&nbsp;with an expanded format designed to accelerate global collaboration and growth&nbsp;opportunities for FinTechs, scale-ups and investors. The summit will convene more than&nbsp;10,000 delegates from over 150 countries, alongside more than 1,000 investors, and over 300&nbsp;regional and international speakers, and over 250 sponsors, spanning over more than 25&nbsp;industry verticals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 2026 edition will feature a dedicated Investors&rsquo; Lounge and Deal Hub, new country&nbsp;pavilions to enhance cross-border partnerships, and curated content streams examining&nbsp;emerging trends in digital finance, AI-driven technologies and regulatory innovation. These&nbsp;developments build on the Summit&rsquo;s continued momentum and its contribution to the region&rsquo;s&nbsp;financial innovation landscape, supported by DIFC&rsquo;s ongoing growth as a global hub for&nbsp;financial innovation.</p>
<p>The Week will feature platforms that examine the systems and standards underpinning the&nbsp;future of financial services. Seamless FinTech Middle East will feature discussions on digital&nbsp;commerce, payments and financial infrastructure, while the Reg3 Forum will bring together&nbsp;regulators, policymakers and market participants to explore supervisory innovation and the&nbsp;evolution of cross-border regulatory frameworks. Together, these forums provide a&nbsp;foundation for addressing how global financial systems can remain connected, efficient and&nbsp;forward-looking.</p>
<p>There will also be leading gatherings focused on long-term capital allocation and sustainable&nbsp;economic growth. The DIFC Family Wealth Centre Summit will examine the priorities of family&nbsp;enterprises and the expanding role of private markets, while the Future Sustainability Forum&nbsp;will explore the growing importance of sustainability-led finance and climate-aligned&nbsp;investment. In parallel, the Islamic Finance Forum will highlight developments across Sharia-aligned markets, reflecting Dubai&rsquo;s established role as a global centre for Islamic finance.<br /><br />Additional platforms within the programme will provide perspective on wider sector&nbsp;performance, emerging economic models and venture activity across the region. Highlights&nbsp;include the MENA Banking Excellence Awards, which recognise transformation within the&nbsp;banking sector; the Solana Economic Zone, offering insights into decentralised technologies&nbsp;and digital economic models; IPEM Future Dubai, convening private-market leaders to assess&nbsp;capital flows and investment trends; and the Dubai Future District Fund annual meeting,&nbsp;showcasing developments from the emirate&rsquo;s venture and innovation ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Collectively, the programme represents the broadest and most comprehensive gathering of&nbsp;finance and future-focused events in the region, offering institutions, innovators and&nbsp;policymakers a single platform through which to engage on shared priorities, explore new&nbsp;areas of opportunity and contribute to the sector&rsquo;s long-term development.<br /><br />Organisations and partners wishing to participate in the Week or contribute to its wider&nbsp;programme can register at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.difc.com/whats-on/news/www.dubaifuturefinanceweek.com">www.dubaifuturefinanceweek.com</a>.</p>
