<p><a href="https://www.fiserv.com/" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Fiserv, Inc.</a>&nbsp;(NYSE: FI), a leading global provider of payments and financial services technology, has published the Fiserv Small Business Index&trade; for February 2024. The Fiserv Small Business Index is an indicator of the performance of small businesses in the United States at national, state, and industry levels.</p>
<p>Nationally, the seasonally adjusted&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fiserv.com/en/fiserv-small-business-index.html" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Fiserv Small Business Index</a>&nbsp;increased 3 points to 142. Small business sales grew +2.6% month-over-month and +6.6% year-over-year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Consumer spending accelerated through February, delivering a significant boost to small business sales,&rdquo; said Prasanna Dhore, Chief Data Officer at Fiserv. &ldquo;Small businesses in the Retail sector had a particularly strong month, with a high volume of foot traffic helping drive 3.7% month-over-month and 7.2% year-over-year sales growth. We also saw spending at Food Services and Drinking Places rebound after a lackluster January,<span>&nbsp;</span>with sales up 4.1% month-over-month.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Retail Spotlight</span></p>
<p>Retail small businesses delivered strong results in February, with an index of 149, reflecting a +6 point gain over January. Sales activity grew a seasonally adjusted +3.7% over January and +7.2% year-over-year. Sales growth was boosted by gains in foot traffic, with retail small business transaction numbers at a five year high.</p>
<p><span>Additional Small Business Insights</span></p>
<p>Food Services and Drinking Places had an impressive rebound in February, jumping +5 points over the previous month to an index of 127. The gains follow a lackluster January, which was impacted by harsh weather in addition to the natural downshift from the holiday season. In February, small business customers devoted the biggest share of their wallets and their incremental spend to this subsector. Spending was up +4.1% over January and +6.3% compared to last year.</p>
<p>Specialty Trade Contractors<span>&nbsp;</span>had a February index of 149, a +3 point increase over January. Month-over-month sales expanded by +2.3%. Growth compared to February 2023 was even more substantial, up +4.7%. The Specialty Trade Contractors subsector includes service providers, such as carpentry and masonry, roofing, electrical, and heating and plumbing specialists.</p>
<p><span>About the Fiserv Small Business Index&trade;</span></p>
<p>The Fiserv Small Business Index is published during the first week of every month and differentiated by its direct aggregation of consumer spending activity within the U.S. small business ecosystem. Rather than relying on survey or sentiment data, the Fiserv Small Business Index is derived from point-of-sale transaction data, including card, cash, and check transactions in-store and online, across approximately 2 million U.S. small businesses.</p>
<p>Benchmarked to 2019, the Fiserv Small Business Index provides a numeric value measuring consumer spending, with an accompanying transaction index measuring customer traffic. Through a simple interface, users can access data by region, state, and/or across business types categorized by the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). Computing a monthly index for 16 sectors and 34 sub-sectors, the Fiserv Small Business Index provides a timely, reliable and consistent measure of small business performance even in industries where large businesses dominate.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>Nigerian Exchange Group Plc (NGX Group or the Company) is pleased to announce its full-year Audited Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2023, with a profit after tax of N5.2 billion and a declaration of a final dividend of N1.5 billion.</p>
<p>The Group experienced a surge in gross earnings, rising by 57.4% to N11.8 billion in FY 2023 from N7.5 billion in FY 2022. This growth was attributed to performances in core revenue and other income segments. Notably, transaction fees rose by 52.6%, driven by increased trading activities, while listing fees and rental income increased by 42.2% and 41.8%, respectively. Strategic investments also contributed to a 5.4% boost in treasury investment income.</p>
<p>Other income, representing 29.7% of gross earnings, witnessed an unprecedented rise of 163.6%, reaching N3.504 billion. Key contributors to this surge were market data income, which increased by 44.1%, and an exceptional 304.8% rise in other operating income.</p>
<p>In light of the robust operational performance, the Board approved a final dividend of N1.5 billion at 75 Kobo per share for the year ended 31st December 2023. This is in addition to an interim dividend of N495.53 million at 25 Kobo per share paid in August 2023, bringing the total dividend for FY 2023 to N1 per share.</p>
<p>Commenting on the dividend, the Group Chairman, NGX Group, Alhaji (Dr) Umaru Kwairanga, expressed profound satisfaction and optimism, stating, &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s announcement of both the financial results and dividend pay-out is a testament to NGX Group's unwavering commitment to maximising shareholder value and the resilience of our financial position. We are elated to reward our shareholders, and this underscores our confidence in the sustainable growth of the Company. I would like to reassure all stakeholders that the Board and Management are focused on positioning NGX Group as the premier financial market infrastructure in Africa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Group Chief Executive Officer, NGX Group, Mr. Temi Popoola, echoed this sentiment, expressing satisfaction with the Company&rsquo;s operational performance. &ldquo;I am pleased with the significant improvement in NGX Group&rsquo;s operational performance. We have witnessed notable increases in transaction and listing fees, as well as in rental and treasury investment income. Our strategic focus on technology income and other streams, along with strong capital allocation, has led to a notable increase in return on equity to 13.8%. NGX Group is poised to continue its trajectory of growth, innovation, and value creation for its stakeholders in the upcoming fiscal year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>NGX Group&rsquo;s financial metrics highlight a substantial turnaround and operational success. Operating profit reversed from a loss to a gain of N433 million, a 130.2% improvement, reflecting operational efficiency and profitability transformation. Profit before income tax skyrocketed by 639%, reaching N5.27 billion, driven by strong revenue performance and optimised cost management. This was capped by a 788% surge in after-tax profit to N5.25 billion, with an improved profit after tax margin of 44.49%, showcasing the Group&rsquo;s financial health and earnings quality.</p>

<div> licensed virtual asset trading platforms, suspicious websites, online investment scams, SFC, Hong Kong Police Force
Summary:<br /> SFC warns against impersonation of licensed virtual asset trading platforms, reports fund withdrawal difficulties, urges public to verify legitimacy. <br /> <div>
<p>The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) today warned the public against suspicious websites impersonating two licensed virtual asset trading platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li>HSKEX, which impersonates Hash Blockchain Limited, operates at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hskexpro.com/" target="_blank">https://www.hskexpro.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://hskex.com/" target="_blank">https://hskex.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hskexs.com/" target="_blank">https://www.hskexs.com</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://hskexit.com/" target="_blank">https://hskexit.com/</a>; and</li>
<li><a href="https://www.oslexu.com/" target="_blank">www.oslexu.com</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://oslint.com/" target="_blank">www.oslint.com</a>&nbsp;impersonate OSL Digital Securities Limited.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The above-mentioned websites were posted on the SFC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sfc.hk/en/alert-list/suspicious-virtual-asset-trading-platforms" target="_blank">Suspicious Virtual Asset Trading Platforms Alert List</a>&nbsp;on 4 March 2024 following reports on fund withdrawal difficulties.&nbsp; Victims also said they were asked to pay exorbitant &ldquo;fees and taxes&rdquo; to withdraw their funds from the websites.&nbsp; At the SFC&rsquo;s request, the Hong Kong Police Force has taken steps to block access to relevant websites (Note 1).</p>
<p>The SFC once again reminds the public that online investment scams may involve any type of assets and are perpetrated through multiple channels, including social media and instant messaging apps.&nbsp; Investors should stay vigilant and verify the legitimacy of a virtual asset trading platform before making any transactions.</p>
<p>The SFC urges the public to make use of the SFC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://apps.sfc.hk/publicregWeb/searchByName?locale=en" target="_blank">Public Register of Licensed Persons and Registered Institutions</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sfc.hk/en/Welcome-to-the-Fintech-Contact-Point/Virtual-assets/Virtual-asset-trading-platforms-operators/Lists-of-virtual-asset-trading-platforms" target="_blank">List of licensed virtual asset trading platforms</a>&nbsp;for up-to-date information on licensed entities, including their official websites. &nbsp;Investors should also refrain from sending money or making any transactions before verifying the counterparty&rsquo;s identity.</p>
<p>Note:</p>
<ol>
<li>At the time the SFC requested the Hong Kong Police Force to block access to the relevant websites, the websites impersonating OSL Digital Securities Limited were already inaccessible.&nbsp; Hence, the SFC only requested the Hong Kong Police Force to block access to the websites impersonating Hash Blockchain Limited.</li>

Fee and commission income from the Equities Market was up 113.2%, while trading volumes grew by 30.9%. The discrepancy between fee income and trading volumes dynamics is largely explained by the introduction of a new asymmetric tariff structure that came into effect in November 2022.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Fee income from the Bond Market increased by 67.6% while trading volumes (excluding placements of overnight bonds) improved by 60.1%. Primary market volumes (excluding placements of overnight bonds) were up 45.2%, mostly driven by elevated corporate borrowing activity. Secondary market trading volumes grew by 74.6%. Effective fee dynamics were supported by the tariff optimization that came into effect at the beginning of 2023 as well as the migration of volumes to value-added CCP-based trading modes.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Fee income from the FX Market increased by 30.4%. Trading volumes were up 22.5%. Spot volumes added 7.5%, while swap volumes grew by 31.4%. The effective fee dynamics is explained by two opposing&nbsp;factors: [1] the asymmetric tariff structure favoring liquidity makers on the spot market that came into effect on August&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2022, [2] a shift in the volumes&rsquo; mix towards the less profitable swap segment.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Money Market fee income was up 26.0%. Trading volumes grew by 24.5%. GCC-repo volumes surged by 68.1% to reach nearly RUB 224 trln. CCP repo trading volumes added 35.1%.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Derivatives Market fee income increased by 79.2%. The trading volume stood virtually flat, adding just 3.7%. The discrepancy between fee income and volume dynamics was the result of a shift in volumes&rsquo; mix towards value-added commodity derivatives and the new asymmetric tariff structure implemented in June 2022.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Fee income from the Depository and Settlement Services grew by 24.5%. The growth was primarily explained by a 19.9% increase in the average value of assets under custody. The discrepancy between the growth rates of F&amp;C income and assets on deposit is the result of business lines beyond safekeeping, primarily clearing and collateral management services, which are the reflection of repo operations at the NSD.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>IT Services, Listing and other fee income line was largely driven by Finuslugi revenues. Sale of software and tech. services improved by 34.0% driven by tariffs revision and the introduction of low-latency protocols for market data distribution &ndash; SIMBA ASTS and FIFO TWIME ASTS &ndash; to Equities and FX Markets. Listing and other services grew by 26.6% as primary market activity in equities and bonds recovered. Sales of information services rose by 20.7%, primarily on the back of RUB depreciation during the year. Finuslugi revenues surged by 141.7% as the business unit develops new features and keeps onboarding new clients. Other fee income shrank by 66.1% as base period revenues included additional fees on EUR balances of 0.2 p.p. above the non-positive ECB rate.</li>

<title>Disinflation Without A Rise In Unemployment? What Is Different This Time Around, Federal Reserve Governor Adriana D. Kugler, At The 2024 Stanford Institute For Economic Policy Research Economic Summit, Stanford University, Stanford, California</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> supply and demand, inflation, pandemic, employment, Federal Reserve<br />
Summary:<br />Supply and demand imbalances, inflation, and employment illustrate the complex relationship and tradeoffs in pursuing the Federal Reserve's dual mandate. <div>
<p>Thank you, Mark, and thank you for the opportunity to be part of the discussions today.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;For more than 40 years, the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research has assisted economic policymakers by producing sharp analysis and fostering the kind of constructive dialogue reflected in today's agenda.</p>
<p>My topic today is the Federal Reserve's dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices&mdash;and, specifically, the tradeoffs that sometimes arise when pursuing these two objectives. I say "sometimes" because there have been times and certain economic conditions in which such tradeoffs did not arise&mdash;or at least were not apparent. This distinction is an important one, especially when considering the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)'s recent progress in reducing high inflation while the labor market has remained strong. Better understanding the tradeoffs, or lack thereof, in pursuing the dual mandate will help researchers and policymakers draw lessons from these welcome recent developments.</p>
<p><strong>History of the Inflation&ndash;Unemployment Tradeoff</strong><br />In 1977, Congress legislated the Federal Reserve's "dual mandate," under which the FOMC is required to pursue both maximum employment and stable prices, with both objectives on an equal footing.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;At the outset, it is worth stressing that these goals are generally complementary, and I will return to this point shortly. But when they are not complementary, one way to think of the policy problem is in terms of tradeoffs: Maximum employment is the highest level of employment that will not cause inflation to escalate significantly above levels consistent with price stability.</p>
<p>Before going into those tradeoffs, I want to emphasize that achieving the Committee's employment goal on an ongoing basis rests on achieving price stability. Price stability enables long-lasting economic expansions, which strengthen the labor market and expand employment opportunities. This process particularly benefits families and communities that all too often have been left behind.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a></p>
<p>But it is appropriate to recognize also that tradeoffs between the goals of maximum employment and price stability can occur in the short term. Indeed, the potential shorter-term tradeoff between unemployment and inflation has long featured prominently among the economic considerations of policymakers. Government action to boost employment through fiscal or monetary stimulus has historically tended to increase aggregate spending and inflation, too. On the contrary, actions to reduce inflation by shifting to contractionary fiscal or monetary policy have tended to slow economic activity and raise unemployment, or at least slow the pace of job creation.</p>
<p>The idea of a short-run tradeoff is reflected in the original specification of the "Phillips curve," named after New Zealand economist A.W. Phillips, who plotted historical values of the United Kingdom's unemployment rate and growth in nominal wages between 1861 and 1957, showing an often inverse relationship between the two. Although the Phillips curve was initially specified in terms of wages, later versions have more typically compared unemployment with price inflation.</p>
<p>Taken at face value, a tradeoff between keeping employment high and reducing inflation would seem to present policymakers with a dilemma. It suggests that when inflation is well above levels associated with price stability, policymakers must engineer a significant increase in unemployment to bring inflation down. Disinflation can be especially challenging when expectations of future inflation are high.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;We saw this in the 1970s and 1980s. Convincing households and businesses that the FOMC was committed to reducing inflation required accepting a protracted, though ultimately temporary, period of high unemployment, as then Fed Chair Paul Volcker came to believe. Volcker is widely credited with ending the "Great Inflation" experienced at the time through his willingness to induce a punishing recession. He lowered inflation and kept it down, in substantial part by convincing the public that the Fed would keep inflation in check whatever the cost, thereby lowering expectations of future inflation.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a></p>
<p>While long experience shows that there can be a tradeoff between policy actions to pursue maximum employment and stable prices, there are times and conditions when this is not the case, or at least when there is little evidence of a tradeoff. For example, for most of the decade after the Great Recession, FOMC policy was, by some measures at least, highly accommodative, yet inflation ran consistently below the Committee's 2 percent target. So when inflation is below target and employment is below maximum sustainable levels, accommodative policy can be used to pursue both sides of the mandate.</p>
<p>Academic economists have debated for decades about the circumstances in which the tradeoff applies. One strand of the research literature proposes that a central bank can indeed achieve good economic outcomes by focusing on a single mandate, an inflation target, and that policies to promote stable prices can also secure low unemployment. In this view, stabilization of inflation ensures that the economy performs at its optimal level, with firms producing just the right amount such that no resources, including workers, are left on the sidelines. This theory fits in a world in which the economy is driven by demand&mdash;in such a case, shocks coming from the demand side of the economy can be offset by monetary policy, which works via aggregate demand.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a></p>
<p>But in the real world&mdash;which is not so simple&mdash;demand shocks are not the only forces that can drive economic fluctuations. Supply shocks not only exist, but they can also be large and persistent, as we have learned over the past several years. Adverse supply shocks, just like higher inflation expectations, make managing the tradeoff between inflation and unemployment more difficult and costly. While a sharp reduction in demand reduces both economic activity and inflation, a sharp reduction in supply, such as a sudden loss of global oil supply, increases inflation and reduces economic activity. Trying to combat inflation by raising interest rates would further reduce economic activity and employment, while reducing interest rates to boost economic activity and employment raises inflation even higher. Therefore, counteracting a persistent supply shock with monetary policy tools may help with one side of the mandate but create even larger deviations from the other side of the mandate.</p>
<p><strong>Inflation and Unemployment in the Pandemic and Its Aftermath</strong><br />Let me now turn to the pandemic experience. Inflation picked up in 2021, and by mid-2022, 12-month inflation, based on personal consumption expenditures (PCE), hit 7 percent, well above the FOMC's 2 percent target. It was the most significant surge in inflation since the 1970s, prompting fears that it could raise expectations of future inflation and make getting inflation down again require a steep tradeoff&mdash;that is, much higher unemployment.</p>
<p>One more specific concern was that a so-called wage&ndash;price spiral would emerge, as may have been the case for a time in the 1970s. In a tight labor market, expectations of continued high inflation can lead workers trying to maintain their living standards to demand higher raises. In a context of strong aggregate demand, firms will likely grant the wage increases to retain their workers&mdash;then pass through the resulting cost increase as higher prices. To avoid a continuing spiral, demand and supply in labor and product markets must be rebalanced&mdash;through lower aggregate demand, greater aggregate supply, or both.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;If achieving this balance requires a drastic reduction in aggregate demand, then sustainably taming inflation could require a high cost in terms of the employment mandate. Fortunately, we appear to have avoided a wage&ndash;price spiral this time, as I will discuss later.</p>
<p>As inflation rose and began to appear persistent, the FOMC rightly focused on restoring price stability, knowing that without price stability, the economy would not work for anyone and that high inflation would ultimately undermine the strength of the labor market. While interest rates rose rapidly, some feared that the cost of disinflation would be persistently elevated unemployment. But over the past year or so, that tradeoff has been much less evident than many feared. We have seen inflation cool significantly, falling more rapidly than at any time since the 1980s. Yet unemployment remains near the lowest levels seen only a few times since the 1960s.</p>
<p>How have we managed to avoid the familiar tradeoff during this period and see such welcome outcomes on both the inflation and employment fronts? I would propose a few possible reasons. These center on the fact that the pandemic inflation featured both supply and demand shocks. In the limited time that I have today, I don't propose to get into the debate about exactly how much of the recent inflation can be explained by supply as opposed to demand. But I will discuss how both demand and supply forces have been important in the rise and fall in the inflation rate.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a></p>
<p>The pandemic caused a significant reduction in supply in some areas of the economy. Limits on the supply of goods resulted from restricted output in many industries. Consider a key U.S. manufacturing industry, auto production. In 2019, the U.S. manufactured 10-1/2 million light vehicles. In 2020, production plunged to 8-1/2 million, with pandemic-related plant shutdowns followed by worldwide shortages of computer chips and other parts.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;It has taken the industry a long time to recover&mdash;auto production was less than 9 million in 2021 and a bit under 10 million in 2022. Constrained vehicle supply played a big role in boosting auto prices. And it wasn't just motor vehicles; for example, you might recall reports of food processing plant shutdowns, and many other goods-producing industries also suffered from "lost output." U.S. industrial production dropped at the onset of the pandemic and then remained below its pre-pandemic level until early 2022 despite strong demand for physical goods; indeed, evidence shows that output was held down by insufficient supply of materials.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a></p>
<p>But supply problems were not limited to goods; indeed, insufficient supply of labor has also been widely cited by businesses as having held down output. Labor supply was suddenly and severely limited early in the pandemic as workers voluntarily and, in some cases, involuntarily stayed out of the workplace. The labor force did not recover to pre-pandemic levels until mid-2022. Older workers, in particular, left the labor market in large numbers. But even many prime-age workers&mdash;those between the ages of 25 and 54&mdash;withdrew because of school disruptions and health concerns, and prime-age labor force participation remained below its pre-pandemic level until early 2023. A slowdown in immigration, likewise, deprived the economy of a customary source of labor supply growth, as did elevated mortality due to COVID-19.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a></p>
<p>Fortunately, these supply shortages for both goods and labor have mostly dissipated. For example, auto production in 2023 nearly regained its 2019 level, and industrial production as well as various goods supply indicators have returned closer to their pre-pandemic levels. Congestion in logistics and transportation networks eased, and firms sometimes found alternative supply chain networks.</p>
<p>In the labor market, shortages directly related to the pandemic have eased, helping restore labor force participation, likely in part because of the reopening of schools, progress with the health situation, and help from childcare subsidies and other policies. Increased capabilities for remote work, allowing for a decoupling between firm and worker location, expanded the pool of available workers and jobs. More broadly, strong labor demand has enticed more workers into the labor market to the point that labor force participation among prime-age workers is now above pre-pandemic levels. And immigration has rebounded as well.</p>
<p>Another, more subtle source of labor market supply recovery has been improvements in the quality of matches between firms and workers. At any time, a crucial factor that affects labor supply is how well the skills of available workers fulfill the needs of employers. With labor in many sectors in short supply and very high numbers of job openings, many workers quit their jobs to move to new ones. Economists generally believe that increased labor turnover improves worker&ndash;firm matches&mdash;workers find jobs that make better use of their skills, typically with higher pay, and firms find workers that are better suited for their businesses and are more productive at their jobs. Economic expansions, such as the one that has continued since April 2020, present more opportunities for workers to find a good match.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a>&nbsp;And it appears that workers and firms were pretty efficient at finding each other over the past couple of years, likely upgrading the average quality of a job match in the process.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a>&nbsp;Higher-quality job&ndash;worker matches improve the productivity of workers, serving like a boost to labor supply.</p>
<p>If reductions in supply contributed to inflation, then recovery of that supply would help lower inflation, too. Supply improvements in the goods sector have helped ease inflation starting in early 2022; for example, in January, the 12-month growth of new motor vehicle prices was less than 1 percent, far slower than its peak pace above 13 percent in the spring of 2022. More broadly, the overall price level for core PCE goods, which excludes food and energy, was fairly flat last year and has actually declined in recent months.</p>
<p>On the labor side, supply recovery has likely contributed to disinflation by helping to ease the pace of wage growth&mdash;especially in the labor-intensive services industries.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn14" title="footnote 14"><span>14</span></a><a name="f14"></a>&nbsp;For private services as a whole, 12-month nominal wage growth, as measured by average hourly earnings, was 4.5 percent in January, down from its peak of 5.9 percent in early 2022. And, sure enough, price inflation in services has also slowed: In core PCE services&mdash;which accounts for roughly three-fourths of core PCE&mdash;12-month inflation was 4.1 percent in January, down from its peak of 5.8 percent early last year.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn15" title="footnote 15"><span>15</span></a><a name="f15"></a></p>
<p>But supply is not the only factor behind the slowing of inflation. Policies affecting aggregate demand have played a role as well. On the fiscal side, measures of the impact of government spending on economic growth turned negative in 2021 after being strongly supportive in 2020.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn16" title="footnote 16"><span>16</span></a><a name="f16"></a>&nbsp;And in terms of monetary policy, the FOMC's actions in late 2021 indicated a sooner-than-previously-anticipated start to policy rate increases, with the FOMC beginning to raise the target range for the federal funds rate in March 2022. After that, the Committee tightened its stance of policy expeditiously. The result can be seen especially in areas of the economy that are sensitive to financial conditions. The housing sector saw a significant slowdown, with residential investment declining more than 15 percent in 2022 and remaining flat in 2023. Growth of investment in equipment was tepid last year, likely due in part to restrictive financial conditions, even as we have seen growth in manufacturing construction for semiconductors and electric vehicle batteries that will help address remaining supply-side bottlenecks.</p>
<p>Aside from these examples of subdued spending in policy-sensitive sectors, we can also see the imprint of monetary policy in the anchoring of inflation expectations. Even amid high inflation, households, businesses, and financial markets believed that inflation would eventually return to its target pace. These beliefs were guided by the FOMC's actions: By raising policy rates expeditiously and communicating clearly, the Committee demonstrated its resolve to lower inflation to 2 percent and its commitment to the price-stability mandate. Anchored inflation expectations are apparent, for example, in the popular University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers. Expectations of inflation for the period covering the next 5 to 10 years have remained relatively stable over the pandemic and close to levels seen before the pandemic. And shorter-term expectations rose in 2021 but have come back down recently.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn17" title="footnote 17"><span>17</span></a><a name="f17"></a>&nbsp;Anchored inflation expectations likely matter for actual price setting. That is what modern theories of the Phillips curve suggest. And the relevance of that theoretical expectation has been suggested by surveys reported by Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond staff: The data show a close relationship between firms' expectations for overall inflation and those firms' own price-setting plans.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn18" title="footnote 18"><span>18</span></a><a name="f18"></a>&nbsp;Crucially, by keeping inflation expectations anchored, the FOMC has likely forestalled the development of wage&ndash;price spiral dynamics of the kind I mentioned earlier, while also creating conditions in which inflation has been able to peak at a lower rate than would have been the case if the FOMC had not acted with credibility and clear communication. Real wage growth&mdash;that is, growth of wages after accounting for inflation&mdash;has turned positive, which means workers' income is rising faster than the cost of living.</p>
<p><strong>A Couple of Final Observations about the Pandemic and Its Aftermath</strong><br />These developments help bring us back to the inflation&ndash;unemployment tradeoff that started my discussion. The pandemic experience has shown that the nature of that tradeoff changes with economic conditions, as does the steepness of the Phillips curve. I will close by making two more general observations about the changes that we have seen during the pandemic and its aftermath, with suggestions about open questions for researchers moving forward.</p>
<p>First, supply curves are, as economists say, "convex": Their slope increases sharply after quantity supplied reaches a certain point, such that prices rise quickly. The steep part of the supply curve can come into play when demand nears the limits of an industry's capacity. That could happen either because of an unusually large increase in demand or because of a temporary reduction in industry capacity&mdash;or both. Research has shown this is the case for individual industries, even in the pre-pandemic period.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn19" title="footnote 19"><span>19</span></a><a name="f19"></a>&nbsp;During the pandemic, many industries experienced large demand shocks or supply curtailment that contributed to inflation, as I have already discussed, and those same shocks also may have exacerbated the inflationary effects by pushing many industries up the steep part of their supply curves.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn20" title="footnote 20"><span>20</span></a><a name="f20"></a></p>
<p>Early in the pandemic, the convexity or steepness of industry supply curves was quite costly in terms of our inflation mandate. But it has likely helped us more recently as we have apparently moved back down the steep part of the supply curve in many industries, which has allowed for rapid disinflation.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn21" title="footnote 21"><span>21</span></a><a name="f21"></a>&nbsp;An open question in the longer term is whether this process has helped firms learn more about supply chains and inventory management such that we might even be less likely to encounter the steep part of supply curves in the future.</p>
<p>Second, with regard to the Phillips curve specifically, I note that in a large class of economic models, the steepness of the Phillips curve is partly a function of how frequently firms adjust their prices, and that seems to be borne out by recent experience.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn22" title="footnote 22"><span>22</span></a><a name="f22"></a>&nbsp;Before the pandemic, the typical price tag lasted more than 10 months, and this figure was reasonably stable for many years. But the pandemic seems to have moved firms into a regime of more frequent price adjustment&mdash;that is, shorter price duration. By early 2022, the typical price was lasting less than five months. Price adjustment frequency has since slowed back down, with the latest data from the third quarter of last year suggesting prices were lasting nearly seven months.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn23" title="footnote 23"><span>23</span></a><a name="f23"></a>&nbsp;Continued slowing of price adjustment frequency is an indicator that firms' costs are rising less quickly and the economy is moving back down the Phillips curve.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn24" title="footnote 24"><span>24</span></a><a name="f24"></a>&nbsp;Interestingly, though, in the workhorse academic models used for studying the effects of monetary policy on the economy, the frequency of price adjustment is often assumed to be constant. Of course, economists have thought about this in the past; but a greater understanding of the relationship between the price adjustment decisions of individual firms and overall inflation is an important area for further academic research.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn25" title="footnote 25"><span>25</span></a><a name="f25"></a></p>
<p>For the reasons I have been discussing, I am cautiously optimistic that we will see continued progress on disinflation without significant deterioration of the labor market. With respect to the inflation and unemployment tradeoff, we have certainly learned a lot during the pandemic&mdash;but there is still much more to learn. In particular, I look forward to further research that can enrich the economics profession's understanding of the inflation&ndash;unemployment tradeoff and the Phillips curve and continue informing policymakers as well.</p>

<p><a name="fn2"></a>2. Before 1977, the Federal Reserve viewed itself as having a dual mandate because it was covered by the Employment Act of 1946, which gave the whole federal government a list of objectives that included maximum employment and maximum "purchasing power." The predominant interpretation of the latter objective was that it corresponded to price stability.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn3"></a>3. L&oacute;pez-Salido, Markowitz, and Nelson (2024) provide a longer-term perspective on how the Federal Reserve has viewed price stability as necessary for achieving maximum employment on a sustained basis. See David L&oacute;pez-Salido, Emily Markowitz, and Edward Nelson (2024), "Continuity and Change in the Federal Reserve's Perspective on Price Stability," manuscript, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Division of Monetary Affairs, January.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn4"></a>4. In the context of achieving disinflation, the tradeoff between inflation and unemployment is sometimes referred to as the "sacrifice ratio." Estimates of the quantitative magnitude of this ratio vary widely, depending on the period being studied and the nature of the macroeconomic model being used. Model-based explorations do suggest that inflation expectations matter for the size of the ratio. For a helpful discussion and analysis, see Robert J. Tetlow (2022), "<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2022079pap.pdf">How Large Is the Output Cost of Disinflation?

More recently, this notion has been called the "divine coincidence" (see Olivier Blanchard and Jordi Gal&iacute; (2007), "Real Wage Rigidities and the New Keynesian Model,"&nbsp;<em>Journal of Money, Credit and Banking</em>, vol. 39 (February), pp. 35&ndash;65).&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="fn8"></a>8. Precisely quantifying the relative roles of supply and demand in the pandemic inflation will likely remain a controversial pursuit for some time. One approach is to focus on relative movements of particular prices and of specific output categories in a "bottom up" manner, as illustrated, for example, by Adam Hale Shapiro (2022), "Decomposing Supply and Demand Driven Inflation," working paper, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, February<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/">.</a>&nbsp;An alternative approach is to conduct a "top down" time-series analysis relating aggregate data on wages, prices, labor market tightness, and various measures of goods supply conditions, as illustrated by Olivier J. Blanchard and Ben S. Bernanke (2023), "<a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w31417">What Caused the U.S. Pandemic-Era Inflation?</a>" NBER Working Paper Series 31417 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, June). The two approaches can complement each other by providing alternative, but mutually consistent, perspectives on the same problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn9"></a>9. The auto industry's experience during the pandemic is a good example of how many industries' production functions are, in economists' terms, "Leontief," meaning that shortages of even one key component can restrict production even if other components are available. The prevalence of this kind of production in many industries made the broader supply chain particularly vulnerable to the extreme pandemic supply shocks. A helpful discussion&mdash;which predates the pandemic and focuses on the 2011 Japan earthquake&mdash;is Christoph E. Boehm, Aaron Flaaen, and Nitya Pandalai-Nayar (2019), "Input Linkages and the Transmission of Shocks: Firm-Level Evidence from the 2011 Tōhoku Earthquake,"&nbsp;<em>Review of Economics and Statistics,</em>&nbsp;vol. 101 (March), pp. 60&ndash;75.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn10"></a>10. Industrial production was low despite strong demand: New orders indexes from many sources were elevated throughout late 2020 and 2021. The Census Bureau's Quarterly Survey of Plant Capacity Utilization features questions on reasons for factory output being below capacity. "Insufficient supply of materials" and "insufficient supply of labor" both surged starting in late 2020 and remained near peak levels from mid-2021 through mid-2022 before starting to move back down. Separately, the Institute for Supply Management's Report on Business Manufacturing PMI (Purchasing Managers Index) features lists of items in short supply each month; the share of major manufacturing-sector input material groups reported as being in short supply surged to about 40 percent during 2021 and has since declined to below 10 percent. For a more formal approach to measuring lost output in manufacturing industries, see Charles Gilbert, Maria D. Tito, and Cynthia Doniger (2021), "<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/quantifying-bottlenecks-in-manufacturing-20211119.html">Quantifying Bottlenecks in Manufacturing</a>," FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, November 19).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn11"></a>11. Per data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Current Population Survey, the labor force level among foreign-born workers had a pre-pandemic peak about a year before the pandemic and did not fully recover to this peak until early 2022.&nbsp;</p>

Past research has found that job quality is higher in expansions; see Gadi Barlevy (2002), "The Sullying Effect of Recessions,"&nbsp;<em>Review of Economic Studies,</em>&nbsp;vol. 69 (January), pp. 65&ndash;96. In the pandemic specifically, job-to-job flows appear to have featured strong wage growth; see David Autor, Arindrajit Dube, and Annie McGrew (2023), "<a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w31010">The Unexpected Compression: Competition at Work in the Low Wage Labor Market</a>," NBER Working Paper Series 31010 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, November).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn13"></a>13. There are various ways to measure "matching efficiency." One such measure shows an initial decline in matching efficiency early in the pandemic, followed by a recovery to (roughly) pre-pandemic levels. See Simon Mongey and Jeff Horwich (2023), "<a href="https://www.minneapolisfed.org/article/2023/are-job-vacancies-still-as-plentiful-as-they-appear-implications-for-the-soft-landing">Are Job Vacancies Still as Plentiful as They Appear?

<p><a name="fn14"></a>14. In general, the most labor-intensive sectors (measured as labor costs' share of value added) are mostly services sectors. As of 2022, the labor cost share of value added was 83 percent in education and health services, 75 percent in professional and business services, 64 percent in construction, and 59 percent in leisure and hospitality. See Bureau of Economic Analysis (2023), "<a href="https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/?reqid=150&amp;step=2&amp;isuri=1&amp;categories=gdpxind">Interactive Data</a>," tables on composition of gross output by industry," December.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn15"></a>15. The connection between wages and prices in services industries has been explored in the economics literature and been found to be a likely contributor to the higher "stickiness" or persistence of services prices relative to goods prices. See Ekaterina Peneva (2011), "Some Evidence on Factor Intensity and Price Rigidity,"&nbsp;<em>Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control,</em>&nbsp;vol. 35 (October), pp. 1652&ndash;58.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="fn21"></a>21. For a formal treatment of the notion that monetary policy can be particularly effective at lowering inflation without large output losses following supply and capacity issues, see Xiwen Bai, Jes&uacute;s Fern&aacute;ndez-Villaverde, Yiliang Li, and Francesco Zanetti (2024), "The Causal Effects of Global Supply Chain Disruptions on Macroeconomic Outcomes: Evidence and Theory," working paper, January, available on the University of Pennsylvania website at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~jesusfv/Supply_Chain_Disruption.pdf">https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~jesusfv/Supply_Chain_Disruption.pdf</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn22"></a>22. In a broad set of models on inaction and action in the face of uncertainty and "non-convex" adjustment costs, firms may choose not to change prices even when faced with shocks, provided the shocks are small. But large shocks move firms out of their "inaction range" such that a series of large shocks can increase adjustment frequency. This can potentially explain reduced price "stickiness" in the pandemic. However, this outcome was not necessarily inevitable, as higher uncertainty can reduce adjustment frequency (due to raising the "real option" value of waiting), and the pandemic environment has been uncertain in many dimensions. For discussions, see Joseph Vavra (2014), "Inflation Dynamics and Time-Varying Volatility: New Evidence and an Ss Interpretation,"&nbsp;<em>Quarterly Journal of Economics,</em>&nbsp;vol. 129 (February), pp. 215&ndash;58; and Robert E. Hall (2023), "<a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w31025">A Major Shock Makes Prices More Flexible and May Result in a Burst of Inflation or Deflation</a>," NBER Working Paper Series 31025 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, March).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn23"></a>23. See updated data from Hugh Montag and Daniel Villar (2023), "<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/price-setting-during-the-covid-era-20230829.html">Price-Setting during the Covid Era</a>," FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, August 29).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn24"></a>24. The previous inflationary episode experienced by the U.S.&mdash;during the late 1970s and early 1980s&mdash;saw similar dynamics of price adjustment frequency; see Emi Nakamura, Jon Steinsson, Patrick Sun, and Daniel Villar (2018), "The Elusive Costs of Inflation: Price Dispersion during the U.S. Great Inflation,"&nbsp;<em>Quarterly Journal of Economics,&nbsp;</em>vol. 133 (November), pp. 1933&ndash;80.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn25"></a>25. I am referring here to the standard "New Keynesian" model, in which firms are allowed to adjust prices only if they receive a random signal whose probability distribution is typically constant and independent of the duration of the firm's current price level (so-called Calvo pricing). Allowing for price adjustment frequency and inflation to move together is one possible way to generate a "nonlinear" Phillips curve; for example, see Andres Blanco, Corina Boar, Callum J. Jones, and Virgiliu Midrigan (2024), "<a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w32094">Non-Linear Inflation Dynamics in Menu Cost Economies</a>," NBER Working Paper Series 32094 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, January).&nbsp;</p>

<div> Corruption, Bribery, Guilty plea, FCPA violations, Gunvor S.A.  
Summary:  
Gunvor S.A. pleads guilty to FCPA violations, pays over $661 million, bribed Ecuadorian officials, cooperates with U.S. authorities. International investigation and guilty pleas follow.  
Gunvor S.A. pays $661 million to settle FCPA violations, admitting to bribing Ecuadorean officials, and faces significant monetary penalties and forfeitures. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>Gunvor S.A. (Gunvor), an international commodities trading company based in Switzerland, has pleaded guilty and will pay over $661 million to resolve an investigation by the U.S. Justice Department into violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).</p>
<p>Gunvor&rsquo;s guilty plea stemmed from the company&rsquo;s corrupt scheme to pay substantial bribes to Ecuadorean government officials to secure business with Ecuador&rsquo;s state-owned and state-controlled oil company, Petroecuador.</p>
<p>In connection with the resolution, Gunvor entered into a plea agreement with the government and pleaded guilty to an information charging the company with conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA.&nbsp;Following the plea, the court sentenced Gunvor to pay a criminal monetary penalty of $374,560,071 and to forfeit $287,138,444 in ill-gotten gains. The sentence includes credits of up to one-quarter of the criminal fine each for amounts Gunvor pays to resolve investigations by Swiss and Ecuadorean authorities into the same misconduct so long as the payments are made within one year of today&rsquo;s date. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland announced today a parallel resolution of its investigation into Gunvor&rsquo;s misconduct that involved payment of approximately $98 million by Gunvor to Swiss authorities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over nearly a decade, Gunvor representatives bribed high-level government officials at Ecuador&rsquo;s state-owned oil company to enter into business transactions with other state-owned entities that ultimately benefited Gunvor. As a result of this complex bribery scheme, Gunvor obtained hundreds of millions of dollars in illicit profits,&rdquo; said Acting Senior Counselor Brent S. Wible of the Justice Department&rsquo;s Criminal Division. &ldquo;Foreign bribery emboldens corrupt officials and undermines the rule of law. Gunvor&rsquo;s guilty plea demonstrates that the Criminal Division remains resolute in our efforts to root out bribery and official corruption. We will continue to hold both corporations and individuals who bribe foreign officials to account, in coordination with our international partners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s guilty plea and sentencing marks yet another example of this office&rsquo;s efforts to combat widespread corruption,&rdquo; said U.S. Attorney Breon Peace for the Eastern District of New York. &ldquo;Corruption erodes the public&rsquo;s trust in their government, prevents government officials from acting in the best interests of the people they represent and harms businesses that play by the rules, driving up prices for consumers. The Justice Department, including my office, will not tolerate bribes being paid by American companies or foreign companies misusing the U.S. financial system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gunvor&rsquo;s years-long bribery scheme involving high-level Ecuadoran officials was both detrimental to the business environment and eroded the public&rsquo;s trust and confidence in their government,&rdquo; said Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey B. Veltri of the FBI Miami Field Office. &ldquo;This guilty plea and significant fine would not have been possible without significant cooperation from our international partners in the Cayman Islands, Colombia, Curacao, Ecuador, Panama, Portugal, Singapore, and Switzerland. This truly was an international effort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to the company&rsquo;s admissions and court documents, between 2012 and 2020, Gunvor and its co-conspirators paid more than $97 million to intermediaries knowing that some of the money would be and in fact was used to bribe Ecuadorean officials, including Nilsen Arias Sandoval, a then-high ranking official at Petroecuador.&nbsp;As part of the scheme, Gunvor managers and agents attended meetings in the United States and elsewhere. The bribe payments were routed through banks in the United States using shell companies in Panama and the British Virgin Islands controlled by Gunvor&rsquo;s co-conspirators.&nbsp;Among other things, a Gunvor employee also directed one of the intermediaries to use the money to purchase an 18-karat gold Patek Philippe watch for Arias.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In exchange for these bribe payments, high-level Ecuadorian officials helped various state-owned entities, which were acting as front companies for Gunvor, win the rights to a series of oil-backed loan contracts with Petroecuador. This structure allowed Gunvor and its co-conspirators to avoid a competitive bidding process and to obtain contractual terms that it could not have obtained otherwise.&nbsp;Gunvor also received confidential Petroecuador information in exchange for the bribes. In total, Gunvor earned more than $384 million in profits from the contracts it obtained corruptly from Petroecuador.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The department reached this resolution with Gunvor based on a number of factors, including, among others, the nature and seriousness of the offense. Gunvor received credit for its cooperation with the department&rsquo;s investigation, which included: (i) producing documents to the department from multiple foreign countries expeditiously while navigating foreign data privacy and criminal laws; (ii) providing information obtained through its own internal investigation to the department, which allowed the department to preserve and obtain evidence as part of the department&rsquo;s investigation; (iii) making detailed, factual presentations to the department; (iv) arranging for the interview of an employee based outside the United States; (v) promptly collecting, analyzing, and organizing voluminous information, including complex financial information, at the request of the department, and producing an analysis of trading activity conducted by multiple outside forensic accounting firms retained by Gunvor; (vi) translating foreign language documents to facilitate and expedite review by the department; and (vii) imaging the phones of relevant custodians at the beginning of Gunvor&rsquo;s internal investigation, thus preserving business communications sent on mobile messaging applications.</p>
<p>Gunvor also engaged in timely and appropriate remedial measures, including: (i)&nbsp;eliminating the use of third-party business origination agents; (ii) enhancing its third party due-diligence process; (iii) developing and implementing a control framework for internal business developers and additional layers of review and approval for counterparty payments; (iv)&nbsp;enhancing the independent compliance committee with responsibility for reviewing high-risk transactions; (v) engaging resources to review its compliance program and test the effectiveness of its overall reporting process, its reporting hotline and the effectiveness of the investigation of reports made through the hotline; (vi) evaluating and updating its compensation policy to better incentivize compliance with the law and corporate policies; (vii) hiring additional compliance personnel; (viii) testing and enhancing its compliance program, including by conducting compliance culture reviews, testing new third party due diligence process and payment controls, and evaluating controls around business development activities; and (ix) developing and implementing a risk-based business communications policy that addresses the use of ephemeral and encrypted messaging applications.</p>
<p>The department also considered Gunvor&rsquo;s history of misconduct. In October 2019, Gunvor reached a resolution with the Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland concerning a corrupt scheme to bribe officials in Congo-Brazzaville and C&ocirc;te d&rsquo;Ivoire to secure oil contracts obtained between approximately 2009 and 2012. As part of the 2019 Swiss resolution, Gunvor admitted that it lacked sufficient controls to prevent the underlying misconduct and failed to take &ldquo;all the reasonable organizational measures&rdquo; required to prevent Gunvor&rsquo;s employees and agents from engaging in bribery. The conduct that is the subject of today&rsquo;s guilty plea occurred, in part, at the same time as the prior Swiss investigation and resolution.</p>
<p>In light of these considerations, the department determined that the appropriate resolution in this case was for Gunvor to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA. The criminal fine calculated under the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines reflects a 25% reduction off the 30th&nbsp;percentile of the applicable guidelines fine range, taking into account Gunvor&rsquo;s cooperation and remediation, as well as its prior history.</p>
<p>The department previously secured convictions in the Eastern District of New York of four individuals who were implicated in Gunvor&rsquo;s bribery scheme, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Antonio Pere Ycaza, a former consultant for Gunvor, pleaded guilty on Oct. 7, 2020, to one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering.</li>
<li>Enrique Pere Ycaza, a former consultant for Gunvor, also pleaded guilty on Oct. 7, 2020, to one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering and to violate the FCPA.</li>
<li>Raymond Kohut, a former Gunvor employee and agent, pleaded guilty on April 6, 2021, to one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering.</li>
<li>Nilsen Arias Sandoval, a former senior Petroecuador official, pleaded guilty on Jan. 19, 2022, to one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FBI Miami Field Office is investigating the case, with assistance from the FBI&rsquo;s International Corruption Unit.</p>
<p>Trial Attorney Clayton P. Solomon and Assistant Chiefs Derek J. Ettinger and Jonathan P. Robell of the Criminal Division&rsquo;s Fraud Section, Trial Attorney D. Hunter Smith and Deputy Chief Adam J. Schwartz of the Criminal Division&rsquo;s Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Nick M. Axelrod, Jonathan P. Lax, and Matthew R. Galeotti for the Eastern District of New York are prosecuting the case. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Laura Mantell and Brendan King for the Eastern District of New York are handling forfeiture matters.</p>
<p>The Justice Department&rsquo;s Office of International Affairs and authorities in the Cayman Islands, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Portugal, Singapore, and Switzerland provided valuable assistance.</p>
<p>The Criminal Division&rsquo;s Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice Department&rsquo;s FCPA enforcement efforts can be found at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa">www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa</a>.</p>
<p>The Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative is led by a team of dedicated prosecutors in the Criminal Division&rsquo;s Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, in partnership with federal law enforcement agencies, and often with U.S. Attorneys&rsquo; Offices, to forfeit the proceeds of foreign official corruption and, where appropriate, to use those recovered assets to benefit the people harmed by these acts of corruption and abuse of office.</p>

<div> FTSE Russell, index provider, annual Russell US Indexes rebalancing schedule, market shifts reflected, transparent, predictable process, 40th anniversary, IPO additions.<br />
Summary:<br />FTSE Russell announces 2024 Russell Indexes rebalancing schedule, 40th anniversary, IPO additions, market shifts reflected, transparent, predictable process. <div>
<div class="tr-VerticalSpacing tr-VerticalSpacing--m">
<div class="tr-RichText   ">
<p><span>FTSE Russell, the global index provider, today confirms the schedule for the 36<span>th</span>&nbsp;annual&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lseg.com/en/ftse-russell/russell-reconstitution">Reconstitution</a>&nbsp;of its Russell US Indexes suite, set to occur at the end of June.&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="tr-VerticalSpacing tr-VerticalSpacing--l">
<div class="tr-RichText   ">
<p>This rebalancing process is designed to capture market shifts from the previous year to ensure the Russell US Indexes continue to accurately reflect the US equity market.</p>
<p>The 2024 Russell Reconstitution schedule is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Tuesday, April 30<span>th</span></span>&nbsp;&ndash; &ldquo;Rank Day&rdquo; &ndash; Index membership eligibility for 2024 Russell Reconstitution determined from constituent market capitalization at market close.</li>
<li><span>Friday, May 24<span>th</span></span>&nbsp;&ndash; Preliminary index additions &amp; deletions membership lists posted to the website after 6 PM US eastern time.</li>
<li><span>Friday, May 31<span>st</span></span>,&nbsp;<span>June 7<span>th</span>, 14<span>th</span>&nbsp;and 21<span>st</span></span>&nbsp;&ndash; Preliminary membership lists (reflecting any updates) posted to the website after 6 PM US eastern time.</li>

</ul>
<br />
<p><span>Catherine Yoshimoto, Director, Product Management, FTSE Russell, said:&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;With a US equity market that is constantly changing, it is critical that the entire Russell US Indexes suite undergoes a complete recalibration to ensure the indexes accurately reflect company size and style shifts that have occurred since the last reconstitution. This annual event is widely followed and traditionally concludes with one of the highest trading volume days of the year, making our transparent, rules-based methodology a key element to a seamless and predictable process for investors. This year, we not only celebrate the 36<span>th</span>&nbsp;annual Russell Reconstitution but also the 40<span>th</span>&nbsp;anniversary of the launch of the Russell US Indexes.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Annual reconstitution and quarterly IPO additions provide an important foundation for FTSE Russell&rsquo;s widely used Russell US Indexes. These index governance processes are designed to ensure that the indexes remain a current and relevant measure of US equity market performance.</p>
<p>On February 16<span>th</span>, FTSE Russell announced the 1Q2024&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lseg.com/en/ftse-russell/russell-reconstitution/ipo-additions">preliminary list of IPO additions</a>, which will take effect at the market open of March 18<span>th</span>. As of 1Q2024, there are no preliminary additions to the Russell 1000 Index and seven additions to the Russell 3000 Index, all of which will be added to the small cap Russell 2000 Index. There will also be six IPOs added to the Russell Microcap Index.</p>

<title>FESE Response To The IOSCO Consultation Report On Market Outages</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/fese-response-to-the-iosco-consultation-report-on-market-outages/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/fese-response-to-the-iosco-consultation-report-on-market-outages/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>FESE agrees with the key findings in IOSCO&rsquo;s consultation report. We believe the recommended good practices around outage and communication plans, the reopening of trading, the closing auction and alternative prices, and the post-outage plan are largely appropriate.</p>
<p>We would also like to thank IOSCO for acknowledging FESE&rsquo;s frameworks for industry-wide standard protocols and highlighting that the EU enjoys a comprehensive regulatory framework on outages. Looking at the details of the IOSCO findings, it is clear that one particular approach will not work in all cases, especially given the differences between equities and derivatives venues. The report also states that, in some jurisdictions with multiple trading venues, alternative venues could be used should a market outage occur on one of the markets. However, in the fragmented European trading landscape, if the primary venue experiences an outage, it is unlikely that other venues which generally follow the prices formed on the primary would be able to continue offering trading.</p>

<div> asymmetric effects, term premium, QE and QT announcement effects, QE execution, QT execution<br />
Summary: The author discusses the asymmetric effects of quantitative easing and quantitative tightening, the term premium, QE execution, QT execution, and the implications of QT in the United States. <div>
<p>Thank you, it is great to be here. I'm pleased to participate in this panel to discuss a policy action now being implemented by central banks around the globe: quantitative tightening (QT).<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240301a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;I want to thank Kristin, Matt, and Wenxin for putting together a great paper that provides an overview of the effects of QT across seven central banks.</p>
<p>Often called "large-scale asset purchases" (LSAPs) by central bankers, the view of quantitative easing, or QE, as a tool to add monetary policy accommodation and QT to tighten policy has changed over time. When it was used during and after the Global Financial Crisis, QE was deemed an "unconventional" tool in central banks' arsenals. But QE has now been used numerous times in the past two decades for extended periods when the policy rate was at the effective lower bound, so I would say it is no longer unconventional.</p>
<p>Given the role of QE and QT in the policy toolkit, it is good to have researchers and policymakers examine how asset purchases work and talk about current issues associated with their implementation. This paper is very timely and thorough in looking across countries and their experiences with QE and QT. There is a lot packed into this work that makes it a little difficult to fully assess in the time we have today. So I will focus my comments on four points: (1) the evidence that the effects of QE are asymmetric to the effects of QT; (2) the execution of QE versus the execution of QT in the United States; (3) the role of announcement effects of QT; and, finally, (4) who has taken the Fed's place in buying assets when we withdraw from the market. I will then end with some thoughts about issues facing the Federal Reserve as we move forward with normalizing our balance sheet.</p>
<p><strong>The Asymmetry of Quantitative Easing versus Quantitative Tightening</strong><br />For me, one of the most interesting results of the paper is that the announcement effects of quantitative easing are much larger than the announcement effects of quantitative tightening. The authors find that announcements of QT have a small but statistically significant effect in increasing government bond yields&mdash;about 4 to 8 basis points. But this effect is much smaller, in absolute terms, than the prevailing estimates of the decrease in yields from announcements of QE. The conclusion is that the interest rate effects of QE and QT are asymmetric. For an economist, this result may seem puzzling&mdash;why would changing the sign on an action lead to asymmetric effects on prices and real variables?</p>
<p>Ever since central banks initiated QE in response to the Global Financial Crisis, academics have debated its effectiveness. One view is that it has a very limited effect in situations where a central bank is swapping zero interest-bearing reserves for zero interest-bearing shorter-term Treasury securities. Because the two assets would seem to be nearly perfect substitutes, there can be no price effects from altering the composition of the two assets. The central bank is simply swapping two $10 bills for a twenty. If this is true, then undoing the trade via QT has no effect either. It should be symmetrical.</p>
<p>The alternative view, based on market segmentation or preferred habitat theory, is that when a central bank uses reserves to pay for government securities, it is decreasing the supply of these securities to private investors, which will bid up the price and lower the interest rate on government securities.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240301a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;By lowering interest rates on longer-maturity assets, which pay a higher interest rate than reserves, the central bank can stimulate the economy in a manner similar to lowering the policy rate. But by this logic, when QT reverses QE, asset prices should fall and yields should rise in equal magnitude. Thus, any positive effects derived from QE would be reversed when QT occurs. This suggests that QE and QT may cancel each other out in welfare terms. But if there are no net benefits from the action, what is the point of doing it? To illustrate this point, suppose someone is given a weight-loss drug and they lose 80 pounds, but then the drug is taken away and they regain the 80 pounds. What was the point of the exercise if there was no net welfare gain?</p>
<p>To me, for QE to be beneficial on net, there&nbsp;<em>has</em>&nbsp;to be asymmetry in the effects of QE relative to QT. My thinking on this has long been guided by the conclusions of a paper I wrote with Alex Berentsen about optimal stabilization policy, which is what QE and QT ultimately should be about.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240301a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;The gist of the argument is that when shocks and frictions to trading arise suddenly, the central bank can take actions such as injecting reserves to ease trading frictions or credit constraints and improve welfare. But by waiting until the frictions and shocks dissipate before undoing the injections, the positive effects are not reversed. As an example, when a house is on fire, pouring water on the fire will put it out, which has great benefits for all. But when the fire is out, draining the water away does not reignite the fire&mdash;the initial benefits are not undone. The punchline here is that QE is conducted under different market conditions than those that occur when QT is done, so it is not surprising that the effects will be different. The authors' findings that QE has asymmetric effects compared to QT is not a puzzle but an indication that central banks timed QE and QT in the right manner such that society was better off.</p>
<p><strong>The Execution of Quantitative Easing versus Quantitative Tightening</strong><br />Turning to the impact of QE and QT on interest rates, analysis often focuses on the term premium. There are three key elements of asset purchases that change the term premium: (1) the expected path of QE, which includes the amount and timing of purchases; (2) the length of time the central bank is expected to hold the additional securities; and (3) the expected path of QT, including the amount and timing of redemptions, which importantly depends on the desired ultimate size of securities holdings (and reserve balances) of the central bank. As soon as an asset purchase program is announced, these expectations are formed, resulting in the term premium effect, or TPE, on interest rates.</p>
<p>Over time, the TPE will change, based on both the passage of time and any updates to the public's expectations for the components I just mentioned. Let me talk about three factors that affect both the expected path of asset purchases and interest rates. These factors are things to keep in mind for future policy decisions.</p>
<p>First, there are two ways that QE can be implemented, and they have different impacts on interest rates. These are what I call&nbsp;<em>closed</em>- or&nbsp;<em>open-ended</em>&nbsp;QE programs. Closed-ended QE programs involve an announcement of a fixed stock of purchases over a fixed period of time. An example of this type of asset purchase program was initiated by the Fed in March 2009.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240301a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;Open-ended QE simply gives a purchase amount per month but no calendar endpoint, so the expected size of the program is unspecified. A set of economic conditions for reducing or ending purchases may be stipulated, but when they will occur is not perfectly predictable. Here, one can think of the Fed's most recent asset purchase program.</p>
<p>At the time of an asset purchase announcement, it will be easier for markets to fully price in a closed-ended program, since its purchase amount and end date are given, whereas the open-ended program's pricing will depend on market expectations for the evolution of the economy. So if one wants a particular impact on interest rates at the announcement date, one might lean toward a closed-ended program or be aware that additional guidance on the expected path of the open-ended program will be needed.</p>
<p>As time passes and the economy evolves, the two programs work differently. One might prefer an open-ended program over time because it dynamically responds to the evolution of economic conditions. The program could be halted or extended as conditions improve or worsen, unlike a closed-ended program. But, of course, the criteria set in the open-ended program must be carefully considered. As I said in a recent FEDS Note and in several speeches, the 2020 criteria for when to begin QT may have been too restrictive and did not allow the Committee to taper as soon and as gradually as desired.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240301a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;Setting the appropriate criteria ahead of time to create the flexibility needed to respond to changing economic and financial conditions is very hard to do.</p>
<p>The second factor affecting the path of asset purchases is that it is very important that QE be credibly followed by QT. If QE is viewed as nothing more than a permanent injection of money into the economy, it would likely create inflation. This was widely predicted back in 2009, but the inflation didn't happen. Why? In my view, it didn't happen because the Fed credibly committed to withdrawing the injected reserves at a later date. Pre-committing to QT is what allows the injection of reserves into the economy without inflation or other longer-run distortions of market pricing. So when starting asset purchases or weighing how to approach asset runoff or sales, it is important that the central bank commit to normalizing its balance sheet.</p>
<p>The third factor is that it is important for a central bank to move carefully as it comes to the end of QT and the desired level of ample reserves. The endpoint should be related to the expectation of the banking system's demand for reserves. In the United States, we saw stresses in money markets in the fall of 2019, when the Fed reduced the level of reserves during balance sheet normalization through July and then there was heavy issuance of Treasury securities in September. The level of reserves likely went a bit too low.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240301a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;Learning from our experiences and trying to understand how the demand for reserves has changed over time suggests moving carefully toward the endpoint of QT.</p>
<p>For this reason, even if QE is an open-ended program, QT is more likely to resemble a closed-ended program. Central banks usually have an idea of how large they want their balance sheet to be when QT ends; therefore, once the pace of QT is announced, markets should be able to effectively price in the entire program at the announcement of the plan. After that, the actual execution of QT is simply validating the beliefs that market participants had at the announcement. This is why many refer to QT as merely draining unneeded reserves, which should be as interesting as watching paint dry.</p>
<p><strong>Quantitative Tightening in the United States</strong><br />Let me now turn more directly to the authors' paper and two of their findings. First, as I mentioned earlier, they find central banks' QT announcements have only a small effect on interest rates. To conduct this analysis, the authors do an event study around QT announcements, which requires them to identify "surprises" in the QT announcements. As the authors acknowledge, this is not a trivial exercise. My comment here is to point out why identifying a QT announcement surprise is challenging when considering examples in the United States.</p>
<p>Let me walk through the evolution of the Fed's QT communications in the spring of 2022 to consider how various communications affected the expected path of QT.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240301a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;Recall that QE ended in March 2022.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240301a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a>&nbsp;Heading into April, it was likely that markets expected a redemption path somewhat like the Fed's 2017&ndash;2019 QT plan.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240301a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;That plan phased in redemptions over 12 months and ultimately allowed, at most, $30 billion of Treasury securities and $20 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) to be redeemed each month. On April 5, 2022, then-Vice Chair Lael Brainard gave a speech that noted the balance sheet would shrink considerably more rapidly than in the previous case of QT; specifically, she said that "significantly larger caps and a much shorter period to phase in the maximum caps compared with 2017&ndash;2019."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240301a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a>&nbsp;The next day, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes provided additional information on the expected maximum monthly caps and phase-in period, saying participants generally agreed to a three-month phase-in and caps of $60 billion and $35 billion for Treasury securities and agency MBS, respectively.</p>
<p>Over those two days in April, the markets likely updated their expected QT plans to have sooner and larger redemptions. This change would be associated with a less negative term premium effect, meaning a rise in Treasury yields. The 10-year Treasury yield rose 19 basis points over the two days of the Vice Chair's speech and the FOMC minutes&mdash;that is, 12 basis points on the day of her speech and another 7 basis points on the day of the FOMC minutes&mdash;and a total of 37 basis points over that week.</p>
<p>About a month later, on May 4, 2022, the FOMC communicated its "Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet." The plan was consistent with the FOMC minutes from April, and there was little change in the 10-year Treasury yield that day and week (negative 4 basis points on the day of the announcement and 2 basis points over the five-day period). So, when doing event studies, it may be difficult to estimate the full impact of QT announcements by simply looking at the formal announcement of the QT plan.</p>
<p>Let me turn to a second point of the paper, about which types of investors have increased their securities holdings as the Fed has reduced its holdings. When a central bank steps away from asset purchases and begins to shrink its balance sheet, a common question is, who will step in and take the central bank's place in buying securities? I always respond by saying, "Why is this important?" If the government bond market is broad and deep, there will be plenty of buyers&mdash;there is no need to worry about who will buy the government debt. If the government bond market is not broad or deep, however, then the central bank's actions can have adverse and unwanted effects on prices and market functioning. This would then affect how fast the central bank can reduce its balance sheet and whether it can do so passively or actively.</p>
<p>One could also argue that it matters because knowing the buyers helps one understand the transmission of QT to asset prices and interest rates. Does it matter if it is banks or nonbank financial firms that are doing the buying? Does it matter if it is hedge funds, pension funds, or actual households doing the buying? One needs to have a better understanding of why the question is being asked before one can fully understand the answers to the question.</p>
<p>The authors focus on the reduction in aggregate securities holdings of central banks and find that households and broker-dealers are the main investors absorbing the redeemed securities. For my discussion today, I decided to dig a bit deeper into the Financial Accounts of the United States in two ways. First, I decided to look at each type of security (Treasury securities and agency MBS) individually.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240301a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a>&nbsp;For Treasury securities, I also find that since the 2022 start of QT, households have boosted their market share the most, and broker-dealers have also increased their share. For agency MBS, not only has the market shares of those two investor types increased, but so has the market shares of money market funds.</p>
<p>Second, I dug into the household category a bit more. As currently categorized, the Financial Accounts household category includes hedge funds. The Federal Reserve Board is working to segregate hedge funds in this data set. In the interim, the Board publishes separate data on the balance sheets of domestic hedge funds.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240301a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a>&nbsp;Using this supplemental data, I find that it is not the hedge funds that are responsible for the increase in household market share. This means the increase is driven by the other household investors: actual households and nonprofit organizations.</p>
<p>What do I make of this finding? My interpretation is that it reinforces the view that the demand for U.S. Treasury securities is broad and deep&mdash;the buyers are not a narrow set of deep-pocketed, sophisticated investors but rather the American public. As a result, the pace of runoff is not a problem. As we have seen with the current phase of QT, runoff up to $95 billion a month is not causing substantial strains in financial markets&mdash;something that a few years ago would have surprised a lot of people, given the worries about QT that were common prior to 2022.</p>
<p><strong>Normalization</strong><br />Let me conclude with a few comments on where I believe the Fed should be heading as it continues to normalize its balance sheet. By "normalizing" I mean reducing the size of the balance sheet but retaining enough assets to manage monetary policy using an ample-reserves regime.</p>
<p>As the Federal Reserve continues its QT program, I support further thinking about how many more securities to redeem. We have an overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility with take-up of more than $500 billion, and I view these funds as excess liquidity that financial market participants do not want, so this tells me that we can continue to reduce our holdings for some time.</p>
<p>In addition, it is important to remember that we now have a standing repurchase agreement facility (SRF). The SRF serves as a backstop in money markets, since it takes in Treasury securities as well as agency MBS and puts reserves in the banking system. This facility may allow banks to lower the level of reserves below what reserves would be without the facility, and it may provide a signal for when reserves are getting close to ample.</p>
<p>Chair Powell has noted that the FOMC will begin to discuss slowing our redemptions at our FOMC meeting this month, which will help us transition into whatever definition of "ample" we deem appropriate. Changing our pace of redemptions will occur when the Committee makes a decision to do so, and the timing will be independent of any changes to the policy rate target. Balance sheet plans are about getting liquidity levels right and approaching "ample" at the correct speed. They do not imply anything about the stance of interest rate policy, which is focused on influencing the macroeconomy and achieving our dual mandate.</p>
<p>Thinking about longer-term issues related to the Fed's portfolio, I want to mention two things. First, I would like to see the Fed's agency MBS holdings go to zero. Agency MBS holdings have been slow to run off the portfolio, at a recent monthly average of about $15 billion, because the underlying mortgages have very low interest rates and prepayments are quite small. I believe it is important to see a continued reduction in these holdings.</p>
<p>Second, I would like to see a shift in Treasury holdings toward a larger share of shorter-dated Treasury securities. Prior to the Global Financial Crisis, we held approximately one-third of our portfolio in Treasury bills.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240301a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a>&nbsp;Today, bills are less than 5 percent of our Treasury holdings and less than 3 percent of our total securities holdings. Moving toward more Treasury bills would shift the maturity structure more toward our policy rate&mdash;the overnight federal funds rate&mdash;and allow our income and expenses to rise and fall together as the FOMC increases and cuts the target range. This approach could also assist a future asset purchase program because we could let the short-term securities roll off the portfolio and not increase the balance sheet.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240301a.htm#fn14" title="footnote 14"><span>14</span></a><a name="f14"></a>&nbsp;This is an issue the FOMC will need to decide in the next couple of years.</p>
<p>In conclusion, let me be clear that this is a great paper that will serve as a major reference for researchers and central banks. The authors' analysis will surely have a much longer shelf life than my discussion of it.</p>
<hr align="left" size="1" width="33%" />
<p><a name="fn1"></a>1. The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn2"></a>2. There are several theories for how QE works. The market segmentation theory suggests that assets of different maturities are imperfect substitutes, so a lower supply of long-term assets and a higher supply of short-term assets would imply that long-term interest rates fall and short-term interest rates rise. The preferred habitat theory suggests that financial market participants prefer certain asset maturities over others and the price (or interest) rate needs to adjust to change their desired mix of holdings.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn3"></a>3. For details of the model and results, see Aleksander Berentsen and Christopher Waller (2011), "Price-Level Targeting and Stabilization Policy,"&nbsp;<em>Journal of Money, Credit and Banking,</em>&nbsp;vol. 43, Supplement 2 (October), pp. 559&ndash;80.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn4"></a>4. An example of a closed-ended program is from March 2009, when the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) noted that "to help improve conditions in private credit markets, the Committee decided to purchase up to $300 billion of longer-term Treasury securities over the next six months"; see paragraph 3 of the March 2009 FOMC statement, which is available on the Board's website at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm">https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm</a>. An example of an open-ended program is from December 2020, when the FOMC stated it would keep buying $120 billion per month in securities "until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee's maximum employment and price stability goals"; see paragraph 4 of the December 2020 FOMC statement, which is available on the Board's website at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm">https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn5"></a>5. See Jane Ihrig and Chris Waller (2024), "<a href="https://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.3455">The Federal Reserve's Responses to the Post-COVID Period of High Inflation</a>," FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, February 14).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn6"></a>6. For a discussion of the September 2019 experience, see Sriya Anbil, Alyssa Anderson, and Zeynep Senyuz (2020), "<a href="https://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.2527">What Happened in Money Markets in September 2019?</a>" FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, February 27).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn7"></a>7. Prior to the spring announcements, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) began discussions on policy normalization as reported in the December 2021 FOMC minutes. It was noted that some participants observed that the balance sheet could potentially shrink faster than the previous experience. The 10-year Treasury yield moved up several basis points around the release of the minutes.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn8"></a>8. In March 2022, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) indicated that it "expects to begin reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities at a coming meeting"; see paragraph 3 of the March 2022 FOMC statement, which is available on the Board's website at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm">https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm</a>. This language signaled the Fed would be holding the peak amount of securities on its balance sheet for just a short period of time, which turned out to be between March and the end of May.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn9"></a>9. In January 2022, the Federal Open Market Committee provided a statement on "Principles for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet," but it did not provide information about the timing or pace of redemptions; the statement is available on the Board's website at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20220126c.htm">https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20220126c.htm</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn10"></a>10. See Lael Brainard (2022), "<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20220405a.htm">Variation in the Inflation Experiences of Households</a>," speech delivered at the Spring 2022 Institute Research Conference, Opportunity and Inclusive Growth Institute, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Minneapolis, April 5.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn11"></a>11. My calculations look at how investor types' market shares change over time, as is done in Seth Carpenter, Selva Demiralp, Jane Ihrig, and Elizabeth Klee (2015), "Analyzing Federal Reserve Asset Purchases: From Whom Does the Fed Buy?"&nbsp;<em>Journal of Banking and Finance,</em>&nbsp;vol. 52 (March), pp. 230&ndash;44.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn12"></a>12. Data on the balance sheet of hedge funds is available on the Board's website at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/20231207/html/b101f.htm">https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/20231207/html/b101f.htm</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn13"></a>13. A Treasury bill is a security backed by the U.S. Treasury Department with a maturity of up to 52 weeks. A bill is sold at a discount, and at maturity the investor receives the par value of the security.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn14"></a>14. There may be other considerations for holding a sizable share of bills in the Fed's portfolio. For example, Vissing-Jorgensen (2023) argues for considering the convenience yield impact of bills; see Annette Vissing-Jorgensen (2023), "Balance Sheet Policy above the ELB," paper presented at the ECB Forum on Central Banking, held in Sintra, Portugal, June 26&ndash;28.&nbsp;</p>

<title>SEC Charges Advisory Firm HG Vora For Disclosure Failures Ahead Of Ryder Acquisition Bid</title>

<div> SEC, HG Vora Capital Management, ownership disclosures, civil penalty, Ryder System Inc<br />
Summary: SEC fined HG Vora for late ownership disclosure before its bid for Ryder, violating securities laws, leading to significant stock price increase. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced settled charges against New York-based investment adviser HG Vora Capital Management LLC for its failure to make timely ownership disclosures in the lead-up to its May 2022 acquisition bid for trucking fleet company Ryder System Inc. HG Vora agreed to pay a $950,000 civil penalty to settle the SEC&rsquo;s charges.</p>
<p>Under the federal securities laws, a company that owns more than five percent of a public company&rsquo;s stock must report its position and whether it has a control purpose, which is an intention to influence or control the company. According to the SEC&rsquo;s order, on Feb. 14, 2022, HG Vora disclosed that it owned 5.6 percent of Ryder&rsquo;s common stock as of Dec. 31, 2021, and certified that it did not have a control purpose. The order states that HG Vora then built up its position to 9.9 percent of Ryder's stock and formed a control purpose no later than April 26, 2022. The federal securities laws therefore required it to report its control purpose and its current ownership position by May 6, 2022, but it did not report this information until May 13. On that same day, HG Vora sent a letter to Ryder proposing to buy all Ryder shares for $86 a share, a sizeable premium over the trading price. Before the letter to Ryder and its filing, and after forming a control purpose, HG Vora purchased swap agreements that gave it economic exposure to the equivalent of 450,000 more shares of Ryder common stock. After HG Vora&rsquo;s public announcement of its bid on May 13, 2022, Ryder&rsquo;s stock price increased significantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The federal laws and SEC rules covering ownership disclosure help keep investors fully informed about control &ndash; and potential changes in control &ndash; of publicly traded companies,&rdquo; said Mark Cave, Associate Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;But, according to today&rsquo;s order, HG Vora deprived Ryder shareholders of information about its significant stake in the company, while building a large swaps position from which it stood to profit after announcing the Ryder takeover bid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that HG Vora violated the beneficial ownership provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Without admitting or denying the findings, HG Vora agreed to cease and desist from future violations and to pay the civil penalty discussed above. On Oct. 10, 2023, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-219">SEC adopted rules</a>&nbsp;shortening the deadline for filing an initial Schedule 13D from 10 to five business days. HG Vora was found to have violated the rules in effect at the time of the conduct at issue in the SEC&rsquo;s order by filing this report more than 10 days after forming a control purpose.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Jonathan Cowen with assistance from Robert Nesbitt of the Office of Market Intelligence and Nicholas Panos from the Office of Mergers &amp; Acquisitions. The investigation was supervised by Assistant Director Jeffrey Weiss and Mr. Cave.</p>

<p><span>ACER and the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) are organising an online workshop to present the simulation results of the long-term flow-based allocation of transmission capacities.</span></p>
<p><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">When?</span></span></p>
<p><span>Friday, 22 March 2024, 09:00 &ndash; 12:00 CET</span></p>
<p><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is it about?</span></span></p>
<p><span>The long-term flow-based allocation of transmission capacities process will be used to manage and allocate the electricity transmission across the European integrated market on yearly and monthly timeframe in the Core and Nordic capacity calculation regions (CCRs). The process will enhance the efficiency of the transmission capacity allocation, thus providing hedging opportunities to market participants.</span></p>
<p><span>The Nordic CCR comprises&nbsp;4 countries: Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden.</span></p>
<p><span>The Core CCR consists of 13 countries: Austria, Belgium, Czechia, Croatia, France, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia and Romania.</span></p>
<p><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the key objectives?</span></span></p>
<p><span>This 6<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;workshop aims to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Present and discuss the simulation results.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span>Introduce the expected timeline for the go-live of the single allocation platform that will support the long-term flow-based capacity allocation process.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This workshop will provide stakeholders with an in-depth understanding of the long-term flow-based allocation process, as well as the go-live preparation of yearly and monthly flow-based auctions.</span></p>

Summary:<br />
Global economy at inflection point with synchronized monetary policy tightening. Disinflation on track but risks of re-emerging inflation and deeper-than-expected slowdown pose challenges for emerging markets. Banking supervision is crucial. <div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The global economy is at an inflection point, as the most synchronised and most significant monetary policy tightening in recent memory nears the end. Disinflation is largely on track, and there is a good chance of a soft, or softish, landing. But inflationary pressures may re-emerge. And the current slowdown in growth may still turn out to be deeper and more protracted than expected. If such risks materialise, capital flows to emerging market economies may retrench. Some, like those in sub-Saharan Africa, may be particularly vulnerable given their high levels of debt held by foreign bondholders and commercial banks. Policymakers will need to navigate these difficult waters, including by enhancing banking supervision.</span></p>

<div> Circular, reporting system, quantitative trading, regulation, market order
Summary:<br /> 
- SZSE implemented reporting system for quantitative trading
- Recognizes advantages and problems of quantitative trading
- Plans to strengthen regulatory arrangements
- Will increase communication with HKEX
- Will take self-regulatory measures and report violations to CSRC<br /> <div>
<p>On September 1, 2023, SZSE issued the Circular on Matters Relating to the Reporting of Stock Program Trading and the Circular on Matters Relating to Strengthening the Management of Program Trading with official effect from October 9, 2023, establishing the special reporting&nbsp;system&nbsp;and corresponding regulatory arrangements for quantitative trading. With joint efforts of all market participants, the above&nbsp;system&nbsp;has been smoothly implemented.&nbsp;The existing&nbsp;investors have completed the reporting on schedule as required, while&nbsp;new&nbsp;investors have carried out the provisions of &ldquo;reporting before trading&rdquo; and their reporting quality has generally met the requirements, laying the foundation for further strengthening and improving the regulation of quantitative trading. SZSE will, based on the reported information, continue to intensify the monitoring and analysis of quantitative trading, especially high-frequency trading and dynamically evaluate and improve the reporting&nbsp;system.</p>
<p>With the wide application of new information technologies, quantitative trading has recently become an important way of trading. It helps provide liquidity to the market and facilitates price discovery.&nbsp;Compared with&nbsp;small and medium-sized investors, quantitative trading, especially high-frequency trading, has obvious advantages in technology, information and speed, but at some time points, also shows problems such as strategy convergence, trading resonance and increase in market volatility. From the perspective of international experience, overseas markets generally implement the stricter regulation on quantitative trading, especially high-frequency trading, to prevent negative impact on market order. In the next step, SZSE will adhere to the investor-oriented approach, take the maintenance of fairness as the starting point and goal of its work, learn from international regulatory practices, seek advantages and avoid disadvantages. SZSE will establish sound regulatory arrangements for quantitative trading, including strict implementation of the reporting&nbsp;system&nbsp;and clear access arrangements of &ldquo;reporting before trading&rdquo;; strengthen the authorization management of market&nbsp;data for&nbsp;quantitative trading and perfect the differentiated charging mechanism; improve monitoring standards for abnormal trading and reinforce the regulation on abnormal trading and abnormal order reporting and withdrawal; strengthen the monitoring and regulation of leverage-type quantitative products and the joint regulation of futures and spot goods. Meanwhile, SZSE will further clarify customer management responsibilities of securities companies, perfect the self-regulatory management cooperation mechanism with the Securities Association of China and the Asset Management Association of China and intensify the regulation on trading of quantitative&nbsp;and&nbsp;private institutions. In addition, SZSE will increase communication with HKEX and under the principle of equal treatment for domestic and foreign capital, clarify reporting arrangements for&nbsp;northbound&nbsp;investors under the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect and include quantitative trading by&nbsp;northbound&nbsp;investors in the reporting scope. SZSE will resolutely take self-regulatory measures against abnormal trading that affects the market order and report those suspected of violating laws and regulations and having serious circumstances to the CSRC for investigation and punishment.</p>

<title>Shenzhen Stock Exchange Restricts Ningbo Lingjun’s Trading And Initiates A Public Censure Procedure Against It</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>On February 19, during trading monitoring,&nbsp;SZSE discovered that from 9:30:00 to 9:30:42, multiple securities accounts of Ningbo Lingjun Investment Management Partnership (Limited Partnership) (&ldquo;Ningbo Lingjun&rdquo;) automatically generated trading instructions through computer programs and placed large quantities of orders in a short time. Stocks amounting to CNY 1.372 billion were sold through such accounts&nbsp;and&nbsp;the Shenzhen Component Index fell rapidly&nbsp;during&nbsp;that&nbsp;period, affecting the normal trading order. This constituted an abnormal trading activity specified in Item 6 of Article 6.2 of the Trading Rules of Shenzhen Stock Exchange. The securities accounts of Ningbo Lingjun continued abnormal trading activities though they have been repeatedly subject to regulatory measures such as written warning by SZSE for such activities since this year.</p>
<p>According to the Implementing Rules for Restricted&nbsp;Trading, the Implementing Measures for Self-disciplinary Supervision and Disciplinary Measures and other relevant provisions of SZSE, we decided to take trading restriction measures against the relevant securities accounts of Ningbo Lingjun from February 20, 2024 to February 22, 2024, during which period&nbsp;Ningbo Lingjun is restricted from trading in all stocks listed and traded on SZSE. In addition,&nbsp;we&nbsp;initiated the disciplinary sanction procedures for public censure against Ningbo Lingjun.</p>
<p>SZSE will, in accordance with the unified arrangement of the CSRC, resolutely implement the requirements of strict and tough regulation, adhere to the primary responsibility for regulation and treat regulation as its primary business and constantly strengthen trading regulation. Moreover, SZSE will always maintain a strict tone and a tough stance of &ldquo;zero tolerance&rdquo; for, quickly respond to and crack down on&nbsp;the&nbsp;illegalities and violations that affect the normal order of the market and damage the legitimate rights and interests of investors. At the same time, SZSE reminds investors to participate in trading in accordance with laws and regulations to jointly maintain the normal trading order of the market.</p>

<title>ASIC: It’s A Scam! Celebrities Are Not Getting Rich From Online Investment Trading Platforms</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-its-a-scam-celebrities-are-not-getting-rich-from-online-investment-tradi/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The National Anti-Scam Centre is warning consumers to beware of fake news articles and deepfake videos of public figures that endorse and link to online investment trading platform scams, particularly on social media.</p>
<p>Last year, Australians reported losing more than $8 million to online investment trading platform scams, with 400 reports made to Scamwatch.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are urging Australians to take their time and do their research before taking up an investment opportunity &ndash; particularly those seen on social media,&rsquo; ACCC Deputy Chair Catriona Lowe said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Scammers are creating fake news articles and deepfake videos to convince people that celebrities and well-known public figures are making huge sums of money using online investment trading platforms, when in fact it is a scam.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;These fake videos and news articles circulating on social media and video sharing platforms, often claim that the online trading platform uses artificial intelligence or other emerging technologies such as quantum computing to generate high returns for investors, but it is not true,&rsquo; Ms Lowe said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We know of an Australian man who lost $80,000 in cryptocurrency after seeing a deepfake Elon Musk video interview on social media, clicking the link and registering his details through an online form. He was provided with an account manager and an online dashboard where he could see his investment supposedly making huge returns. But when he tried to withdraw the money &ndash; he was locked out of his account.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Reports to Scamwatch indicate the most prolific online investment trading platform scam appears under the brand &lsquo;Quantum AI&rsquo;. Others include &lsquo;Immediate Edge&rsquo;, &lsquo;Immediate Connect&rsquo;, &lsquo;Immediate X3&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Quantum Trade Wave&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The National Anti-Scam Centre&rsquo;s investment scam fusion cell, co-led by the ACCC and ASIC, has been active in disrupting investment scams such as online investment trading platform scams.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In addition to referring these scam ads to social media platforms for removal, the fusion cell has developed a trial method for blocking payments to these scams,&rsquo; Ms Lowe said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It has been encouraging to see an overall downward trend in losses reported to Scamwatch to investment scams since the establishment of the fusion cell in July 2023.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The ACCC and ASIC will continue to work together as part of the National Anti-Scam Centre's efforts to stop scammers from harming Australians.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>How online investment trading platform scams work</h2>
<ul>
<li>Scammers entice victims through social media advertisements, deepfake videos on video sharing platforms and fake online news articles about celebrities and well-known public figures claiming to make substantial money from online trading platforms.</li>
<li>This fake click bait will link to a scam website where victims are prompted to enter their details. This is the gateway for communication between the scammer and victim.</li>
<li>Scammers ask for a small investment of around $250 via credit card to provide access to the trading platform.</li>
<li>Scammers will often ask the new investor to download a third-party trading platform via the relevant app store or provide the investor with login details for an online dashboard.</li>
<li>After showing profits through a dedicated online dashboard, scammers persuade their victims to invest more. Sometimes scammers will allow victims to make a small withdrawal early in the scam to build trust.</li>
<li>When the victim eventually tries to withdraw their funds, scammers will ask for withdrawal fees or cite tax implications to obtain more money. Some victims have reported being locked out of their account.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Protect yourself</h3>
<p><span>STOP</span>&nbsp;&ndash; Don&rsquo;t give personal information or act on investment advice you have come across on social media. Don&rsquo;t feel pressured to invest. If you have any doubts, stop communicating with them.</p>
<p><span>THINK</span>&nbsp;&ndash; Ask yourself if you really know what you are investing in? Scammers can create fake news to make it seem legitimate. Do an internet search to see if there are warnings about this investment trading platform scam, including if the well-known public figure has warned about being impersonated.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>PROTECT</span>&nbsp;&ndash; Act quickly if something feels wrong. If you have shared financial information or transferred money, contact your bank immediately. Help others by reporting scams to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.scamwatch.gov.au/report-a-scam">Scamwatch</a>.</p>
<h3>Investor information</h3>
<p>Before investing, Australians can make these simple practical checks to help reduce the risk of investment scams:</p>
<ul>
<li>check ASIC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://moneysmart.gov.au/check-and-report-scams/investor-alert-list">investor alert list</a>&nbsp;to help keep you informed about investments that could be fraudulent, a scam or unlicensed.</li>
<li>go to&nbsp;ASIC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://moneysmart.gov.au/check-and-report-scams/check-before-you-invest">Check before you invest</a>&nbsp;page to see how you can check if the company or person is licensed or authorised to offer the investment. Be sure to check&nbsp;<a href="https://connectonline.asic.gov.au/RegistrySearch/faces/landing/ProfessionalRegisters.jspx?_adf.ctrl-state=y9w00wdnd_54">ASIC&rsquo;s professional register</a>&nbsp;to see if the licensee is authorised to provide services to retail clients. Sometimes licensees are impersonated so check you are dealing with the correct entity by independently verifying contact details on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.afca.org.au/make-a-complaint/findafinancialfirm">AFCA&rsquo;s financial firms directory</a>.&nbsp; Does the website domain and contact details match those on the list? For more information about how to spot an investment scam, visit&nbsp;<a href="https://moneysmart.gov.au/investment-warnings/investment-scams">ASIC&rsquo;s Moneysmart website</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>On February 8, SZSE formulated and issued the&nbsp;<i>Self-Regulatory Guidelines No.17 for Companies Listed&nbsp;</i><i>on&nbsp;</i>Shenzhen Stock Exchange<i>&nbsp;- Sustainable Development Report (for Trial Implementation) (</i><i>E</i><i>xposure</i><i>&nbsp;</i><i>Draft)</i>&nbsp;(hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;<i>Guidelines for Sustainable Development Report</i>&rdquo;) to solicit comments from the market. This is an important measure for SZSE to implement the&nbsp;guiding principles&nbsp;of the 20th CPC National Congress, the Central Economic Work Conference and the Central Financial Work Conference and fully, accurately and comprehensively carry out the new development concept. With this measure, SZSE&nbsp;aims to&nbsp;standardize the disclosure requirements for sustainable development information of listed companies, instruct listed companies to practice the concept of sustainable development and promote the improvement of the quality of listed companies.&nbsp;This&nbsp;helps give full play to the hub function of the capital market, guides the gathering of factors in the field of sustainable development, further builds industrial clusters with sustainable investment value and facilitates the realization of the strategic goals of &ldquo;carbon peaking and carbon neutrality&rdquo;. It also drives the enhancement of governance ability, competitiveness, innovation ability, anti-risk ability, medium and long-term sustainable development ability and long-term stable return ability of listed companies, enhances listed companies&rsquo; attraction to long-term capital and further consolidates the foundation for the high-quality development of listed companies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;According to the report to the 20th CPC National Congress, driving low-carbon economic and social development is the key link in achieving high-quality development, which is the primary task for comprehensively building a modern socialist country. The Central Economic Work Conference proposed to actively yet prudently promote carbon peaking and carbon neutrality and accelerate the creation of a low-carbon supply chain. The Central Financial Work Conference pointed out the effective implementation of five major tasks including green finance. In the&nbsp;<i>Three-year Action Plan for Promoting the Improvement of Quality of Listed Companies (2022-2025)</i>, CSRC requires the establishment of a sound disclosure system for sustainable development information,&nbsp;the&nbsp;formulation of a system of disclosure rules for sustainable development information of listed companies&nbsp;that is&nbsp;based on China&rsquo;s actual situation, in line with international trends and with Chinese characteristics,&nbsp;the&nbsp;definition of the implementation path and&nbsp;the&nbsp;gradual promotion as planned in stages. The aim is to better play the role of finance in serving national strategies, supporting high-quality development and practicing social responsibilities and further optimize resource allocation.</p>
<p>Under the guidance of CSRC, SZSE has steadily advanced the drafting of the&nbsp;<i>Guidelines for Sustainable Development Report</i>&nbsp;with the overall thinking of three aspects.&nbsp;Firstly, being practical and realistic.&nbsp;After fully considering the development stage and disclosure ability of listed companies in China, SZSE achieves the matching of cost and benefit through the combination of mandatory and voluntary disclosure, combination of qualitative and quantitative disclosure, setting of transitional period and mitigation measures.&nbsp;Secondly,&nbsp;upholding&nbsp;systematic thinking.&nbsp;SZSE helps listed companies build a sound governance mechanism related to sustainable development, establishes a disclosure framework with &ldquo;governance - strategy - impact, risk and opportunity management - indicators and objectives&rdquo; as&nbsp;the&nbsp;core elements and drives high-quality information disclosure with better internal governance and concrete actions.&nbsp;Thirdly, learning from good practices and reflecting Chinese characteristics.&nbsp;SZSE summarizes the current domestic and foreign disclosure systems and excellent practices, refers to national standards and industry norms and actively absorbs international beneficial experience. Based on the actual situation of China&rsquo;s capital market, SZSE sets specific topics such as rural revitalization and innovation-driven concept to fully reflect the characteristics and advantages of China&rsquo;s listed companies in the field of sustainable development.</p>
<p>Following the above drafting ideas, the&nbsp;<i>Guidelines for Sustainable Development Report</i>&nbsp;consists&nbsp;of 58 articles in 6 chapters covering 20 specific topics, further enriching&nbsp;and improving&nbsp;the information disclosure requirements related to sustainable development on the basis of the existing rules. It specifies that listed companies shall analyze and disclose the topics to be disclosed around four core&nbsp;aspects, namely, governance, strategy, impact&nbsp;-&nbsp;risk&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;opportunity management,&nbsp;and indicators&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;objectives, so that investors and stakeholders can fully understand the actions taken by listed companies to cope with and manage impacts, risks and opportunities related to sustainable development. Meanwhile, it sets multiple topics including carbon emissions, pollutants, ecosystem and biodiversity, circular economy utilization, rural revitalization and supply chain security in such aspects as environment, society and corporate governance. In terms of implementation method, it clarifies that&nbsp;the&nbsp;constituents continuously included in the Shenzhen 100 Index and the ChiNext Index during the reporting period and&nbsp;the&nbsp;companies listed&nbsp;simultaneously&nbsp;at home and abroad shall disclose the&nbsp;<i>Sustainable Development Report</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;that&nbsp;other listed companies are encouraged to make disclosure voluntarily. It also defines that&nbsp;listed companies shall disclose the information related to some important topics through qualitative and quantitative methods, so as to facilitate horizontal and vertical comparison by investors and stakeholders. Meanwhile, it sets mitigation measures for quantitative disclosure requirements&nbsp;including that listed companies can make qualitative disclosure and explain the reasons for the indicators that are more difficult to disclose quantitatively in the first reporting period. In terms of transitional arrangements and other mitigation measures, in order to help listed companies build capacity and prepare for implementation in advance, listed companies that are required to disclose the&nbsp;<i>Sustainable Development Report</i>&nbsp;can disclose the 2025&nbsp;<i>Sustainable Development Report</i>&nbsp;for the first time before April 30, 2026 at the latest. If it is difficult to quantitatively disclose the impact of sustainable development-related risks and opportunities on the current financial position during the reporting periods of 2025 and 2026, it can be only disclosed qualitatively.</p>
<p>SZSE has always adhered to the concept of sustainable development, actively carried out practices related to sustainable development, instructed listed companies to actively fulfill their social responsibilities and&nbsp;has&nbsp;been committed to building a group of listed companies that meet the requirements of low-carbon sustainable development. SZSE has successively issued the&nbsp;<i>White Paper on Environmental Information Disclosure of SZSE-listed Companies</i>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<i>White Paper on Sustainable Development Information Disclosure of SZSE-listed Companies.</i>&nbsp;These help guide&nbsp;listed companies to strengthen their awareness of sustainable development information disclosure and actively practice the concept of sustainable development by sharing the practices and excellent cases of sustainable development information disclosure of SZSE-listed companies. In 2022, more than 2,700 SZSE-listed companies disclosed their social responsibility performance in their annual reports; more than 1,100 ones disclosed information on pollution prevention, resource conservation and ecological protection; and more than 800 ones released independent social responsibility reports or ESG reports, further improving the quality of ESG information disclosure.&nbsp;According to the statistics of the United Nations on total carbon emissions of companies listed on stock exchanges of G20 countries, SZSE-listed companies ranked first in low carbon with the lowest total carbon emissions.</p>
<p>Next, SZSE will, in accordance with the unified deployments of CSRC, continue to listen to the opinions and suggestions of market participants through multiple means, fully study and absorb reasonable opinions and suggestions and timely release them to the market for implementation. SZSE will constantly improve the system of sustainable development rules, cultivate leading companies in the field of sustainable development, enrich the system of sustainable development products, optimize the system of sustainable development services, strive to build a benchmark for sustainable exchanges and help create a low-carbon and sustainable market ecology.</p>
