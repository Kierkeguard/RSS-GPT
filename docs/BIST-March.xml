I'm pleased to participate in this panel to discuss a policy action now being implemented by central banks around the globe: quantitative tightening (QT).<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240301a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;I want to thank Kristin, Matt, and Wenxin for putting together a great paper that provides an overview of the effects of QT across seven central banks.</p>
<p>Often called "large-scale asset purchases" (LSAPs) by central bankers, the view of quantitative easing, or QE, as a tool to add monetary policy accommodation and QT to tighten policy has changed over time. When it was used during and after the Global Financial Crisis, QE was deemed an "unconventional" tool in central banks' arsenals. But QE has now been used numerous times in the past two decades for extended periods when the policy rate was at the effective lower bound, so I would say it is no longer unconventional.</p>
<p>Given the role of QE and QT in the policy toolkit, it is good to have researchers and policymakers examine how asset purchases work and talk about current issues associated with their implementation. This paper is very timely and thorough in looking across countries and their experiences with QE and QT. There is a lot packed into this work that makes it a little difficult to fully assess in the time we have today. So I will focus my comments on four points: (1) the evidence that the effects of QE are asymmetric to the effects of QT; (2) the execution of QE versus the execution of QT in the United States; (3) the role of announcement effects of QT; and, finally, (4) who has taken the Fed's place in buying assets when we withdraw from the market. I will then end with some thoughts about issues facing the Federal Reserve as we move forward with normalizing our balance sheet.</p>
<p><strong>The Asymmetry of Quantitative Easing versus Quantitative Tightening</strong><br />For me, one of the most interesting results of the paper is that the announcement effects of quantitative easing are much larger than the announcement effects of quantitative tightening. The authors find that announcements of QT have a small but statistically significant effect in increasing government bond yields&mdash;about 4 to 8 basis points. But this effect is much smaller, in absolute terms, than the prevailing estimates of the decrease in yields from announcements of QE. The conclusion is that the interest rate effects of QE and QT are asymmetric. For an economist, this result may seem puzzling&mdash;why would changing the sign on an action lead to asymmetric effects on prices and real variables?</p>
<p>Ever since central banks initiated QE in response to the Global Financial Crisis, academics have debated its effectiveness. One view is that it has a very limited effect in situations where a central bank is swapping zero interest-bearing reserves for zero interest-bearing shorter-term Treasury securities. Because the two assets would seem to be nearly perfect substitutes, there can be no price effects from altering the composition of the two assets. The central bank is simply swapping two $10 bills for a twenty. If this is true, then undoing the trade via QT has no effect either. It should be symmetrical.</p>
<p>The alternative view, based on market segmentation or preferred habitat theory, is that when a central bank uses reserves to pay for government securities, it is decreasing the supply of these securities to private investors, which will bid up the price and lower the interest rate on government securities.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240301a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;By lowering interest rates on longer-maturity assets, which pay a higher interest rate than reserves, the central bank can stimulate the economy in a manner similar to lowering the policy rate. But by this logic, when QT reverses QE, asset prices should fall and yields should rise in equal magnitude. Thus, any positive effects derived from QE would be reversed when QT occurs. This suggests that QE and QT may cancel each other out in welfare terms. But if there are no net benefits from the action, what is the point of doing it? To illustrate this point, suppose someone is given a weight-loss drug and they lose 80 pounds, but then the drug is taken away and they regain the 80 pounds. What was the point of the exercise if there was no net welfare gain?</p>
<p>To me, for QE to be beneficial on net, there&nbsp;<em>has</em>&nbsp;to be asymmetry in the effects of QE relative to QT. My thinking on this has long been guided by the conclusions of a paper I wrote with Alex Berentsen about optimal stabilization policy, which is what QE and QT ultimately should be about.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240301a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;The gist of the argument is that when shocks and frictions to trading arise suddenly, the central bank can take actions such as injecting reserves to ease trading frictions or credit constraints and improve welfare. But by waiting until the frictions and shocks dissipate before undoing the injections, the positive effects are not reversed. As an example, when a house is on fire, pouring water on the fire will put it out, which has great benefits for all. But when the fire is out, draining the water away does not reignite the fire&mdash;the initial benefits are not undone. The punchline here is that QE is conducted under different market conditions than those that occur when QT is done, so it is not surprising that the effects will be different. The authors' findings that QE has asymmetric effects compared to QT is not a puzzle but an indication that central banks timed QE and QT in the right manner such that society was better off.</p>
<p><strong>The Execution of Quantitative Easing versus Quantitative Tightening</strong><br />Turning to the impact of QE and QT on interest rates, analysis often focuses on the term premium. There are three key elements of asset purchases that change the term premium: (1) the expected path of QE, which includes the amount and timing of purchases; (2) the length of time the central bank is expected to hold the additional securities; and (3) the expected path of QT, including the amount and timing of redemptions, which importantly depends on the desired ultimate size of securities holdings (and reserve balances) of the central bank. As soon as an asset purchase program is announced, these expectations are formed, resulting in the term premium effect, or TPE, on interest rates.</p>
<p>Over time, the TPE will change, based on both the passage of time and any updates to the public's expectations for the components I just mentioned. Let me talk about three factors that affect both the expected path of asset purchases and interest rates. These factors are things to keep in mind for future policy decisions.</p>
<p>First, there are two ways that QE can be implemented, and they have different impacts on interest rates. These are what I call&nbsp;<em>closed</em>- or&nbsp;<em>open-ended</em>&nbsp;QE programs. Closed-ended QE programs involve an announcement of a fixed stock of purchases over a fixed period of time. An example of this type of asset purchase program was initiated by the Fed in March 2009.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240301a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;Open-ended QE simply gives a purchase amount per month but no calendar endpoint, so the expected size of the program is unspecified. A set of economic conditions for reducing or ending purchases may be stipulated, but when they will occur is not perfectly predictable. Here, one can think of the Fed's most recent asset purchase program.</p>
<p>At the time of an asset purchase announcement, it will be easier for markets to fully price in a closed-ended program, since its purchase amount and end date are given, whereas the open-ended program's pricing will depend on market expectations for the evolution of the economy. So if one wants a particular impact on interest rates at the announcement date, one might lean toward a closed-ended program or be aware that additional guidance on the expected path of the open-ended program will be needed.</p>
<p>As time passes and the economy evolves, the two programs work differently. One might prefer an open-ended program over time because it dynamically responds to the evolution of economic conditions. The program could be halted or extended as conditions improve or worsen, unlike a closed-ended program. But, of course, the criteria set in the open-ended program must be carefully considered. As I said in a recent FEDS Note and in several speeches, the 2020 criteria for when to begin QT may have been too restrictive and did not allow the Committee to taper as soon and as gradually as desired.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240301a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;Setting the appropriate criteria ahead of time to create the flexibility needed to respond to changing economic and financial conditions is very hard to do.</p>
<p>The second factor affecting the path of asset purchases is that it is very important that QE be credibly followed by QT. If QE is viewed as nothing more than a permanent injection of money into the economy, it would likely create inflation. This was widely predicted back in 2009, but the inflation didn't happen. Why? In my view, it didn't happen because the Fed credibly committed to withdrawing the injected reserves at a later date. Pre-committing to QT is what allows the injection of reserves into the economy without inflation or other longer-run distortions of market pricing. So when starting asset purchases or weighing how to approach asset runoff or sales, it is important that the central bank commit to normalizing its balance sheet.</p>
<p>The third factor is that it is important for a central bank to move carefully as it comes to the end of QT and the desired level of ample reserves. The endpoint should be related to the expectation of the banking system's demand for reserves. In the United States, we saw stresses in money markets in the fall of 2019, when the Fed reduced the level of reserves during balance sheet normalization through July and then there was heavy issuance of Treasury securities in September. The level of reserves likely went a bit too low.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240301a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;Learning from our experiences and trying to understand how the demand for reserves has changed over time suggests moving carefully toward the endpoint of QT.</p>
<p>For this reason, even if QE is an open-ended program, QT is more likely to resemble a closed-ended program. Central banks usually have an idea of how large they want their balance sheet to be when QT ends; therefore, once the pace of QT is announced, markets should be able to effectively price in the entire program at the announcement of the plan. After that, the actual execution of QT is simply validating the beliefs that market participants had at the announcement. This is why many refer to QT as merely draining unneeded reserves, which should be as interesting as watching paint dry.</p>
<p><strong>Quantitative Tightening in the United States</strong><br />Let me now turn more directly to the authors' paper and two of their findings. First, as I mentioned earlier, they find central banks' QT announcements have only a small effect on interest rates. To conduct this analysis, the authors do an event study around QT announcements, which requires them to identify "surprises" in the QT announcements. As the authors acknowledge, this is not a trivial exercise. My comment here is to point out why identifying a QT announcement surprise is challenging when considering examples in the United States.</p>
<p>Let me walk through the evolution of the Fed's QT communications in the spring of 2022 to consider how various communications affected the expected path of QT.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240301a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;Recall that QE ended in March 2022.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240301a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a>&nbsp;Heading into April, it was likely that markets expected a redemption path somewhat like the Fed's 2017&ndash;2019 QT plan.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240301a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;That plan phased in redemptions over 12 months and ultimately allowed, at most, $30 billion of Treasury securities and $20 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) to be redeemed each month. On April 5, 2022, then-Vice Chair Lael Brainard gave a speech that noted the balance sheet would shrink considerably more rapidly than in the previous case of QT; specifically, she said that "significantly larger caps and a much shorter period to phase in the maximum caps compared with 2017&ndash;2019."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240301a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a>&nbsp;The next day, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes provided additional information on the expected maximum monthly caps and phase-in period, saying participants generally agreed to a three-month phase-in and caps of $60 billion and $35 billion for Treasury securities and agency MBS, respectively.</p>
<p>Over those two days in April, the markets likely updated their expected QT plans to have sooner and larger redemptions. This change would be associated with a less negative term premium effect, meaning a rise in Treasury yields. The 10-year Treasury yield rose 19 basis points over the two days of the Vice Chair's speech and the FOMC minutes&mdash;that is, 12 basis points on the day of her speech and another 7 basis points on the day of the FOMC minutes&mdash;and a total of 37 basis points over that week.</p>
<p>About a month later, on May 4, 2022, the FOMC communicated its "Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet." The plan was consistent with the FOMC minutes from April, and there was little change in the 10-year Treasury yield that day and week (negative 4 basis points on the day of the announcement and 2 basis points over the five-day period). So, when doing event studies, it may be difficult to estimate the full impact of QT announcements by simply looking at the formal announcement of the QT plan.</p>
<p>Let me turn to a second point of the paper, about which types of investors have increased their securities holdings as the Fed has reduced its holdings. When a central bank steps away from asset purchases and begins to shrink its balance sheet, a common question is, who will step in and take the central bank's place in buying securities? I always respond by saying, "Why is this important?" If the government bond market is broad and deep, there will be plenty of buyers&mdash;there is no need to worry about who will buy the government debt. If the government bond market is not broad or deep, however, then the central bank's actions can have adverse and unwanted effects on prices and market functioning. This would then affect how fast the central bank can reduce its balance sheet and whether it can do so passively or actively.</p>
<p>One could also argue that it matters because knowing the buyers helps one understand the transmission of QT to asset prices and interest rates. Does it matter if it is banks or nonbank financial firms that are doing the buying? Does it matter if it is hedge funds, pension funds, or actual households doing the buying? One needs to have a better understanding of why the question is being asked before one can fully understand the answers to the question.</p>
<p>The authors focus on the reduction in aggregate securities holdings of central banks and find that households and broker-dealers are the main investors absorbing the redeemed securities. For my discussion today, I decided to dig a bit deeper into the Financial Accounts of the United States in two ways. First, I decided to look at each type of security (Treasury securities and agency MBS) individually.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240301a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a>&nbsp;For Treasury securities, I also find that since the 2022 start of QT, households have boosted their market share the most, and broker-dealers have also increased their share. For agency MBS, not only has the market shares of those two investor types increased, but so has the market shares of money market funds.</p>
<p>Second, I dug into the household category a bit more. As currently categorized, the Financial Accounts household category includes hedge funds. The Federal Reserve Board is working to segregate hedge funds in this data set. In the interim, the Board publishes separate data on the balance sheets of domestic hedge funds.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240301a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a>&nbsp;Using this supplemental data, I find that it is not the hedge funds that are responsible for the increase in household market share. This means the increase is driven by the other household investors: actual households and nonprofit organizations.</p>
<p>What do I make of this finding? My interpretation is that it reinforces the view that the demand for U.S. Treasury securities is broad and deep&mdash;the buyers are not a narrow set of deep-pocketed, sophisticated investors but rather the American public. As a result, the pace of runoff is not a problem. As we have seen with the current phase of QT, runoff up to $95 billion a month is not causing substantial strains in financial markets&mdash;something that a few years ago would have surprised a lot of people, given the worries about QT that were common prior to 2022.</p>
<p><strong>Normalization</strong><br />Let me conclude with a few comments on where I believe the Fed should be heading as it continues to normalize its balance sheet. By "normalizing" I mean reducing the size of the balance sheet but retaining enough assets to manage monetary policy using an ample-reserves regime.</p>
<p>As the Federal Reserve continues its QT program, I support further thinking about how many more securities to redeem. We have an overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility with take-up of more than $500 billion, and I view these funds as excess liquidity that financial market participants do not want, so this tells me that we can continue to reduce our holdings for some time.</p>
<p>In addition, it is important to remember that we now have a standing repurchase agreement facility (SRF). The SRF serves as a backstop in money markets, since it takes in Treasury securities as well as agency MBS and puts reserves in the banking system. This facility may allow banks to lower the level of reserves below what reserves would be without the facility, and it may provide a signal for when reserves are getting close to ample.</p>
<p>Chair Powell has noted that the FOMC will begin to discuss slowing our redemptions at our FOMC meeting this month, which will help us transition into whatever definition of "ample" we deem appropriate. Changing our pace of redemptions will occur when the Committee makes a decision to do so, and the timing will be independent of any changes to the policy rate target. Balance sheet plans are about getting liquidity levels right and approaching "ample" at the correct speed. They do not imply anything about the stance of interest rate policy, which is focused on influencing the macroeconomy and achieving our dual mandate.</p>
<p>Thinking about longer-term issues related to the Fed's portfolio, I want to mention two things. First, I would like to see the Fed's agency MBS holdings go to zero. Agency MBS holdings have been slow to run off the portfolio, at a recent monthly average of about $15 billion, because the underlying mortgages have very low interest rates and prepayments are quite small. I believe it is important to see a continued reduction in these holdings.</p>
<p>Second, I would like to see a shift in Treasury holdings toward a larger share of shorter-dated Treasury securities. Prior to the Global Financial Crisis, we held approximately one-third of our portfolio in Treasury bills.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240301a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a>&nbsp;Today, bills are less than 5 percent of our Treasury holdings and less than 3 percent of our total securities holdings. Moving toward more Treasury bills would shift the maturity structure more toward our policy rate&mdash;the overnight federal funds rate&mdash;and allow our income and expenses to rise and fall together as the FOMC increases and cuts the target range. This approach could also assist a future asset purchase program because we could let the short-term securities roll off the portfolio and not increase the balance sheet.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240301a.htm#fn14" title="footnote 14"><span>14</span></a><a name="f14"></a>&nbsp;This is an issue the FOMC will need to decide in the next couple of years.</p>
<p>In conclusion, let me be clear that this is a great paper that will serve as a major reference for researchers and central banks. The authors' analysis will surely have a much longer shelf life than my discussion of it.</p>
<hr align="left" size="1" width="33%" />
<p><a name="fn1"></a>1. The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn2"></a>2. There are several theories for how QE works. The market segmentation theory suggests that assets of different maturities are imperfect substitutes, so a lower supply of long-term assets and a higher supply of short-term assets would imply that long-term interest rates fall and short-term interest rates rise. The preferred habitat theory suggests that financial market participants prefer certain asset maturities over others and the price (or interest) rate needs to adjust to change their desired mix of holdings.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn3"></a>3. For details of the model and results, see Aleksander Berentsen and Christopher Waller (2011), "Price-Level Targeting and Stabilization Policy,"&nbsp;<em>Journal of Money, Credit and Banking,</em>&nbsp;vol. 43, Supplement 2 (October), pp. 559&ndash;80.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn4"></a>4. An example of a closed-ended program is from March 2009, when the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) noted that "to help improve conditions in private credit markets, the Committee decided to purchase up to $300 billion of longer-term Treasury securities over the next six months"; see paragraph 3 of the March 2009 FOMC statement, which is available on the Board's website at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm">https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm</a>. An example of an open-ended program is from December 2020, when the FOMC stated it would keep buying $120 billion per month in securities "until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee's maximum employment and price stability goals"; see paragraph 4 of the December 2020 FOMC statement, which is available on the Board's website at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm">https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="fn6"></a>6. For a discussion of the September 2019 experience, see Sriya Anbil, Alyssa Anderson, and Zeynep Senyuz (2020), "<a href="https://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.2527">What Happened in Money Markets in September 2019?</a>" FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, February 27).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn7"></a>7. Prior to the spring announcements, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) began discussions on policy normalization as reported in the December 2021 FOMC minutes. It was noted that some participants observed that the balance sheet could potentially shrink faster than the previous experience. The 10-year Treasury yield moved up several basis points around the release of the minutes.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn8"></a>8. In March 2022, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) indicated that it "expects to begin reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities at a coming meeting"; see paragraph 3 of the March 2022 FOMC statement, which is available on the Board's website at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm">https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm</a>. This language signaled the Fed would be holding the peak amount of securities on its balance sheet for just a short period of time, which turned out to be between March and the end of May.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn9"></a>9. In January 2022, the Federal Open Market Committee provided a statement on "Principles for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet," but it did not provide information about the timing or pace of redemptions; the statement is available on the Board's website at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20220126c.htm">https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20220126c.htm</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="fn11"></a>11. My calculations look at how investor types' market shares change over time, as is done in Seth Carpenter, Selva Demiralp, Jane Ihrig, and Elizabeth Klee (2015), "Analyzing Federal Reserve Asset Purchases: From Whom Does the Fed Buy?"&nbsp;<em>Journal of Banking and Finance,</em>&nbsp;vol. 52 (March), pp. 230&ndash;44.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="fn13"></a>13. A Treasury bill is a security backed by the U.S. Treasury Department with a maturity of up to 52 weeks. A bill is sold at a discount, and at maturity the investor receives the par value of the security.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn14"></a>14. There may be other considerations for holding a sizable share of bills in the Fed's portfolio. For example, Vissing-Jorgensen (2023) argues for considering the convenience yield impact of bills; see Annette Vissing-Jorgensen (2023), "Balance Sheet Policy above the ELB," paper presented at the ECB Forum on Central Banking, held in Sintra, Portugal, June 26&ndash;28.&nbsp;</p>

<div> SEC, HG Vora Capital Management, ownership disclosures, civil penalty, Ryder System Inc<br>
Summary: SEC fined HG Vora for late ownership disclosure before its bid for Ryder, violating securities laws, leading to significant stock price increase. <br><br> <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced settled charges against New York-based investment adviser HG Vora Capital Management LLC for its failure to make timely ownership disclosures in the lead-up to its May 2022 acquisition bid for trucking fleet company Ryder System Inc. HG Vora agreed to pay a $950,000 civil penalty to settle the SEC&rsquo;s charges.</p>
<p>Under the federal securities laws, a company that owns more than five percent of a public company&rsquo;s stock must report its position and whether it has a control purpose, which is an intention to influence or control the company. According to the SEC&rsquo;s order, on Feb. 14, 2022, HG Vora disclosed that it owned 5.6 percent of Ryder&rsquo;s common stock as of Dec. 31, 2021, and certified that it did not have a control purpose. The order states that HG Vora then built up its position to 9.9 percent of Ryder's stock and formed a control purpose no later than April 26, 2022. The federal securities laws therefore required it to report its control purpose and its current ownership position by May 6, 2022, but it did not report this information until May 13. On that same day, HG Vora sent a letter to Ryder proposing to buy all Ryder shares for $86 a share, a sizeable premium over the trading price. Before the letter to Ryder and its filing, and after forming a control purpose, HG Vora purchased swap agreements that gave it economic exposure to the equivalent of 450,000 more shares of Ryder common stock. After HG Vora&rsquo;s public announcement of its bid on May 13, 2022, Ryder&rsquo;s stock price increased significantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The federal laws and SEC rules covering ownership disclosure help keep investors fully informed about control &ndash; and potential changes in control &ndash; of publicly traded companies,&rdquo; said Mark Cave, Associate Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;But, according to today&rsquo;s order, HG Vora deprived Ryder shareholders of information about its significant stake in the company, while building a large swaps position from which it stood to profit after announcing the Ryder takeover bid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that HG Vora violated the beneficial ownership provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Without admitting or denying the findings, HG Vora agreed to cease and desist from future violations and to pay the civil penalty discussed above. On Oct. 10, 2023, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-219">SEC adopted rules</a>&nbsp;shortening the deadline for filing an initial Schedule 13D from 10 to five business days. HG Vora was found to have violated the rules in effect at the time of the conduct at issue in the SEC&rsquo;s order by filing this report more than 10 days after forming a control purpose.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Jonathan Cowen with assistance from Robert Nesbitt of the Office of Market Intelligence and Nicholas Panos from the Office of Mergers &amp; Acquisitions. The investigation was supervised by Assistant Director Jeffrey Weiss and Mr. Cave.</p>

<div> workshop, simulation results, transmission capacities, European integrated market, allocation process<br />
Summary: 
ACER and ENTSO-E are organizing an online workshop to present simulation results of long-term flow-based allocation process, introducing go-live timeline. <div>
<p><span>ACER and the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) are organising an online workshop to present the simulation results of the long-term flow-based allocation of transmission capacities.</span></p>
<p><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">When?</span></span></p>
<p><span>Friday, 22 March 2024, 09:00 &ndash; 12:00 CET</span></p>
<p><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is it about?</span></span></p>
<p><span>The long-term flow-based allocation of transmission capacities process will be used to manage and allocate the electricity transmission across the European integrated market on yearly and monthly timeframe in the Core and Nordic capacity calculation regions (CCRs). The process will enhance the efficiency of the transmission capacity allocation, thus providing hedging opportunities to market participants.</span></p>
<p><span>The Nordic CCR comprises&nbsp;4 countries: Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden.</span></p>
<p><span>The Core CCR consists of 13 countries: Austria, Belgium, Czechia, Croatia, France, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia and Romania.</span></p>
<p><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the key objectives?</span></span></p>
<p><span>This 6<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;workshop aims to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Present and discuss the simulation results.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span>Introduce the expected timeline for the go-live of the single allocation platform that will support the long-term flow-based capacity allocation process.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This workshop will provide stakeholders with an in-depth understanding of the long-term flow-based allocation process, as well as the go-live preparation of yearly and monthly flow-based auctions.</span></p>

Summary:<br />
Global economy at inflection point with synchronized monetary policy tightening. Disinflation on track but risks of re-emerging inflation and deeper-than-expected slowdown pose challenges for emerging markets. Banking supervision is crucial. <div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The global economy is at an inflection point, as the most synchronised and most significant monetary policy tightening in recent memory nears the end. Disinflation is largely on track, and there is a good chance of a soft, or softish, landing. But inflationary pressures may re-emerge. And the current slowdown in growth may still turn out to be deeper and more protracted than expected. If such risks materialise, capital flows to emerging market economies may retrench. Some, like those in sub-Saharan Africa, may be particularly vulnerable given their high levels of debt held by foreign bondholders and commercial banks. Policymakers will need to navigate these difficult waters, including by enhancing banking supervision.</span></p>

<div> Circular, reporting system, quantitative trading, regulation, market order
Summary:<br /> 
- SZSE implemented reporting system for quantitative trading
- Recognizes advantages and problems of quantitative trading
- Plans to strengthen regulatory arrangements
- Will increase communication with HKEX
- Will take self-regulatory measures and report violations to CSRC<br /> <div>
<p>On September 1, 2023, SZSE issued the Circular on Matters Relating to the Reporting of Stock Program Trading and the Circular on Matters Relating to Strengthening the Management of Program Trading with official effect from October 9, 2023, establishing the special reporting&nbsp;system&nbsp;and corresponding regulatory arrangements for quantitative trading. With joint efforts of all market participants, the above&nbsp;system&nbsp;has been smoothly implemented.&nbsp;The existing&nbsp;investors have completed the reporting on schedule as required, while&nbsp;new&nbsp;investors have carried out the provisions of &ldquo;reporting before trading&rdquo; and their reporting quality has generally met the requirements, laying the foundation for further strengthening and improving the regulation of quantitative trading. SZSE will, based on the reported information, continue to intensify the monitoring and analysis of quantitative trading, especially high-frequency trading and dynamically evaluate and improve the reporting&nbsp;system.</p>
<p>With the wide application of new information technologies, quantitative trading has recently become an important way of trading. It helps provide liquidity to the market and facilitates price discovery.&nbsp;Compared with&nbsp;small and medium-sized investors, quantitative trading, especially high-frequency trading, has obvious advantages in technology, information and speed, but at some time points, also shows problems such as strategy convergence, trading resonance and increase in market volatility. From the perspective of international experience, overseas markets generally implement the stricter regulation on quantitative trading, especially high-frequency trading, to prevent negative impact on market order. In the next step, SZSE will adhere to the investor-oriented approach, take the maintenance of fairness as the starting point and goal of its work, learn from international regulatory practices, seek advantages and avoid disadvantages. SZSE will establish sound regulatory arrangements for quantitative trading, including strict implementation of the reporting&nbsp;system&nbsp;and clear access arrangements of &ldquo;reporting before trading&rdquo;; strengthen the authorization management of market&nbsp;data for&nbsp;quantitative trading and perfect the differentiated charging mechanism; improve monitoring standards for abnormal trading and reinforce the regulation on abnormal trading and abnormal order reporting and withdrawal; strengthen the monitoring and regulation of leverage-type quantitative products and the joint regulation of futures and spot goods. Meanwhile, SZSE will further clarify customer management responsibilities of securities companies, perfect the self-regulatory management cooperation mechanism with the Securities Association of China and the Asset Management Association of China and intensify the regulation on trading of quantitative&nbsp;and&nbsp;private institutions. In addition, SZSE will increase communication with HKEX and under the principle of equal treatment for domestic and foreign capital, clarify reporting arrangements for&nbsp;northbound&nbsp;investors under the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect and include quantitative trading by&nbsp;northbound&nbsp;investors in the reporting scope. SZSE will resolutely take self-regulatory measures against abnormal trading that affects the market order and report those suspected of violating laws and regulations and having serious circumstances to the CSRC for investigation and punishment.</p>

<title>Shenzhen Stock Exchange Restricts Ningbo Lingjun’s Trading And Initiates A Public Censure Procedure Against It</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>On February 19, during trading monitoring,&nbsp;SZSE discovered that from 9:30:00 to 9:30:42, multiple securities accounts of Ningbo Lingjun Investment Management Partnership (Limited Partnership) (&ldquo;Ningbo Lingjun&rdquo;) automatically generated trading instructions through computer programs and placed large quantities of orders in a short time. Stocks amounting to CNY 1.372 billion were sold through such accounts&nbsp;and&nbsp;the Shenzhen Component Index fell rapidly&nbsp;during&nbsp;that&nbsp;period, affecting the normal trading order. This constituted an abnormal trading activity specified in Item 6 of Article 6.2 of the Trading Rules of Shenzhen Stock Exchange. The securities accounts of Ningbo Lingjun continued abnormal trading activities though they have been repeatedly subject to regulatory measures such as written warning by SZSE for such activities since this year.</p>
<p>According to the Implementing Rules for Restricted&nbsp;Trading, the Implementing Measures for Self-disciplinary Supervision and Disciplinary Measures and other relevant provisions of SZSE, we decided to take trading restriction measures against the relevant securities accounts of Ningbo Lingjun from February 20, 2024 to February 22, 2024, during which period&nbsp;Ningbo Lingjun is restricted from trading in all stocks listed and traded on SZSE. In addition,&nbsp;we&nbsp;initiated the disciplinary sanction procedures for public censure against Ningbo Lingjun.</p>
<p>SZSE will, in accordance with the unified arrangement of the CSRC, resolutely implement the requirements of strict and tough regulation, adhere to the primary responsibility for regulation and treat regulation as its primary business and constantly strengthen trading regulation. Moreover, SZSE will always maintain a strict tone and a tough stance of &ldquo;zero tolerance&rdquo; for, quickly respond to and crack down on&nbsp;the&nbsp;illegalities and violations that affect the normal order of the market and damage the legitimate rights and interests of investors. At the same time, SZSE reminds investors to participate in trading in accordance with laws and regulations to jointly maintain the normal trading order of the market.</p>

<p>The National Anti-Scam Centre is warning consumers to beware of fake news articles and deepfake videos of public figures that endorse and link to online investment trading platform scams, particularly on social media.</p>
<p>Last year, Australians reported losing more than $8 million to online investment trading platform scams, with 400 reports made to Scamwatch.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are urging Australians to take their time and do their research before taking up an investment opportunity &ndash; particularly those seen on social media,&rsquo; ACCC Deputy Chair Catriona Lowe said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Scammers are creating fake news articles and deepfake videos to convince people that celebrities and well-known public figures are making huge sums of money using online investment trading platforms, when in fact it is a scam.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;These fake videos and news articles circulating on social media and video sharing platforms, often claim that the online trading platform uses artificial intelligence or other emerging technologies such as quantum computing to generate high returns for investors, but it is not true,&rsquo; Ms Lowe said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We know of an Australian man who lost $80,000 in cryptocurrency after seeing a deepfake Elon Musk video interview on social media, clicking the link and registering his details through an online form. He was provided with an account manager and an online dashboard where he could see his investment supposedly making huge returns. But when he tried to withdraw the money &ndash; he was locked out of his account.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Reports to Scamwatch indicate the most prolific online investment trading platform scam appears under the brand &lsquo;Quantum AI&rsquo;. Others include &lsquo;Immediate Edge&rsquo;, &lsquo;Immediate Connect&rsquo;, &lsquo;Immediate X3&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Quantum Trade Wave&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The National Anti-Scam Centre&rsquo;s investment scam fusion cell, co-led by the ACCC and ASIC, has been active in disrupting investment scams such as online investment trading platform scams.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In addition to referring these scam ads to social media platforms for removal, the fusion cell has developed a trial method for blocking payments to these scams,&rsquo; Ms Lowe said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It has been encouraging to see an overall downward trend in losses reported to Scamwatch to investment scams since the establishment of the fusion cell in July 2023.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The ACCC and ASIC will continue to work together as part of the National Anti-Scam Centre's efforts to stop scammers from harming Australians.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>How online investment trading platform scams work</h2>
<ul>
<li>Scammers entice victims through social media advertisements, deepfake videos on video sharing platforms and fake online news articles about celebrities and well-known public figures claiming to make substantial money from online trading platforms.</li>
<li>This fake click bait will link to a scam website where victims are prompted to enter their details. This is the gateway for communication between the scammer and victim.</li>
<li>Scammers ask for a small investment of around $250 via credit card to provide access to the trading platform.</li>
<li>Scammers will often ask the new investor to download a third-party trading platform via the relevant app store or provide the investor with login details for an online dashboard.</li>
<li>After showing profits through a dedicated online dashboard, scammers persuade their victims to invest more. Sometimes scammers will allow victims to make a small withdrawal early in the scam to build trust.</li>
<li>When the victim eventually tries to withdraw their funds, scammers will ask for withdrawal fees or cite tax implications to obtain more money. Some victims have reported being locked out of their account.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Protect yourself</h3>
<p><span>STOP</span>&nbsp;&ndash; Don&rsquo;t give personal information or act on investment advice you have come across on social media. Don&rsquo;t feel pressured to invest. If you have any doubts, stop communicating with them.</p>
<p><span>THINK</span>&nbsp;&ndash; Ask yourself if you really know what you are investing in? Scammers can create fake news to make it seem legitimate. Do an internet search to see if there are warnings about this investment trading platform scam, including if the well-known public figure has warned about being impersonated.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>PROTECT</span>&nbsp;&ndash; Act quickly if something feels wrong. If you have shared financial information or transferred money, contact your bank immediately. Help others by reporting scams to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.scamwatch.gov.au/report-a-scam">Scamwatch</a>.</p>
<h3>Investor information</h3>
<p>Before investing, Australians can make these simple practical checks to help reduce the risk of investment scams:</p>
<ul>
<li>check ASIC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://moneysmart.gov.au/check-and-report-scams/investor-alert-list">investor alert list</a>&nbsp;to help keep you informed about investments that could be fraudulent, a scam or unlicensed.</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>On February 8, SZSE formulated and issued the&nbsp;<i>Self-Regulatory Guidelines No.17 for Companies Listed&nbsp;</i><i>on&nbsp;</i>Shenzhen Stock Exchange<i>&nbsp;- Sustainable Development Report (for Trial Implementation) (</i><i>E</i><i>xposure</i><i>&nbsp;</i><i>Draft)</i>&nbsp;(hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;<i>Guidelines for Sustainable Development Report</i>&rdquo;) to solicit comments from the market. This is an important measure for SZSE to implement the&nbsp;guiding principles&nbsp;of the 20th CPC National Congress, the Central Economic Work Conference and the Central Financial Work Conference and fully, accurately and comprehensively carry out the new development concept. With this measure, SZSE&nbsp;aims to&nbsp;standardize the disclosure requirements for sustainable development information of listed companies, instruct listed companies to practice the concept of sustainable development and promote the improvement of the quality of listed companies.&nbsp;This&nbsp;helps give full play to the hub function of the capital market, guides the gathering of factors in the field of sustainable development, further builds industrial clusters with sustainable investment value and facilitates the realization of the strategic goals of &ldquo;carbon peaking and carbon neutrality&rdquo;. It also drives the enhancement of governance ability, competitiveness, innovation ability, anti-risk ability, medium and long-term sustainable development ability and long-term stable return ability of listed companies, enhances listed companies&rsquo; attraction to long-term capital and further consolidates the foundation for the high-quality development of listed companies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;According to the report to the 20th CPC National Congress, driving low-carbon economic and social development is the key link in achieving high-quality development, which is the primary task for comprehensively building a modern socialist country. The Central Economic Work Conference proposed to actively yet prudently promote carbon peaking and carbon neutrality and accelerate the creation of a low-carbon supply chain. The Central Financial Work Conference pointed out the effective implementation of five major tasks including green finance. In the&nbsp;<i>Three-year Action Plan for Promoting the Improvement of Quality of Listed Companies (2022-2025)</i>, CSRC requires the establishment of a sound disclosure system for sustainable development information,&nbsp;the&nbsp;formulation of a system of disclosure rules for sustainable development information of listed companies&nbsp;that is&nbsp;based on China&rsquo;s actual situation, in line with international trends and with Chinese characteristics,&nbsp;the&nbsp;definition of the implementation path and&nbsp;the&nbsp;gradual promotion as planned in stages. The aim is to better play the role of finance in serving national strategies, supporting high-quality development and practicing social responsibilities and further optimize resource allocation.</p>
<p>Under the guidance of CSRC, SZSE has steadily advanced the drafting of the&nbsp;<i>Guidelines for Sustainable Development Report</i>&nbsp;with the overall thinking of three aspects.&nbsp;Firstly, being practical and realistic.&nbsp;After fully considering the development stage and disclosure ability of listed companies in China, SZSE achieves the matching of cost and benefit through the combination of mandatory and voluntary disclosure, combination of qualitative and quantitative disclosure, setting of transitional period and mitigation measures.&nbsp;Secondly,&nbsp;upholding&nbsp;systematic thinking.&nbsp;SZSE helps listed companies build a sound governance mechanism related to sustainable development, establishes a disclosure framework with &ldquo;governance - strategy - impact, risk and opportunity management - indicators and objectives&rdquo; as&nbsp;the&nbsp;core elements and drives high-quality information disclosure with better internal governance and concrete actions.&nbsp;Thirdly, learning from good practices and reflecting Chinese characteristics.&nbsp;SZSE summarizes the current domestic and foreign disclosure systems and excellent practices, refers to national standards and industry norms and actively absorbs international beneficial experience. Based on the actual situation of China&rsquo;s capital market, SZSE sets specific topics such as rural revitalization and innovation-driven concept to fully reflect the characteristics and advantages of China&rsquo;s listed companies in the field of sustainable development.</p>
<p>Following the above drafting ideas, the&nbsp;<i>Guidelines for Sustainable Development Report</i>&nbsp;consists&nbsp;of 58 articles in 6 chapters covering 20 specific topics, further enriching&nbsp;and improving&nbsp;the information disclosure requirements related to sustainable development on the basis of the existing rules. It specifies that listed companies shall analyze and disclose the topics to be disclosed around four core&nbsp;aspects, namely, governance, strategy, impact&nbsp;-&nbsp;risk&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;opportunity management,&nbsp;and indicators&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;objectives, so that investors and stakeholders can fully understand the actions taken by listed companies to cope with and manage impacts, risks and opportunities related to sustainable development. Meanwhile, it sets multiple topics including carbon emissions, pollutants, ecosystem and biodiversity, circular economy utilization, rural revitalization and supply chain security in such aspects as environment, society and corporate governance. In terms of implementation method, it clarifies that&nbsp;the&nbsp;constituents continuously included in the Shenzhen 100 Index and the ChiNext Index during the reporting period and&nbsp;the&nbsp;companies listed&nbsp;simultaneously&nbsp;at home and abroad shall disclose the&nbsp;<i>Sustainable Development Report</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;that&nbsp;other listed companies are encouraged to make disclosure voluntarily. It also defines that&nbsp;listed companies shall disclose the information related to some important topics through qualitative and quantitative methods, so as to facilitate horizontal and vertical comparison by investors and stakeholders. Meanwhile, it sets mitigation measures for quantitative disclosure requirements&nbsp;including that listed companies can make qualitative disclosure and explain the reasons for the indicators that are more difficult to disclose quantitatively in the first reporting period. In terms of transitional arrangements and other mitigation measures, in order to help listed companies build capacity and prepare for implementation in advance, listed companies that are required to disclose the&nbsp;<i>Sustainable Development Report</i>&nbsp;can disclose the 2025&nbsp;<i>Sustainable Development Report</i>&nbsp;for the first time before April 30, 2026 at the latest. If it is difficult to quantitatively disclose the impact of sustainable development-related risks and opportunities on the current financial position during the reporting periods of 2025 and 2026, it can be only disclosed qualitatively.</p>
<p>SZSE has always adhered to the concept of sustainable development, actively carried out practices related to sustainable development, instructed listed companies to actively fulfill their social responsibilities and&nbsp;has&nbsp;been committed to building a group of listed companies that meet the requirements of low-carbon sustainable development. SZSE has successively issued the&nbsp;<i>White Paper on Environmental Information Disclosure of SZSE-listed Companies</i>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<i>White Paper on Sustainable Development Information Disclosure of SZSE-listed Companies.</i>&nbsp;These help guide&nbsp;listed companies to strengthen their awareness of sustainable development information disclosure and actively practice the concept of sustainable development by sharing the practices and excellent cases of sustainable development information disclosure of SZSE-listed companies. In 2022, more than 2,700 SZSE-listed companies disclosed their social responsibility performance in their annual reports; more than 1,100 ones disclosed information on pollution prevention, resource conservation and ecological protection; and more than 800 ones released independent social responsibility reports or ESG reports, further improving the quality of ESG information disclosure.&nbsp;According to the statistics of the United Nations on total carbon emissions of companies listed on stock exchanges of G20 countries, SZSE-listed companies ranked first in low carbon with the lowest total carbon emissions.</p>
<p>Next, SZSE will, in accordance with the unified deployments of CSRC, continue to listen to the opinions and suggestions of market participants through multiple means, fully study and absorb reasonable opinions and suggestions and timely release them to the market for implementation. SZSE will constantly improve the system of sustainable development rules, cultivate leading companies in the field of sustainable development, enrich the system of sustainable development products, optimize the system of sustainable development services, strive to build a benchmark for sustainable exchanges and help create a low-carbon and sustainable market ecology.</p>
