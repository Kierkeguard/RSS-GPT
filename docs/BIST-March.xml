<div> Vienna Stock Exchange, Austrian indices, free float factor, index calculation, review
Summary:<br />Vienna Stock Exchange reviews Austrian indices, changes free float factors, indexes based on quantitative methodology, rules for composition and calculation parameters.<br /> <div>
<p>The review of the Austrian indices by the Vienna Stock Exchange results in changes to the calculation factors, while the composition of the national index ATX remains unchanged. The free float factors of Raiffeisen Bank International AG (0.5 to 0.4), RHI Magnesita N.V. (0.7 to 0.5) and Warimpex Finanz- und Beteiligungs AG (0.6 to 0.5) will all decrease, that of AUSTRIACARD HOLDINGS AG will increase from 0.2 to 0.3. The free float factor expresses how many of a company's shares&nbsp;circulate among the public and influences how strongly a share is weighted in the index. The above changes will take effect on 18 March 2024. The next scheduled review of the composition of Austrian indices will take place on 3 September 2024; the free float factors will be reviewed again on 4 June 2024.</p>
<p>The index calculation is based on a purely quantitative methodology that is defined in a set of rules. In accordance with the "The Rules for the Austrian Indices of the Vienna Stock Exchange ", the Vienna Stock Exchange can add or remove companies after the half-yearly review (March and September). The daily average turnover and the free float capitalisation of the companies are used as the basis for the decision. The calculation parameters (number of shares, free float factors and representation factors) are reviewed on a quarterly basis (March, June, September and December). The Vienna Stock Exchange publishes the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wienerborse.at/en/indices/index-changes/atx-watchlist/?_gl=1*jgb5q*_up*MQ..*_ga*Mzg3MzYyNjMxLjE3MDk2MzM1MTE.*_ga_V1WTDN429Y*MTcwOTYzMzUxMC4xLjAuMTcwOTYzMzUxMC4wLjAuMA.." target="_blank">"ATX watchlist"</a>&nbsp;once a month. Institutional investors, trading members, issuers of financial products, academics and the Vienna Stock Exchange contribute their experience to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wienerborse.at/en/indices/index-changes/list-of-atx-committee-members/" target="_blank">Index Committee</a>, which decides on the rules and regulations for the indices.</p>

<title>Remarks To The Council Of Institutional Investors – Dangers Of The Unbounded Administrative State, SEC Commissioner Mark T. Uyeda, Washington D.C., March 5, 2024</title>

<div> Private Fund Advisers, Dealer Definition, Cryptocurrencies, Investment Contract Test, Section 211(h)<br />
In a speech, a Commissioner discusses concerns about SEC's jurisdiction over private funds, dealer definition, cryptocurrencies, and investment contracts.<br /><br />Summary: The Commissioner discusses concerns regarding SEC's jurisdiction over private funds, dealer definition, cryptocurrencies, and investment contracts. <div>
<p>Thank you for the invitation to address the Council of Institutional Investors, whose members are responsible for combined assets under management of nearly $5 trillion.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-cii-030524#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;They include pension plans obligated to act prudently when investing the savings of millions of workers and their families to provide retirement benefits. Council members include state and local government pension plans, which are important to secure the retirement promise made to individuals who have provided a lifetime of public service. It is a promise that I am quite familiar with. As a former California state securities regulator, I am a member of the California Public Employees&rsquo; Retirement System (CalPERS). I am also the son of a retired community college instructor, whose retirement has been made possible by the California State Teachers Retirement System (CalSTRS).</p>
<p>When one compares the investment holdings of CalPERS or CalSTRS to the holdings of the Federal Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) or a target date fund in a 401(k) plan, one will notice a significant difference: defined benefit plans often have an allocation to private funds while the others do not. There may be reasons for investing in private funds, such the potential for higher risk-adjusted returns, increased diversification, and the ability to better match anticipated cash outflows from the plan. However, for the average worker who invests through a 401(k) plan or an individual retirement account, it is nearly impossible to obtain exposures to a diversified portfolio comparable to CalPERS and CalSTRS even if he or she does not expect to retire for 30 years or more. As returns in the public markets become more closely correlated, regulators should be thinking about whether investors might be better served with more opportunities to diversify &ndash; such as exposures similar to those held by pension funds.</p>
<p>Private Fund Adviser Rules</p>
<p>Recently, the Commission has finalized several rules impacting private funds and their advisers, which will impact pension plans and other institutional investors.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-cii-030524#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;One significant rulemaking was an integrated package of reforms for private fund advisers (the &ldquo;Private Funds Rules&rdquo;), that included quarterly fund statements, mandatory fund audits, procedures for adviser-led secondaries, restrictions on certain activities, and prohibitions on certain preferential treatment.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-cii-030524#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;The Council supported the rules&rsquo; provisions on fee and expense disclosure as well as performance disclosure.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-cii-030524#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;More recently, the Council joined an amicus brief in support of the final rules, expressing the view that they would address harms resulting from the imbalance of power between advisers and institutional investors and the information asymmetry around the conflicts that can result.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-cii-030524#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p>While I understand that the Council might be pleased with the results of the rulemaking, some caution about the Commission&rsquo;s statutory authority to promulgate such rules may be in order. The Commission relies on an expansive view of Section 211(h)(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (&ldquo;Advisers Act&rdquo;). This provision was added by paragraph (g) of Section 913 of the Dodd-Frank Act under the heading of &ldquo;authority to establish a fiduciary duty for brokers and dealers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Section 913(g) contained parallel provisions amending both the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (&ldquo;Exchange Act&rdquo;) and the Advisers Act to authorize the Commission to impose a fiduciary standard of care for brokers, dealers, and investment advisers. Section 913(g) also included parallel provisions, codified in Section 15(l) of the Exchange Act and Section 211(h) of the Advisers Act, directing the Commission to &ldquo;examine and, where appropriate, promulgate rules prohibiting or restricting certain sales practices, conflicts of interest, and compensation schemes for brokers, dealers, and investment advisers that the Commission deems contrary to the public interest and the protection of investors.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-cii-030524#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p>By ignoring the context provided by Section 913, the Commission&rsquo;s broad reading represents a significant jurisdictional extension. Section 913 does not mention private funds, but focuses on brokers, dealers, and investment advisers. It does not make sense that Congress would use Section 913, which was part of Title IX of the Dodd-Frank Act, to regulate private fund advisers when Congress specifically addressed them in Title IV of the Dodd-Frank Act. Should we believe that Congress omitted any authorization to regulate private funds in this manner in Title IV, but included an obscure authorization in Section 913(g)?</p>
<p>Over-reaching assertions of government jurisdiction is a problem for all market participants. When contemplating the administrative state, persons should be concerned if there is no practical limiting principle on the scope of an agency&rsquo;s authority and the dangers associated with that method of governance.</p>
<p>Section 211(h) has three important components: (1) sales practices, conflicts of interest and compensation schemes; (2) investors; and (3) brokers, dealers, and investment advisers.</p>
<p>The first component is &ldquo;sales practices, conflicts of interest, and compensation schemes.&rdquo; These areas can be broadly construed. In the capital markets where every participant has its own self-interest, conflicts of interest are everywhere. Nearly any form of communication can be deemed a sales practice and any payment can be part of a compensation scheme. The Investment Company Act of 1940 &ndash; which regulates registered investment companies (RICs) &ndash; already contains provisions that address sales practices,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-cii-030524#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;conflicts of interest<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-cii-030524#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;and compensation schemes.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-cii-030524#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;Does Section 211(h) allow the Commission to superimpose the provisions of the Investment Company Act onto the Advisers Act for non-RICs? Read broadly, Section 211(h) could permit the Commission to prohibit or restrict any type of advisory activity that might fall into these categories. For example, could Section 211(h) be used to prohibit or restrict the ESG activities of a fund, because it involves a sales practice, conflict of interest, and/or compensation scheme? Could Section 211(h) be used for government mandated price caps on funds?</p>
<p>The second component is investors. The Commission argues that Section 211(h) makes no distinction between retail investors and institutional investors. What are the implications of this assertion? If it means that entities such as private funds, which are statutorily excluded from regulation under Sections 3(c)(1) and 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-cii-030524#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;can be indirectly regulated through the Advisers Act, then why wouldn&rsquo;t the same argument apply to other excluded funds? After all, the Private Funds Rules require providing investors with fund-level &ndash; not adviser-level &ndash; disclosures such as quarterly statements about private funds adviser compensation, fund fees and expenses, and performance,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-cii-030524#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;and audited financial statements.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-cii-030524#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;For instance, could the Commission use Section 211(h) to regulate church plans<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-cii-030524#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>&nbsp;excluded by Section 3(c)(14) of the Investment Company Act? What about collective investment trusts that are excluded by Section 3(c)(11) of the Investment Company Act? What about private pension plans that are also excluded by Section 3(c)(11)?</p>
<p>The third component is brokers, dealers, and investment advisers, though I will focus only on investment advisers. Section 211(h) does not differentiate among Commission-registered investment advisers, state-registered investment advisers, and investment advisers exempt from registration. The National Securities Market Improvement Act of 1996 (&ldquo;NSMIA&rdquo;) provides that the states cannot impose substantive regulations on Commission-registered investment advisers,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-cii-030524#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>&nbsp;but is silent on the Commission&rsquo;s ability to impose regulations on state-registered investment advisers. Does Section 211(h) give the Commission the authority to regulate state-registered investment advisers? Section 203(b) provides a list of &ldquo;investment advisers&rdquo; who need not register. This list includes advisers to insurance companies,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-cii-030524#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>&nbsp;advisers to charitable organizations,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-cii-030524#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>&nbsp;commodity trading advisers registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) whose business does not otherwise consist primarily of acting as an investment adviser,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-cii-030524#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a>&nbsp;and advisers to small business investment companies and rural business investment companies.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-cii-030524#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a>&nbsp;Can the Commission now regulate these advisers under Section 211(h)?</p>
<p>Thus, the purported reach of Section 211(h) under the Commission&rsquo;s approach appears to go beyond what Congress intended given the context of Section 913. For the Commission&rsquo;s jurisdictional claim to be valid, Congress must have intended Section 211(h) to be a blank check that subsumes the other federal securities laws, which I find implausible.</p>
<p>Definition of Dealer</p>
<p>The Commission&rsquo;s broad assertion of jurisdiction is not limited to private funds. The Commission&rsquo;s recent rule on dealers has many market participants asking the question &ndash; are they dealers? The heart of the rulemaking was whether liquidity providers, like proprietary trading firms without customers, were dealers because they provided a function similar to market making. The Commission answered affirmatively. Pension plans might take comfort that under the rule, they are unlikely to be dealers because they are not regularly posting bids and asks at or near the market price. But the Commission also made it clear that just because a person does not fall within the rule&rsquo;s definition as a dealer, that person still could be a dealer under the statutory definition.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-cii-030524#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a></p>
<p>The Exchange Act defines a dealer to mean any person engaged in the business of buying and selling securities for such person&rsquo;s own account through a broker or otherwise.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-cii-030524#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a>&nbsp;There is an exception for any person who conducts such activities &ldquo;not as part of a regular business.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-cii-030524#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a>&nbsp;But isn&rsquo;t it part of the regular business of a pension plan, a mutual fund, an exchange-traded fund, a collective investment trust, and a charitable endowment, to buy and sell securities? Indeed, the final dealer rule recognizes that investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act might fall within its scope and thus provided a specific exclusion for them. However, while excluding registered investment companies, the final rule did not exclude private funds, investment advisers, collective investment trusts, and pension plans.</p>
<p>What is the limiting principle on who is a statutory dealer? For the statutory definition, liquidity provision or market making are irrelevant. In fact, the Commission has launched enforcement cases against numerous entities for being statutory dealers, even though they had no customers and bought and held securities for relatively lengthy periods of time before selling.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-cii-030524#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a>&nbsp;While it is unclear how these court cases will turn out, and one court of appeal recently ruled in favor of the Commission&rsquo;s view,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-cii-030524#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a>&nbsp;what is clear is that the guidance released by Commission staff in 2008,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-cii-030524#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a>&nbsp;which lists a number of factors to consider when determining whether a person is a dealer, did not and would not have put these types of entities on notice of their requirement to register as dealers.</p>
<p>Historically, one limiting principle has been that dealers have customers. Since the adoption of the Exchange Act, the terms &ldquo;broker&rdquo; and &ldquo;dealer&rdquo; have generally referred to the method by which a securities business effectuates customer securities transactions. However, that no longer appears to be a requirement in the eyes of the Commission. The new dealer rule fails to provide a definitive test to determine dealer status. With no limiting principle, how does an institutional investor know that they are not a dealer? After all, institutional investors are in the regular business of buying and selling securities. At the very least, institutional investors may need to have policies and procedures to make regular determinations as to their status as a dealer.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies and the Definition of a Security</p>
<p>There is one more area where there appears to be no limiting principle &ndash; what constitutes a security under the investment contract test in Howey, which has arisen for cryptocurrencies and digital assets. Under Howey, an investment contract exists when there is an investment of money in a common enterprise with the expectation of profits based on the managerial efforts of others.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-cii-030524#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a>&nbsp;Council members are likely not invested in crypto or digital assets, so why should they be concerned about how the Commission defines a &ldquo;security&rdquo;? However, the Commission&rsquo;s approach to this analysis for cryptocurrencies and digital assets has been that any item sold whose value is based on the efforts of others is a security. In September 2023, the Commission found that the purchase of a digital image via a non-fungible token (NFT), the proceeds from which was used to finance the creation of an animated series was an investment contract, even though only those users who had purchased the digital image could gain access to watch the content.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-cii-030524#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a>&nbsp;This broad reading of Howey would appear to scope in many common transactions in the non-digital world, including pre-purchase commitments, collectibles, art, and land.</p>
<p>For example, based on the Commission&rsquo;s broad interpretation &ndash; could real estate be considered a security? Many real estate holdings of pension plans are not raw land. They often are projects with development rights, zoning rights, and permits, among other things. Also, let&rsquo;s not forget that the original Howey case involved orange groves. Under the broad definition of an &ldquo;investment contract&rdquo; being applied to the crypto space, could those interests in real estate be deemed as securities? If so, does your real estate broker also need to be registered with FINRA? Does your real estate appraiser have to be registered as an investment adviser? What about commodities holdings? Should they be treated as securities?</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>In conclusion, market participants need to know when their conduct implicates the securities laws and when it does not. The Commission&rsquo;s broad jurisdictional claims in Section 211(h), the definition of &ldquo;dealer,&rdquo; and the definition of &ldquo;security&rdquo; without any practical limiting principle should be concerning for all. The Commission was designed by Congress to have a degree of independence from the political process. In return, the Commission&rsquo;s jurisdiction is limited to only those areas specifically authorized by statute.</p>
<p>Our capital markets have historically thrived because, absent a statutory or regulatory restriction, market participants are able to act without government approval in advance or fear of enforcement without proper notice. The rise of the administrative state presents a challenge to this historical norm. When a regulator can, without practical limitation, promulgate, interpret, and enforce rules and guidance, including retroactively, the temptation to be arbitrary in the exercise of administrative power and enforcement can be great.</p>
<p>I look forward to having a continuing dialogue with the Council and its members in the years to come. Hopefully, you won&rsquo;t need to change the name of your organization to the &ldquo;Council of Institutional Dealers and Investors.&rdquo; Thank you and enjoy the rest of your morning.</p>

<div> reforms, supplementary leverage ratio, US Treasury markets, global systemically important bank holding companies, financial system <br />
Summary: ISDA urged US agencies to implement reforms to the supplementary leverage ratio to preserve resilience of US Treasury markets and the financial system. <div>
<p>On March 5, ISDA submitted a letter to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to urge them to implement targeted reforms to the supplementary leverage ratio (SLR), the enhanced SLR framework and the risk-based surcharge for global systemically important bank holding companies that are important to preserve the resilience of the US Treasury markets, the US economy and the financial system more broadly.</p>
<p>To facilitate participation by banks in US Treasury markets &ndash; including clearing US Treasury security transactions for clients &ndash; the agencies should revise the SLR to permanently exclude on-balance-sheet US Treasuries from total leverage exposure, consistent with the scope of the temporary exclusion for US Treasuries that the agencies implemented in 2020.</p>

<title>Mercuryo Reports Rapid Fire ‘Buy Crypto’ On-Ramp Growth As Bitcoin Soars To New All-Time High</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Bitcoin, Mercuryo, partnership, digital token, payment infrastructure <br />
Summary:<br />
Bitcoin's surge drives global interest in cryptocurrency. Mercuryo's partnerships and services contribute to financial inclusion for the unbanked in developing economies. <div>
<p>Global payments infrastructure provider&nbsp;<a href="https://mercuryo.io/" target="_blank">Mercuryo</a>&nbsp;has reported substantial growth in global digital token payments and services as a stratospheric rise in the Bitcoin price only adds momentum to the fast evolution of the underlying architecture of the space.</p>
<p>Bitcoin has once again captured the imagination of the public as the world&rsquo;s biggest cryptocurrency surged past its record high of $69,000 after 846 days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While price action in the trading of Bitcoin makes the headlines, a dazzling array of payment infrastructure projects are quietly being built as the space evolves to meet the needs of a new generation that is increasingly comfortable seamlessly switching between crypto and fiat services. The provision of on and off-ramp services is the fabric that melds the legacy fiat world and the emerging digital token economy.</p>
<p align="center"><b>&lsquo;Buy Bitcoin&rsquo;</b><span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>As newcomers pour into the space, the &lsquo;buy Bitcoin&rsquo; and &lsquo;buy crypto&rsquo; features have become essential tools among leading participants such as centralised exchanges, non-custodial wallet providers and Decentralised Exchanges (DEXs). To this end, Mercuryo is leading the charge in the evolution of the space as the payment infrastructure provider over the past year secured a series of high-profile strategic partnerships.</p>
<p>Notably, Mercuryo has partnered with&nbsp;<a href="https://mercuryo.io/explore/article/metamask-launch" target="_blank">MetaMask</a>, the leading non-custodial wallet, enabling purchases of up to &euro;699 to be done immediately. The solution also enables users to make purchases directly within the MetaMask wallet using credit and debit cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay and a variety of local payment methods.</p>
<p>Mercuryo has in 2023 also partnered with Ledger, the hardware wallet maker, Jupiter, the leading DEX liquidity aggregator on Solana, Pancakeswap, the leading DEX on the BNB Chain, along with cryptocurrency exchanges, Poloniex,&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.bingx.com/important-announcements/bingx-announces-partnership-with-mercuryo-for-smarter-digital-payments/" target="_blank">BingX</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://phemex.com/announcements/phemex-launches-new-fiat-channel-mercuryo" target="_blank">Phemex</a>&nbsp;and BTSE. Mercuryo is also making waves in the nascent Web3 gaming space, and last year announced partnerships with Wemade, a South Korean Web3 game developer, and IntellaX, a Web3 gaming platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cementing partnerships across the cryptocurrency space has enabled Mercuryo to achieve a 136% boost in raw profitability in 2023. Latin America has witnessed a 27-fold growth, North America a 12-fold growth and Europe a 7-fold growth, spearheaded by a proliferation of on-ramp services across the globe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The launch of the Bitcoin ETF and subsequent rally in the cryptocurrency market that has seen Bitcoin surge to a record high has reawakened interest in crypto among the masses and captured the imagination,&rdquo; said Petr Kozyakov, CEO and Co-Founder of Mercuryo. &ldquo;Our position as a company at the very intersection of digital token services and payments enables us to see emerging trends in the use of crypto as the space evolves beneath the surface headlines. More and more people across the globe are pressing the &lsquo;buy Bitcoin&rsquo; on-ramp button.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Global adoption of cryptocurrency as a means of payment is on the rise as more&nbsp;<a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2023-global-crypto-adoption-index/" target="_blank">nations</a>&nbsp;embrace crypto and the digital financial revolution. Notably, in 2023, Mercuryo integrated with the Brazilian instant payment platform PIX as the provision of cryptocurrency services helps enhance levels of financial inclusion in Latin America.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><b>The unbanked</b></p>
<p>&ldquo;Developing markets, as often, play a crucial role in driving crypto trends, with the US and UK markets attempting to keep pace,&rdquo; added Kozyakov. &ldquo;So, we&rsquo;re up for some exciting industry developments, and Mercuryo will be at the forefront.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Today, 2 billion adults, or 38 percent of all adults worldwide, remain excluded from the financial system today, according to research by the World Bank. The vast majority of the unbanked live in developing economies, where 46 percent of adults do not have a bank account. Providing access to on and off-ramp services enables the unbanked to obtain access to financial services such as P2P payments and cross border payments.</p>

<title>B.C. Securities Commission Launches Guide To Empower Women Investors</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/bc-securities-commission-launches-guide-to-empower-women-investors/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/bc-securities-commission-launches-guide-to-empower-women-investors/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The B.C. Securities Commission (BCSC) is unveiling a new resource in the lead-up to International Women&rsquo;s Day on March 8 that is designed to give women the investment knowledge they need to empower them on their financial journey.</p>
<p>Taking to heart the United Nations theme,&nbsp;<em>Invest in women: Accelerate progress</em>, the BCSC has published an online&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investright.org/tools-resources/guides/women-investing/" target="_blank"><em>Women and Investing</em></a>&nbsp;guide. Founded on research, it includes unbiased information about the fundamental investing principles that can support the financial needs of women.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<em>Women and Investing</em>&nbsp;guide caters to both novice and experienced investors alike, explaining a variety of important concepts, including: &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Investing and saving&nbsp;</li>
<li>Investment goals&nbsp;and retirement</li>
<li>Diversification</li>
<li>Working with a registered investment advisor, and</li>
<li>Using a robo-advisor or doing it yourself through self-directed investing.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know that investing can seem intimidating, but it&rsquo;s one of the best pathways toward building wealth and achieving financial independence,&rdquo; said Brenda Leong, the BCSC&rsquo;s Chair and CEO.&nbsp;&ldquo;This resource will give women the information and guidance they need to feel more confident about making informed investment decisions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>BCSC research shows there are notable differences between men and women when it comes to investing confidence. Women feel less confident than men when it comes to making investment decisions (59 per cent of women say they&rsquo;re confident, while 78 per cent of men say the same). Women also feel more anxiety about losing money on investments (51 per cent say they&rsquo;re anxious, compared to 44 per cent of men) and they are less optimistic than men that they&rsquo;ll be able to achieve their investment targets (only 39 per cent say they&rsquo;re optimistic, whereas 51 per cent of men say the same).</p>
<p>On the other hand, women are also less likely to engage in speculative investing behaviour, which is correlated with higher risk. Women would benefit from greater confidence when it comes to investing, and they are starting from a good place because women already have good instincts when it comes to making smart investment decisions.</p>
<p>Research also shows that women face unique financial challenges including the gender pay gap, the need to plan for a longer retirement (since they tend to outlive men), and time away from the workforce to focus on family, which can impact wealth-building opportunities.</p>

<title>Colombia Unveils New Taxonomy Guidelines To Accelerate Green Finance</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Taxonomy, Colombia, Sustainable Finance, Policies, Climate Bonds
Summary:
Colombia introduced a pioneering green taxonomy, supported by new guidelines and tools for implementation. Climate Bonds plays a crucial role in global taxonomy initiatives. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<ul>
<li><sub>New Policies and Tools Redefine Sustainable Finance Landscape for banks and financial institutions&nbsp;&nbsp;</sub></li>
<li><strong>Colombia's Pioneering Green Taxonomy laid the foundation for sustainable investment&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In April 2022, the Colombian Government launched the first Taxonomy in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) with the aim of supporting the mobilisation of capital for sustainability objectives. This milestone not only marks the region's first-ever taxonomy but also positions Colombia as a trailblazer, with a high level of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.climatebonds.net/civicrm/mailing/url?u=6583&amp;qid=2231252" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">interoperability with the EU Taxonomy.</a>&nbsp;Aligning with international standards and in line with the Paris Agreement's 1.5&deg;C trajectory, it responds to the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) acquired on the Paris Agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.climatebonds.net/civicrm/mailing/url?u=6584&amp;qid=2231252" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Colombian Green Taxonomy</a>&nbsp;(Taxonom&iacute;a Verde de Colombia - TVC) establishes how an investment can contribute to climate mitigation and adaptation and five other environmental goals. A taxonomy works like a shopping list, signalling to investors that assets and activities can be financed for a green future. It is the starting point of sustainable finance policies. However, a taxonomy alone will not drive rapid climate action. Public policies and tools must be developed to support the taxonomy implementation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3><br /><strong>New guidelines will serve as public policies to simplify the Taxonomy usability &nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>On the 12th of February, the Taxonomy Supervisory Committee, led by the Financial Superintendency (SFC) and the Ministry of Finance (MHCP) of Colombia, introduced two game-changing usability guidelines. Crafted for both general and banking sector users, these guidelines serve as official tools, simplifying the application of TVC in the financial and non-financial sectors. The guidelines are outlined in the official document, published by the SFC, that officialised the adoption of the taxonomy, encourage the use of taxonomy for labelling green bonds, investment portfolios, and voluntary pension funds (External Circular 005 of 2022).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>These guidelines were authored by Climate Bonds Initiative, Metrix Finanzas and Ambire Global, in the framework of the project "Greening the Colombian financial system: Implementing local green definitions to enable long-term investment in priority sectors" through support of the UK PACT programme from the Government of the United Kingdom.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Navigating the TVC Landscape: A Comprehensive Overview&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>The<strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.climatebonds.net/civicrm/mailing/url?u=6585&amp;qid=2231252" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">General TVC Implementation Guideline</a>,</strong>&nbsp;targeting a diverse audience ranging from private companies to financial consumers, provides a practical roadmap for meeting TVC eligibility criteria at the sector and activity levels, complying with its general and specific requirements and social safeguards. It also provides insight on how to approach and align those activities related to energy efficiency which is not mentioned explicitly in the Colombian Taxonomy. With practical examples, visual graphs, and strategies for analysis and management, this guideline is set to be a game-changer in fostering sustainable finance policies. &nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Empowering Financial Institutions: TVC Implementation Guideline on Green Credit Management&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>Specifically designed for banks and financial institutions,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.climatebonds.net/civicrm/mailing/url?u=6586&amp;qid=2231252" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>TVC Implementation Guideline on Green Credit Management</strong></a>&nbsp;offers strategic, operational, and technical recommendations. It provides a list of recommendations to improve the assessment of social and environmental risks for green credits. This guideline aims to boost investments in green projects and assets, presenting best practices gleaned from the sustainability strategy of banks in the country. These recommendations directly addresses the challenges banks face when evaluating projects for green credits. They stem from assessments conducted on five of Colombia's largest banks through the implementation of pilot projects.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Governments can implement policies to accelerate Taxonomy-aligned investment&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>Beyond taxonomy guidance, governments and regulators can accelerate 1.5&deg;C-aligned investment through various policy options. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.climatebonds.net/civicrm/mailing/url?u=6587&amp;qid=2231252" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">101 Sustainable Finance Policies for 1.5&ordm;C</a>&nbsp;provides a comprehensive toolkit for policymakers, including subsidies and guarantees to de-risk investments.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><br /><strong>Climate Bonds at the Forefront of Global Taxonomy Initiatives&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>As taxonomies gain prominence globally, Climate Bonds continues to play a pivotal role in their development and implementation. With a robust presence in Latin America and the Caribbean, Climate Bonds has been instrumental in guiding taxonomies in countries such as Colombia, Chile, Mexico, Brazil, Peru, Costa Rica, and Panama.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are also enabling the uptake of these taxonomies, providing further policy expertise, capacity building, training, and supporting key labelled bond issuers, from sovereigns to development banks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To learn more about our work with Taxonomies, click&nbsp;<a href="https://www.climatebonds.net/civicrm/mailing/url?u=6588&amp;qid=2231252" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Climate_Bonds_Taxonomy" src="https://mondovisione.com/_assets/images/Climate_Bonds_Taxonomy.jpg" title="Climate_Bonds_Taxonomy" /></p>
<h3><strong>The Last Word&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>Taxonomies play a pivotal role in attracting increased capital for climate solutions, signalling the credibility and longevity of green finance. Climate Bonds is on a global mission to facilitate USD5 trillion in annual green bond issuance by 2025, acknowledging that addressing the impending climate challenges demands a comprehensive transformation of significant sectors of the global economy. To achieve trillions in annual issuance, robust local initiatives are essential. Taxonomies emerge as indispensable tools for nurturing local markets, and Climate Bonds is committed to providing support for these endeavours.&nbsp;</p>

<title>MarketAxess Announces Monthly Volume Statistics for February 2024 - Record Total Credit Trading ADV of $15.2 Billion; Record U.S. High-Grade ADV of $7.7 Billion</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> February 2024, MarketAxess, trading volume, credit, rates, FPM<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
MarketAxess reported record total credit ADV, with increases in U.S. high-grade, emerging markets, Eurobonds, and municipal bonds ADV. U.S. high-yield ADV decreased. The preliminary FPM for total credit for February 2024 was approximately $152, down from $168 in the prior year, driven by product mix shift and lower duration of bonds traded in U.S. high-grade. Total rates ADV decreased. <div>
<p>MarketAxess Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: MKTX), the operator of a leading electronic trading platform for fixed-income securities, today announced monthly trading volume and preliminary variable transaction fees per million (&ldquo;FPM&rdquo;) for February 2024.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><b>Chris Concannon, CEO of MarketAxess, commented:</b></p>
<p>&ldquo;We delivered record total credit ADV of&nbsp;<b>$15.2 billion</b>, driven by a&nbsp;<b>14.6%</b>&nbsp;increase in U.S. high-grade ADV, a&nbsp;<b>12.5%</b>&nbsp;increase in emerging markets ADV, a&nbsp;<b>9.1%</b>&nbsp;increase in Eurobonds ADV, and an&nbsp;<b>8.0%&nbsp;</b>increase in municipal bonds ADV. Strong credit volumes quarter-to-date across several of our growth cylinders have&nbsp;<b>more than offset</b>&nbsp;significantly lower levels of U.S. high-yield trading activity on our platform impacted by continued low levels of credit spread volatility. The roll-out of MarketAxess X-Pro is continuing and client engagement is increasing with approximately&nbsp;<b>14%</b>&nbsp;of our largest client firms active on the platform, up from&nbsp;<b>12%</b>&nbsp;in January 2024.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Select February 2024 highlights*</b></p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li><b>Record</b>&nbsp;total credit average daily volume (&ldquo;ADV&rdquo;) of&nbsp;<b>$15.2 billion</b>, up&nbsp;<b>5.1%</b>.</li>
<li><b>Record</b>&nbsp;U.S. high-grade ADV of&nbsp;<b>$7.7</b>&nbsp;<b>billion</b>, up<b>&nbsp;14.6%</b>&nbsp;on an&nbsp;<b>18.6%&nbsp;</b>increase in<b>&nbsp;</b>estimated market ADV. Estimated market share of&nbsp;<b>19.5%</b>,<b>&nbsp;</b>down from&nbsp;<b>20.1%&nbsp;</b>in the prior year on&nbsp;<b>record</b>&nbsp;February new issuance calendar.</li>
<li>U.S. high-yield ADV of&nbsp;<b>$1.4 billion</b>, down&nbsp;<b>37.1%</b>. Estimated market share of&nbsp;<b>12.9%</b>, down from&nbsp;<b>19.2%&nbsp;</b>in the prior year. U.S. high-yield estimated market ADV decreased&nbsp;<b>6.3%</b>. We believe the decrease in U.S. high-yield estimated market share year-over-year was driven, in part, by&nbsp;<b>lower levels of credit spread volatility</b>&nbsp;and a greater&nbsp;<b>focus on the new issue calendar</b>&nbsp;by our long-only client segment. Lower levels of credit spread volatility drove an estimated&nbsp;<b>73.8%</b>&nbsp;decrease in ETF market maker client activity on our platform.</li>

<title>EACH Responds To ESAs’ Joint Consultation On Second Batch Of Policy Mandates Under The Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)</title>

<div> implementation, DORA, timeline, extension, incident reporting

Summary:
- EACH members call for extension of DORA timeline
- Proposals for re-organizing major incident reporting data fields
- Exclusion of ICT services supporting critical functions from subcontracting definition
- Suggestions for TLPT testers and threat intelligence providers
- Financial entities should be allowed to rely on TLPT performed by ICT third-party service providers.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>On Monday 4<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;March EACH responded to some of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esas-launch-joint-consultation-second-batch-policy-mandates-under-digital" target="_blank">ESAs&rsquo;&nbsp;joint consultation on second batch of policy mandates under the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)</a>. &nbsp;EACH Members would like to underline the following key messages:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Timeline for the implementation of DORA</b>&nbsp;&ndash; EACH Members consider that the timeline for the implementation of DORA (which will apply from 17 January 2025)&nbsp;<b>appears to be extremely challenging</b>. EACH Members are therefore calling for an&nbsp;<b>extension of such timeline</b>&nbsp;in order to ensure a smooth and efficient implementation. We would expect Authorities to provide comfort to the industry accordingly as well as some prioritisation of the aspects of DORA that should be implemented first.</li>
<li><b>Major incident reporting</b>&nbsp;&ndash; The amount of data fields to be provided in the context of the initial, intermediate and final reports seems often excessively detailed and, in some cases, potentially misleading. EACH Members have therefore put forward some proposals regarding a re-organisation of such data fields by, for instance, suggesting certain data fields to be moved from the initial reports to the intermediate one.</li>
<li><b>Subcontracting&nbsp;</b><b>ICT services supporting critical or important functions</b>&nbsp;&ndash; EACH Members suggest not to include in the definition of &lsquo;subcontracting&rsquo; those cases where ICT services supporting critical or important functions are provided from the parent company to a subsidiary or the reverse. Furthermore, we consider that monitoring subcontracting conditions through the review of contractual documentation between ICT third-party service providers and subcontractors is unrealistic.</li>
<li><b>Elements related to TLPT</b>&nbsp;&ndash; EACH overall agrees with the approach proposed in the consultation document (cross-sectoral, proportional, two-layered). We would nevertheless suggest that external testers and threat intelligence providers should prove their experience not only in TLPT, but also in TLPT&nbsp;<i>in the financial sector</i>. In addition,&nbsp;to avoid high costs and unnecessary burden to the financial entity for preparing and managing the tests and to recognize the above specific situation and requirements, financial entities should be allowed to rely on TLPT that are performed by ICT third-party service providers.</li>
</ul>

<title>Purdue University/CME Group Ag Economy Barometer: Modest Improvement In Farmer Sentiment, Yet Financial Concerns Loom</title>

<div> increase, farmer sentiment, financial performance, concerns, farmland values<br />
<br />Summary: Farmer sentiment improves slightly with concerns about financial performance, high input costs, and farmland values. Solar energy leasing interest remains strong. <div>
<p>The latest&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4106668-1&amp;h=794810970&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fageconomybarometer%2F&amp;a=Purdue+University%2FCME+Group+Ag+Economy+Barometer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Purdue University/CME Group Ag Economy Barometer</a>&nbsp;reveals a modest increase in farmer sentiment compared to the previous month, though concerns remain regarding farm financial performance in the year ahead. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The February barometer reading reached 111, marking a 5-point rise from last month. The small uptick is attributed to producers expressing increased optimism about the future, with the Future Expectations Index climbing 7 points to 115. However, the Current Conditions Index remained unchanged. Despite their improved outlook for the future, farmers' financial performance expectations did not keep pace. February's Farm Financial Performance Index registered at 85, a slight dip from January and notably lower than its recent peak in December. The February survey was conducted from&nbsp;Feb. 12-16.</p>
<p>"Weak crop prices continue to weigh heavily on financial expectations, with mid-February Eastern Corn Belt cash prices for corn and soybeans declining by 7% and 8%, respectively, compared to two months earlier," said&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4106668-1&amp;h=4200754721&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fageconomybarometer%2Fteam%2Fjim-mintert%2F&amp;a=James+Mintert" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">James Mintert</a>, the barometer's principal investigator and director of&nbsp;Purdue University's&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4106668-1&amp;h=3141738204&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fhome%2F&amp;a=Center+for+Commercial+Agriculture" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Center for Commercial Agriculture</a>.</p>
<p>When producers were asked about their primary concerns for farm operations in the upcoming year, the top concern cited by 34% of respondents was "high input costs," closely followed by "lower crop/livestock prices," chosen by 28% of respondents. Worries about rising interest rates among producers seem to have diminished somewhat, with only 18% of February respondents citing it as a top concern, down from 26% who did so in November.</p>
<p>The Farm Capital Investment Index remains weak at 34 points, 9 points lower than last year. Producers expressing reluctance toward making large investments highlighted concerns over high production costs and weak output prices. The percentage of farmers worried about farm profitability has tripled since last October. This month, 22 out of every 100 farmers pointed to farm profitability concerns, while last fall only 7 out of every 100 farmers felt the same way.</p>
<p>The Short-Term Farmland Values Expectations Index held steady in comparison to January but declined by 4 points from a year ago and by 30 points from two years ago. Although the farmland index remains positive, it is clear that overall sentiment regarding future increases in farmland values is weaker than it was a couple of years ago. Among producers who expect values to increase in the next year, the top reason cited for their optimism was demand from non-farm investors.</p>
<p>Each February, the barometer survey asks producers about growth plans for their farm operation in the upcoming five years. This year, 4 out of 10 respondents expressed no plans for growth, with 14% saying they plan to exit or retire. Alternatively, just over 3 out of 10 respondents anticipate their farm's annual growth rate to exceed 5%. Responses to this question, which have been consistent in recent years, point to further consolidation among farm operations.</p>
<p>"To put growth rates into perspective, consider that a farm operation growing at a 5% annual rate will double in size in about 14 years, whereas a farm growing at an annual rate of 10% will need just seven years to double," Mintert said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interest in leasing farmland for solar energy development remains strong, with 10% of respondents having discussed such projects in the last six months. Rates varied widely, but over half of the respondents reported being offered lease rates of&nbsp;$1,000&nbsp;per acre or more. The top end for solar lease rates appears to be rising over time. When this question was posed in&nbsp;June 2021, just 27% of respondents reported a lease rate offer of&nbsp;$1,000&nbsp;or more per acre, compared to 56% of respondents this year.</p>

<div> February 2024, Tradeweb Markets Inc., trading volume, rates, credit, equities, money markets.<br />
Summary: Record total trading volume, increased ADV across asset classes, sustained rates market volatility, ongoing institutional client activity, and strong retail engagement. <div>
<p>Tradeweb Markets Inc. (Nasdaq: TW), a leading, global operator of electronic marketplaces for rates, credit, equities and money markets, today reported total trading volume for the month of February 2024 of $37.9 trillion (tn)<a href="https://www.tradeweb.com/newsroom/media-center/news-releases/tradeweb-reports-february-2024-total-trading-volume-of-$37.9-trillion-and-average-daily-volume-of-$1.87-trillion/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span>[1]</span></a>. Average daily volume (ADV) for the month was $1.87tn, an increase of 31.1 percent (%) year-over-year (YoY).</p>
<p>In February 2024, Tradeweb records included:</p>
<ul>
<li>ADV in U.S. government bonds</li>
<li>ADV in European government bonds</li>
<li>ADV in rates futures</li>
<li>ADV in fully electronic U.S. High Grade credit</li>
<li>ADV in equity convertibles/swaps/options</li>
<li>ADV in global repurchase agreements</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">February 2024 Highlights</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;<span>Rates</span></span> &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>U.S. government bond ADV was up 44.0% YoY to $207.8 billion (bn). European government bond ADV was up 17.9% YoY to $51.0bn.  
<ul>
<li>U.S. government bond volumes were supported by growth across all client sectors, leading to record volume on the institutional platform for the second consecutive month. Increased adoption across a wide range of trading protocols, along with sustained rates market volatility, contributed to the increase in volume. The addition of r8fin also contributed positively to wholesale volumes. Higher interest rates continued to drive trading in the retail market on the short end of the curve. European government bond volumes continued to be strong, particularly in UK Gilts, where there was continued flow and growth in our dealer-to-client platform. We also saw an abundance of new issuance across Europe and the UK in the primary market, along with increased client activity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Mortgage ADV was up 12.2% YoY to $188.1bn.  
<ul>
<li>Platform trading activity remained healthy while shifting rate-cut bets led agency mortgages to underperform compared to other fixed-income asset classes. Specified pool trading volumes set a record high, up 170% YoY.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Swaps/swaptions &ge; 1-year ADV was up 65.1% YoY to $502.3bn and total rates derivatives ADV was up 32.1% YoY to $789.7bn.  
<ul>
<li>Strong volume in swaps/swaptions &ge; 1-year was driven by ongoing institutional client activity in response to current global central bank policy decisions, as well as an 88% YoY increase in compression activity, which carries a lower fee per million. Quarter-to-date compression activity is running higher than 4Q23. Clients continued to utilize the request-for-market (RFM) protocol for larger risk transfers, while inflation and emerging markets swap growth remained strong.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Credit</span> </span> &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Fully electronic U.S. credit ADV was up 49.9% YoY to $7.7bn and European credit ADV was up 4.7% YoY to $2.3bn.  
<ul>
<li>Strong U.S. credit volumes were driven by increased client adoption of Tradeweb protocols, most notably in request-for-quote (RFQ), portfolio trading and Tradeweb AllTrade&reg;. Tradeweb captured 17.5% share of fully electronic U.S. High Grade TRACE, and 6.6% share of fully electronic U.S. High Yield TRACE. Strong European credit volumes were supported by continued growth in client use of Tradeweb Automated Intelligent Execution (AiEX) and portfolio trading.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Municipal bonds ADV was down 4.4% YoY to $322 million (mm).  
<ul>
<li>Volumes slightly outperformed the broader market, which was down more than 5% YoY. Retail activity was more resilient than institutional flows, as Muni/U.S. Treasury ratios remained unattractive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Credit derivatives ADV was down 23.1% YoY to $8.1bn.&nbsp;  
<ul>
<li>Tight credit spreads and low market volatility led to subdued swap execution facility (SEF) and multilateral trading facility (MTF) credit default swaps activity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Equities</span> &nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>U.S. ETF ADV was up 20.6% YoY to $8.7bn and European ETF ADV was up 7.0% YoY to $3.0bn.  
<ul>
<li>U.S. and European ETF growth was driven by continued institutional client adoption of ETF trading via Tradeweb&rsquo;s electronic RFQ as well as an uptick in the use of our ETF portfolio trading functionality.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span> &nbsp;<span>Money Markets</span> &nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Repurchase agreement ADV was up 33.8% YoY to $550.3bn.  
<ul>
<li>Increased client engagement with Tradeweb&rsquo;s electronic repo trading protocols drove record global repo activity. The combination of quantitative tightening, heightened collateral supply, and current rates market activity shifted more balances from the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s reverse repo facility to money markets. Retail money markets activity was strong as interest rates remained elevated and market expectations for rate cuts moved further into 2024.</li>
</ul>

The strategic relationship is set to transform the accessibility, consistency and analytical power of Thatcham Vehicle Risk Data (VRD)<sup>i</sup>&nbsp;which is used to assign an industry-standard ABI Code and Group Rating score to vehicles. The VRD is integral to how insurers assess and rate risk for all wheels-based insurance products.</p>

<p>The news comes as the Association of British Insurers, in close collaboration with Thatcham Research, has released its motor insurance affordability roadmap<sup>ii</sup>. This includes recommendations to increase visibility of the Group Rating system, which would help consumers make more informed choices on their motor insurance based on the vehicle they choose. This collaboration will help support these actions and recommendations, making it easier for insurance providers to be transparent with customers over vehicle ratings as car safety technology evolves.</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><b>The first element of the agreement focuses on streamlining and automating access to the VRD</b>. LexisNexis Risk Solutions has the widest data distribution network into the U.K. insurance sector, streamlining data directly into insurers, brokers, managing general agents (MGAs), insurtechs, software houses and third-party data providers, to support billions of insurance quotes per month. LexisNexis Risk Solutions will become the sole distributor of Thatcham VRD to the U.K. and ROI insurance market.Leveraging this unique network, insurance providers, including insurers, brokers, MGAs, insurtechs and software houses, will be able to access Thatcham VRD in real time for the first time, alongside additional public, third party and proprietary data sources, as part of a streamlined risk assessment and decisioning process, via the&nbsp;<a href="http://email.prnewswire.com/ls/click?upn=u001.v9xoTZaCB3KDvUFxTt6K9ITfJcLtx-2FOvmuVizoBK57Dc5EUnbgWie5hAam5zcOJklBug-2BOWUxscL-2BWt44nV7vEexJy-2B-2FcLOXDTCGWAFFmC9Fo3DlqiSHCwKvHggYhtEmxew6hHMWVSAoNLz0LLEMN40AaQWzPHOqroDOLvs0Kdarha8hr8HSf1cEfk1khtS4FCnzY8b-2F0FuW9uxKDzXZGPwZuEXjsTflD-2F-2B8iKkvMpqFseaQt0L5lPC9nX5-2FmV2SpvHg3a2MPBpjCaEalp3zc3vtncqhZ8yRHSf0GiOoq3-2F0taP4f3NO1p4jE64to3PSdXJcv-2Bru-2Fc8t6aU3opvI2zQ0hDvzkUWPCa-2B-2B-2FSl8yIQaCRCLz8GCZp9sucPGO1EfzccaewQh7m9GUDc4LX2IAvPEVXA-2FgwOYzD9db4BOLII-3DdNNn_pIbxPfpDI69aAybPrpOfg1n6CWmKMnb3conIyNKCYgr-2BTRqxLAwMRExIXLpGb5DJ2pZV74YdU0C7jmjuRXZQMa8aIbT-2FORgLCAPNNzi7lmwuOI3QfIb73PvTJ8dAeHbjkRZzsLdX7tIExpHkf3aiyviLeskfJMB0jyJ9TvGOaTT1f-2FB-2B7ZJtsnb4nVn-2B7v8-2FOPmT8lLJmwI1DnS5fb6ePhMkYIrZOHNOzZ-2FExlI9G5x0qi25F28Nd5W-2FXNf2-2BgaYZpOLqjHlF3NMKF42mUG6p6JiVElkXNIyLLniEtG0DMLUy3yGZz1hihBsUWYrx-2B7kqq9QxHAkuZ-2Fp4eRhLZASD5m3Yx0oDalpkWliX-2FELnpB1u-2F0AYK8uzsZFsuzKkFHQ" target="_blank">LexisNexis&reg; Informed Quotes</a>&nbsp;platform.</li>
<li><b>The second element of the agreement focuses on consistent matching of Thatcham VRD to vehicle registrations</b>. As part of the strategic relationship with Thatcham Research, LexisNexis Risk Solutions will use its extensive linking and data normalisation expertise to match vehicles to Thatcham VRD (incorporating the Group Rating, Variant Code and ABI Code datasets). This will create greater consistency for insurance providers by delivering more granular data to support the identification of risk-affecting vehicle features in the quoting process regardless of the quoting platform.</li>
<li><b>The third element of the agreement will focus on uncovering new, predictive vehicle intelligence.&nbsp;</b>Leveraging its long track record of building new and innovative vehicle data products, LexisNexis Risk Solutions will collaborate with Thatcham Research in exploring the possibility to unlock significant intelligence on vehicles that does not exist today.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>James Burton, managing director, U.K. and Ireland insurance, LexisNexis Risk Solutions, said: "We pride ourselves on being experts in insurance, and our vehicle strategy is both consistent with and complementary to the Thatcham Research vision.

As an organisation, we are passionate, driven by the opportunity to help Thatcham Research customers, our customers and our shared customers realise the benefits of this relationship as they look to improve profitability, operational efficiency, reduce claims costs and improve the customer experience."</p>
<p>Jonathan Hewett, chief executive of Thatcham Research, said: "This exclusive relationship with LexisNexis Risk Solutions will allow Thatcham Research to focus efforts on research, testing and training, knowing that the insights we offer that are essential to how insurance providers derive premiums and assess risk will be managed by a trusted partner to the industry. We are pleased to be able to offer insurance providers greater access to vital data which may not have been accessible previously.

<title>Securities And Futures Bureau And Taiwan Stock Exchange Shine Spotlight On Taiwan's Capital Market With Highly-Anticipated "Taiwan Day" In London</title>

<div> Taiwan, TWSE, investment attraction, foreign investors, "Taiwan Day"
Summary:<br />Chang and Lin led a Taiwan team to Europe, attracting foreign investment, highlighting Taiwan's stock market strengths and reforms, and seeking feedback. <div>
<p>In early March,&nbsp;Chen-Shan Chang, Director-General of the Securities and Futures Bureau (the "SFB") and Sherman Lin, Chairman and CEO of the Taiwan Stock Exchange (the "TWSE") led a team to Europe, marking the first foreign investment attraction trip of the year. The visit included meetings with dozens of influential European institutions, ranging from exchanges, index companies, investment institutions, and large asset management firms. A much-anticipated highlight was the "Taiwan Day" event held on 5 March, which brought together over 50 prominent investors from the UK to gain insights into the latest market reform measures and the outlook for Taiwan's stock market.</p>
<p>Held in London, the "Taiwan Day" proved to be a resounding response to the recent call by Dr. Tien-Mu Huang, Chairperson of the Financial Supervisory Commission (the "FSC"), for securities-related institutions to continuously enhance international connectivity and promote the strengths and reforms of Taiwan's capital market. During the event, the prominent European institutional investors in attendance were highly impressed by a wide array of strengths of Taiwan's stock market, such as its high-tech cluster characteristics, outstanding ESG performance, and foreign investment-friendly environment.</p>
<p>Taiwan's representative for the UK, Vincent Chin-Hsiang Yao shared how the pandemic has underscored the crucial role of Taiwanese enterprises in the global supply chain. The "Taiwan Day" not only provided participants an opportunity to gain a profound understanding of the advantages offered by Taiwanese enterprises, but also aimed to foster a solid foundation for enhancing the ties between Taiwan and the UK and promoting mutual prosperity.</p>
<p>Chang, in his articulation, highlighted Taiwan's commitment to attract foreign investment in recent years, as demonstrated by the joint efforts with the TWSE to visit institutional investors in major financial centers around the world since last year, and the aspiration to establish Taiwan's capital market as a foreign investment-friendly environment through direct dialogue in the future.</p>
<p>Lin continued by illustrating the UK's role as a substantial investment source for Taiwan, and the Taiwan-UK partnership further cemented by the "Bilateral Enhanced Trade Partnership Arrangement" signed in last November. Going forward, Taiwan will continue to strengthen the development of its high-tech industry, create an ESG-friendly environment, and actively seek feedback from investors to consolidate the role of Taiwan's capital market.</p>
<p>Shin-Chung Chen, Senior Vice President of the TWSE, took the floor to present the compelling attributes of Taiwan's capital market. These include Taiwan's robust economic development with a projected GDP growth rate of over 3% in 2024 as well as the prominent rankings on a global scale. According to data of the World Federation of Exchanges, Taiwan's stock exchange ranks 7th, 12th and 16th in terms of turnover, trading value and market capitalization, respectively. In 2023, over 80% of listed companies distributed cash dividends and foreign ownership accounted for over 40%. Additionally, Taiwan listed companies and emerging technology firms play a pivotal role in the up and midstream supply chain of artificial intelligence (AI). These companies not only prioritize ESG-related development, but also maintain a steadfast commitment to continuously fostering a foreign investment-friendly environment which welcomes international investors into Taiwan's market.</p>
<p>Kuo-Jung Cheng, Deputy Director of the SFB, then provided a comprehensive introduction to a series of investor-friendly initiatives poised to attract overseas capital into Taiwan's capital market, enhancing the appeal of Taiwan's market among foreign investors through more diversified investment opportunities, flexible sources of investment funds, and convenient digital services. Cheng also gave an in-depth overview of recent key regulatory reforms and forward-looking policies related to sustainability, green finance, and net-zero emissions, underscoring Taiwan's commitment to aligning its market with international standards, all the while leading market participants in promoting the characteristics and advantages of Taiwan's market.</p>
<p>Following the meeting, the TWSE arranged one-on-one sessions with investors to delve into specific areas of interest, including ESG and trading systems. These sessions allowed the TWSE to actively respond to investor questions and gather feedback with a view of continuing to bolster investor confidence. The institutional investors attending the event responded positively to the resilience of Taiwan's economic fundamentals, its central role in the semiconductor and information and communications technology (ICT) industries, and the focus on the development of the ESG ecosystem. They also highly appreciated the authority and the TWSE for their attentive listening to investor opinions, proactive response, and thorough explanations on important issues of concern.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the TWSE will continue to encourage foreign investment opportunities and to promote the investment niche offered by Taiwan stocks, actively seeking feedback from global key institutional investors for the development of Taiwan market. Through these efforts, the TWSE aims to enhance Taiwan's international presence and deepen the investment community's understanding of the advantages and resilience of Taiwan's capital market.</p>

<li><span><strong><span>FinTechs invited to provide solutions around Sustainable Finance Reporting, verification and disclosure requirements.</span></strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>PIMFA WealthTech, the market network and technology platform created with principal strategic partner Morningstar, a leading provider of independent investment insights, has today (5 March 2024) launched its latest&nbsp;<a href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fforms.office.com%2Fpages%2Fresponsepage.aspx%3Fid=-wLT0u8Kc0eUpXlQxvZKNSpVxXioBWJBmn47zo9GcWBUM09IMThPNlA0WkpLWVdXWkNJUkhUWjY3VS4u/1/0102018e0e89aeb4-c8ade75a-d0f4-4a5c-b9ec-608e645f77e5-000000/p04Ug3x4mmF_QZW-_nCIR6Lz0fA=364" target="_blank">&lsquo;Tech Sprint&rsquo;</a>&nbsp;this time focused on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors.</span></p>
<p><span>FinTechs active in this area are invited to participate in, and demonstrate how, their technologies and solutions can make a difference to ESG and sustainable finance reporting, verification and disclosure.</span></p>
<p><span>PIMFA WealthTech is seeking high-growth, market-innovating scale-up firms, which are typically post Seed/Series A funding. FinTechs should have a demonstrable minimum viable product and, ideally, already be engaged with the financial services sector, although this is not essential.</span></p>
<p><span>Participating FinTechs will need to demonstrate how Morningstar datasets can be incorporated within their respective solutions, with a preference for solutions that utilise APIs, Open Data and Artificial Intelligence (AI).</span></p>
<p><span>A briefing session for chosen FinTechs will be held on 20 March, and FinTechs will be invited to showcase their solutions at the&nbsp;<a href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fmorningstar.cventevents.com%2Fevent%2F1968e049-2913-4d37-8b37-a19ea7e242f3%2FregPage:4de01221-a090-41ff-afcf-7e4d7acf508a%3FRefid=WealthTech%26rp=c4d90cda-662b-4ac3-9f9d-075bb9540cd2/1/0102018e0e89aeb4-c8ade75a-d0f4-4a5c-b9ec-608e645f77e5-000000/iMXX3Zz8DVPInhROFrC1iScY3ls=364" target="_blank">Morningstar Investment Conference</a>&nbsp;on 1<sup>&nbsp;</sup>May.</span></p>
<p><span>ESG and sustainable finance are a priority area of focus not only for wealth managers and advice firms, but also the&nbsp;<a href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.fca.org.uk%2Fpublication%2Fpolicy%2Fps23-16.pdf/1/0102018e0e89aeb4-c8ade75a-d0f4-4a5c-b9ec-608e645f77e5-000000/k0p_pikmU_0Na3GEDlGgDwxU7ag=364" target="_blank">Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)</a>. PIMFA, the trade association for the wealth management, investment services and the investment and financial advice industry, is taking a leading role in supporting the development of new guidance in partnership with the FCA to ensure the information provided to consumers is clear and consistent and so as to eradicate, where possible, the detrimental impact of the phenomenon known as &lsquo;greenwashing&rsquo;.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.pimfa.co.uk%2Fpress-release%2Fwealth-managers-and-advisers-want-more-support-in-accessing-sustainable-finance-and-esg-investment-data-report-finds%2F/1/0102018e0e89aeb4-c8ade75a-d0f4-4a5c-b9ec-608e645f77e5-000000/IecWA3ztcxZuEk1nkrJmF6dZG40=364" target="_blank"><span>Research conducted by</span></a><span>&nbsp;PIMFA last year, conducted in association with Alpha FMC a specialist management consultancy for the wealth and asset management industries, indicates the ESG data market is becoming increasingly challenging for firms to navigate, that technology solutions in this area will become invaluable and that using innovative technology, such as AI could prove vital for integrating all aspects of ESG and sustainable finance into a firm's offering and operations. For example, where providers can help to aggregate, analyse and populate information needed for climate-related disclosures at an entity, product or consumer-facing level.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Morningstar and PIMFA WealthTech have over the past 12 months collaborated on a number of &lsquo;Tech Sprints&rsquo; to address common issues within the wealth management and advice sector where new technology could offer the most effective solution for all parties.</span></p>
<p><span>The first Tech Sprints in 2023 examined how customer-focused technology can be deployed to support the needs of wealth managers with the requirements of Consumer Duty. Subsequent Tech Sprints in late 2023 focused on how new technology and Fintech providers can support wealth managers and advisers with client profiling, onboarding and experience.</span></p>
<p><span>PIMFA WealthTech has been created to address digital business transformation through the development and adoption of market-leading technologies. As a digital marketplace and industry network. PIMFA WealthTech&rsquo;s objective is to drive innovation and enhance collaboration between FinTechs and wealth management and advice firms, operating an Advisory Council of leading wealth management and financial advice practitioners that cover all segments of the sector.</span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Richard Adler, Executive Director of PIMFA WealthTech, commented:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;</em>ESG and Sustainable Finance is a top priority for PIMFA members, with the recent FCA sustainability disclosure requirements and investment labels policy a key step for increasing trust in sustainable investments.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;The role technology can play in helping our members meet new requirements and serve their clients better has the potential to be enormous. We&rsquo;re delighted to be working with Morningstar on this important Tech Sprint and invite FinTechs in this space to participate and demonstrate to the wealth management industry the type of innovation and support they can offer.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Anastasia Georgiou, Director of Client Solutions, Adviser Segment, EMEA, Morningstar, commented:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;</em>We are proud to continue our longstanding strategic partnership with PIMFA WealthTech to showcase new technology solutions from FinTechs to the Wealth sector.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;Today, firms need to generate insights and ideas for sustainable investments and position new offerings in the market. This includes identifying innovative ways to address the challenge of harnessing the vast amount of data available which is needed to provide accurate reporting and disclosures. Along with PIMFA, Morningstar is proud to help promote new solutions to help firms identify ESG risks and create new opportunities for clients.&rdquo;</span></p>

<div> Keywords: Adenza integration, 2024 strategic priorities, capital allocation strategy, financial outlook, webcast<br />
Summary: Nasdaq reaffirms financial outlook, outlines 2024 priorities, focus on Adenza integration, leverage technology, accelerate revenue, and enhance shareholder value.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<ul>
<li><span>Highlights enhanced value-creation opportunity following strategic pivot to a platform business with a more scalable, recurring, and profitable revenue profile</span> </li>
<li><span>Reaffirms medium-term outlook and provides 2024 priorities, including progress made to achieve synergy and deleveraging targets associated with Adenza integration</span> </li>
<li><span>Expects to action approximately 70% of targeted&nbsp;$80 million&nbsp;in net expense synergies ahead of plan, by the end of 2024</span> </li>
<li><span>Details accelerated deleveraging plan with intent to reach a 4.0x leverage ratio nine to twelve months before &ndash; and a 3.3x leverage ratio at least six months before &ndash; previously announced targets</span> </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nasdaq (Nasdaq: NDAQ) today will host its Investor Day at&nbsp;8:00 AM ET, where&nbsp;
Adena Friedman, Chair and CEO,&nbsp;
Sarah Youngwood, Executive Vice President and CFO, and other members of the senior leadership team will detail the company&rsquo;s plans to deliver its next phase of resilient and scalable growth.</p>
<p>Nasdaq has reaffirmed its medium-term financial outlook and will outline its key 2024 priorities. Additionally, the company will discuss its financial framework and capital allocation strategy as well as highlight the benefits of its divisional structure, unified with a One Nasdaq go-to-market approach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nasdaq is the trusted fabric of the global financial system, providing market-leading platforms that enhance the liquidity, transparency, and integrity of the global economy. Over the past several years, we have continuously invested to create an integrated and durable growth platform with mission-critical capabilities to serve our clients even more holistically,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span>
Adena Friedman, Chair and CEO.</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Across our divisions, we are uniquely positioned to grow our share of a&nbsp;$31 billion&nbsp;serviceable addressable market opportunity and further reinforce our position as a trusted partner to the industry. We are confident this will unlock a new chapter of scalable, durable, and profitable growth that delivers significant value for our clients and shareholders.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Executing 2024 Strategic Priorities</span></p>
<p>Nasdaq will discuss its 2024 strategic priorities, which are designed to deliver performance in line with its medium-term outlook target ranges. The three key priorities are:</p>
<p><span>Integrate: Execute Adenza Integration</span></p>
<p>Following the completion of the acquisition, Adenza has already accelerated Nasdaq&rsquo;s growth story by expanding Nasdaq&rsquo;s total pro forma revenue, Solutions revenue, and non-GAAP operating margin. Nasdaq will continue to successfully integrate Adenza to expand its growth opportunities, unlock synergies, and drive operating leverage. The company expects to action approximately 70% of the targeted&nbsp;$80 million&nbsp;in net expense synergies ahead of plan, by the end of 2024, with a portion realized in 2024 and fully realized in 2025.</p>
<p><span>Innovate: Leverage Technology Infrastructure to Drive Innovation</span></p>
<p>Nasdaq&rsquo;s longstanding focus on embracing cloud workflows throughout its market infrastructure and software solutions, coupled with years of investment in AI, positions the company to benefit from the next wave of technology innovation. Nasdaq&rsquo;s modern, cloud-native applications and its unique, proprietary data, create a strong foundation to introduce generative AI capabilities that will enhance the value that the company can provide to its clients and can further Nasdaq&rsquo;s competitive position.</p>
<p><span>Accelerate: Unlock the Value of the Divisional Structure to Drive Incremental Revenue</span></p>
<p>The company will continue to accelerate the impact of its divisional structure and leverage its One Nasdaq strategy to create and deliver on new growth and revenue opportunities. Within its Financial Technology division, Nasdaq expects to achieve at least&nbsp;$100 million&nbsp;in incremental revenue through cross-sell opportunities by year-end 2027.</p>
<p><span>Enhancing Shareholder Value via a Disciplined Capital Allocation Strategy</span></p>
<p>Nasdaq will also provide details on its financial framework and capital allocation strategy. This strategy, which is fueled by strong free cash flow generation and capital discipline, will focus on four key actions:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Utilizing a disciplined ROIC-based framework to allocate investment capital​ to drive organic growth.</li>
<li>Accelerating its deleveraging plan, now targeting an estimated leverage ratio of 4.0x, nine to twelve months before Nasdaq&rsquo;s previously stated goal. Nasdaq expects to reach 3.3x, at least six months ahead of its previously stated goal.</li>
<li>Growing the dividend and progressing towards an annualized payout ratio of 35% to 38% by 2027. This includes raising the 2024 quarterly dividend by&nbsp;$0.02&nbsp;per share, to&nbsp;$0.24&nbsp;per share, which will be reflected in the&nbsp;June 2024&nbsp;dividend payment.</li>
<li>Offsetting dilution from employee vesting and mitigating dilution from the Adenza acquisition equity issuance over time, both through the company&rsquo;s previously announced Board authorized share repurchase program.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Reiterating Medium-Term Financial Outlook</span></p>
<p>Nasdaq will reaffirm its previously stated medium-term financial outlook:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Capital Access Platforms Revenue growth of 5% to 8%.</li>
<li>Financial Technology Revenue growth of 10% to 14%.</li>
<li>Total Solutions Revenue growth of 8% to 11%.</li>
<li>Non-GAAP Operating Expense growth of 5% to 8%.</li>
</ul>
<p>This outlook reflects a three-to-five-year period and assumes a stable market backdrop. The company will also reaffirm its 2024 non-GAAP operating expense guidance with a range of&nbsp;$2,105 million&nbsp;to&nbsp;$2,185 million&nbsp;and its 2024 non-GAAP tax rate guidance with a range of 24.5% to 26.5%.</p>
<p>Reconciliations of&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;GAAP to non-GAAP operating expense and tax rate guidance are not provided due to the inherent difficulty in quantifying certain amounts due to a variety of factors including the unpredictability in the movement in foreign currency rates, as well as future charges or reversals outside of the normal course of business.</p>
<p><span>Webcast and Materials</span></p>
<p>The agenda, slide presentation, and a live webcast are available on Nasdaq&rsquo;s investor relations website:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=oGtP8PE-lHitvvfwjh0K87pkvwxYWqn2QcTFPEDpwFAZ9HmE-O-pXHvp0xCB082-eFZ-HaPIZ8OGDqb--uHNzL1q3GipeswuxD0HNLRB7P4=" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://ir.nasdaq.com</a>.</p>

<div> Extension, Dutch National Regulatory Authority, Norwegian NRA, electricity cross-zonal risk hedging opportunities, coordinated decisions
<br />
The Dutch and Norwegian NRAs requested a six-month extension to assess and adopt coordinated decisions on electricity cross-zonal risk hedging opportunities.
<br /><br />Summary: 
ACM and NVE-RME requested a six-month extension to assess electricity cross-zonal hedging opportunities and coordinate decisions. ACER and ESA will reach a decision promptly. <div>
<p>On 18 February 2024, the Dutch National Regulatory Authority (NRA), Autoriteit Consument &amp; Markt (ACM), requested a six-month extension from ACER to adopt coordinated decisions with the Norwegian NRA, NVE-RME, on electricity cross-zonal risk hedging opportunities.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is it about?</span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>By February 2024, in accordance with the&nbsp;<a href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtSCFQJBVJdB0wMU1JVHVYKA1IdCggGVxoBBgZTUgIFBVMGAFMdAgEAAwsOB1sdAQ0EDh0GXABQGlQGAA8ZUQdRA1dXVFVZUFEERQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" target="_blank">Regulation on forward capacity allocation</a>, the Dutch and Norwegian NRAs were required to assess whether the electricity forward market in their respective bidding zone provides sufficient hedging opportunities. If these opportunities prove insufficient, the NRAs must take coordinated decisions to either introduce long-term transmission rights or task Transmission System Operators (TSOs) with implementing alternative measures to improve cross-zonal hedging opportunities.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;are the next steps?</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></p>
<p>ACER intends to act promptly on the ACM request, aiming to reach a decision in April 2024.</p>
<p>The EFTA Surveillance Authority (ESA) will decide on the extension request for NVE-RME, based on a draft from ACER, following the procedure of the Third Energy Package as outlined in the EEA Agreement. &nbsp;</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority To Investigate Use Of Personal Guarantees In Certain Small Business Lending</title>

<div> investigate, personal guarantees, small businesses, lending, FCA

Summary: The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) will investigate the use of personal guarantees by lenders for small businesses, collect data, review policies, and work with government departments. It aims to support small businesses' access to lending.<br /><br /> <div>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has today committed to investigate the use of personal guarantees by lenders to support loans to certain small businesses. The steps come in response to a super complaint from the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB).</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>The FSB has raised concerns that a growing demand for personal guarantees by lenders has a detrimental impact on small businesses, which they believe dissuades them from borrowing funds to grow. It has particular concerns about small limited companies. The FCA&rsquo;s remit, which is set by Parliament, does not include lending to limited companies. However, the work announced by the FCA today reflects its commitment to do what it can to support small businesses within its defined remit.</p>
<p>If the FCA&rsquo;s work identifies relevant information, it will share these with appropriate government departments &ndash; in particular the Treasury as it considers reforming the Consumer Credit Act.</p>
<p>The FCA will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collect data (from April-June 2024) to understand the number of personal guarantees in place for sole traders and small partnerships borrowing less than &pound;25,000.</li>
<li>Review a sample of firms&rsquo; policies and procedures to understand when personal guarantees are required for loans that come&nbsp;under the FCA&rsquo;s regulation.</li>
<li>Work with the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) to monitor the levels of complaints about this issue.</li>
<li>Consider whether lenders need further guidance&nbsp;on&nbsp;applying the FCA&rsquo;s rules and guidance within the Consumer Credit Sourcebook to situations where a personal guarantee is in place. If required, the FCA will consult on and publish guidance in the normal manner.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sheldon Mills, Executive Director of Consumers and Competition at the FCA, said:</p>
<p>'Small businesses are vital to the UK economy, and it is important that they can access lending to help them grow &ndash; so we welcome the FSB raising these issues. We will play our part to better understand whether lenders&rsquo; practices are causing unnecessary barriers to growth and, if necessary, act to remove any within our remit.</p>
<p>'That remit, set by Parliament, is limited when it comes to small businesses. If we identify issues outside our remit, we will make these public so that Parliament and policy makers can consider whether greater protection should be available to small businesses.'</p>
<p>This work might also be of value to Parliament and its relevant committees as and when they look at business banking and related issues.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Mike McCudden, CEO of JP Jenkins, commented:</span></p>

Stijn Vander Straeten, CEO of Crypto Finance, states: &ldquo;As a well-established Swiss company with a strong commitment to regulatory compliance and delivering top-tier financial solutions, we have further strengthened our position with the introduction of Crypto Finance in Germany as the settlement agent and custodian. This marks a pivotal moment in our mission to cultivate a resilient and trusted digital asset ecosystem together with Deutsche B&ouml;rse, while also strengthening Crypto Finance's well-established and regulated custody and settlement offering in Germany.&rdquo;

<p>At the end of 2023 Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group reaffirmed within the Horizon 2026 strategy its objective to create a digital asset platform. In February, German regulator BaFin granted Crypto Finance (Deutschland) GmbH four licences which include regulated digital asset trading, settlement, and custody services in Germany. This was another precondition to start the platform, which had received a Multilateral Trading Facility (MTF) licence before already.</p>

<div> Infrastructure, fire prevention, financial resiliency, Securities and Exchange Commission, market resiliency
Summary:<br /><br />Infrastructure, fire prevention, and market resiliency are crucial in preventing financial "fires" like the Great Chicago Fire. The Securities and Exchange Commission works to enhance financial resiliency. <div>
<p><span>In 1871, a century and a half ago, as the story goes, Mrs. O'Leary's cow kicked over a lantern. That led to the Great Chicago Fire, which left over a hundred thousand people without homes and caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damages, and that's in 1871 dollars.</span></p>
<p>




</p>
<p>Now, what does Mrs. O'Leary's cow have to do with the Securities and Exchange Commission?</p>
<p>The Chicago fire was caused by so much more than bovine mischief. It was about building materials and incentives related to Chicago infrastructure. It was about fire prevention, firefighting equipment, building codes.</p>
<p>Chicagoans understood this. When they rebuilt their city, they did it with better infrastructure and standards to prevent fires from starting and then containing the spread. And such investments in resiliency were well worth it. Chicagoans have benefited ever since.</p>
<p>Well, the same is true in finance. History is full of times when fires in one corner of the financial system, or at one financial institution, spread across the broader economy.</p>
<p>And fires can come from either banks or non-banks. And when that happens, the American public, you and me alike, bystanders, just like those Chicagoans who saw their homes burn, inevitably get hurt, losing jobs, homes, businesses, mortgages, and more.</p>
<p>And that's why after a fire in the financial system, the 1929 Market Crash, the ensuing Great Depression, Franklin Roosevelt and Congress came together and established the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>And for 90 years since, Congress repeatedly has enhanced our authorities in the wake of subsequent financial fires. Promoting financial resiliency goes to the core of our three-part mission. It's the essence of fair, orderly, and efficient markets. You see, in normal times it helps promote trust in our capital markets. But in times of stress, it protects investors and issuers alike.</p>
<p>That's why we are updating our rules as technology and business models evolve.</p>
<p>In the U.S. Treasury markets, for instance, we recently adopted rules to promote central clearing in these markets.</p>
<p>We're also working on rules to register dealers, regulate trading platforms, promote greater transparency.</p>
<p>We finalized rules to enhance money market funds&rsquo; risk management.</p>
<p>We finalized rules to shorten the settlement cycle in equity markets, helping ensure that dollars and securities change hands more quickly, lowering risk.</p>
<p>We continue working on rulemaking initiatives to improve visibility into private funds, including hedge funds. It&rsquo;s through a form called &ldquo;Form PF.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We also have a number of cybersecurity projects to enhance market resiliency in the modern digital age.</p>
<p>It's a good thing when our markets can better prevent and withstand fires from cows or any other cause. It benefits investors and issuers alike when we beef up our market resiliency.</p>

Summary:<br />
The EBA launches a consultation on draft RTS for off-balance sheet items under CRR3, aiming to enhance the regulatory framework and risk control. <div>
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<ul>
<li class="body"><em>The EBA plays an important role in the implementation of the Basel III framework through the Banking Package in the EU.&nbsp;</em></li>
<li class="body"><em>These draft technical standards are part of the first phase of the EBA roadmap on the implementation of the EU Banking Package.</em></li>
<li class="body"><em>These draft technical standards will contribute to a more a robust regulatory framework, efficient supervision, and enhanced risk control by credit institutions.&nbsp;</em> </li>
</ul>
<br />
<p class="body">The European Banking Authority (EBA) today launched a public consultation on its draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) under the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR3) regarding off-balance sheet items under the standardised approach of credit risk. &nbsp;These RTS provide the criteria that institutions shall use to classify off-balance sheet items, unless explicitly specified in Annex 1 of the CRR. Further, they specify the factors that may constrain the institutions&rsquo; ability to cancel the unconditionally cancellable commitments. These RTS are part phase 1 of the&nbsp;EBA roadmap on the implementation of the EU banking package. The consultation runs until 4 June 2024.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Under the standardised approach of credit risk, the exposure values of off-balance exposure depend on the application of certain percentages, which in turn depend on a bucket classification. The CRR3 is set to introduce amendments to update the calibration of applicable percentages, which results in the introduction of an adjusted weighting scheme and an additional bucket, increasing the number of risk buckets from 4 to 5, and the conversion factor possibilities to 10%, 20%, 40%, 50% or 100%2. These RTS specifies the criteria that institutions shall use to classify off-balance sheet items, unless explicitly specified in the Level 1 text. Further, they specify factors that may constrain the institutions&rsquo; ability to cancel the unconditionally cancellable commitments.</p>
<h4>Consultation process</h4>
<p>Comments to this consultation can be sent to the EBA by clicking on the "send your comments" button on the consultation page. Please note that the deadline for the submission of comments is 4 June 2024.</p>
<p>The public hearing on these draft RTS will take place via conference call on Monday 22 April 2024 from 14.00 to 16.00 CEST. The EBA invites interested stakeholders to register using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/public-hearing-cp-regarding-crr3-article-1118-balance-sheet-exposures-under-standardised-approach" title="Public Hearing on the CP regarding CRR3 Article 111(8) on off-balance sheet exposures under the standardised approach of credit risk">this link</a>&nbsp;by 18 April 2024 at 16:00 CEST.</p>
<h4>Legal basis and background</h4>
<p>The draft RTS &nbsp;have been developed according to Article 111(8) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR), as amended by the CRR3.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><span>"Whilst installed capacity has remained same in the past few years, Transcorp Power has been able to steadily improve on its capacity utilization rate. In 2023, the Company&rsquo;s utilization rate stood at 78 per cent."</span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><span>The Group Chairman, Nigerian Exchange Group, Alhaji Dr. Umaru Kwairanga commended the listing of 7.5 billion ordinary shares of Transcorp Power on the Main Board of NGX, saying the listing was a testament to the resilience, innovation, and excellence within Nigeria's power sector.</span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><span>He added that it also underscores NGX's pivotal role in driving economic growth and development in our nation, saying "we as an Exchange are determined to ensure that all sectors of Nigeria&rsquo;s economy are fully represented on NGX and that the transparency, sustainability, ethical values, and private sector dynamism that drives the Exchange drives the economy."</span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><span>Kwairanga further said "with a market capitalization exceeding N1 trillion, Transcorp Power's entry into the public market represents a significant milestone, highlighting the increasing confidence and maturity of our capital market.</span></span><span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><span>"It is a clear signal of the transformative journey our energy sector has embarked upon, thanks to the Electric Power Sector Reform Act and subsequent market liberalization."</span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><span>The acting CEO of NGX, Jude Chiemeka stated that with Transcorp Power boasting a remarkable market capitalization of over N1 trillion, marking the first listing of the year, underscored the pivotal role NGX plays in shaping Nigeria&rsquo;s economic landscape.</span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><span>He added that NGX is not just a platform for trading stocks; &ldquo;it is a catalyst for economic growth and development, and we recognize our responsibility in supporting the government's privatization efforts, particularly within the energy sector.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><span>"The listing of Transcorp Power exemplifies our belief that NGX serves as a viable platform for the privatization of energy companies, driving efficiency, innovation, and sectoral growth," he said.</span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><span>Also, the Chief Finance Officer of Transcorp Power, Evans Okpogoro added that The Company's revenue has grown impressively over the past five years, driven by a surge in energy delivery and capacity charge, coupled with the lucrative expansion into international markets.</span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><span>Okpogoro explained that the Company has sustained and grown its EBITDA margins, thereby strengthening its pedigree as one of the leading power generation companies in Nigeria.</span></span></p>

<title>ISDA Publishes Whitepaper Charting The Next Phase Of India’s OTC Derivatives Market</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> whitepaper, India’s financial markets, OTC derivatives market, recommendations, ISDA <br />
Summary: <br />
- ISDA recommends market and policy initiatives to grow India's OTC derivatives market for economic development and risk management. <div>
<p>ISDA has published a new whitepaper that explores the growth of India&rsquo;s financial markets and makes a series of market and policy recommendations to encourage the further development of a safe and efficient over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market.</p>
<p>India&rsquo;s economy is expected to grow strongly in the coming years and is forecast to become the world&rsquo;s third largest by 2030. Despite this, the country&rsquo;s OTC derivatives market remains small, with average daily turnover of interest rate derivatives reported by sales desks in India accounting for just 0.1% of the overall global market in 2022, according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://data.bis.org/topics/DER/tables-and-dashboards/BIS,DER_D12_2,1.0">Bank for International Settlements</a>.</p>
<p>While Indian authorities have taken important steps to develop the country&rsquo;s derivatives market &ndash; notably, by passing legislation to ensure the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2020/09/25/netting-success-in-india/">enforceability of close-out netting</a>&nbsp;in 2020 &ndash; the whitepaper proposes several initiatives that industry participants and regulators could take to create deeper and more liquid domestic derivatives markets and enhance risk management practices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Derivatives are critical for healthy, competitive financial markets and help spur economic growth. They give companies the ability to raise financing at the best rate and manage their risks, enabling those firms to invest and grow. We commend the Indian authorities for taking important steps to develop their domestic derivatives markets, and our paper sets out additional recommendations that we hope the industry and regulators will consider,&rdquo; said Scott O&rsquo;Malia, ISDA&rsquo;s Chief Executive.</p>
<p>The recommendations are centered on five key pillars:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Broaden product development, innovation and diversification:</span>&nbsp;This includes developing standardized term benchmarks to reduce basis risk, expanding the scope of the credit derivatives market beyond the current limited universe of bonds, debentures and money market instruments, and enabling onshore OTC commodity and equity derivatives markets.</li>
<li><span>Foster adoption of similar market and risk principles across regulatory regimes:&nbsp;</span>ISDA recommends the rules governing the use of derivatives by various market participants be aligned. In particular, the rules relating to the use of OTC interest rate and credit derivatives should be harmonized.</li>
<li><span>Enhance market access and diversification of participants in the OTC derivatives market:</span>&nbsp;Regulators and industry participants should work together to develop skills and expertise across the market by holding targeted educational and awareness initiatives.</li>
<li><span>Ensure growth in a safe and efficient manner:</span>&nbsp;ISDA believes initial margin requirements for non-cleared derivatives should be aligned with global standards to ensure domestic markets are safe and efficient. This includes allowing full substituted compliance for Indian branches of foreign banks and expanding the list of eligible collateral.</li>
<li><span>Encourage greater alignment with international principles and practices:</span>&nbsp;Domestic rules should be aligned with international standards wherever possible to increase harmonization and encourage international participation and investment. For example, ISDA recommends the Reserve Bank of India adopt the standardized approach for measuring counterparty credit risk, bringing bank capital rules in India in line with standards developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The paper and full list of recommendations is available&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/03/04/charting-the-next-phase-of-indias-otc-derivatives-market/">here</a>.</p>

<title>UK Companies House Begins Phased Roll Out Of New Powers To Tackle Fraud</title>

<div> Powers, Companies House, ECCT Act, measures, offences
Summary:
Companies House gains new powers under ECCT Act to improve data quality, tackle misuse, and remove inaccurate information. New rules and penalties aim to combat economic crime. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>From today, Companies House has new and enhanced powers to improve the quality and reliability of its data and tackle misuse of the companies register.</p>
<p>The first measures under the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023 (&ldquo;ECCT Act&rdquo;) came into force on Monday 4 March, 2024.</p>
<p>Changes introduced today include:</p>
<ul>
<li>greater powers to query information and request supporting evidence</li>
<li>stronger checks on company names</li>
<li>new rules for registered office addresses. All companies must have an appropriate address at all times. They will not be able to use a PO Box as their registered office address</li>
<li>a requirement for all companies to supply a registered email address</li>
<li>a requirement for subscribers to confirm they&rsquo;re forming a company for a lawful purpose when they incorporate, and for a company to confirm its intended future activities will be lawful on its confirmation statement</li>
<li>greater powers to tackle and remove factually inaccurate information</li>
<li>the ability to share data with other government departments and law enforcement agencies.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>New criminal offences and civil penalties will complement the measures introduced today.</p>
<p>Our priority is cleansing the register to remove details of those appointed without consent.</p>
<p><strong>Companies House CEO Louise Smyth said:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;These new and enhanced powers are the most significant change for Companies House in our 180-year history.</li>
<li>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve known for some time that criminals have misused UK companies to commit fraud, money laundering and other forms of economic crime.</li>
<li>&ldquo;As we start to crack down on abuse of the register, we are prioritising cases where people&rsquo;s names and addresses have been used without their consent. It will now be much quicker and easier to report and remove personal information that has been misused.</li>
<li>&ldquo;This will make a real difference to individuals.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Business Minister Kevin Hollinrake said:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Companies House now have the tools to take a much harder line on criminals who take advantage of the UK&rsquo;s open economy and can now ensure the reputation of our businesses is not tarnished by the UK playing host to the world&rsquo;s scammers.</li>
<li>&ldquo;The new reforms, which come into effect today, provide further protection to the public from companies fraudulently using their address and will begin to remove the smoke and mirrors around companies hiding behind false information. This will enhance the UK&rsquo;s reputation as a great and safe place to do business.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The phased roll out of new powers and requirements is designed to minimise hassle for legitimate businesses. Many of the changes will be integrated into existing reporting cycles, such as the requirement to update a company&rsquo;s confirmation statement.</p>
<p>As further measures are introduced, we will let people who file information with Companies House know what they need to do to via our communications channels and campaigns.</p>

<div> Meeting, IFRS Foundation, IASB, ISSB, Monitoring Board
Summary:<br /><br />The IFRS Foundation Monitoring Board discussed IASB and ISSB activities, emphasized equal importance, support for ISSB standards, and reviewed members' compliance. <div>
<p>During last week&rsquo;s meeting of the IFRS Foundation Monitoring Board in Madrid, Spain, the Monitoring Board discussed the activities of the Trustees of the IFRS Foundation, including their oversight responsibilities of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB). The meeting was joined by the members of the Trustees of the IFRS Foundation under the leadership of Erkki Liikanen, Chair of the Trustees, and also Andreas Barckow, Chair of the IASB, and Emmanuel Faber, Chair of the ISSB.</p>
<p>The Monitoring Board was informed of the ongoing activities of the IFRS Foundation under the new &lsquo;Two Standard Setting Boards (SSBs) under One Foundation&rsquo; model. In response, the Monitoring Board continued to convey its expectations on:</p>
<ul>
<li>connectivity between the financial statements and sustainability-related disclosures, while ensuring mutual independence and balanced resource allocation for their standard setting process. In this context, the Monitoring Board welcomed the progress made by the IFRS Foundation, including the first joint meeting of the IASB and ISSB in January 2024;</li>
<li>further exploration of effective functioning of the multi-location model<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;to maximize the potentials of the two SSBs under the leadership of the Trustees of the IFRS Foundation.</li>
<li>stable and diversified funding to support the work of the two SSBs.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the activities of each SSB, the Monitoring Board reiterated the equal importance of the work of both the IASB and ISSB.</p>
<p>The Monitoring Board recognized significant efforts made by the IFRS Foundation to support the implementation of the ISSB Standards, including the publication of the Preview of the Inaugural　Adoption Guide in February 2024. The Monitoring Board members unanimously called for the IFRS Foundation to continue the constructive and close discussions with the regulators to continue progress toward the shared goal of the global framework for sustainability-related financial information by having jurisdictions adopt, apply or be informed by the ISSB standards.</p>
<p>The Monitoring Board also appreciated that the strategic directions of both the IASB and ISSB are under consideration: the IASB is reviewing its strategy for the next decade, while the ISSB is discussing the next priorities following a Request for Information which was issued to stakeholders. The Monitoring Board will continue to engage with the Trustees on these matters.</p>
<p>The Monitoring Board reconfirmed that ensuring robust due process is the core function of the IFRS Foundation and encouraged continued efforts in this area.</p>
<p>Finally, the Monitoring Board completed its periodic review of existing members against the agreed membership criteria in its Charter<sup>2</sup>. The Monitoring Board concluded that no member had been found non-compliant with the criteria. The Monitoring Board will conduct a further review in five years&rsquo; time.</p>
<p>Takashi Nagaoka, Chairman of the IFRS Monitoring Board and Deputy Commissioner for International Affairs of Japan Financial Services Agency said:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;As Monitoring Board Chair, I am proud to host a joint meeting together with the Chair of the IFRS Foundation Trustees, providing an opportunity for the Monitoring Board members to have a dialogue with the Foundation at this critical moment for the consideration of the ways forward to implement the ISSB Standards as well as the strategic directions of the IASB and ISSB.</em></p>
<p><em>On behalf of my fellow Monitoring Board members, I would like to express my gratitude to Lee White, outgoing Managing Director of the IFRS Foundation, who has served for six years as a critical hub connecting the activities of the Foundation to the varied stakeholders including the Monitoring Board. I also thank Erkki Liikanen, the Chair of the Trustees, for his great leadership in steering the Foundation and congratulate him on his reappointment to serve a third term.&rdquo;</em></p>

<title>ICE Mortgage Monitor: First-Time Homebuyers Make Up Record 47% Of GSE Purchase Loans, 39% Of All GSE Securitizations In 2023</title>

<div> eMBS, first-time homebuyers, agency securities, refinance, mortgage market
Summary:<br />First-time homebuyers dominated 2023's mortgage market, with high DTIs and credit scores. Refinance activity surged as rates dropped, but servicers struggled to retain borrowers.<br /> <div>
<div class="bw-subheadline-wrapper">
<ul>
<li>Though originations hit a 30-year low in 2023, ICE eMBS data shows first-time homebuyers (FTHB) made up the highest share of agency purchase security issuance in at least 10 years</li>
<li>In 2023&rsquo;s 80%+ purchase-driven market, FTHBs account for an exceptionally high share (44%) of overall agency securities issuance, raising the specter of performance risk for MBS investors</li>
<li>The impact is most pronounced among GSE securities, in which FTHB purchase loans account for 39% of all 2023 issuance, a 12 pp higher share than any other vintage in the past decade</li>
<li>ICE data shows FTHBs have higher average front-end debt-to-income (DTI) ratios, but back-end DTIs similar to repeat buyers, spending more on housing but less on other forms of debt</li>
<li>While demand in the mortgage market continues to track closely with interest rate movements, recent periods of easing have highlighted the potential for a rebound in refinance lending if rates move lower</li>
<li>With the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ice.com/fixed-income-data-services/index-solutions/mortgage-rate-lock-indices" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">ICE US Conforming 30-year Fixed Mortgage Rate Lock Index</a><span>&nbsp;showing January rates averaging 6.6%, rate/term refis returned to make up 24% of the month&rsquo;s refinance activity, a nearly two year high</span></li>
<li><a href="https://www.icemortgagetechnology.com/resources/data-reports/february-2024-mortgage-monitor" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">As noted last month</a><span>, industry rate predictions would have millions of recent borrowers in the money for a refi by the end of 2024, yet servicers&rsquo; retention of such borrowers hit a 17-year low in Q4 2023</span></li>
<li>According to ICE Market Trends data, the number of days from rate lock to close matched a 4.5 year low in January, shortening secondary market hedging times</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE:ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, released its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.icemortgagetechnology.com/resources/data-reports" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">March 2024 ICE Mortgage Monitor Report</a>, based on the company&rsquo;s industry-leading mortgage, real estate and public records data sets. Drawing from ICE&rsquo;s eMBS agency securities database and ICE Market Trends originations data, the report notes just 4.3 million mortgages were originated in 2023, the fewest in the 30 years ICE has been tracking the metric.</p>
<p>Andy Walden, ICE Vice President of Enterprise Research Strategy, explains that one byproduct of such low volumes is a significantly altered makeup of recent agency mortgage-backed security (MBS) issuance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since 1995, only two quarters have seen fewer than 1 million first lien mortgages originated,&rdquo; Walden said. &ldquo;The first was Q1 2023, and Q4 the second. Looking back, last year&rsquo;s market was dominated by purchase lending, with loans to buy homes making up 82% of a historically low number of originations. While it remains a tough market for prospective purchasers, our eMBS agency securities database revealed that first-time homebuyers actually made up 55% of all agency purchase mortgages last year. That&rsquo;s the highest share in the 10 years we&rsquo;ve been tracking the metric.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In fact, FTHB purchase loans accounted for an exceptionally high share of all issuance activity last year. They made up 39% of all GSE securitizations in 2023 &ndash; 12 percentage points higher than any other vintage in the past decade. The market in which these folks purchased their first home was one of record house prices, ballooning down payments, rising rates and elevated DTIs. Given record exposure to first-time homebuyer loans, it&rsquo;ll be worth watching the performance of this cohort very closely moving forward, particularly for those invested in 2023 agency MBS.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leveraging ICE Market Trends origination data sheds further light on FTHB trends. While on average, FTHBs have higher front-end DTIs than repeat buyers, their back-end DTIs are more comparable. FTHBs spend a greater share of their income on housing than repeat buyers but pay less on other forms of debt in comparison. While credit scores remain elevated among conventional purchase loans overall, the average FTHB has a 9-point lower credit score than the average repeat buyer. The delta widens among VA purchase loans, with the average FTHB credit score (709) in January 23 points below that of the average repeat buyer (732). Interestingly, FHA loans, the choice for many lower credit score buyers, have broadly the same average credit scores among both first time and repeat buyers.</p>
<p>Demand in the mortgage market continues to closely follow rate movements and remains largely purchase driven. With interest rates averaging 6.6% for the month according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ice.com/fixed-income-data-services/index-solutions/mortgage-rate-lock-indices" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">ICE US Conforming 30-year Fixed Mortgage Rate Lock Index</a>, rate/term refinances &ndash; which have been effectively nonexistent for some time &ndash; made up 24% of January refinance activity, the highest such share in nearly two years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We noted last month that if industry rate projections hold firm, we could see a mini surge of refi activity around the 2023 vintage by the end of 2024,&rdquo; Walden continued. &ldquo;Even the relatively slight rate pullbacks of December and January spurred a growing number of homeowners to refinance. Demand is clearly there when rates cross certain thresholds and, if current rate forecasts hold true, we expect that demand to increase throughout the year. Unfortunately, when it comes to retaining the business of refinancing homeowners, the industry has a lot of ground to make up. Servicers retained just one of every five such borrowers in Q4 2024, a 17-year low.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Providing an exemplary servicing experience is critical to reversing this trend, as is effectively identifying and engaging with customers likely to refinance. And when they have the opportunity to serve that customer, lenders need to be sure the front-end of the process is smooth as well. To that point, we did see the number of days from rate lock to close hit a 4.5 year low in January. In addition to enhancing the consumer experience, that also reduces hedging timelines. Those dynamics are tied tightly to the rate environment and can turn on a dime. Should rates fall, and the market shifts more heavily to refis, hedging times could increase as well &ndash; raising associated hedge duration risk. Industry participants would do well to develop a deep understanding the complexities of this evolving market to capitalize on opportunity and minimize risk.&rdquo;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Nigerian Exchange Group Plc (NGX Group or the Company) is pleased to announce its full-year Audited Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2023, with a profit after tax of N5.2 billion and a declaration of a final dividend of N1.5 billion.</p>
<p>The Group experienced a surge in gross earnings, rising by 57.4% to N11.8 billion in FY 2023 from N7.5 billion in FY 2022. This growth was attributed to performances in core revenue and other income segments. Notably, transaction fees rose by 52.6%, driven by increased trading activities, while listing fees and rental income increased by 42.2% and 41.8%, respectively. Strategic investments also contributed to a 5.4% boost in treasury investment income.</p>
<p>Other income, representing 29.7% of gross earnings, witnessed an unprecedented rise of 163.6%, reaching N3.504 billion. Key contributors to this surge were market data income, which increased by 44.1%, and an exceptional 304.8% rise in other operating income.</p>
<p>In light of the robust operational performance, the Board approved a final dividend of N1.5 billion at 75 Kobo per share for the year ended 31st December 2023.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> licensed virtual asset trading platforms, suspicious websites, online investment scams, SFC, Hong Kong Police Force
Summary:<br /> SFC warns against impersonation of licensed virtual asset trading platforms, reports fund withdrawal difficulties, urges public to verify legitimacy. <br /> <div>
<p>The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) today warned the public against suspicious websites impersonating two licensed virtual asset trading platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li>HSKEX, which impersonates Hash Blockchain Limited, operates at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hskexpro.com/" target="_blank">https://www.hskexpro.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://hskex.com/" target="_blank">https://hskex.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hskexs.com/" target="_blank">https://www.hskexs.com</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://hskexit.com/" target="_blank">https://hskexit.com/</a>; and</li>
<li><a href="https://www.oslexu.com/" target="_blank">www.oslexu.com</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://oslint.com/" target="_blank">www.oslint.com</a>&nbsp;impersonate OSL Digital Securities Limited.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The above-mentioned websites were posted on the SFC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sfc.hk/en/alert-list/suspicious-virtual-asset-trading-platforms" target="_blank">Suspicious Virtual Asset Trading Platforms Alert List</a>&nbsp;on 4 March 2024 following reports on fund withdrawal difficulties.&nbsp; Victims also said they were asked to pay exorbitant &ldquo;fees and taxes&rdquo; to withdraw their funds from the websites.&nbsp; At the SFC&rsquo;s request, the Hong Kong Police Force has taken steps to block access to relevant websites (Note 1).</p>
<p>The SFC once again reminds the public that online investment scams may involve any type of assets and are perpetrated through multiple channels, including social media and instant messaging apps.&nbsp; Investors should stay vigilant and verify the legitimacy of a virtual asset trading platform before making any transactions.</p>
<p>The SFC urges the public to make use of the SFC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://apps.sfc.hk/publicregWeb/searchByName?locale=en" target="_blank">Public Register of Licensed Persons and Registered Institutions</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sfc.hk/en/Welcome-to-the-Fintech-Contact-Point/Virtual-assets/Virtual-asset-trading-platforms-operators/Lists-of-virtual-asset-trading-platforms" target="_blank">List of licensed virtual asset trading platforms</a>&nbsp;for up-to-date information on licensed entities, including their official websites. &nbsp;Investors should also refrain from sending money or making any transactions before verifying the counterparty&rsquo;s identity.</p>
<p>Note:</p>
<ol>
<li>At the time the SFC requested the Hong Kong Police Force to block access to the relevant websites, the websites impersonating OSL Digital Securities Limited were already inaccessible.&nbsp; Hence, the SFC only requested the Hong Kong Police Force to block access to the websites impersonating Hash Blockchain Limited.</li>

<ul>
<li>The total market capitalization of the Equities Market at the end of 2023 was RUB 58.1 trln (USD 647.3 bln). Fee and commission income from the Equities Market was up 113.2%, while trading volumes grew by 30.9%. The discrepancy between fee income and trading volumes dynamics is largely explained by the introduction of a new asymmetric tariff structure that came into effect in November 2022.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Fee income from the Bond Market increased by 67.6% while trading volumes (excluding placements of overnight bonds) improved by 60.1%. Primary market volumes (excluding placements of overnight bonds) were up 45.2%, mostly driven by elevated corporate borrowing activity. Secondary market trading volumes grew by 74.6%. Effective fee dynamics were supported by the tariff optimization that came into effect at the beginning of 2023 as well as the migration of volumes to value-added CCP-based trading modes.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Fee income from the FX Market increased by 30.4%. Trading volumes were up 22.5%. Spot volumes added 7.5%, while swap volumes grew by 31.4%. The effective fee dynamics is explained by two opposing&nbsp;factors: [1] the asymmetric tariff structure favoring liquidity makers on the spot market that came into effect on August&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2022, [2] a shift in the volumes&rsquo; mix towards the less profitable swap segment.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Money Market fee income was up 26.0%. Trading volumes grew by 24.5%. GCC-repo volumes surged by 68.1% to reach nearly RUB 224 trln. CCP repo trading volumes added 35.1%.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Derivatives Market fee income increased by 79.2%. The trading volume stood virtually flat, adding just 3.7%. The discrepancy between fee income and volume dynamics was the result of a shift in volumes&rsquo; mix towards value-added commodity derivatives and the new asymmetric tariff structure implemented in June 2022.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Fee income from the Depository and Settlement Services grew by 24.5%. The growth was primarily explained by a 19.9% increase in the average value of assets under custody. The discrepancy between the growth rates of F&amp;C income and assets on deposit is the result of business lines beyond safekeeping, primarily clearing and collateral management services, which are the reflection of repo operations at the NSD.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>IT Services, Listing and other fee income line was largely driven by Finuslugi revenues. Sale of software and tech. services improved by 34.0% driven by tariffs revision and the introduction of low-latency protocols for market data distribution &ndash; SIMBA ASTS and FIFO TWIME ASTS &ndash; to Equities and FX Markets. Listing and other services grew by 26.6% as primary market activity in equities and bonds recovered. Sales of information services rose by 20.7%, primarily on the back of RUB depreciation during the year. Finuslugi revenues surged by 141.7% as the business unit develops new features and keeps onboarding new clients. Other fee income shrank by 66.1% as base period revenues included additional fees on EUR balances of 0.2 p.p. above the non-positive ECB rate.</li>

<div> supply and demand, inflation, pandemic, employment, Federal Reserve<br />
Summary:<br />Supply and demand imbalances, inflation, and employment illustrate the complex relationship and tradeoffs in pursuing the Federal Reserve's dual mandate. <div>
<p>Thank you, Mark, and thank you for the opportunity to be part of the discussions today.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;For more than 40 years, the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research has assisted economic policymakers by producing sharp analysis and fostering the kind of constructive dialogue reflected in today's agenda.</p>
<p>My topic today is the Federal Reserve's dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices&mdash;and, specifically, the tradeoffs that sometimes arise when pursuing these two objectives. I say "sometimes" because there have been times and certain economic conditions in which such tradeoffs did not arise&mdash;or at least were not apparent. This distinction is an important one, especially when considering the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)'s recent progress in reducing high inflation while the labor market has remained strong. Better understanding the tradeoffs, or lack thereof, in pursuing the dual mandate will help researchers and policymakers draw lessons from these welcome recent developments.</p>
<p><strong>History of the Inflation&ndash;Unemployment Tradeoff</strong><br />In 1977, Congress legislated the Federal Reserve's "dual mandate," under which the FOMC is required to pursue both maximum employment and stable prices, with both objectives on an equal footing.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;At the outset, it is worth stressing that these goals are generally complementary, and I will return to this point shortly. But when they are not complementary, one way to think of the policy problem is in terms of tradeoffs: Maximum employment is the highest level of employment that will not cause inflation to escalate significantly above levels consistent with price stability.</p>
<p>Before going into those tradeoffs, I want to emphasize that achieving the Committee's employment goal on an ongoing basis rests on achieving price stability. Price stability enables long-lasting economic expansions, which strengthen the labor market and expand employment opportunities. This process particularly benefits families and communities that all too often have been left behind.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a></p>
<p>But it is appropriate to recognize also that tradeoffs between the goals of maximum employment and price stability can occur in the short term. Indeed, the potential shorter-term tradeoff between unemployment and inflation has long featured prominently among the economic considerations of policymakers. Government action to boost employment through fiscal or monetary stimulus has historically tended to increase aggregate spending and inflation, too. On the contrary, actions to reduce inflation by shifting to contractionary fiscal or monetary policy have tended to slow economic activity and raise unemployment, or at least slow the pace of job creation.</p>
<p>The idea of a short-run tradeoff is reflected in the original specification of the "Phillips curve," named after New Zealand economist A.W. Phillips, who plotted historical values of the United Kingdom's unemployment rate and growth in nominal wages between 1861 and 1957, showing an often inverse relationship between the two. Although the Phillips curve was initially specified in terms of wages, later versions have more typically compared unemployment with price inflation.</p>
<p>Taken at face value, a tradeoff between keeping employment high and reducing inflation would seem to present policymakers with a dilemma. It suggests that when inflation is well above levels associated with price stability, policymakers must engineer a significant increase in unemployment to bring inflation down. Disinflation can be especially challenging when expectations of future inflation are high.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;We saw this in the 1970s and 1980s. Convincing households and businesses that the FOMC was committed to reducing inflation required accepting a protracted, though ultimately temporary, period of high unemployment, as then Fed Chair Paul Volcker came to believe. Volcker is widely credited with ending the "Great Inflation" experienced at the time through his willingness to induce a punishing recession. He lowered inflation and kept it down, in substantial part by convincing the public that the Fed would keep inflation in check whatever the cost, thereby lowering expectations of future inflation.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a></p>
<p>While long experience shows that there can be a tradeoff between policy actions to pursue maximum employment and stable prices, there are times and conditions when this is not the case, or at least when there is little evidence of a tradeoff. For example, for most of the decade after the Great Recession, FOMC policy was, by some measures at least, highly accommodative, yet inflation ran consistently below the Committee's 2 percent target. So when inflation is below target and employment is below maximum sustainable levels, accommodative policy can be used to pursue both sides of the mandate.</p>
<p>Academic economists have debated for decades about the circumstances in which the tradeoff applies. One strand of the research literature proposes that a central bank can indeed achieve good economic outcomes by focusing on a single mandate, an inflation target, and that policies to promote stable prices can also secure low unemployment. In this view, stabilization of inflation ensures that the economy performs at its optimal level, with firms producing just the right amount such that no resources, including workers, are left on the sidelines. This theory fits in a world in which the economy is driven by demand&mdash;in such a case, shocks coming from the demand side of the economy can be offset by monetary policy, which works via aggregate demand.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a></p>
<p>But in the real world&mdash;which is not so simple&mdash;demand shocks are not the only forces that can drive economic fluctuations. Supply shocks not only exist, but they can also be large and persistent, as we have learned over the past several years. Adverse supply shocks, just like higher inflation expectations, make managing the tradeoff between inflation and unemployment more difficult and costly. While a sharp reduction in demand reduces both economic activity and inflation, a sharp reduction in supply, such as a sudden loss of global oil supply, increases inflation and reduces economic activity. Trying to combat inflation by raising interest rates would further reduce economic activity and employment, while reducing interest rates to boost economic activity and employment raises inflation even higher. Therefore, counteracting a persistent supply shock with monetary policy tools may help with one side of the mandate but create even larger deviations from the other side of the mandate.</p>
<p><strong>Inflation and Unemployment in the Pandemic and Its Aftermath</strong><br />Let me now turn to the pandemic experience. Inflation picked up in 2021, and by mid-2022, 12-month inflation, based on personal consumption expenditures (PCE), hit 7 percent, well above the FOMC's 2 percent target. It was the most significant surge in inflation since the 1970s, prompting fears that it could raise expectations of future inflation and make getting inflation down again require a steep tradeoff&mdash;that is, much higher unemployment.</p>
<p>One more specific concern was that a so-called wage&ndash;price spiral would emerge, as may have been the case for a time in the 1970s. In a tight labor market, expectations of continued high inflation can lead workers trying to maintain their living standards to demand higher raises. In a context of strong aggregate demand, firms will likely grant the wage increases to retain their workers&mdash;then pass through the resulting cost increase as higher prices. To avoid a continuing spiral, demand and supply in labor and product markets must be rebalanced&mdash;through lower aggregate demand, greater aggregate supply, or both.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;If achieving this balance requires a drastic reduction in aggregate demand, then sustainably taming inflation could require a high cost in terms of the employment mandate. Fortunately, we appear to have avoided a wage&ndash;price spiral this time, as I will discuss later.</p>
<p>As inflation rose and began to appear persistent, the FOMC rightly focused on restoring price stability, knowing that without price stability, the economy would not work for anyone and that high inflation would ultimately undermine the strength of the labor market. While interest rates rose rapidly, some feared that the cost of disinflation would be persistently elevated unemployment. But over the past year or so, that tradeoff has been much less evident than many feared. We have seen inflation cool significantly, falling more rapidly than at any time since the 1980s. Yet unemployment remains near the lowest levels seen only a few times since the 1960s.</p>
<p>How have we managed to avoid the familiar tradeoff during this period and see such welcome outcomes on both the inflation and employment fronts? I would propose a few possible reasons. These center on the fact that the pandemic inflation featured both supply and demand shocks. In the limited time that I have today, I don't propose to get into the debate about exactly how much of the recent inflation can be explained by supply as opposed to demand. But I will discuss how both demand and supply forces have been important in the rise and fall in the inflation rate.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a></p>
<p>The pandemic caused a significant reduction in supply in some areas of the economy. Limits on the supply of goods resulted from restricted output in many industries. Consider a key U.S. manufacturing industry, auto production. In 2019, the U.S. manufactured 10-1/2 million light vehicles. In 2020, production plunged to 8-1/2 million, with pandemic-related plant shutdowns followed by worldwide shortages of computer chips and other parts.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;It has taken the industry a long time to recover&mdash;auto production was less than 9 million in 2021 and a bit under 10 million in 2022. Constrained vehicle supply played a big role in boosting auto prices. And it wasn't just motor vehicles; for example, you might recall reports of food processing plant shutdowns, and many other goods-producing industries also suffered from "lost output." U.S. industrial production dropped at the onset of the pandemic and then remained below its pre-pandemic level until early 2022 despite strong demand for physical goods; indeed, evidence shows that output was held down by insufficient supply of materials.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a></p>
<p>But supply problems were not limited to goods; indeed, insufficient supply of labor has also been widely cited by businesses as having held down output. Labor supply was suddenly and severely limited early in the pandemic as workers voluntarily and, in some cases, involuntarily stayed out of the workplace. The labor force did not recover to pre-pandemic levels until mid-2022. Older workers, in particular, left the labor market in large numbers. But even many prime-age workers&mdash;those between the ages of 25 and 54&mdash;withdrew because of school disruptions and health concerns, and prime-age labor force participation remained below its pre-pandemic level until early 2023. A slowdown in immigration, likewise, deprived the economy of a customary source of labor supply growth, as did elevated mortality due to COVID-19.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a></p>
<p>Fortunately, these supply shortages for both goods and labor have mostly dissipated. For example, auto production in 2023 nearly regained its 2019 level, and industrial production as well as various goods supply indicators have returned closer to their pre-pandemic levels. Congestion in logistics and transportation networks eased, and firms sometimes found alternative supply chain networks.</p>
<p>In the labor market, shortages directly related to the pandemic have eased, helping restore labor force participation, likely in part because of the reopening of schools, progress with the health situation, and help from childcare subsidies and other policies. Increased capabilities for remote work, allowing for a decoupling between firm and worker location, expanded the pool of available workers and jobs. More broadly, strong labor demand has enticed more workers into the labor market to the point that labor force participation among prime-age workers is now above pre-pandemic levels. And immigration has rebounded as well.</p>
<p>Another, more subtle source of labor market supply recovery has been improvements in the quality of matches between firms and workers. At any time, a crucial factor that affects labor supply is how well the skills of available workers fulfill the needs of employers. With labor in many sectors in short supply and very high numbers of job openings, many workers quit their jobs to move to new ones. Economists generally believe that increased labor turnover improves worker&ndash;firm matches&mdash;workers find jobs that make better use of their skills, typically with higher pay, and firms find workers that are better suited for their businesses and are more productive at their jobs. Economic expansions, such as the one that has continued since April 2020, present more opportunities for workers to find a good match.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a>&nbsp;And it appears that workers and firms were pretty efficient at finding each other over the past couple of years, likely upgrading the average quality of a job match in the process.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a>&nbsp;Higher-quality job&ndash;worker matches improve the productivity of workers, serving like a boost to labor supply.</p>
<p>If reductions in supply contributed to inflation, then recovery of that supply would help lower inflation, too. Supply improvements in the goods sector have helped ease inflation starting in early 2022; for example, in January, the 12-month growth of new motor vehicle prices was less than 1 percent, far slower than its peak pace above 13 percent in the spring of 2022. More broadly, the overall price level for core PCE goods, which excludes food and energy, was fairly flat last year and has actually declined in recent months.</p>
<p>On the labor side, supply recovery has likely contributed to disinflation by helping to ease the pace of wage growth&mdash;especially in the labor-intensive services industries.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn14" title="footnote 14"><span>14</span></a><a name="f14"></a>&nbsp;For private services as a whole, 12-month nominal wage growth, as measured by average hourly earnings, was 4.5 percent in January, down from its peak of 5.9 percent in early 2022. And, sure enough, price inflation in services has also slowed: In core PCE services&mdash;which accounts for roughly three-fourths of core PCE&mdash;12-month inflation was 4.1 percent in January, down from its peak of 5.8 percent early last year.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn15" title="footnote 15"><span>15</span></a><a name="f15"></a></p>
<p>But supply is not the only factor behind the slowing of inflation. Policies affecting aggregate demand have played a role as well. On the fiscal side, measures of the impact of government spending on economic growth turned negative in 2021 after being strongly supportive in 2020.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn16" title="footnote 16"><span>16</span></a><a name="f16"></a>&nbsp;And in terms of monetary policy, the FOMC's actions in late 2021 indicated a sooner-than-previously-anticipated start to policy rate increases, with the FOMC beginning to raise the target range for the federal funds rate in March 2022. After that, the Committee tightened its stance of policy expeditiously. The result can be seen especially in areas of the economy that are sensitive to financial conditions. The housing sector saw a significant slowdown, with residential investment declining more than 15 percent in 2022 and remaining flat in 2023. Growth of investment in equipment was tepid last year, likely due in part to restrictive financial conditions, even as we have seen growth in manufacturing construction for semiconductors and electric vehicle batteries that will help address remaining supply-side bottlenecks.</p>
<p>Aside from these examples of subdued spending in policy-sensitive sectors, we can also see the imprint of monetary policy in the anchoring of inflation expectations. Even amid high inflation, households, businesses, and financial markets believed that inflation would eventually return to its target pace. These beliefs were guided by the FOMC's actions: By raising policy rates expeditiously and communicating clearly, the Committee demonstrated its resolve to lower inflation to 2 percent and its commitment to the price-stability mandate. Anchored inflation expectations are apparent, for example, in the popular University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers. Expectations of inflation for the period covering the next 5 to 10 years have remained relatively stable over the pandemic and close to levels seen before the pandemic. And shorter-term expectations rose in 2021 but have come back down recently.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn17" title="footnote 17"><span>17</span></a><a name="f17"></a>&nbsp;Anchored inflation expectations likely matter for actual price setting. That is what modern theories of the Phillips curve suggest. And the relevance of that theoretical expectation has been suggested by surveys reported by Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond staff: The data show a close relationship between firms' expectations for overall inflation and those firms' own price-setting plans.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn18" title="footnote 18"><span>18</span></a><a name="f18"></a>&nbsp;Crucially, by keeping inflation expectations anchored, the FOMC has likely forestalled the development of wage&ndash;price spiral dynamics of the kind I mentioned earlier, while also creating conditions in which inflation has been able to peak at a lower rate than would have been the case if the FOMC had not acted with credibility and clear communication. Real wage growth&mdash;that is, growth of wages after accounting for inflation&mdash;has turned positive, which means workers' income is rising faster than the cost of living.</p>
<p><strong>A Couple of Final Observations about the Pandemic and Its Aftermath</strong><br />These developments help bring us back to the inflation&ndash;unemployment tradeoff that started my discussion. The pandemic experience has shown that the nature of that tradeoff changes with economic conditions, as does the steepness of the Phillips curve. I will close by making two more general observations about the changes that we have seen during the pandemic and its aftermath, with suggestions about open questions for researchers moving forward.</p>
<p>First, supply curves are, as economists say, "convex": Their slope increases sharply after quantity supplied reaches a certain point, such that prices rise quickly. The steep part of the supply curve can come into play when demand nears the limits of an industry's capacity. That could happen either because of an unusually large increase in demand or because of a temporary reduction in industry capacity&mdash;or both. Research has shown this is the case for individual industries, even in the pre-pandemic period.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn19" title="footnote 19"><span>19</span></a><a name="f19"></a>&nbsp;During the pandemic, many industries experienced large demand shocks or supply curtailment that contributed to inflation, as I have already discussed, and those same shocks also may have exacerbated the inflationary effects by pushing many industries up the steep part of their supply curves.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn20" title="footnote 20"><span>20</span></a><a name="f20"></a></p>
<p>Early in the pandemic, the convexity or steepness of industry supply curves was quite costly in terms of our inflation mandate. But it has likely helped us more recently as we have apparently moved back down the steep part of the supply curve in many industries, which has allowed for rapid disinflation.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn21" title="footnote 21"><span>21</span></a><a name="f21"></a>&nbsp;An open question in the longer term is whether this process has helped firms learn more about supply chains and inventory management such that we might even be less likely to encounter the steep part of supply curves in the future.</p>
<p>Second, with regard to the Phillips curve specifically, I note that in a large class of economic models, the steepness of the Phillips curve is partly a function of how frequently firms adjust their prices, and that seems to be borne out by recent experience.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn22" title="footnote 22"><span>22</span></a><a name="f22"></a>&nbsp;Before the pandemic, the typical price tag lasted more than 10 months, and this figure was reasonably stable for many years. But the pandemic seems to have moved firms into a regime of more frequent price adjustment&mdash;that is, shorter price duration. By early 2022, the typical price was lasting less than five months. Price adjustment frequency has since slowed back down, with the latest data from the third quarter of last year suggesting prices were lasting nearly seven months.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn23" title="footnote 23"><span>23</span></a><a name="f23"></a>&nbsp;Continued slowing of price adjustment frequency is an indicator that firms' costs are rising less quickly and the economy is moving back down the Phillips curve.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn24" title="footnote 24"><span>24</span></a><a name="f24"></a>&nbsp;Interestingly, though, in the workhorse academic models used for studying the effects of monetary policy on the economy, the frequency of price adjustment is often assumed to be constant. Of course, economists have thought about this in the past; but a greater understanding of the relationship between the price adjustment decisions of individual firms and overall inflation is an important area for further academic research.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn25" title="footnote 25"><span>25</span></a><a name="f25"></a></p>
<p>For the reasons I have been discussing, I am cautiously optimistic that we will see continued progress on disinflation without significant deterioration of the labor market. With respect to the inflation and unemployment tradeoff, we have certainly learned a lot during the pandemic&mdash;but there is still much more to learn. In particular, I look forward to further research that can enrich the economics profession's understanding of the inflation&ndash;unemployment tradeoff and the Phillips curve and continue informing policymakers as well.</p>

<p><a name="fn1"></a>1. The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn2"></a>2. Before 1977, the Federal Reserve viewed itself as having a dual mandate because it was covered by the Employment Act of 1946, which gave the whole federal government a list of objectives that included maximum employment and maximum "purchasing power." The predominant interpretation of the latter objective was that it corresponded to price stability.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn3"></a>3. L&oacute;pez-Salido, Markowitz, and Nelson (2024) provide a longer-term perspective on how the Federal Reserve has viewed price stability as necessary for achieving maximum employment on a sustained basis. See David L&oacute;pez-Salido, Emily Markowitz, and Edward Nelson (2024), "Continuity and Change in the Federal Reserve's Perspective on Price Stability," manuscript, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Division of Monetary Affairs, January.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn4"></a>4. In the context of achieving disinflation, the tradeoff between inflation and unemployment is sometimes referred to as the "sacrifice ratio." Estimates of the quantitative magnitude of this ratio vary widely, depending on the period being studied and the nature of the macroeconomic model being used. Model-based explorations do suggest that inflation expectations matter for the size of the ratio. For a helpful discussion and analysis, see Robert J. Tetlow (2022), "<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2022079pap.pdf">How Large Is the Output Cost of Disinflation? (PDF)</a>" Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2022-079 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, November).&nbsp;</p>

Rasche (2005), "<a href="https://doi.org/10.20955/r.87.187-236">The Reform of October 1979: How It Happened and Why</a>," Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis,&nbsp;<em>Review,</em>&nbsp;vol. 87 (March/April, Part 2), pp. 187-235.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn6"></a>6. For discussion of the notion that inflation-targeting monetary policy can achieve both stable prices and maximum employment, see Ben S. Bernanke, Thomas Laubach, Frederic S. Mishkin, and Adam S. Posen (1999),&nbsp;<em>Inflation Targeting: Lessons from the International Experience</em>&nbsp;(Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press). More recently, this notion has been called the "divine coincidence" (see Olivier Blanchard and Jordi Gal&iacute; (2007), "Real Wage Rigidities and the New Keynesian Model,"&nbsp;<em>Journal of Money, Credit and Banking</em>, vol. 39 (February), pp. 35&ndash;65).&nbsp;</p>

Bernanke (2006), "<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20060224a.htm">The Benefits of Price Stability</a>," speech delivered at the Center for Economic Policy Studies and on the occasion of the Seventy-Fifth Anniversary of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, Princeton University, Princeton, N.J., February 24.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn8"></a>8. Precisely quantifying the relative roles of supply and demand in the pandemic inflation will likely remain a controversial pursuit for some time. One approach is to focus on relative movements of particular prices and of specific output categories in a "bottom up" manner, as illustrated, for example, by Adam Hale Shapiro (2022), "Decomposing Supply and Demand Driven Inflation," working paper, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, February<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/">.</a>&nbsp;An alternative approach is to conduct a "top down" time-series analysis relating aggregate data on wages, prices, labor market tightness, and various measures of goods supply conditions, as illustrated by Olivier J. Blanchard and Ben S. Bernanke (2023), "<a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w31417">What Caused the U.S. Pandemic-Era Inflation?</a>" NBER Working Paper Series 31417 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, June). The two approaches can complement each other by providing alternative, but mutually consistent, perspectives on the same problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn9"></a>9. The auto industry's experience during the pandemic is a good example of how many industries' production functions are, in economists' terms, "Leontief," meaning that shortages of even one key component can restrict production even if other components are available. The prevalence of this kind of production in many industries made the broader supply chain particularly vulnerable to the extreme pandemic supply shocks. A helpful discussion&mdash;which predates the pandemic and focuses on the 2011 Japan earthquake&mdash;is Christoph E. Boehm, Aaron Flaaen, and Nitya Pandalai-Nayar (2019), "Input Linkages and the Transmission of Shocks: Firm-Level Evidence from the 2011 Tōhoku Earthquake,"&nbsp;<em>Review of Economics and Statistics,</em>&nbsp;vol. 101 (March), pp. 60&ndash;75.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn10"></a>10. Industrial production was low despite strong demand: New orders indexes from many sources were elevated throughout late 2020 and 2021. The Census Bureau's Quarterly Survey of Plant Capacity Utilization features questions on reasons for factory output being below capacity. "Insufficient supply of materials" and "insufficient supply of labor" both surged starting in late 2020 and remained near peak levels from mid-2021 through mid-2022 before starting to move back down. Separately, the Institute for Supply Management's Report on Business Manufacturing PMI (Purchasing Managers Index) features lists of items in short supply each month; the share of major manufacturing-sector input material groups reported as being in short supply surged to about 40 percent during 2021 and has since declined to below 10 percent. For a more formal approach to measuring lost output in manufacturing industries, see Charles Gilbert, Maria D. Tito, and Cynthia Doniger (2021), "<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/quantifying-bottlenecks-in-manufacturing-20211119.html">Quantifying Bottlenecks in Manufacturing</a>," FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, November 19).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn11"></a>11. Per data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Current Population Survey, the labor force level among foreign-born workers had a pre-pandemic peak about a year before the pandemic and did not fully recover to this peak until early 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn12"></a>12. Past research has found that job quality is higher in expansions; see Gadi Barlevy (2002), "The Sullying Effect of Recessions,"&nbsp;<em>Review of Economic Studies,</em>&nbsp;vol. 69 (January), pp. 65&ndash;96. In the pandemic specifically, job-to-job flows appear to have featured strong wage growth; see David Autor, Arindrajit Dube, and Annie McGrew (2023), "<a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w31010">The Unexpected Compression: Competition at Work in the Low Wage Labor Market</a>," NBER Working Paper Series 31010 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, November).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn13"></a>13. There are various ways to measure "matching efficiency." One such measure shows an initial decline in matching efficiency early in the pandemic, followed by a recovery to (roughly) pre-pandemic levels. See Simon Mongey and Jeff Horwich (2023), "<a href="https://www.minneapolisfed.org/article/2023/are-job-vacancies-still-as-plentiful-as-they-appear-implications-for-the-soft-landing">Are Job Vacancies Still as Plentiful as They Appear? Implications for the 'Soft Landing,'</a>&nbsp;" Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, December 1.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn14"></a>14. In general, the most labor-intensive sectors (measured as labor costs' share of value added) are mostly services sectors. As of 2022, the labor cost share of value added was 83 percent in education and health services, 75 percent in professional and business services, 64 percent in construction, and 59 percent in leisure and hospitality. See Bureau of Economic Analysis (2023), "<a href="https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/?reqid=150&amp;step=2&amp;isuri=1&amp;categories=gdpxind">Interactive Data</a>," tables on composition of gross output by industry," December.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn15"></a>15. The connection between wages and prices in services industries has been explored in the economics literature and been found to be a likely contributor to the higher "stickiness" or persistence of services prices relative to goods prices. See Ekaterina Peneva (2011), "Some Evidence on Factor Intensity and Price Rigidity,"&nbsp;<em>Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control,</em>&nbsp;vol. 35 (October), pp. 1652&ndash;58.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn16"></a>16. See, for example, the Hutchins Center Fiscal Impact Measure, which estimates the effect of government tax and spending policy on gross domestic product growth. The measure is available on the Brookings Institution's website at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/hutchins-center-fiscal-impact-measure/">https://www.brookings.edu/articles/hutchins-center-fiscal-impact-measure</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn17"></a>17. Expected inflation in the New York Fed's Survey of Consumer Expectations shows a similar pattern to that seen in the Michigan survey. And expectations appear well anchored in surveys of forecasters and in market-based measures.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn18"></a>18. See Felipe F. Schwartzman and Sonya Ravindranath Waddell (2024), "<a href="https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/economic_brief/2024/eb_24-03">Inflation Expectations and Price Setting among Fifth District Firms</a>," Economic Brief 24-03 (Richmond, Va.: Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, January).&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="fn20"></a>20. For an accessible discussion, see Deepa D. Datta, Laura Feiveson, Ekaterina Peneva, and Gisela Rua (2022), "<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/bottlenecks-shortages-and-soaring-prices-in-the-us-economy-20220624.html">Bottlenecks, Shortages, and Soaring Prices in the U.S. Economy</a>," FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, June 24).</p>
<p><a name="fn21"></a>21. For a formal treatment of the notion that monetary policy can be particularly effective at lowering inflation without large output losses following supply and capacity issues, see Xiwen Bai, Jes&uacute;s Fern&aacute;ndez-Villaverde, Yiliang Li, and Francesco Zanetti (2024), "The Causal Effects of Global Supply Chain Disruptions on Macroeconomic Outcomes: Evidence and Theory," working paper, January, available on the University of Pennsylvania website at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~jesusfv/Supply_Chain_Disruption.pdf">https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~jesusfv/Supply_Chain_Disruption.pdf</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn22"></a>22. In a broad set of models on inaction and action in the face of uncertainty and "non-convex" adjustment costs, firms may choose not to change prices even when faced with shocks, provided the shocks are small. But large shocks move firms out of their "inaction range" such that a series of large shocks can increase adjustment frequency. This can potentially explain reduced price "stickiness" in the pandemic. However, this outcome was not necessarily inevitable, as higher uncertainty can reduce adjustment frequency (due to raising the "real option" value of waiting), and the pandemic environment has been uncertain in many dimensions. For discussions, see Joseph Vavra (2014), "Inflation Dynamics and Time-Varying Volatility: New Evidence and an Ss Interpretation,"&nbsp;<em>Quarterly Journal of Economics,</em>&nbsp;vol. 129 (February), pp. 215&ndash;58; and Robert E. Hall (2023), "<a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w31025">A Major Shock Makes Prices More Flexible and May Result in a Burst of Inflation or Deflation</a>," NBER Working Paper Series 31025 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, March).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn23"></a>23. See updated data from Hugh Montag and Daniel Villar (2023), "<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/price-setting-during-the-covid-era-20230829.html">Price-Setting during the Covid Era</a>," FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, August 29).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn24"></a>24. The previous inflationary episode experienced by the U.S.&mdash;during the late 1970s and early 1980s&mdash;saw similar dynamics of price adjustment frequency; see Emi Nakamura, Jon Steinsson, Patrick Sun, and Daniel Villar (2018), "The Elusive Costs of Inflation: Price Dispersion during the U.S. Great Inflation,"&nbsp;<em>Quarterly Journal of Economics,&nbsp;</em>vol. 133 (November), pp. 1933&ndash;80.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn25"></a>25. I am referring here to the standard "New Keynesian" model, in which firms are allowed to adjust prices only if they receive a random signal whose probability distribution is typically constant and independent of the duration of the firm's current price level (so-called Calvo pricing). Allowing for price adjustment frequency and inflation to move together is one possible way to generate a "nonlinear" Phillips curve; for example, see Andres Blanco, Corina Boar, Callum J. Jones, and Virgiliu Midrigan (2024), "<a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w32094">Non-Linear Inflation Dynamics in Menu Cost Economies</a>," NBER Working Paper Series 32094 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, January).&nbsp;</p>

<div> Corruption, Bribery, Guilty plea, FCPA violations, Gunvor S.A.  
Summary:  
Gunvor S.A. pleads guilty to FCPA violations, pays over $661 million, bribed Ecuadorian officials, cooperates with U.S. authorities. International investigation and guilty pleas follow.  
Gunvor S.A. pays $661 million to settle FCPA violations, admitting to bribing Ecuadorean officials, and faces significant monetary penalties and forfeitures. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>Gunvor S.A. (Gunvor), an international commodities trading company based in Switzerland, has pleaded guilty and will pay over $661 million to resolve an investigation by the U.S. Justice Department into violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).</p>
<p>Gunvor&rsquo;s guilty plea stemmed from the company&rsquo;s corrupt scheme to pay substantial bribes to Ecuadorean government officials to secure business with Ecuador&rsquo;s state-owned and state-controlled oil company, Petroecuador.</p>
<p>In connection with the resolution, Gunvor entered into a plea agreement with the government and pleaded guilty to an information charging the company with conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA.&nbsp;Following the plea, the court sentenced Gunvor to pay a criminal monetary penalty of $374,560,071 and to forfeit $287,138,444 in ill-gotten gains. The sentence includes credits of up to one-quarter of the criminal fine each for amounts Gunvor pays to resolve investigations by Swiss and Ecuadorean authorities into the same misconduct so long as the payments are made within one year of today&rsquo;s date. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland announced today a parallel resolution of its investigation into Gunvor&rsquo;s misconduct that involved payment of approximately $98 million by Gunvor to Swiss authorities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over nearly a decade, Gunvor representatives bribed high-level government officials at Ecuador&rsquo;s state-owned oil company to enter into business transactions with other state-owned entities that ultimately benefited Gunvor. As a result of this complex bribery scheme, Gunvor obtained hundreds of millions of dollars in illicit profits,&rdquo; said Acting Senior Counselor Brent S. Wible of the Justice Department&rsquo;s Criminal Division. &ldquo;Foreign bribery emboldens corrupt officials and undermines the rule of law. Gunvor&rsquo;s guilty plea demonstrates that the Criminal Division remains resolute in our efforts to root out bribery and official corruption. We will continue to hold both corporations and individuals who bribe foreign officials to account, in coordination with our international partners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s guilty plea and sentencing marks yet another example of this office&rsquo;s efforts to combat widespread corruption,&rdquo; said U.S. Attorney Breon Peace for the Eastern District of New York. &ldquo;Corruption erodes the public&rsquo;s trust in their government, prevents government officials from acting in the best interests of the people they represent and harms businesses that play by the rules, driving up prices for consumers. The Justice Department, including my office, will not tolerate bribes being paid by American companies or foreign companies misusing the U.S. financial system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gunvor&rsquo;s years-long bribery scheme involving high-level Ecuadoran officials was both detrimental to the business environment and eroded the public&rsquo;s trust and confidence in their government,&rdquo; said Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey B. Veltri of the FBI Miami Field Office. &ldquo;This guilty plea and significant fine would not have been possible without significant cooperation from our international partners in the Cayman Islands, Colombia, Curacao, Ecuador, Panama, Portugal, Singapore, and Switzerland. This truly was an international effort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to the company&rsquo;s admissions and court documents, between 2012 and 2020, Gunvor and its co-conspirators paid more than $97 million to intermediaries knowing that some of the money would be and in fact was used to bribe Ecuadorean officials, including Nilsen Arias Sandoval, a then-high ranking official at Petroecuador.&nbsp;As part of the scheme, Gunvor managers and agents attended meetings in the United States and elsewhere. The bribe payments were routed through banks in the United States using shell companies in Panama and the British Virgin Islands controlled by Gunvor&rsquo;s co-conspirators.&nbsp;Among other things, a Gunvor employee also directed one of the intermediaries to use the money to purchase an 18-karat gold Patek Philippe watch for Arias.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In exchange for these bribe payments, high-level Ecuadorian officials helped various state-owned entities, which were acting as front companies for Gunvor, win the rights to a series of oil-backed loan contracts with Petroecuador. This structure allowed Gunvor and its co-conspirators to avoid a competitive bidding process and to obtain contractual terms that it could not have obtained otherwise.&nbsp;Gunvor also received confidential Petroecuador information in exchange for the bribes. In total, Gunvor earned more than $384 million in profits from the contracts it obtained corruptly from Petroecuador.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The department reached this resolution with Gunvor based on a number of factors, including, among others, the nature and seriousness of the offense. Gunvor received credit for its cooperation with the department&rsquo;s investigation, which included: (i) producing documents to the department from multiple foreign countries expeditiously while navigating foreign data privacy and criminal laws; (ii) providing information obtained through its own internal investigation to the department, which allowed the department to preserve and obtain evidence as part of the department&rsquo;s investigation; (iii) making detailed, factual presentations to the department; (iv) arranging for the interview of an employee based outside the United States; (v) promptly collecting, analyzing, and organizing voluminous information, including complex financial information, at the request of the department, and producing an analysis of trading activity conducted by multiple outside forensic accounting firms retained by Gunvor; (vi) translating foreign language documents to facilitate and expedite review by the department; and (vii) imaging the phones of relevant custodians at the beginning of Gunvor&rsquo;s internal investigation, thus preserving business communications sent on mobile messaging applications.</p>
<p>Gunvor also engaged in timely and appropriate remedial measures, including: (i)&nbsp;eliminating the use of third-party business origination agents; (ii) enhancing its third party due-diligence process; (iii) developing and implementing a control framework for internal business developers and additional layers of review and approval for counterparty payments; (iv)&nbsp;enhancing the independent compliance committee with responsibility for reviewing high-risk transactions; (v) engaging resources to review its compliance program and test the effectiveness of its overall reporting process, its reporting hotline and the effectiveness of the investigation of reports made through the hotline; (vi) evaluating and updating its compensation policy to better incentivize compliance with the law and corporate policies; (vii) hiring additional compliance personnel; (viii) testing and enhancing its compliance program, including by conducting compliance culture reviews, testing new third party due diligence process and payment controls, and evaluating controls around business development activities; and (ix) developing and implementing a risk-based business communications policy that addresses the use of ephemeral and encrypted messaging applications.</p>
<p>The department also considered Gunvor&rsquo;s history of misconduct. In October 2019, Gunvor reached a resolution with the Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland concerning a corrupt scheme to bribe officials in Congo-Brazzaville and C&ocirc;te d&rsquo;Ivoire to secure oil contracts obtained between approximately 2009 and 2012. As part of the 2019 Swiss resolution, Gunvor admitted that it lacked sufficient controls to prevent the underlying misconduct and failed to take &ldquo;all the reasonable organizational measures&rdquo; required to prevent Gunvor&rsquo;s employees and agents from engaging in bribery. The conduct that is the subject of today&rsquo;s guilty plea occurred, in part, at the same time as the prior Swiss investigation and resolution.</p>
<p>In light of these considerations, the department determined that the appropriate resolution in this case was for Gunvor to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA. The criminal fine calculated under the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines reflects a 25% reduction off the 30th&nbsp;percentile of the applicable guidelines fine range, taking into account Gunvor&rsquo;s cooperation and remediation, as well as its prior history.</p>
<p>The department previously secured convictions in the Eastern District of New York of four individuals who were implicated in Gunvor&rsquo;s bribery scheme, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Antonio Pere Ycaza, a former consultant for Gunvor, pleaded guilty on Oct. 7, 2020, to one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering.</li>
<li>Enrique Pere Ycaza, a former consultant for Gunvor, also pleaded guilty on Oct. 7, 2020, to one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering and to violate the FCPA.</li>
<li>Raymond Kohut, a former Gunvor employee and agent, pleaded guilty on April 6, 2021, to one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering.</li>
<li>Nilsen Arias Sandoval, a former senior Petroecuador official, pleaded guilty on Jan. 19, 2022, to one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FBI Miami Field Office is investigating the case, with assistance from the FBI&rsquo;s International Corruption Unit.</p>
<p>Trial Attorney Clayton P. Solomon and Assistant Chiefs Derek J. Ettinger and Jonathan P. Robell of the Criminal Division&rsquo;s Fraud Section, Trial Attorney D. Hunter Smith and Deputy Chief Adam J. Schwartz of the Criminal Division&rsquo;s Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Nick M. Axelrod, Jonathan P. Lax, and Matthew R. Galeotti for the Eastern District of New York are prosecuting the case. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Laura Mantell and Brendan King for the Eastern District of New York are handling forfeiture matters.</p>
<p>The Justice Department&rsquo;s Office of International Affairs and authorities in the Cayman Islands, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Portugal, Singapore, and Switzerland provided valuable assistance.</p>
<p>The Criminal Division&rsquo;s Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice Department&rsquo;s FCPA enforcement efforts can be found at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa">www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa</a>.</p>
<p>The Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative is led by a team of dedicated prosecutors in the Criminal Division&rsquo;s Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, in partnership with federal law enforcement agencies, and often with U.S. Attorneys&rsquo; Offices, to forfeit the proceeds of foreign official corruption and, where appropriate, to use those recovered assets to benefit the people harmed by these acts of corruption and abuse of office.</p>

<div> FTSE Russell, index provider, annual Russell US Indexes rebalancing schedule, market shifts reflected, transparent, predictable process, 40th anniversary, IPO additions.<br />
Summary:<br />FTSE Russell announces 2024 Russell Indexes rebalancing schedule, 40th anniversary, IPO additions, market shifts reflected, transparent, predictable process. <div>
<div class="tr-VerticalSpacing tr-VerticalSpacing--m">
<div class="tr-RichText   ">
<p><span>FTSE Russell, the global index provider, today confirms the schedule for the 36<span>th</span>&nbsp;annual&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lseg.com/en/ftse-russell/russell-reconstitution">Reconstitution</a>&nbsp;of its Russell US Indexes suite, set to occur at the end of June.&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="tr-VerticalSpacing tr-VerticalSpacing--l">
<div class="tr-RichText   ">
<p>This rebalancing process is designed to capture market shifts from the previous year to ensure the Russell US Indexes continue to accurately reflect the US equity market.</p>
<p>The 2024 Russell Reconstitution schedule is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Tuesday, April 30<span>th</span></span>&nbsp;&ndash; &ldquo;Rank Day&rdquo; &ndash; Index membership eligibility for 2024 Russell Reconstitution determined from constituent market capitalization at market close.</li>
<li><span>Friday, May 24<span>th</span></span>&nbsp;&ndash; Preliminary index additions &amp; deletions membership lists posted to the website after 6 PM US eastern time.</li>
<li><span>Friday, May 31<span>st</span></span>,&nbsp;<span>June 7<span>th</span>, 14<span>th</span>&nbsp;and 21<span>st</span></span>&nbsp;&ndash; Preliminary membership lists (reflecting any updates) posted to the website after 6 PM US eastern time.</li>
<li><span>Monday, June 10<span>th</span></span>&nbsp;&ndash; &ldquo;Lock-down&rdquo; period begins with the updates to reconstitution membership considered to be final.</li>

<li><span>Monday, July 1<span>st</span></span>&nbsp;&ndash; Equity markets open with the newly reconstituted Russell US Indexes.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p><span>Catherine Yoshimoto, Director, Product Management, FTSE Russell, said:&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;With a US equity market that is constantly changing, it is critical that the entire Russell US Indexes suite undergoes a complete recalibration to ensure the indexes accurately reflect company size and style shifts that have occurred since the last reconstitution. This annual event is widely followed and traditionally concludes with one of the highest trading volume days of the year, making our transparent, rules-based methodology a key element to a seamless and predictable process for investors. This year, we not only celebrate the 36<span>th</span>&nbsp;annual Russell Reconstitution but also the 40<span>th</span>&nbsp;anniversary of the launch of the Russell US Indexes.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Annual reconstitution and quarterly IPO additions provide an important foundation for FTSE Russell&rsquo;s widely used Russell US Indexes. These index governance processes are designed to ensure that the indexes remain a current and relevant measure of US equity market performance.</p>
<p>On February 16<span>th</span>, FTSE Russell announced the 1Q2024&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lseg.com/en/ftse-russell/russell-reconstitution/ipo-additions">preliminary list of IPO additions</a>, which will take effect at the market open of March 18<span>th</span>. As of 1Q2024, there are no preliminary additions to the Russell 1000 Index and seven additions to the Russell 3000 Index, all of which will be added to the small cap Russell 2000 Index. There will also be six IPOs added to the Russell Microcap Index.</p>

<title>FESE Response To The IOSCO Consultation Report On Market Outages</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/fese-response-to-the-iosco-consultation-report-on-market-outages/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/fese-response-to-the-iosco-consultation-report-on-market-outages/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>FESE agrees with the key findings in IOSCO&rsquo;s consultation report. We believe the recommended good practices around outage and communication plans, the reopening of trading, the closing auction and alternative prices, and the post-outage plan are largely appropriate.</p>
<p>We would also like to thank IOSCO for acknowledging FESE&rsquo;s frameworks for industry-wide standard protocols and highlighting that the EU enjoys a comprehensive regulatory framework on outages. Looking at the details of the IOSCO findings, it is clear that one particular approach will not work in all cases, especially given the differences between equities and derivatives venues. The report also states that, in some jurisdictions with multiple trading venues, alternative venues could be used should a market outage occur on one of the markets. However, in the fragmented European trading landscape, if the primary venue experiences an outage, it is unlikely that other venues which generally follow the prices formed on the primary would be able to continue offering trading.</p>

<div> asymmetric effects, term premium, QE and QT announcement effects, QE execution, QT execution<br />
Summary: The author discusses the asymmetric effects of quantitative easing and quantitative tightening, the term premium, QE execution, QT execution, and the implications of QT in the United States. <div>
<p>Thank you, it is great to be here. I'm pleased to participate in this panel to discuss a policy action now being implemented by central banks around the globe: quantitative tightening (QT).<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240301a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;I want to thank Kristin, Matt, and Wenxin for putting together a great paper that provides an overview of the effects of QT across seven central banks.</p>
<p>Often called "large-scale asset purchases" (LSAPs) by central bankers, the view of quantitative easing, or QE, as a tool to add monetary policy accommodation and QT to tighten policy has changed over time. When it was used during and after the Global Financial Crisis, QE was deemed an "unconventional" tool in central banks' arsenals. But QE has now been used numerous times in the past two decades for extended periods when the policy rate was at the effective lower bound, so I would say it is no longer unconventional.</p>
<p>Given the role of QE and QT in the policy toolkit, it is good to have researchers and policymakers examine how asset purchases work and talk about current issues associated with their implementation. This paper is very timely and thorough in looking across countries and their experiences with QE and QT. There is a lot packed into this work that makes it a little difficult to fully assess in the time we have today. So I will focus my comments on four points: (1) the evidence that the effects of QE are asymmetric to the effects of QT; (2) the execution of QE versus the execution of QT in the United States; (3) the role of announcement effects of QT; and, finally, (4) who has taken the Fed's place in buying assets when we withdraw from the market. I will then end with some thoughts about issues facing the Federal Reserve as we move forward with normalizing our balance sheet.</p>
<p><strong>The Asymmetry of Quantitative Easing versus Quantitative Tightening</strong><br />For me, one of the most interesting results of the paper is that the announcement effects of quantitative easing are much larger than the announcement effects of quantitative tightening. The authors find that announcements of QT have a small but statistically significant effect in increasing government bond yields&mdash;about 4 to 8 basis points. But this effect is much smaller, in absolute terms, than the prevailing estimates of the decrease in yields from announcements of QE. The conclusion is that the interest rate effects of QE and QT are asymmetric. For an economist, this result may seem puzzling&mdash;why would changing the sign on an action lead to asymmetric effects on prices and real variables?</p>
<p>Ever since central banks initiated QE in response to the Global Financial Crisis, academics have debated its effectiveness. One view is that it has a very limited effect in situations where a central bank is swapping zero interest-bearing reserves for zero interest-bearing shorter-term Treasury securities. Because the two assets would seem to be nearly perfect substitutes, there can be no price effects from altering the composition of the two assets. The central bank is simply swapping two $10 bills for a twenty. If this is true, then undoing the trade via QT has no effect either. It should be symmetrical.</p>
<p>The alternative view, based on market segmentation or preferred habitat theory, is that when a central bank uses reserves to pay for government securities, it is decreasing the supply of these securities to private investors, which will bid up the price and lower the interest rate on government securities.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240301a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;By lowering interest rates on longer-maturity assets, which pay a higher interest rate than reserves, the central bank can stimulate the economy in a manner similar to lowering the policy rate. But by this logic, when QT reverses QE, asset prices should fall and yields should rise in equal magnitude. Thus, any positive effects derived from QE would be reversed when QT occurs. This suggests that QE and QT may cancel each other out in welfare terms. But if there are no net benefits from the action, what is the point of doing it? To illustrate this point, suppose someone is given a weight-loss drug and they lose 80 pounds, but then the drug is taken away and they regain the 80 pounds. What was the point of the exercise if there was no net welfare gain?</p>
<p>To me, for QE to be beneficial on net, there&nbsp;<em>has</em>&nbsp;to be asymmetry in the effects of QE relative to QT. My thinking on this has long been guided by the conclusions of a paper I wrote with Alex Berentsen about optimal stabilization policy, which is what QE and QT ultimately should be about.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240301a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;The gist of the argument is that when shocks and frictions to trading arise suddenly, the central bank can take actions such as injecting reserves to ease trading frictions or credit constraints and improve welfare. But by waiting until the frictions and shocks dissipate before undoing the injections, the positive effects are not reversed. As an example, when a house is on fire, pouring water on the fire will put it out, which has great benefits for all. But when the fire is out, draining the water away does not reignite the fire&mdash;the initial benefits are not undone. The punchline here is that QE is conducted under different market conditions than those that occur when QT is done, so it is not surprising that the effects will be different. The authors' findings that QE has asymmetric effects compared to QT is not a puzzle but an indication that central banks timed QE and QT in the right manner such that society was better off.</p>
<p><strong>The Execution of Quantitative Easing versus Quantitative Tightening</strong><br />Turning to the impact of QE and QT on interest rates, analysis often focuses on the term premium. There are three key elements of asset purchases that change the term premium: (1) the expected path of QE, which includes the amount and timing of purchases; (2) the length of time the central bank is expected to hold the additional securities; and (3) the expected path of QT, including the amount and timing of redemptions, which importantly depends on the desired ultimate size of securities holdings (and reserve balances) of the central bank. As soon as an asset purchase program is announced, these expectations are formed, resulting in the term premium effect, or TPE, on interest rates.</p>
<p>Over time, the TPE will change, based on both the passage of time and any updates to the public's expectations for the components I just mentioned. Let me talk about three factors that affect both the expected path of asset purchases and interest rates. These factors are things to keep in mind for future policy decisions.</p>
<p>First, there are two ways that QE can be implemented, and they have different impacts on interest rates. These are what I call&nbsp;<em>closed</em>- or&nbsp;<em>open-ended</em>&nbsp;QE programs. Closed-ended QE programs involve an announcement of a fixed stock of purchases over a fixed period of time. An example of this type of asset purchase program was initiated by the Fed in March 2009.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240301a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;Open-ended QE simply gives a purchase amount per month but no calendar endpoint, so the expected size of the program is unspecified. A set of economic conditions for reducing or ending purchases may be stipulated, but when they will occur is not perfectly predictable. Here, one can think of the Fed's most recent asset purchase program.</p>
<p>At the time of an asset purchase announcement, it will be easier for markets to fully price in a closed-ended program, since its purchase amount and end date are given, whereas the open-ended program's pricing will depend on market expectations for the evolution of the economy. So if one wants a particular impact on interest rates at the announcement date, one might lean toward a closed-ended program or be aware that additional guidance on the expected path of the open-ended program will be needed.</p>
<p>As time passes and the economy evolves, the two programs work differently. One might prefer an open-ended program over time because it dynamically responds to the evolution of economic conditions. The program could be halted or extended as conditions improve or worsen, unlike a closed-ended program. But, of course, the criteria set in the open-ended program must be carefully considered. As I said in a recent FEDS Note and in several speeches, the 2020 criteria for when to begin QT may have been too restrictive and did not allow the Committee to taper as soon and as gradually as desired.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240301a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;Setting the appropriate criteria ahead of time to create the flexibility needed to respond to changing economic and financial conditions is very hard to do.</p>
<p>The second factor affecting the path of asset purchases is that it is very important that QE be credibly followed by QT. If QE is viewed as nothing more than a permanent injection of money into the economy, it would likely create inflation. This was widely predicted back in 2009, but the inflation didn't happen. Why? In my view, it didn't happen because the Fed credibly committed to withdrawing the injected reserves at a later date. Pre-committing to QT is what allows the injection of reserves into the economy without inflation or other longer-run distortions of market pricing. So when starting asset purchases or weighing how to approach asset runoff or sales, it is important that the central bank commit to normalizing its balance sheet.</p>
<p>The third factor is that it is important for a central bank to move carefully as it comes to the end of QT and the desired level of ample reserves. The endpoint should be related to the expectation of the banking system's demand for reserves. In the United States, we saw stresses in money markets in the fall of 2019, when the Fed reduced the level of reserves during balance sheet normalization through July and then there was heavy issuance of Treasury securities in September. The level of reserves likely went a bit too low.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240301a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;Learning from our experiences and trying to understand how the demand for reserves has changed over time suggests moving carefully toward the endpoint of QT.</p>
<p>For this reason, even if QE is an open-ended program, QT is more likely to resemble a closed-ended program. Central banks usually have an idea of how large they want their balance sheet to be when QT ends; therefore, once the pace of QT is announced, markets should be able to effectively price in the entire program at the announcement of the plan. After that, the actual execution of QT is simply validating the beliefs that market participants had at the announcement. This is why many refer to QT as merely draining unneeded reserves, which should be as interesting as watching paint dry.</p>
<p><strong>Quantitative Tightening in the United States</strong><br />Let me now turn more directly to the authors' paper and two of their findings. First, as I mentioned earlier, they find central banks' QT announcements have only a small effect on interest rates. To conduct this analysis, the authors do an event study around QT announcements, which requires them to identify "surprises" in the QT announcements. As the authors acknowledge, this is not a trivial exercise. My comment here is to point out why identifying a QT announcement surprise is challenging when considering examples in the United States.</p>
<p>Let me walk through the evolution of the Fed's QT communications in the spring of 2022 to consider how various communications affected the expected path of QT.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240301a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;Recall that QE ended in March 2022.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240301a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a>&nbsp;Heading into April, it was likely that markets expected a redemption path somewhat like the Fed's 2017&ndash;2019 QT plan.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240301a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;That plan phased in redemptions over 12 months and ultimately allowed, at most, $30 billion of Treasury securities and $20 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) to be redeemed each month. On April 5, 2022, then-Vice Chair Lael Brainard gave a speech that noted the balance sheet would shrink considerably more rapidly than in the previous case of QT; specifically, she said that "significantly larger caps and a much shorter period to phase in the maximum caps compared with 2017&ndash;2019."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240301a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a>&nbsp;The next day, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes provided additional information on the expected maximum monthly caps and phase-in period, saying participants generally agreed to a three-month phase-in and caps of $60 billion and $35 billion for Treasury securities and agency MBS, respectively.</p>
<p>Over those two days in April, the markets likely updated their expected QT plans to have sooner and larger redemptions. This change would be associated with a less negative term premium effect, meaning a rise in Treasury yields. The 10-year Treasury yield rose 19 basis points over the two days of the Vice Chair's speech and the FOMC minutes&mdash;that is, 12 basis points on the day of her speech and another 7 basis points on the day of the FOMC minutes&mdash;and a total of 37 basis points over that week.</p>
<p>About a month later, on May 4, 2022, the FOMC communicated its "Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet." The plan was consistent with the FOMC minutes from April, and there was little change in the 10-year Treasury yield that day and week (negative 4 basis points on the day of the announcement and 2 basis points over the five-day period). So, when doing event studies, it may be difficult to estimate the full impact of QT announcements by simply looking at the formal announcement of the QT plan.</p>
<p>Let me turn to a second point of the paper, about which types of investors have increased their securities holdings as the Fed has reduced its holdings. When a central bank steps away from asset purchases and begins to shrink its balance sheet, a common question is, who will step in and take the central bank's place in buying securities? I always respond by saying, "Why is this important?" If the government bond market is broad and deep, there will be plenty of buyers&mdash;there is no need to worry about who will buy the government debt. If the government bond market is not broad or deep, however, then the central bank's actions can have adverse and unwanted effects on prices and market functioning. This would then affect how fast the central bank can reduce its balance sheet and whether it can do so passively or actively.</p>
<p>One could also argue that it matters because knowing the buyers helps one understand the transmission of QT to asset prices and interest rates. Does it matter if it is banks or nonbank financial firms that are doing the buying? Does it matter if it is hedge funds, pension funds, or actual households doing the buying? One needs to have a better understanding of why the question is being asked before one can fully understand the answers to the question.</p>
<p>The authors focus on the reduction in aggregate securities holdings of central banks and find that households and broker-dealers are the main investors absorbing the redeemed securities. For my discussion today, I decided to dig a bit deeper into the Financial Accounts of the United States in two ways. First, I decided to look at each type of security (Treasury securities and agency MBS) individually.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240301a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a>&nbsp;For Treasury securities, I also find that since the 2022 start of QT, households have boosted their market share the most, and broker-dealers have also increased their share. For agency MBS, not only has the market shares of those two investor types increased, but so has the market shares of money market funds.</p>
<p>Second, I dug into the household category a bit more. As currently categorized, the Financial Accounts household category includes hedge funds. The Federal Reserve Board is working to segregate hedge funds in this data set. In the interim, the Board publishes separate data on the balance sheets of domestic hedge funds.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240301a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a>&nbsp;Using this supplemental data, I find that it is not the hedge funds that are responsible for the increase in household market share. This means the increase is driven by the other household investors: actual households and nonprofit organizations.</p>
<p>What do I make of this finding? My interpretation is that it reinforces the view that the demand for U.S. Treasury securities is broad and deep&mdash;the buyers are not a narrow set of deep-pocketed, sophisticated investors but rather the American public. As a result, the pace of runoff is not a problem. As we have seen with the current phase of QT, runoff up to $95 billion a month is not causing substantial strains in financial markets&mdash;something that a few years ago would have surprised a lot of people, given the worries about QT that were common prior to 2022.</p>
<p><strong>Normalization</strong><br />Let me conclude with a few comments on where I believe the Fed should be heading as it continues to normalize its balance sheet. By "normalizing" I mean reducing the size of the balance sheet but retaining enough assets to manage monetary policy using an ample-reserves regime.</p>
<p>As the Federal Reserve continues its QT program, I support further thinking about how many more securities to redeem. We have an overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility with take-up of more than $500 billion, and I view these funds as excess liquidity that financial market participants do not want, so this tells me that we can continue to reduce our holdings for some time.</p>
<p>In addition, it is important to remember that we now have a standing repurchase agreement facility (SRF). The SRF serves as a backstop in money markets, since it takes in Treasury securities as well as agency MBS and puts reserves in the banking system. This facility may allow banks to lower the level of reserves below what reserves would be without the facility, and it may provide a signal for when reserves are getting close to ample.</p>
<p>Chair Powell has noted that the FOMC will begin to discuss slowing our redemptions at our FOMC meeting this month, which will help us transition into whatever definition of "ample" we deem appropriate. Changing our pace of redemptions will occur when the Committee makes a decision to do so, and the timing will be independent of any changes to the policy rate target. Balance sheet plans are about getting liquidity levels right and approaching "ample" at the correct speed. They do not imply anything about the stance of interest rate policy, which is focused on influencing the macroeconomy and achieving our dual mandate.</p>
<p>Thinking about longer-term issues related to the Fed's portfolio, I want to mention two things. First, I would like to see the Fed's agency MBS holdings go to zero. Agency MBS holdings have been slow to run off the portfolio, at a recent monthly average of about $15 billion, because the underlying mortgages have very low interest rates and prepayments are quite small. I believe it is important to see a continued reduction in these holdings.</p>
<p>Second, I would like to see a shift in Treasury holdings toward a larger share of shorter-dated Treasury securities. Prior to the Global Financial Crisis, we held approximately one-third of our portfolio in Treasury bills.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240301a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a>&nbsp;Today, bills are less than 5 percent of our Treasury holdings and less than 3 percent of our total securities holdings. Moving toward more Treasury bills would shift the maturity structure more toward our policy rate&mdash;the overnight federal funds rate&mdash;and allow our income and expenses to rise and fall together as the FOMC increases and cuts the target range. This approach could also assist a future asset purchase program because we could let the short-term securities roll off the portfolio and not increase the balance sheet.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240301a.htm#fn14" title="footnote 14"><span>14</span></a><a name="f14"></a>&nbsp;This is an issue the FOMC will need to decide in the next couple of years.</p>
<p>In conclusion, let me be clear that this is a great paper that will serve as a major reference for researchers and central banks. The authors' analysis will surely have a much longer shelf life than my discussion of it.</p>
<hr align="left" size="1" width="33%" />
<p><a name="fn1"></a>1. The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn2"></a>2. There are several theories for how QE works. The market segmentation theory suggests that assets of different maturities are imperfect substitutes, so a lower supply of long-term assets and a higher supply of short-term assets would imply that long-term interest rates fall and short-term interest rates rise. The preferred habitat theory suggests that financial market participants prefer certain asset maturities over others and the price (or interest) rate needs to adjust to change their desired mix of holdings.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn3"></a>3. For details of the model and results, see Aleksander Berentsen and Christopher Waller (2011), "Price-Level Targeting and Stabilization Policy,"&nbsp;<em>Journal of Money, Credit and Banking,</em>&nbsp;vol. 43, Supplement 2 (October), pp. 559&ndash;80.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn4"></a>4. An example of a closed-ended program is from March 2009, when the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) noted that "to help improve conditions in private credit markets, the Committee decided to purchase up to $300 billion of longer-term Treasury securities over the next six months"; see paragraph 3 of the March 2009 FOMC statement, which is available on the Board's website at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm">https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm</a>. An example of an open-ended program is from December 2020, when the FOMC stated it would keep buying $120 billion per month in securities "until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee's maximum employment and price stability goals"; see paragraph 4 of the December 2020 FOMC statement, which is available on the Board's website at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm">https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn5"></a>5. See Jane Ihrig and Chris Waller (2024), "<a href="https://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.3455">The Federal Reserve's Responses to the Post-COVID Period of High Inflation</a>," FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, February 14).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn6"></a>6. For a discussion of the September 2019 experience, see Sriya Anbil, Alyssa Anderson, and Zeynep Senyuz (2020), "<a href="https://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.2527">What Happened in Money Markets in September 2019?</a>" FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, February 27).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn7"></a>7. Prior to the spring announcements, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) began discussions on policy normalization as reported in the December 2021 FOMC minutes. It was noted that some participants observed that the balance sheet could potentially shrink faster than the previous experience. The 10-year Treasury yield moved up several basis points around the release of the minutes.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn8"></a>8. In March 2022, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) indicated that it "expects to begin reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities at a coming meeting"; see paragraph 3 of the March 2022 FOMC statement, which is available on the Board's website at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm">https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm</a>. This language signaled the Fed would be holding the peak amount of securities on its balance sheet for just a short period of time, which turned out to be between March and the end of May.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn9"></a>9. In January 2022, the Federal Open Market Committee provided a statement on "Principles for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet," but it did not provide information about the timing or pace of redemptions; the statement is available on the Board's website at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20220126c.htm">https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20220126c.htm</a>.&nbsp;</p>

See Lael Brainard (2022), "<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20220405a.htm">Variation in the Inflation Experiences of Households</a>," speech delivered at the Spring 2022 Institute Research Conference, Opportunity and Inclusive Growth Institute, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Minneapolis, April 5.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn11"></a>11. My calculations look at how investor types' market shares change over time, as is done in Seth Carpenter, Selva Demiralp, Jane Ihrig, and Elizabeth Klee (2015), "Analyzing Federal Reserve Asset Purchases: From Whom Does the Fed Buy?"&nbsp;<em>Journal of Banking and Finance,</em>&nbsp;vol. 52 (March), pp. 230&ndash;44.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn12"></a>12. Data on the balance sheet of hedge funds is available on the Board's website at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/20231207/html/b101f.htm">https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/20231207/html/b101f.htm</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn13"></a>13. A Treasury bill is a security backed by the U.S. Treasury Department with a maturity of up to 52 weeks. A bill is sold at a discount, and at maturity the investor receives the par value of the security.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn14"></a>14. There may be other considerations for holding a sizable share of bills in the Fed's portfolio. For example, Vissing-Jorgensen (2023) argues for considering the convenience yield impact of bills; see Annette Vissing-Jorgensen (2023), "Balance Sheet Policy above the ELB," paper presented at the ECB Forum on Central Banking, held in Sintra, Portugal, June 26&ndash;28.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced settled charges against New York-based investment adviser HG Vora Capital Management LLC for its failure to make timely ownership disclosures in the lead-up to its May 2022 acquisition bid for trucking fleet company Ryder System Inc. HG Vora agreed to pay a $950,000 civil penalty to settle the SEC&rsquo;s charges.</p>
<p>Under the federal securities laws, a company that owns more than five percent of a public company&rsquo;s stock must report its position and whether it has a control purpose, which is an intention to influence or control the company. According to the SEC&rsquo;s order, on Feb. 14, 2022, HG Vora disclosed that it owned 5.6 percent of Ryder&rsquo;s common stock as of Dec. 31, 2021, and certified that it did not have a control purpose. The order states that HG Vora then built up its position to 9.9 percent of Ryder's stock and formed a control purpose no later than April 26, 2022. The federal securities laws therefore required it to report its control purpose and its current ownership position by May 6, 2022, but it did not report this information until May 13. On that same day, HG Vora sent a letter to Ryder proposing to buy all Ryder shares for $86 a share, a sizeable premium over the trading price. Before the letter to Ryder and its filing, and after forming a control purpose, HG Vora purchased swap agreements that gave it economic exposure to the equivalent of 450,000 more shares of Ryder common stock. After HG Vora&rsquo;s public announcement of its bid on May 13, 2022, Ryder&rsquo;s stock price increased significantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The federal laws and SEC rules covering ownership disclosure help keep investors fully informed about control &ndash; and potential changes in control &ndash; of publicly traded companies,&rdquo; said Mark Cave, Associate Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;But, according to today&rsquo;s order, HG Vora deprived Ryder shareholders of information about its significant stake in the company, while building a large swaps position from which it stood to profit after announcing the Ryder takeover bid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that HG Vora violated the beneficial ownership provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Without admitting or denying the findings, HG Vora agreed to cease and desist from future violations and to pay the civil penalty discussed above. On Oct. 10, 2023, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-219">SEC adopted rules</a>&nbsp;shortening the deadline for filing an initial Schedule 13D from 10 to five business days. HG Vora was found to have violated the rules in effect at the time of the conduct at issue in the SEC&rsquo;s order by filing this report more than 10 days after forming a control purpose.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Jonathan Cowen with assistance from Robert Nesbitt of the Office of Market Intelligence and Nicholas Panos from the Office of Mergers &amp; Acquisitions. The investigation was supervised by Assistant Director Jeffrey Weiss and Mr. Cave.</p>

Summary: 
ACER and ENTSO-E are organizing an online workshop to present simulation results of long-term flow-based allocation process, introducing go-live timeline. <div>
<p><span>ACER and the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) are organising an online workshop to present the simulation results of the long-term flow-based allocation of transmission capacities.</span></p>
<p><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">When?</span></span></p>
<p><span>Friday, 22 March 2024, 09:00 &ndash; 12:00 CET</span></p>
<p><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is it about?</span></span></p>
<p><span>The long-term flow-based allocation of transmission capacities process will be used to manage and allocate the electricity transmission across the European integrated market on yearly and monthly timeframe in the Core and Nordic capacity calculation regions (CCRs). The process will enhance the efficiency of the transmission capacity allocation, thus providing hedging opportunities to market participants.</span></p>
<p><span>The Nordic CCR comprises&nbsp;4 countries: Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden.</span></p>
<p><span>The Core CCR consists of 13 countries: Austria, Belgium, Czechia, Croatia, France, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia and Romania.</span></p>
<p><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the key objectives?</span></span></p>
<p><span>This 6<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;workshop aims to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Present and discuss the simulation results.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span>Introduce the expected timeline for the go-live of the single allocation platform that will support the long-term flow-based capacity allocation process.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This workshop will provide stakeholders with an in-depth understanding of the long-term flow-based allocation process, as well as the go-live preparation of yearly and monthly flow-based auctions.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The global economy is at an inflection point, as the most synchronised and most significant monetary policy tightening in recent memory nears the end. Disinflation is largely on track, and there is a good chance of a soft, or softish, landing. But inflationary pressures may re-emerge. And the current slowdown in growth may still turn out to be deeper and more protracted than expected. If such risks materialise, capital flows to emerging market economies may retrench. Some, like those in sub-Saharan Africa, may be particularly vulnerable given their high levels of debt held by foreign bondholders and commercial banks. Policymakers will need to navigate these difficult waters, including by enhancing banking supervision.</span></p>

<title>Shenzhen Stock Exchange Smoothly Implements The Quantitative Trading Reporting System</title>

<div> Circular, reporting system, quantitative trading, regulation, market order
Summary:<br /> 
- SZSE implemented reporting system for quantitative trading
- Recognizes advantages and problems of quantitative trading
- Plans to strengthen regulatory arrangements
- Will increase communication with HKEX
- Will take self-regulatory measures and report violations to CSRC<br /> <div>
<p>On September 1, 2023, SZSE issued the Circular on Matters Relating to the Reporting of Stock Program Trading and the Circular on Matters Relating to Strengthening the Management of Program Trading with official effect from October 9, 2023, establishing the special reporting&nbsp;system&nbsp;and corresponding regulatory arrangements for quantitative trading. With joint efforts of all market participants, the above&nbsp;system&nbsp;has been smoothly implemented.&nbsp;The existing&nbsp;investors have completed the reporting on schedule as required, while&nbsp;new&nbsp;investors have carried out the provisions of &ldquo;reporting before trading&rdquo; and their reporting quality has generally met the requirements, laying the foundation for further strengthening and improving the regulation of quantitative trading. SZSE will, based on the reported information, continue to intensify the monitoring and analysis of quantitative trading, especially high-frequency trading and dynamically evaluate and improve the reporting&nbsp;system.</p>
<p>With the wide application of new information technologies, quantitative trading has recently become an important way of trading. It helps provide liquidity to the market and facilitates price discovery.&nbsp;Compared with&nbsp;small and medium-sized investors, quantitative trading, especially high-frequency trading, has obvious advantages in technology, information and speed, but at some time points, also shows problems such as strategy convergence, trading resonance and increase in market volatility. From the perspective of international experience, overseas markets generally implement the stricter regulation on quantitative trading, especially high-frequency trading, to prevent negative impact on market order. In the next step, SZSE will adhere to the investor-oriented approach, take the maintenance of fairness as the starting point and goal of its work, learn from international regulatory practices, seek advantages and avoid disadvantages. SZSE will establish sound regulatory arrangements for quantitative trading, including strict implementation of the reporting&nbsp;system&nbsp;and clear access arrangements of &ldquo;reporting before trading&rdquo;; strengthen the authorization management of market&nbsp;data for&nbsp;quantitative trading and perfect the differentiated charging mechanism; improve monitoring standards for abnormal trading and reinforce the regulation on abnormal trading and abnormal order reporting and withdrawal; strengthen the monitoring and regulation of leverage-type quantitative products and the joint regulation of futures and spot goods. Meanwhile, SZSE will further clarify customer management responsibilities of securities companies, perfect the self-regulatory management cooperation mechanism with the Securities Association of China and the Asset Management Association of China and intensify the regulation on trading of quantitative&nbsp;and&nbsp;private institutions. In addition, SZSE will increase communication with HKEX and under the principle of equal treatment for domestic and foreign capital, clarify reporting arrangements for&nbsp;northbound&nbsp;investors under the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect and include quantitative trading by&nbsp;northbound&nbsp;investors in the reporting scope. SZSE will resolutely take self-regulatory measures against abnormal trading that affects the market order and report those suspected of violating laws and regulations and having serious circumstances to the CSRC for investigation and punishment.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>On February 19, during trading monitoring,&nbsp;SZSE discovered that from 9:30:00 to 9:30:42, multiple securities accounts of Ningbo Lingjun Investment Management Partnership (Limited Partnership) (&ldquo;Ningbo Lingjun&rdquo;) automatically generated trading instructions through computer programs and placed large quantities of orders in a short time. Stocks amounting to CNY 1.372 billion were sold through such accounts&nbsp;and&nbsp;the Shenzhen Component Index fell rapidly&nbsp;during&nbsp;that&nbsp;period, affecting the normal trading order. This constituted an abnormal trading activity specified in Item 6 of Article 6.2 of the Trading Rules of Shenzhen Stock Exchange. The securities accounts of Ningbo Lingjun continued abnormal trading activities though they have been repeatedly subject to regulatory measures such as written warning by SZSE for such activities since this year.</p>
<p>According to the Implementing Rules for Restricted&nbsp;Trading, the Implementing Measures for Self-disciplinary Supervision and Disciplinary Measures and other relevant provisions of SZSE, we decided to take trading restriction measures against the relevant securities accounts of Ningbo Lingjun from February 20, 2024 to February 22, 2024, during which period&nbsp;Ningbo Lingjun is restricted from trading in all stocks listed and traded on SZSE. In addition,&nbsp;we&nbsp;initiated the disciplinary sanction procedures for public censure against Ningbo Lingjun.</p>
<p>SZSE will, in accordance with the unified arrangement of the CSRC, resolutely implement the requirements of strict and tough regulation, adhere to the primary responsibility for regulation and treat regulation as its primary business and constantly strengthen trading regulation. Moreover, SZSE will always maintain a strict tone and a tough stance of &ldquo;zero tolerance&rdquo; for, quickly respond to and crack down on&nbsp;the&nbsp;illegalities and violations that affect the normal order of the market and damage the legitimate rights and interests of investors. At the same time, SZSE reminds investors to participate in trading in accordance with laws and regulations to jointly maintain the normal trading order of the market.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The National Anti-Scam Centre is warning consumers to beware of fake news articles and deepfake videos of public figures that endorse and link to online investment trading platform scams, particularly on social media.</p>
<p>Last year, Australians reported losing more than $8 million to online investment trading platform scams, with 400 reports made to Scamwatch.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are urging Australians to take their time and do their research before taking up an investment opportunity &ndash; particularly those seen on social media,&rsquo; ACCC Deputy Chair Catriona Lowe said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Scammers are creating fake news articles and deepfake videos to convince people that celebrities and well-known public figures are making huge sums of money using online investment trading platforms, when in fact it is a scam.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;These fake videos and news articles circulating on social media and video sharing platforms, often claim that the online trading platform uses artificial intelligence or other emerging technologies such as quantum computing to generate high returns for investors, but it is not true,&rsquo; Ms Lowe said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We know of an Australian man who lost $80,000 in cryptocurrency after seeing a deepfake Elon Musk video interview on social media, clicking the link and registering his details through an online form. He was provided with an account manager and an online dashboard where he could see his investment supposedly making huge returns. But when he tried to withdraw the money &ndash; he was locked out of his account.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Reports to Scamwatch indicate the most prolific online investment trading platform scam appears under the brand &lsquo;Quantum AI&rsquo;. Others include &lsquo;Immediate Edge&rsquo;, &lsquo;Immediate Connect&rsquo;, &lsquo;Immediate X3&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Quantum Trade Wave&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The National Anti-Scam Centre&rsquo;s investment scam fusion cell, co-led by the ACCC and ASIC, has been active in disrupting investment scams such as online investment trading platform scams.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In addition to referring these scam ads to social media platforms for removal, the fusion cell has developed a trial method for blocking payments to these scams,&rsquo; Ms Lowe said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It has been encouraging to see an overall downward trend in losses reported to Scamwatch to investment scams since the establishment of the fusion cell in July 2023.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The ACCC and ASIC will continue to work together as part of the National Anti-Scam Centre's efforts to stop scammers from harming Australians.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>How online investment trading platform scams work</h2>
<ul>
<li>Scammers entice victims through social media advertisements, deepfake videos on video sharing platforms and fake online news articles about celebrities and well-known public figures claiming to make substantial money from online trading platforms.</li>
<li>This fake click bait will link to a scam website where victims are prompted to enter their details. This is the gateway for communication between the scammer and victim.</li>
<li>Scammers ask for a small investment of around $250 via credit card to provide access to the trading platform.</li>
<li>Scammers will often ask the new investor to download a third-party trading platform via the relevant app store or provide the investor with login details for an online dashboard.</li>
<li>After showing profits through a dedicated online dashboard, scammers persuade their victims to invest more. Sometimes scammers will allow victims to make a small withdrawal early in the scam to build trust.</li>
<li>When the victim eventually tries to withdraw their funds, scammers will ask for withdrawal fees or cite tax implications to obtain more money. Some victims have reported being locked out of their account.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Protect yourself</h3>
<p><span>STOP</span>&nbsp;&ndash; Don&rsquo;t give personal information or act on investment advice you have come across on social media. Don&rsquo;t feel pressured to invest. If you have any doubts, stop communicating with them.</p>
<p><span>THINK</span>&nbsp;&ndash; Ask yourself if you really know what you are investing in? Scammers can create fake news to make it seem legitimate. Do an internet search to see if there are warnings about this investment trading platform scam, including if the well-known public figure has warned about being impersonated.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>PROTECT</span>&nbsp;&ndash; Act quickly if something feels wrong. If you have shared financial information or transferred money, contact your bank immediately. Help others by reporting scams to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.scamwatch.gov.au/report-a-scam">Scamwatch</a>.</p>
<h3>Investor information</h3>
<p>Before investing, Australians can make these simple practical checks to help reduce the risk of investment scams:</p>
<ul>
<li>check ASIC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://moneysmart.gov.au/check-and-report-scams/investor-alert-list">investor alert list</a>&nbsp;to help keep you informed about investments that could be fraudulent, a scam or unlicensed.</li>
<li>go to&nbsp;ASIC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://moneysmart.gov.au/check-and-report-scams/check-before-you-invest">Check before you invest</a>&nbsp;page to see how you can check if the company or person is licensed or authorised to offer the investment.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>On February 8, SZSE formulated and issued the&nbsp;<i>Self-Regulatory Guidelines No.17 for Companies Listed&nbsp;</i><i>on&nbsp;</i>Shenzhen Stock Exchange<i>&nbsp;- Sustainable Development Report (for Trial Implementation) (</i><i>E</i><i>xposure</i><i>&nbsp;</i><i>Draft)</i>&nbsp;(hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;<i>Guidelines for Sustainable Development Report</i>&rdquo;) to solicit comments from the market. This is an important measure for SZSE to implement the&nbsp;guiding principles&nbsp;of the 20th CPC National Congress, the Central Economic Work Conference and the Central Financial Work Conference and fully, accurately and comprehensively carry out the new development concept. With this measure, SZSE&nbsp;aims to&nbsp;standardize the disclosure requirements for sustainable development information of listed companies, instruct listed companies to practice the concept of sustainable development and promote the improvement of the quality of listed companies.&nbsp;This&nbsp;helps give full play to the hub function of the capital market, guides the gathering of factors in the field of sustainable development, further builds industrial clusters with sustainable investment value and facilitates the realization of the strategic goals of &ldquo;carbon peaking and carbon neutrality&rdquo;. It also drives the enhancement of governance ability, competitiveness, innovation ability, anti-risk ability, medium and long-term sustainable development ability and long-term stable return ability of listed companies, enhances listed companies&rsquo; attraction to long-term capital and further consolidates the foundation for the high-quality development of listed companies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;According to the report to the 20th CPC National Congress, driving low-carbon economic and social development is the key link in achieving high-quality development, which is the primary task for comprehensively building a modern socialist country. The Central Economic Work Conference proposed to actively yet prudently promote carbon peaking and carbon neutrality and accelerate the creation of a low-carbon supply chain. The Central Financial Work Conference pointed out the effective implementation of five major tasks including green finance. In the&nbsp;<i>Three-year Action Plan for Promoting the Improvement of Quality of Listed Companies (2022-2025)</i>, CSRC requires the establishment of a sound disclosure system for sustainable development information,&nbsp;the&nbsp;formulation of a system of disclosure rules for sustainable development information of listed companies&nbsp;that is&nbsp;based on China&rsquo;s actual situation, in line with international trends and with Chinese characteristics,&nbsp;the&nbsp;definition of the implementation path and&nbsp;the&nbsp;gradual promotion as planned in stages. The aim is to better play the role of finance in serving national strategies, supporting high-quality development and practicing social responsibilities and further optimize resource allocation.</p>
<p>Under the guidance of CSRC, SZSE has steadily advanced the drafting of the&nbsp;<i>Guidelines for Sustainable Development Report</i>&nbsp;with the overall thinking of three aspects.&nbsp;Firstly, being practical and realistic.&nbsp;After fully considering the development stage and disclosure ability of listed companies in China, SZSE achieves the matching of cost and benefit through the combination of mandatory and voluntary disclosure, combination of qualitative and quantitative disclosure, setting of transitional period and mitigation measures.&nbsp;Secondly,&nbsp;upholding&nbsp;systematic thinking.&nbsp;SZSE helps listed companies build a sound governance mechanism related to sustainable development, establishes a disclosure framework with &ldquo;governance - strategy - impact, risk and opportunity management - indicators and objectives&rdquo; as&nbsp;the&nbsp;core elements and drives high-quality information disclosure with better internal governance and concrete actions.&nbsp;Thirdly, learning from good practices and reflecting Chinese characteristics.&nbsp;SZSE summarizes the current domestic and foreign disclosure systems and excellent practices, refers to national standards and industry norms and actively absorbs international beneficial experience. Based on the actual situation of China&rsquo;s capital market, SZSE sets specific topics such as rural revitalization and innovation-driven concept to fully reflect the characteristics and advantages of China&rsquo;s listed companies in the field of sustainable development.</p>
<p>Following the above drafting ideas, the&nbsp;<i>Guidelines for Sustainable Development Report</i>&nbsp;consists&nbsp;of 58 articles in 6 chapters covering 20 specific topics, further enriching&nbsp;and improving&nbsp;the information disclosure requirements related to sustainable development on the basis of the existing rules. It specifies that listed companies shall analyze and disclose the topics to be disclosed around four core&nbsp;aspects, namely, governance, strategy, impact&nbsp;-&nbsp;risk&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;opportunity management,&nbsp;and indicators&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;objectives, so that investors and stakeholders can fully understand the actions taken by listed companies to cope with and manage impacts, risks and opportunities related to sustainable development. Meanwhile, it sets multiple topics including carbon emissions, pollutants, ecosystem and biodiversity, circular economy utilization, rural revitalization and supply chain security in such aspects as environment, society and corporate governance. In terms of implementation method, it clarifies that&nbsp;the&nbsp;constituents continuously included in the Shenzhen 100 Index and the ChiNext Index during the reporting period and&nbsp;the&nbsp;companies listed&nbsp;simultaneously&nbsp;at home and abroad shall disclose the&nbsp;<i>Sustainable Development Report</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;that&nbsp;other listed companies are encouraged to make disclosure voluntarily. It also defines that&nbsp;listed companies shall disclose the information related to some important topics through qualitative and quantitative methods, so as to facilitate horizontal and vertical comparison by investors and stakeholders. Meanwhile, it sets mitigation measures for quantitative disclosure requirements&nbsp;including that listed companies can make qualitative disclosure and explain the reasons for the indicators that are more difficult to disclose quantitatively in the first reporting period. In terms of transitional arrangements and other mitigation measures, in order to help listed companies build capacity and prepare for implementation in advance, listed companies that are required to disclose the&nbsp;<i>Sustainable Development Report</i>&nbsp;can disclose the 2025&nbsp;<i>Sustainable Development Report</i>&nbsp;for the first time before April 30, 2026 at the latest. If it is difficult to quantitatively disclose the impact of sustainable development-related risks and opportunities on the current financial position during the reporting periods of 2025 and 2026, it can be only disclosed qualitatively.</p>
<p>SZSE has always adhered to the concept of sustainable development, actively carried out practices related to sustainable development, instructed listed companies to actively fulfill their social responsibilities and&nbsp;has&nbsp;been committed to building a group of listed companies that meet the requirements of low-carbon sustainable development. SZSE has successively issued the&nbsp;<i>White Paper on Environmental Information Disclosure of SZSE-listed Companies</i>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<i>White Paper on Sustainable Development Information Disclosure of SZSE-listed Companies.</i>&nbsp;These help guide&nbsp;listed companies to strengthen their awareness of sustainable development information disclosure and actively practice the concept of sustainable development by sharing the practices and excellent cases of sustainable development information disclosure of SZSE-listed companies. In 2022, more than 2,700 SZSE-listed companies disclosed their social responsibility performance in their annual reports; more than 1,100 ones disclosed information on pollution prevention, resource conservation and ecological protection; and more than 800 ones released independent social responsibility reports or ESG reports, further improving the quality of ESG information disclosure.&nbsp;According to the statistics of the United Nations on total carbon emissions of companies listed on stock exchanges of G20 countries, SZSE-listed companies ranked first in low carbon with the lowest total carbon emissions.</p>
<p>Next, SZSE will, in accordance with the unified deployments of CSRC, continue to listen to the opinions and suggestions of market participants through multiple means, fully study and absorb reasonable opinions and suggestions and timely release them to the market for implementation. SZSE will constantly improve the system of sustainable development rules, cultivate leading companies in the field of sustainable development, enrich the system of sustainable development products, optimize the system of sustainable development services, strive to build a benchmark for sustainable exchanges and help create a low-carbon and sustainable market ecology.</p>
