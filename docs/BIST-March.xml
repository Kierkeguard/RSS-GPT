<div> workshop, simulation results, transmission capacities, European integrated market, allocation process<br />
Summary: 
ACER and ENTSO-E are organizing an online workshop to present simulation results of long-term flow-based allocation process, introducing go-live timeline. <div>
<p><span>ACER and the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) are organising an online workshop to present the simulation results of the long-term flow-based allocation of transmission capacities.</span></p>
<p><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">When?</span></span></p>
<p><span>Friday, 22 March 2024, 09:00 &ndash; 12:00 CET</span></p>
<p><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is it about?</span></span></p>
<p><span>The long-term flow-based allocation of transmission capacities process will be used to manage and allocate the electricity transmission across the European integrated market on yearly and monthly timeframe in the Core and Nordic capacity calculation regions (CCRs). The process will enhance the efficiency of the transmission capacity allocation, thus providing hedging opportunities to market participants.</span></p>
<p><span>The Nordic CCR comprises&nbsp;4 countries: Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden.</span></p>
<p><span>The Core CCR consists of 13 countries: Austria, Belgium, Czechia, Croatia, France, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia and Romania.</span></p>
<p><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the key objectives?</span></span></p>
<p><span>This 6<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;workshop aims to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Present and discuss the simulation results.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span>Introduce the expected timeline for the go-live of the single allocation platform that will support the long-term flow-based capacity allocation process.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This workshop will provide stakeholders with an in-depth understanding of the long-term flow-based allocation process, as well as the go-live preparation of yearly and monthly flow-based auctions.</span></p>

Summary:<br />
Global economy at inflection point with synchronized monetary policy tightening. Disinflation on track but risks of re-emerging inflation and deeper-than-expected slowdown pose challenges for emerging markets. Banking supervision is crucial. <div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The global economy is at an inflection point, as the most synchronised and most significant monetary policy tightening in recent memory nears the end. Disinflation is largely on track, and there is a good chance of a soft, or softish, landing. But inflationary pressures may re-emerge. And the current slowdown in growth may still turn out to be deeper and more protracted than expected. If such risks materialise, capital flows to emerging market economies may retrench. Some, like those in sub-Saharan Africa, may be particularly vulnerable given their high levels of debt held by foreign bondholders and commercial banks. Policymakers will need to navigate these difficult waters, including by enhancing banking supervision.</span></p>

<div> Circular, reporting system, quantitative trading, regulation, market order
Summary:<br /> 
- SZSE implemented reporting system for quantitative trading
- Recognizes advantages and problems of quantitative trading
- Plans to strengthen regulatory arrangements
- Will increase communication with HKEX
- Will take self-regulatory measures and report violations to CSRC<br /> <div>
<p>On September 1, 2023, SZSE issued the Circular on Matters Relating to the Reporting of Stock Program Trading and the Circular on Matters Relating to Strengthening the Management of Program Trading with official effect from October 9, 2023, establishing the special reporting&nbsp;system&nbsp;and corresponding regulatory arrangements for quantitative trading. With joint efforts of all market participants, the above&nbsp;system&nbsp;has been smoothly implemented.&nbsp;The existing&nbsp;investors have completed the reporting on schedule as required, while&nbsp;new&nbsp;investors have carried out the provisions of &ldquo;reporting before trading&rdquo; and their reporting quality has generally met the requirements, laying the foundation for further strengthening and improving the regulation of quantitative trading. SZSE will, based on the reported information, continue to intensify the monitoring and analysis of quantitative trading, especially high-frequency trading and dynamically evaluate and improve the reporting&nbsp;system.</p>
<p>With the wide application of new information technologies, quantitative trading has recently become an important way of trading. It helps provide liquidity to the market and facilitates price discovery.&nbsp;Compared with&nbsp;small and medium-sized investors, quantitative trading, especially high-frequency trading, has obvious advantages in technology, information and speed, but at some time points, also shows problems such as strategy convergence, trading resonance and increase in market volatility. From the perspective of international experience, overseas markets generally implement the stricter regulation on quantitative trading, especially high-frequency trading, to prevent negative impact on market order. In the next step, SZSE will adhere to the investor-oriented approach, take the maintenance of fairness as the starting point and goal of its work, learn from international regulatory practices, seek advantages and avoid disadvantages. SZSE will establish sound regulatory arrangements for quantitative trading, including strict implementation of the reporting&nbsp;system&nbsp;and clear access arrangements of &ldquo;reporting before trading&rdquo;; strengthen the authorization management of market&nbsp;data for&nbsp;quantitative trading and perfect the differentiated charging mechanism; improve monitoring standards for abnormal trading and reinforce the regulation on abnormal trading and abnormal order reporting and withdrawal; strengthen the monitoring and regulation of leverage-type quantitative products and the joint regulation of futures and spot goods. Meanwhile, SZSE will further clarify customer management responsibilities of securities companies, perfect the self-regulatory management cooperation mechanism with the Securities Association of China and the Asset Management Association of China and intensify the regulation on trading of quantitative&nbsp;and&nbsp;private institutions. In addition, SZSE will increase communication with HKEX and under the principle of equal treatment for domestic and foreign capital, clarify reporting arrangements for&nbsp;northbound&nbsp;investors under the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect and include quantitative trading by&nbsp;northbound&nbsp;investors in the reporting scope. SZSE will resolutely take self-regulatory measures against abnormal trading that affects the market order and report those suspected of violating laws and regulations and having serious circumstances to the CSRC for investigation and punishment.</p>

<title>Shenzhen Stock Exchange Restricts Ningbo Lingjun’s Trading And Initiates A Public Censure Procedure Against It</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>On February 19, during trading monitoring,&nbsp;SZSE discovered that from 9:30:00 to 9:30:42, multiple securities accounts of Ningbo Lingjun Investment Management Partnership (Limited Partnership) (&ldquo;Ningbo Lingjun&rdquo;) automatically generated trading instructions through computer programs and placed large quantities of orders in a short time. Stocks amounting to CNY 1.372 billion were sold through such accounts&nbsp;and&nbsp;the Shenzhen Component Index fell rapidly&nbsp;during&nbsp;that&nbsp;period, affecting the normal trading order. This constituted an abnormal trading activity specified in Item 6 of Article 6.2 of the Trading Rules of Shenzhen Stock Exchange. The securities accounts of Ningbo Lingjun continued abnormal trading activities though they have been repeatedly subject to regulatory measures such as written warning by SZSE for such activities since this year.</p>
<p>According to the Implementing Rules for Restricted&nbsp;Trading, the Implementing Measures for Self-disciplinary Supervision and Disciplinary Measures and other relevant provisions of SZSE, we decided to take trading restriction measures against the relevant securities accounts of Ningbo Lingjun from February 20, 2024 to February 22, 2024, during which period&nbsp;Ningbo Lingjun is restricted from trading in all stocks listed and traded on SZSE. In addition,&nbsp;we&nbsp;initiated the disciplinary sanction procedures for public censure against Ningbo Lingjun.</p>
<p>SZSE will, in accordance with the unified arrangement of the CSRC, resolutely implement the requirements of strict and tough regulation, adhere to the primary responsibility for regulation and treat regulation as its primary business and constantly strengthen trading regulation. Moreover, SZSE will always maintain a strict tone and a tough stance of &ldquo;zero tolerance&rdquo; for, quickly respond to and crack down on&nbsp;the&nbsp;illegalities and violations that affect the normal order of the market and damage the legitimate rights and interests of investors. At the same time, SZSE reminds investors to participate in trading in accordance with laws and regulations to jointly maintain the normal trading order of the market.</p>

<title>ASIC: It’s A Scam! Celebrities Are Not Getting Rich From Online Investment Trading Platforms</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The National Anti-Scam Centre is warning consumers to beware of fake news articles and deepfake videos of public figures that endorse and link to online investment trading platform scams, particularly on social media.</p>
<p>Last year, Australians reported losing more than $8 million to online investment trading platform scams, with 400 reports made to Scamwatch.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are urging Australians to take their time and do their research before taking up an investment opportunity &ndash; particularly those seen on social media,&rsquo; ACCC Deputy Chair Catriona Lowe said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Scammers are creating fake news articles and deepfake videos to convince people that celebrities and well-known public figures are making huge sums of money using online investment trading platforms, when in fact it is a scam.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;These fake videos and news articles circulating on social media and video sharing platforms, often claim that the online trading platform uses artificial intelligence or other emerging technologies such as quantum computing to generate high returns for investors, but it is not true,&rsquo; Ms Lowe said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We know of an Australian man who lost $80,000 in cryptocurrency after seeing a deepfake Elon Musk video interview on social media, clicking the link and registering his details through an online form. He was provided with an account manager and an online dashboard where he could see his investment supposedly making huge returns. But when he tried to withdraw the money &ndash; he was locked out of his account.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Reports to Scamwatch indicate the most prolific online investment trading platform scam appears under the brand &lsquo;Quantum AI&rsquo;. Others include &lsquo;Immediate Edge&rsquo;, &lsquo;Immediate Connect&rsquo;, &lsquo;Immediate X3&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Quantum Trade Wave&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The National Anti-Scam Centre&rsquo;s investment scam fusion cell, co-led by the ACCC and ASIC, has been active in disrupting investment scams such as online investment trading platform scams.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In addition to referring these scam ads to social media platforms for removal, the fusion cell has developed a trial method for blocking payments to these scams,&rsquo; Ms Lowe said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It has been encouraging to see an overall downward trend in losses reported to Scamwatch to investment scams since the establishment of the fusion cell in July 2023.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The ACCC and ASIC will continue to work together as part of the National Anti-Scam Centre's efforts to stop scammers from harming Australians.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>How online investment trading platform scams work</h2>
<ul>
<li>Scammers entice victims through social media advertisements, deepfake videos on video sharing platforms and fake online news articles about celebrities and well-known public figures claiming to make substantial money from online trading platforms.</li>
<li>This fake click bait will link to a scam website where victims are prompted to enter their details. This is the gateway for communication between the scammer and victim.</li>
<li>Scammers ask for a small investment of around $250 via credit card to provide access to the trading platform.</li>
<li>Scammers will often ask the new investor to download a third-party trading platform via the relevant app store or provide the investor with login details for an online dashboard.</li>
<li>After showing profits through a dedicated online dashboard, scammers persuade their victims to invest more. Sometimes scammers will allow victims to make a small withdrawal early in the scam to build trust.</li>
<li>When the victim eventually tries to withdraw their funds, scammers will ask for withdrawal fees or cite tax implications to obtain more money. Some victims have reported being locked out of their account.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Protect yourself</h3>
<p><span>STOP</span>&nbsp;&ndash; Don&rsquo;t give personal information or act on investment advice you have come across on social media. Don&rsquo;t feel pressured to invest. If you have any doubts, stop communicating with them.</p>
<p><span>THINK</span>&nbsp;&ndash; Ask yourself if you really know what you are investing in? Scammers can create fake news to make it seem legitimate. Do an internet search to see if there are warnings about this investment trading platform scam, including if the well-known public figure has warned about being impersonated.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>PROTECT</span>&nbsp;&ndash; Act quickly if something feels wrong. If you have shared financial information or transferred money, contact your bank immediately. Help others by reporting scams to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.scamwatch.gov.au/report-a-scam">Scamwatch</a>.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>On February 8, SZSE formulated and issued the&nbsp;<i>Self-Regulatory Guidelines No.17 for Companies Listed&nbsp;</i><i>on&nbsp;</i>Shenzhen Stock Exchange<i>&nbsp;- Sustainable Development Report (for Trial Implementation) (</i><i>E</i><i>xposure</i><i>&nbsp;</i><i>Draft)</i>&nbsp;(hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;<i>Guidelines for Sustainable Development Report</i>&rdquo;) to solicit comments from the market. This is an important measure for SZSE to implement the&nbsp;guiding principles&nbsp;of the 20th CPC National Congress, the Central Economic Work Conference and the Central Financial Work Conference and fully, accurately and comprehensively carry out the new development concept. With this measure, SZSE&nbsp;aims to&nbsp;standardize the disclosure requirements for sustainable development information of listed companies, instruct listed companies to practice the concept of sustainable development and promote the improvement of the quality of listed companies.&nbsp;This&nbsp;helps give full play to the hub function of the capital market, guides the gathering of factors in the field of sustainable development, further builds industrial clusters with sustainable investment value and facilitates the realization of the strategic goals of &ldquo;carbon peaking and carbon neutrality&rdquo;. It also drives the enhancement of governance ability, competitiveness, innovation ability, anti-risk ability, medium and long-term sustainable development ability and long-term stable return ability of listed companies, enhances listed companies&rsquo; attraction to long-term capital and further consolidates the foundation for the high-quality development of listed companies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;According to the report to the 20th CPC National Congress, driving low-carbon economic and social development is the key link in achieving high-quality development, which is the primary task for comprehensively building a modern socialist country. The Central Economic Work Conference proposed to actively yet prudently promote carbon peaking and carbon neutrality and accelerate the creation of a low-carbon supply chain. The Central Financial Work Conference pointed out the effective implementation of five major tasks including green finance. In the&nbsp;<i>Three-year Action Plan for Promoting the Improvement of Quality of Listed Companies (2022-2025)</i>, CSRC requires the establishment of a sound disclosure system for sustainable development information,&nbsp;the&nbsp;formulation of a system of disclosure rules for sustainable development information of listed companies&nbsp;that is&nbsp;based on China&rsquo;s actual situation, in line with international trends and with Chinese characteristics,&nbsp;the&nbsp;definition of the implementation path and&nbsp;the&nbsp;gradual promotion as planned in stages. The aim is to better play the role of finance in serving national strategies, supporting high-quality development and practicing social responsibilities and further optimize resource allocation.</p>
<p>Under the guidance of CSRC, SZSE has steadily advanced the drafting of the&nbsp;<i>Guidelines for Sustainable Development Report</i>&nbsp;with the overall thinking of three aspects.&nbsp;Firstly, being practical and realistic.&nbsp;After fully considering the development stage and disclosure ability of listed companies in China, SZSE achieves the matching of cost and benefit through the combination of mandatory and voluntary disclosure, combination of qualitative and quantitative disclosure, setting of transitional period and mitigation measures.&nbsp;Secondly,&nbsp;upholding&nbsp;systematic thinking.&nbsp;SZSE helps listed companies build a sound governance mechanism related to sustainable development, establishes a disclosure framework with &ldquo;governance - strategy - impact, risk and opportunity management - indicators and objectives&rdquo; as&nbsp;the&nbsp;core elements and drives high-quality information disclosure with better internal governance and concrete actions.&nbsp;Thirdly, learning from good practices and reflecting Chinese characteristics.&nbsp;SZSE summarizes the current domestic and foreign disclosure systems and excellent practices, refers to national standards and industry norms and actively absorbs international beneficial experience. Based on the actual situation of China&rsquo;s capital market, SZSE sets specific topics such as rural revitalization and innovation-driven concept to fully reflect the characteristics and advantages of China&rsquo;s listed companies in the field of sustainable development.</p>
<p>Following the above drafting ideas, the&nbsp;<i>Guidelines for Sustainable Development Report</i>&nbsp;consists&nbsp;of 58 articles in 6 chapters covering 20 specific topics, further enriching&nbsp;and improving&nbsp;the information disclosure requirements related to sustainable development on the basis of the existing rules. It specifies that listed companies shall analyze and disclose the topics to be disclosed around four core&nbsp;aspects, namely, governance, strategy, impact&nbsp;-&nbsp;risk&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;opportunity management,&nbsp;and indicators&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;objectives, so that investors and stakeholders can fully understand the actions taken by listed companies to cope with and manage impacts, risks and opportunities related to sustainable development. Meanwhile, it sets multiple topics including carbon emissions, pollutants, ecosystem and biodiversity, circular economy utilization, rural revitalization and supply chain security in such aspects as environment, society and corporate governance. In terms of implementation method, it clarifies that&nbsp;the&nbsp;constituents continuously included in the Shenzhen 100 Index and the ChiNext Index during the reporting period and&nbsp;the&nbsp;companies listed&nbsp;simultaneously&nbsp;at home and abroad shall disclose the&nbsp;<i>Sustainable Development Report</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;that&nbsp;other listed companies are encouraged to make disclosure voluntarily. It also defines that&nbsp;listed companies shall disclose the information related to some important topics through qualitative and quantitative methods, so as to facilitate horizontal and vertical comparison by investors and stakeholders. Meanwhile, it sets mitigation measures for quantitative disclosure requirements&nbsp;including that listed companies can make qualitative disclosure and explain the reasons for the indicators that are more difficult to disclose quantitatively in the first reporting period. In terms of transitional arrangements and other mitigation measures, in order to help listed companies build capacity and prepare for implementation in advance, listed companies that are required to disclose the&nbsp;<i>Sustainable Development Report</i>&nbsp;can disclose the 2025&nbsp;<i>Sustainable Development Report</i>&nbsp;for the first time before April 30, 2026 at the latest. If it is difficult to quantitatively disclose the impact of sustainable development-related risks and opportunities on the current financial position during the reporting periods of 2025 and 2026, it can be only disclosed qualitatively.</p>
<p>SZSE has always adhered to the concept of sustainable development, actively carried out practices related to sustainable development, instructed listed companies to actively fulfill their social responsibilities and&nbsp;has&nbsp;been committed to building a group of listed companies that meet the requirements of low-carbon sustainable development. SZSE has successively issued the&nbsp;<i>White Paper on Environmental Information Disclosure of SZSE-listed Companies</i>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<i>White Paper on Sustainable Development Information Disclosure of SZSE-listed Companies.</i>&nbsp;These help guide&nbsp;listed companies to strengthen their awareness of sustainable development information disclosure and actively practice the concept of sustainable development by sharing the practices and excellent cases of sustainable development information disclosure of SZSE-listed companies. In 2022, more than 2,700 SZSE-listed companies disclosed their social responsibility performance in their annual reports; more than 1,100 ones disclosed information on pollution prevention, resource conservation and ecological protection; and more than 800 ones released independent social responsibility reports or ESG reports, further improving the quality of ESG information disclosure.&nbsp;According to the statistics of the United Nations on total carbon emissions of companies listed on stock exchanges of G20 countries, SZSE-listed companies ranked first in low carbon with the lowest total carbon emissions.</p>
<p>Next, SZSE will, in accordance with the unified deployments of CSRC, continue to listen to the opinions and suggestions of market participants through multiple means, fully study and absorb reasonable opinions and suggestions and timely release them to the market for implementation. SZSE will constantly improve the system of sustainable development rules, cultivate leading companies in the field of sustainable development, enrich the system of sustainable development products, optimize the system of sustainable development services, strive to build a benchmark for sustainable exchanges and help create a low-carbon and sustainable market ecology.</p>
