<div> expanding, solid, employment, inflation, monetary policy
Summary:<br>Economic activity is solid with strong job gains and low unemployment. Inflation is easing but remains elevated. The Committee maintains the federal funds rate and remains attentive to inflation risks. <div>
<p>Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace. Job gains have remained strong, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Inflation has eased over the past year but remains elevated.</p>
<p>The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are moving into better balance. The economic outlook is uncertain, and the Committee remains highly attentive to inflation risks.</p>
<p>In support of its goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent. In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent. In addition, the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as described in its previously announced plans. The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.</p>
<p>In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.</p>
<p>Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chair; John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Thomas I. Barkin; Michael S. Barr; Raphael W. Bostic; Michelle W. Bowman; Lisa D. Cook; Mary C. Daly; Philip N. Jefferson; Adriana D. Kugler; Loretta J. Mester; and Christopher J. Waller.</p>

<div> Securities, regulator, corporate governance, SEC, initiatives
Summary:<br>SEC plays a role in corporate governance, including disclosures, shareholder voting, executive compensation, and insider trading. Initiatives aim to enhance governance.<br> <div>
<p>This video can be viewed at the below&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqcC75HCP94">link</a>.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/video-transcript/sec-chair-gary-gensler-corporate-governance#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>What does the SEC, a securities regulator, have to do with corporate governance?</p>
<p>You might be thinking corporate governance relates to a company's board of directors or management, or it's a matter of state law. And you'd be right. But there's more to this story.</p>
<p>When the SEC was formed 90 years ago, a lot of things had broken down. The stock market, of course, had broken down, but so had matters regarding corporate governance.</p>
<p>Shortly after the 1929 market crash, there was a series of blockbuster Congressional hearings that uncovered widespread abuses by executives of big banks, and utility companies, and investment funds. In essence, the executives had lined their pockets, at you the investor&rsquo;s, expense, and bad corporate governance was part of the problem.</p>
<p>So, shortly thereafter when Congress created the SEC, Congress determined that, as part of our role, we should play a part in corporate governance. Now, this role would stand alongside the state laws, the boards of directors, the management.</p>
<p>Over the decades, in response to yet more corporate governance failures, Congress has given us a number of additional authorities related to this area. And these authorities, taken together, relate to four things.</p>
<p>First, disclosures from issuers about their corporate governance itself. Second, provisions relating to corporate governance that help enhance the integrity of all the other disclosures. Third, provisions about shareholder voting and acquisition of control of the issuers. And, fourth, provisions regarding executive compensation and importantly, ill-gotten compensation, including insider trading.</p>
<p>So, in the last three years, the SEC has taken up several initiatives to carry on our long tradition of corporate governance work.</p>
<p>First, we adopted a number of rules related to executive compensation. In our new clawback rule, for example, it ensures that executives don't keep paid compensation when it was based on an issuer hitting financial milestones that actually were not hit. Further, we finalized rules requiring companies to make disclosures to you, the investors, on the relationship between the company&rsquo;s performance and what they get paid.</p>
<p>Second, we adopted amendments to rules to raise the bar for when insiders can trade in their own company&rsquo;s stock.</p>
<p>Third, relates to proxy voting. We adopted rules regarding something called universal proxy, in essence, allowing investors to vote by proxy similar to how they would vote in person in picking and selecting amongst boards of nominees.</p>
<p>And then, lastly, we adopted rules to require more prompt disclosures by those who seek to buy large stakes in a company to affect control in those companies. These initiatives enhance corporate governance, and that's good for investors and issuers alike.</p>

<title>Cboe Introduces Enhanced Margin Treatment For Index Options Overwriting Strategies</title>

<div> margin relief rule, cash-settled index options, ETFs, capital efficiencies, trading

Summary:<br><br>Cboe introduces margin relief rule for cash-settled index options against ETFs, enhancing capital efficiencies and offering tax benefits for efficient trading and hedging. <div>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Margin rule change aims to enhance capital efficiencies when writing cash-settled index options against ETFs based on the same index</li>
<li>Enables traders to use cash-settled index options as an efficient trading and hedging tool to manage positions at a potentially lower cost</li>
<li>Cboe's suite of index options offer cash-settlement, European-style exercise and potential tax benefits</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cboe Global Markets, Inc. (Cboe: CBOE), the world's leading derivatives and securities exchange network, today announced the introduction of enhanced margin treatment for cash-settled index options. Cboe's&nbsp;margin relief rule aims to provide greater capital efficiencies for traders and reflects its ongoing commitment to advocating for smart and responsive market structure enhancements that meet the evolving needs of its customers.</p>
<p>Cboe's margin relief rule offers enhanced margin treatment when writing, or selling, a cash-settled index option in a margin account against an exchange-traded fund (ETF)&nbsp;that is based on the same underlying index. In the same way an investor can write an equity call option while holding a long position in the underlying security (i.e., a "covered" call), Cboe's rule change allows for writing of index options in a similar manner. An investor, for instance, could write a call option on the Mini S&amp;P 500 Index option (XSP) while having a long position in a corresponding ETF such as the iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF (IVV), SPDR&reg; S&amp;P 500&reg; ETF Trust (SPY), or Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (VOO) to potentially enhance returns on their ETF.</p>
<p>Under the prior framework, there was no margin requirement for a short call that qualified as "covered." Given the similar risk/return profiles of writing an index call option (e.g., XSP) against a long ETF position (e.g., IVV, SPY, VOO) vs. writing a covered call, Cboe's rule now treats these index options as protected for margin purposes &ndash; and not subject to uncovered option margin requirements. This rule change is expected to enable traders to adopt overwriting options strategies at a potentially lower cost than is possible under the existing margin requirement, ultimately creating a more capital-efficient and flexible trading experience.</p>
<p>"Our margin rule represents an exciting development for the options market and provides an additional way for investors to incorporate cash-settled index options in their trading strategies," said Catherine Clay, Head of Global Derivatives at Cboe Global Markets. "Index options can be an excellent trading and hedging tool, offering many unique advantages over existing alternatives. For investors with ETF positions, index options allow them to overwrite long positions with the ease of cash settlement, while potentially mitigating risks of early exercise and capitalizing on potential tax advantages. Our margin relief rule may also potentially free up capital for investors &ndash; which means more resources to allocate to other market opportunities to optimize their trading outcomes."</p>
<p>Cboe is the exclusive home for S&amp;P Dow Jones, FTSE Russell and MSCI index options, along with options on the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX). Cboe's proprietary suite of index options are cash-settled (no transfer of the actual underlying asset; instead, any profit or loss is exchanged in cash upon expiration) and European-style (options can only be exercised at expiration, removing call-away risk and facilitating easier management of positions.)</p>
<p>Cboe's rule applies to any index call or put option written against a position in a non-leveraged index mutual fund or non-leveraged ETF that is based on the same index underlying the index option and held in the same margin account. FINRA recently adopted a similar margin relief rule which conforms to Cboe's rule.

<p>&ldquo;With the addition of MI Center, Encompass now offers lenders a full array of tools and ordering options to digitally initiate and complete mortgage transactions on ICE technology,&rdquo; said Tim Bowler, President of ICE Mortgage Technology&trade;. &ldquo;With all major MI providers available at launch, we&rsquo;re opening doors for lenders to effectively engage with and order mortgage insurance, all through a single interface.&rdquo;</p>
<p>MI Center supports workflow activities pertinent to the mortgage insurance ordering and management process, including comparing rate quotes, managing orders, and uploading documents. Enhanced integrations allow lenders to receive MI quotes from multiple service providers with a single click. Results are grouped by product type but may also be viewed by provider.</p>
<p>EPC integrations were built around the newer MISMO 3.4 data set, which provides a more complete loan data set to MI providers. This gives providers a richer, more robust data set from which to make their evaluations and issue their rate quotes and MI commitments. With the new MI EPC integrations, rate quote documents and insurance certificates will now include the provider&rsquo;s name and type of document in the Encompass eFolder.</p>

Summary: 
Andalusian regional government issues 750 million euro sustainable bonds on BME's fixed income markets with oversubscription and international investor interest.<br /><br /> <div>
<ul>
<li><span>Since 2021, the Regional Government of Andalusia has registered five sustainable issues on BME's fixed income markets for a combined value of 3.35 billion euros</span></li>
</ul>
<p>BME's fixed income market, AIAF, today admitted to trading a EUR 750 million issue of sustainable bonds by the Andalusian regional government at a nominal interest rate of 3.4%. The issue, with a ten-year maturity, is the fifth of its kind by this issuer, for a total amount of 3.35 billion euros.</p>
<p>The placement banks were Banco Santander, BBVA, CaixaBank, Credit Agricole, HSBC and ING. The issue was oversubscribed by more than three times (EUR 2,500 million) by more than 80 institutional investors of 12 nationalities. In addition to Spain, the main investors were Germany, Italy, Portugal, the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria and the Middle East.</p>
<p>The Regional Government of Andalusia is rated Baa2, stable, by Moody's Investors Service and A- , stable, by S&amp;P Global Ratings.</p>
<p>In addition to Andalusia, BME's fixed income markets have registered sustainable issues from five other regional issuers (Community of Madrid, Community of Navarra, the Basque Country, Castilla Le&oacute;n and Galicia), local corporations such as Barcelona City Council, state entities such as Adif and ICO, and public shareholders such as Metro de Tenerife. In addition, there are sustainable issues from the European Union, the European Investment Bank and the national treasuries of Spain, France, the Netherlands, Germany, Ireland, Austria and Belgium.

Spain is one of the leading markets in Europe in terms of sustainable bond issuance and we are convinced that it will continue in this position in the future," explains Gonzalo G&oacute;mez Retuerto, CEO of BME Renta Fija.</p>

<title>EDI Calls For Legislation Outlawing Data Expunging And Contract Termination Charges - Boutique Financial Data Provider: FCA Wholesale Data Market Study Findings Demand Change In Industry Practice</title>

<div> independent financial data vendor, FCA, legislation, discriminatory, anti-competitive<br />
<br />
Summary: 
Exchange Data International (EDI) calls for legislation to outlaw anti-competitive practices by major data vendors, as current termination provisions create barriers for clients and suffocate small data vendors. <div>
<p><span>Exchange Data International (EDI), a leading boutique independent financial data vendor, is today calling on the FCA to propose legislation outlawing discriminatory and anti-competitive practices implemented by major data vendors following the recent publication of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/market-studies/ms23-1-5.pdf" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Wholesale Data Market Study</a>.</span></p>
<p class="nitro-offscreen nitro-lazy-render"><span>The study &ndash; which looked at competition between wholesale data providers &ndash; found that benchmark suppliers of data as well as major data vendors require clients to purge or cease using historical data upon contract termination unless they pay for an ongoing licence fee.</span></p>
<p class="nitro-offscreen nitro-lazy-render"><span>This means that, in effect, clients of benchmark suppliers and the major data vendors are only able to rent the data they are provided with, rather than own it. Furthermore, if clients terminate their contract with one or these suppliers they lose access to all historical data; this is an issue particularly pertinent to asset managers, who generally need historical data for performance comparison.</span></p>
<p class="nitro-offscreen nitro-lazy-render"><span>For many clients, the additional costs of switching data provider &ndash; including contract termination clauses and requirements to purge historical data &ndash; offset any savings gained by switching provider thereby making the switch uneconomic, the study found.</span></p>
<p class="nitro-offscreen nitro-lazy-render"><span>The study also found these requirements are more frequently imposed by main players rather than challengers, and that they present considerable barriers to both a client&rsquo;s ability to switch data providers, and a challenger data provider&rsquo;s ability to establish a significant market share. This is the primary reason why no challenger data provider has more than 3% of the market, and cumulatively challengers only have a 6% market share.</span></p>
<p class="nitro-offscreen nitro-lazy-render"><span>Despite these findings, the FCA study does not currently recommend or call for any legislation change.</span></p>
<p class="nitro-offscreen nitro-lazy-render"><span>Pre Brexit EDI commissioned a leading law firm to investigate these termination practices within the context of competition law, with their assessment being that &ldquo;there are cases which suggest that there are plausible arguments to be made that the Termination Practice infringes EU competition law&rdquo;, specifically in relation to &ldquo;abuse of dominance&rdquo; under Article 102 TEU and its national law equivalents.</span></p>
<p class="nitro-offscreen nitro-lazy-render"><span>The legal report also found that the termination practice imposed on clients by large data vendors may constitute a de facto obligation to remain with that vendor, as the negative repercussions of losing past valuable data makes it unlikely they will switch provider.</span></p>
<p class="nitro-offscreen nitro-lazy-render"><span>As such, with the Wholesale Data Market Study consultation period open until 12th April, EDI is now calling for the FCA to push for legislation that would prohibit both the requirement for data to be expunged upon contract termination, and the imposition of licence fees to retain historical data post termination.</span></p>
<p><small><small></small></small></p>
<blockquote class="nitro-offscreen nitro-lazy-render">
<p><img align="left" alt="Jonathan Bloch, CEO at EDI" class="lazyloaded" hspace="10" id="MzkwOjE5OQ==-1" src="https://cdn-hgnef.nitrocdn.com/XzjsiFluIWsfYNmAPWqZZHvsHBYTqsEf/assets/images/optimized/rev-318e9e2/www.exchange-data.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Jonathan-Bloch-EDI-CEO.jpg" width="25%" /><span><span>&nbsp; Jonathan Bloch, CEO of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.exchange-data.com/">EDI</a>, remarked:</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Current termination provisions not only create huge barriers for clients who want to switch providers, but also suffocate small&nbsp; &nbsp;data vendors who could otherwise flourish within the market. Calling this practice out isn&rsquo;t enough: the FCA has a real&nbsp; &nbsp;opportunity here to take tangible action by calling for legal or regulatory change. In other jurisdictions regulators have made&nbsp; &nbsp;both legal and regulatory attempts to curb anti-comparative behaviour: all eyes are now on the FCA.&rdquo;</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<title>GPW Benchmark Announces Start Of Publication Of New Strategy Indices</title>

<div> Indices, mWIG40TR, strategy, performance, investors
Summary:<br />GPW Benchmark has introduced two new strategy indices, mWIG40TRsh and mWIG40TRlv, reflecting mWIG40TR performance in the opposite or twice as large direction. Investors can generate positive returns on anticipated market falls (mWIG40TRsh) or double their return with doubled risk (mWIG40TRlv). Indices' historical performance is recalculated and published continuously. <div>
<ul>
<li><b>GPW Benchmark has started the publication of two new strategy indices</b></li>
<li><b>The new strategy indices are calculated based on the value of mWIG40TR and the transaction-based index WIRON&reg;</b></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>GPW Benchmark has started publishing two new strategy indices mWIG40TRsh and mWIG40TRlv. The&nbsp; construction and objective of measuring economic realities of the new indices is the same as for the WIG20TRsht and WIG20TRlev indices already published by GPW Benchmark. Unlike the existing indices which are based on the WIG20TR index (the total return counterpart to WIG20) and the transaction-based index WIRON&reg;, the new indices will reflect the performance of the mWIG40TR index (the total return counterpart to mWIG40).</p>
<p>mWIG40TRsh directly reflects the performance of mWIG40TR but in the opposite direction. If mWIG40TR rises by 1% at a trading session, mWIG40TRsh falls by 1%. A 1% decline in mWIG40TR at a session results in a 1% increase of mWIG40TRsh.</p>
<p>mWIG40TRlv also directly reflects the performance of mWIG40TR, its direction is the same as for mWIG40TR, but it is twice as large. If mWIG40TR rises by 1% at a session, mWIG40TRlv rises by 2%. A 1% decline in mWIG40TR results in a 2% decline of mWIG40TRlv.</p>
<p>The return or the cost, respectively, of an investment in the mWIG40TR portfolio is included in the formula of both indices, as well. For mWIG40TRsh, it is the result of the invested amount that the investor receives for short selling the mWIG40TR portfolio. For mWIG40TRlv, it is the cost of capital borrowed to buy shares in the mWIG40TR portfolio. Both the return and the cost of capital are expressed in the new indices in terms of the value of WIRON&reg;.</p>
<p>As a result investors with expectations of negative stock market performance have the opportunity to generate positive returns on their investments if markets fall as predicted (mWIG40TRsh).</p>
<p>Investors expecting a rise in stock prices in the market have a chance of doubling the return on such an investment but they have to remember that their risk of loss is also double (mWIG40TRlv).</p>
<p>The historical performance of the new indices mWIG40TRsh and mWIG40TRlv has been recalculated backwards from 2 January 2019 (first value of WIRON&reg;). The indices are published continuously every 15 seconds between 09:00 and 17:15.<b> </b></p>
<p><b>Performance of new strategy indices mWIG40TRsh and mWIG40TRlv vs. mWIG40TR.</b></p>

<title>Board And C-Suite Leaders Diverge On How To Address Critical Business Challenges, Study From Protiviti, Broadridge And BoardProspects Finds - Focusing On Organizational Resilience And Accountability For Performance Are Governance Best Practices That Can Enable Directors And Management Teams To Work More Effectively</title>

<div> Keywords: Board Governance Survey, Alignment Issues, Critical Challenges, Corporate Culture, Organizational Threats<br />
Summary: The Global Board Governance Survey reveals misalignment between board directors and C-suite leaders, showcasing differences in perceptions, priorities, and preparedness in addressing business challenges.<br /><br /> <div>
<p>Board directors and C-suite leaders are not fully aligned on a range of critical issues when it comes to the oversight of challenges facing their businesses and the board&rsquo;s performance, according to the inaugural Global Board Governance Survey developed by&nbsp;<a href="http://protiviti.com/" target="_blank">Protiviti</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://boardprospects.com/" target="_blank">BoardProspects</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.broadridge.com/" target="_blank">Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.</a>&nbsp;(NYSE: BR).</p>
<p>The study, which captures the views of more than 1,000 board members and C-suite executives from organizations worldwide across a variety of industries, found that while boards and C-suite leaders are aligned in goal and purpose, they do not always see eye to eye on how to get there. It is vital that directors and management teams strategically work to bridge these gaps as their companies continue to face an uncertain macroeconomic environment, an ongoing global war for talent, rising geopolitical risks, cyberattacks, the rise of generative AI and other existential business threats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While the board and C-suite each have their own part to play in the effective management of an organization, they must be on the same page when it comes to navigating the most complex and daunting challenges their companies will face,&rdquo; said Joe Tarantino, president and CEO of Protiviti. &ldquo;In addition to these challenges, the survey also points a way forward for boards and the C-suite to work more effectively by implementing corporate governance best practices, fostering organizational resilience, collectively addressing growth obstacles, and holding each other accountable for continued strong performance.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Where the Board and C-Suite Diverge</b></p>
<p>Boards and the C-suite have many areas of agreement. Strategic planning and execution rates as the top board priority according to both groups. In addition, most director and C-suite respondents &ldquo;agree&rdquo; or &ldquo;strongly agree&rdquo; that board members provide valuable input into corporate strategy and major policy decisions.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to how well the board is carrying out its responsibilities, some differences emerge between the corner office and the boardroom. Ninety-two percent of board respondents rate themselves highly on placing the interests of the company ahead of their own interests, but only 73% of C-suite respondents said the same.&nbsp;Only 58% of board directors agree that board members falling short of expectations are addressed in a constructive manner, a figure which was even lower (36%) for C-suite executives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Board members and C-suite executives are working toward the same goals, but in some cases, the data shows they are taking different routes,&rdquo; said Mark Rogers, Founder and CEO of BoardProspects. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s critical that leadership teams and their partners work together, otherwise it will be difficult to coordinate and execute nimble and competitive responses to changing trends, policies and other market threats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On board and C-suite working dynamics and participation, 89% of board members give themselves high ratings on coming prepared to each meeting, but only 70% of C-suite respondents said the same. Ninety-five percent of board members rated themselves highly on being constructively engaged during meetings and asking probing questions, while only 80% of C-suite executives scored their boards at this level.</p>
<p>When it comes to addressing specific business risks or other business needs, there is misalignment between the board and C-suite on which priorities are not receiving adequate time and attention from the board, including:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corporate culture</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;28% of C-suite respondents believe it is not receiving adequate attention</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19% of board respondents believe it is not receiving adequate attention</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Environmental, social and governance (ESG)</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20% of C-suite respondents</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12% of board respondents</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiring and talent management</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21% of C-suite respondents</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12% of board respondents</p>
<p><b>Addressing Business Threats</b></p>
<p>While board members and C-suite executives largely agree on the top headwinds facing organizations, there is also a significant perceived confidence gap on the board&rsquo;s ability to address them. Of the 15 organizational threats evaluated, in only three instances did more than half of respondents believe their board was &ldquo;extremely&rdquo; or &ldquo;very&rdquo; prepared to address them. These include:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;58%: Impact of compliance/regulatory requirements, including data privacy</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;58%: Access to capital/liquidity</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;55%: Corporate culture (resistance to change or inability to adapt)</p>
<p>Overall, respondents believe their boards are ill-equipped to manage the remaining 12 risks, with the four lowest confidence scores being:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;29%: Political uncertainty</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;29%: Rapid change from disruptive innovation</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;27%: Geopolitical tensions and potential conflicts</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;27%: New and emerging technologies (AI, automation, IoT, metaverse)</p>
<p><b>How Boards Can Take Action</b></p>
<p>&ldquo;Enhancing the dialogue between the C-suite and board members is critical as companies strive to keep pace with technology and the evolving marketplace and this study highlights both the strengths (strategic planning, execution rates and risk management) and areas of greater opportunity (digital transformation, new technologies and cybersecurity),&rdquo; said Michael Tae, Co-President of Broadridge&rsquo;s Investor Communication Solutions. &ldquo;Good corporate governance requires an engaged and active approach, in order to improve both board and C-suite performance and foster growth prospects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The results of the survey reveal several key strategies to improve board governance and performance. Actions that boards and their management teams can take include:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharpening focus on crisis management, cybersecurity issues, and organizational resilience.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Identifying methods of mutual accountability to improve director engagement, assess board performance, and manage underperforming directors.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working together to address obstacles to organizational growth.</p>

<div> Financial Conduct Authority, retirement income advice, review, firms, customer outcomes
Summary: The FCA has asked financial advice firms to review their processes in providing retirement income advice, highlighting both good and poor practices. They have also provided tools to help firms assess their compliance with regulations, including the Consumer Duty. 
<br /><br /> <div>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has today written to the Chief Executives of financial advice firms asking them to review their processes when providing retirement income advice.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/correspondence/dear-ceo-letter-thematic-review-retirement-income-advice.pdf" title="dear-ceo-letter-thematic-review-retirement-income-advice.pdf">letter</a>&nbsp;comes following the FCA&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/thematic-reviews/thematic-review-retirement-income-advice" title="Thematic review of Retirement Income Advice">thematic review</a>&nbsp;of retirement income advice which examined how firms were providing advice.</p>
<p>The review identified examples of good practice in the market with some firms showing they had considered their customers&rsquo; needs and designed their advice model in a way likely to lead to good outcomes. Some firms had clearly detailed processes, specific training on decumulation and used a range of tools to help illustrate complex information for customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the FCA also found some examples where firms were not taking account of the needs of their customers. This included where firms operated in a way unlikely to lead to good customer outcomes by not considering a sustainable level of income to support retirement and some instances of firms not providing the right information to customers. Most of the advice files the FCA reviewed showed advice provided was suitable. However, in a small number of instances recommendations resulted in consumers losing guarantees or incurring unnecessary charges.</p>
<p><span>Sarah Pritchard, Executive Director of Markets and International, at the FCA said</span>: &nbsp;</p>
<p>'Financial advisers have a vital role in helping consumers to make the right decisions now to support them long into the future. Decisions for consumers approaching retirement are complex, with the potential for risk. We want to support a sector that can help consumers access pension benefits, invest with confidence and have a sustainable income when they retire.</p>
<p>'Some firms are getting this right and making a real difference to their customers. However, others are not even getting the basics right and putting their customers&rsquo; futures at risk. We urge all firms to take on board our findings and review their own processes. Where they do not, we will act.' &nbsp;</p>
<p>To help firms the FCA has published a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/retirement-income-advice-assessment-tool-riaat" title="Retirement Income Advice Assessment Tool (RIAAT)">Retirement Income Advice Assessment Tool</a>&nbsp;(RIAAT) and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/documents/instructions-retirement-income-advice-assessment-tool-riaat.pdf" title="instructions-retirement-income-advice-assessment-tool-riaat.pdf">accompanying instructions</a>. This tool shows how we assessed advice files and shows how firms can assess if their advice is compliant with our rules, including the Consumer Duty.&nbsp;</p>

<title>Liquidise Launches To Solve Private Company Equity - The New Platform Offers An Exchange-Like Experience For Private Companies To Manage Their Equity, With A Unique Structure That Guarantees Liquidity</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Registry platform, private market, liquidity pool, guaranteed liquidity, digital asset technology <br />
Liquidise launches with guaranteed liquidity for private companies. Investors and companies like Kester Black and Holon Investments have already benefited. The platform offers a unique structure and process. <br /><br />Summary: Liquidise offers guaranteed liquidity for private companies, benefiting both owners and investors. It incorporates a registry platform, trading platform, and a liquidity pool. <div>
<p><a href="http://www.liquidise.com/" target="_blank">Liquidise</a>, the liquidity platform for private companies, officially launched today having already undertaken three transactions for companies including acclaimed beauty brand&nbsp;<a href="https://kesterblack.com.au/" target="_blank">Kester Black</a>.</p>
<p>Founder and CEO, Andrew Ward, said while the idea of a private market wasn&rsquo;t new, Liquidise offered something that is &ndash; guaranteed liquidity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The problem for private markets has always been liquidity &ndash; you can build a great pool, but ensuring sufficient buyside participation is really difficult,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Liquidise has a unique structure around a guaranteed liquidity pool &ndash; transactions are fully funded before they open for trading, meaning company owners have complete assurance; and shareholders and investors can be confident that they&rsquo;ll be able to trade fairly and efficiently from a transparent price point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kester Black founder and Managing Director Anna Ross said Liquidise had delivered liquidity for shareholders, giving them the opportunity to either sell or buy shares. &ldquo;We had an excellent experience with Liquidise &ndash; the process was smooth, transparent and efficient,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Liquidise is an ideal solution to the liquidity problem that all private company owners face, and we&rsquo;re delighted to have been an early adopter of the platform.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Liquidise incorporates a registry platform (formerly Boulevard Global); a trading platform, and a liquidity pool. Digital asset technology allows for instant settlement and cash transfer. Companies wishing to transact on Liquidise must meet minimum valuation and profitability requirements and undergo a third-party due diligence process to both substantiate their finances and arrive at a share price valuation. An agreed parcel of shares is then purchased by the liquidity pool and its underlying investors, and offered for trade from an agreed price point with pre-qualified and approved participants.</p>
<p>Liquidise investor and Non-Executive Director Cathryn Lyall said the structure and process combined to deliver an unprecedented value proposition for both company owners and investors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unlocking the value of a good company has always been really difficult &ndash; listing is expensive and complex; and the other options like selling, changing control or transacting at a buyer&rsquo;s set price are unpalatable for many reasons,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Also, Employee Share Option Plans have traditionally been cumbersome because good mechanisms for employees to sell their shares don&rsquo;t really exist. Liquidise changes all that, and with 95% of Australian companies privately owned, this can be a real gamechanger for company owners, and for those looking to invest in private opportunities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Companies looking to use Liquidise to facilitate transactions in the coming weeks include Holon Investments; Hellyer Metals Ltd, New Quantum, and LOVE TO. Holon Investments Executive Chairman Luke Behncke said: &ldquo;We have been honoured to be part of the Liquidise journey since its inception and have relied on its registry functions for all critical aspects of governance, compliance and capital raising. Liquidise's Liquidity program is another valuable innovation to support Australian business's commercial realities and we will be looking forward to using it in the future."</p>
<p>Ms Lyall is joined on the Liquidise board by Peter Devine; Ron Lesh; Sean Cash and James Fitzsimmons. The company holds an AFSL and is regulated by AUSTRAC.</p>

<div> Investment, SIX, BITA, indexing, collaboration
<br />
SIX makes a strategic investment in BITA to strengthen joint projects and accelerate global benchmark platform, enhancing ETF services and expanding into key markets.
Summary: <div>
<p><span>SIX, the global financial information provider, and BITA, a leading provider of indexing technology and services, today announced that SIX has made a strategic investment in BITA to strengthen a series of existing joint projects and accelerate the expansion of SIX&rsquo;s global benchmark platform. Existing BITA shareholders, ETFS Capital, Volta Ventures and Pamica NV also invested in the round alongside SIX.</span></p>
<p>Recognizing the growing global demand for the scalable delivery of customized rules-based investment solutions, BITA has developed a cutting-edge technology infrastructure that is currently leveraged by exchanges, delta one desks, and asset management firms in their daily operations. The firm&rsquo;s flagship cloud-based system, BITACore, delivers an extremely intuitive user experience for the design, backtesting, calculation, and dissemination of a large variety of indices, baskets, and custom portfolios.</p>
<p>The investment by SIX aims to strengthen an already successful series of collaborations between both firms. Starting in 2022 with an ongoing partnership to develop a new range of global equity indexes and accelerate the time-to-market for the delivery of customized solutions, the relationship has already expanded to the realm of crypto, where SIX has been leveraging BITA&rsquo;s calculation infrastructure and APIs on a variety of indexing projects that have delivered significant value to SIX clients.</p>
<p>"At SIX, we are committed to providing innovative and efficient solutions to the Indexing and ETF industry,&rdquo; says Marion Leslie, Head Financial Information and Executive Board Member, SIX. &ldquo;Our strategic investment in BITA strengthens our existing partnership and fuels our shared vision of a future where customized indexing solutions are accessible and scalable for all market participants. Together, we will leverage BITA&rsquo;s cutting-edge technology and SIX&rsquo;s global reach to deliver even greater value to our clients.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The collaboration and subsequent investment underpin SIX&rsquo;s drive to expand its range of market-leading services catering to the ETF sector. From creation to redemption, listing, trading, and custody, including high-quality market, index, and reference data distribution, SIX offers the full spectrum of international ETF services along its value chain as a unique one-stop shop. Ultumus, an ETF data specialist acquired by SIX from ETFS Capital in 2021, is in fact already serving as sales and distribution agent and allowing BITA to reach the sell-side with its newly launched custom basket management solution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our growing, multifaceted business relationship with SIX is a perfect example of how our indexing infrastructure can support financial institutions in scaling their product development, cutting time to market, and increasing their flexibility&rdquo; says Victor Hugo Gomez, CEO of BITA. &ldquo;We are delighted to welcome SIX as an investor in BITA and look forward to leveraging their footprint as we continue our path towards becoming the leading investment customization infrastructure&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The funds raised will be utilized by BITA to enhance the functionality of its infrastructure and continue to expand into additional key markets.</p>

<div> Innovation, Regulation, Crypto, Enforcement, Consumer protection
Summary:<br /><br />ASIC promotes responsible financial innovation while ensuring consumer protection and market integrity. They support regulatory reforms and enforce laws effectively. <div>
<div class="dombanner"></div>
<p><span>Key points</span>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>ASIC seeks to promote the growth of responsible financial innovation by balancing our approach to enabling innovation with consumer protection and market integrity outcomes.</li>
<li>We acknowledge the potential benefits of novel financial products and services, or new ways of offering existing products and services &ndash; as long as they are developed and distributed with appropriate regard for consumers, investors, and market integrity.</li>
<li>In ASIC&rsquo;s view, regulation and enforcement help to foster trust &ndash; and trust is essential to every part of the financial system &ndash; crypto and decentralised finance included.</li>
</ul>
<div class="dombanner"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining me &ndash; and thank you to Blockchain APAC for the invitation to speak today.</p>
<p>I would like to begin by acknowledging the traditional owners and custodians of the land on which we meet today &ndash; the Gadigal people of the Eora nation. I pay my respects to their elders past, present and emerging &ndash; and extend that respect to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people here today.</p>
<p>As each of you is acutely aware, there are a range of significant regulatory reforms on the horizon for the crypto sector.</p>
<p>Today I want to comment on these proposed changes &ndash; with a particular focus on ASIC&rsquo;s role to date, our remit more broadly and, most importantly, the outcomes we are hoping to see.</p>
<p>Before I come to that, however, I want to begin by setting out ASIC&rsquo;s approach to innovation &ndash; and why we believe that effective regulation can help promote it.</p>
<h2>ASIC&rsquo;s approach to innovation</h2>
<p>You may be familiar with the concept of the &lsquo;regulatory trilemma&rsquo; &ndash; something ASIC&rsquo;s Chair, Joe Longo, has spoken about a number of times previously. The regulatory trilemma puts forward the idea that supervision of financial innovation can at best achieve two of the following three objectives:</p>
<ol>
<li>Consumer protection</li>
<li>Market integrity</li>
<li>Encouraging financial innovation</li>
</ol>
<p>There is doubtless a tension between these seemingly competing factors. But ultimately the challenge of good regulation is to strike a workable balance between all three.</p>
<p>In ASIC&rsquo;s view, regulation and enforcement help to foster trust &ndash; and trust is essential to every part of the financial system &ndash; crypto and decentralised finance included. A system with limited oversight, that is opaque, unpredictable and unreliable &ndash; leading to widescale investor losses or market manipulation or abuse &ndash; will ultimately fail to thrive.</p>
<p>For ASIC&rsquo;s part, we seek to promote the growth of responsible innovation in financial services by balancing our approach to enabling innovation with consumer protection and market integrity outcomes.</p>
<p>One way we do this is through our Innovation Hub. One of the Hub&rsquo;s functions is to assist fintech and regtech start-up and scale-up businesses navigate the regulatory framework. Since 2015, we have provided informal regulatory assistance to over 900 entities.</p>
<p>A number of entities involved with crypto assets or using blockchain technology have accessed the Hub for assistance and had the benefit of the Enhanced Regulatory Sandbox, which ASIC administers on behalf of the Government.</p>
<p>We also host a number of forums which bring together a range of industry representatives and government agencies, and meet regularly with domestic and international peer regulators to discuss trends in innovation.</p>
<h2>Tokenisation</h2>
<p>One example of our activities in the field of financial innovation &ndash; which I believe will be of particular interest to this audience &ndash; is tokenisation.</p>
<p>Proposals to tokenise financial products and other &lsquo;real world&rsquo; assets have been increasing recently &ndash; and we have been monitoring broader developments in this area.</p>
<p>ASIC worked closely with the RBA on its trial of a Central Bank Digital Currency. We supported the pilot &ndash; which tested some token-based products and services supported by the CBDC &ndash; by assessing use cases and providing relief from the Corporations Act to several participants.</p>
<p>We have seen some banks piloting stablecoins, as a step to facilitate broader tokenised offerings &ndash; as well as proposals from financial market infrastructures.</p>
<p>We can see significant operational and other changes that may have material flow-on impacts to financial markets &ndash; and will be increasing our focus on tokenisation going forward.</p>
<p>Questions we will be considering include:</p>
<ul>
<li>How does tokenisation fit in the current regime?</li>
<li>What, if anything, may be required by way of law reform or guidance?</li>
<li>What are the opportunities and risks?</li>
<li>How can we effectively address the cross-border issues and dynamics?</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some types of tokenisation will be regulated through the current regulatory regime, while others will be regulated through the Government&rsquo;s digital asset platform proposal.</p>
<p>Which brings me to the topic doubtless front of mind for most in this audience: regulatory reform.</p>
<h2>Proposed regulatory reforms</h2>
<p>As you will be aware, there are a range of regulatory reforms and related developments in train.</p>
<p>Last October, the Government released its proposed framework for regulating digital asset platforms. Under these proposals, digital asset platforms would be incorporated within the existing financial services framework. This would involve introducing a new type of financial product called a &lsquo;digital asset facility&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Platform providers will require an Australian Financial Services Licence, granted by ASIC, to operate their platforms, if these reforms are enacted as proposed. This proposal follows on from Treasury&rsquo;s consultation in 2022 on crypto asset secondary service providers, and the 2023 token mapping exercise.</p>
<p>In December last year, the Government released a consultation paper on regulating payments services providers, which includes a proposal to regulate payments stablecoins.</p>
<p>So, what is ASIC&rsquo;s view of and role in these reforms?</p>
<p>In short, our desired outcome is a clear set of rules that maintain market integrity and mitigate the risks to consumers and investors &ndash; backed by mechanisms that promote compliance with these rules and enable us to enforce them effectively.</p>
<p>The word outcomes here is an important one. What matters most are the regulatory outcomes.</p>
<p>While there are different approaches to regulating the crypto asset industry globally, one area of increasing cohesion is the consensus that is developing on the intended outcomes.</p>
<p>Last November, the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) published its recommendations for crypto and digital asset markets.<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/crypto-and-digital-assets-policy-regulation-and-innovation/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span>[1]</span></a>&nbsp;The recommendations place a strong emphasis on addressing governance and conflicts of interest, abusive behaviours, sales and distribution practices, and custody.</p>
<p>As a member of IOSCO and an active participant in its Fintech Task Force, ASIC supports IOSCO&rsquo;s objective of same activity, same risk, same regulatory outcome.</p>
<p>ASIC will continue to support Treasury in the development of its proposed regulatory regimes &ndash; and, when they are finalised, ASIC expects to have a significant role in their initial implementation and ongoing administration.</p>
<p>The final policy settings and legislation are, of course, a matter for Government.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s role will be &ndash; as it is now &ndash; to administer and enforce the laws within our remit.</p>
<p>As you will be aware, under existing law, ASIC only regulates crypto assets and businesses to the extent they involve financial products or financial services. Directors&rsquo; duties and other requirements related to companies also apply.</p>
<p>I want to emphasise, though, that the question as to whether a particular crypto asset or related product is a financial product will remain every bit as important if the new regime is legislated as proposed.</p>
<p>To quote from the Treasury&rsquo;s proposal paper: &ldquo;In all cases, the existing financial services laws will apply to any transaction involving a financial product&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we have already begun thinking about implementation &ndash; such as our processes and guidance. This includes a number of informal discussions with some in the industry.</p>
<p>So, what does all this mean for the industry and people advising it on the implications of the proposed new regime?</p>
<p>It is likely going to mean significant uplift in the operations of a number of industry participants. The proposal is that platform providers will need to comply with the general obligations for licensees &ndash; including operating efficiently, honestly and fairly &ndash; alongside other obligations within the Corporations Act.</p>
<p>Some platform providers will face additional obligations, where they undertake what Treasury has called a &ldquo;financialised function&rdquo;. For example, if you provide the token trading function, this could mean aspects of the markets regime may apply.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s as much as I can say about ASIC&rsquo;s work on this, at this stage, while we wait for the proposed reforms to be finalised.</p>
<p>Whatever the regime, however, if you are operating a business engaged in digital assets, the onus is on you to satisfy yourself that you are operating within the law. That is, you have the appropriate licences &ndash; and that you conduct your business in accordance with the regulatory obligations that apply at any point in time. We provide some guidance, such as in&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/digital-transformation/crypto-assets/" title="Crypto-assets">Information Sheet 225</a>&nbsp;on crypto assets. But ultimately it is your responsibility to ensure you comply.</p>
<p>Where we see misconduct, including where we assess you as needing a licence to offer a product or service, we can take action, as we have demonstrated.</p>
<p>I will now say a few words about our approach to enforcement.</p>
<h2>ASIC&rsquo;s approach to enforcement</h2>
<p>ASIC applies a strategic, risk-based approach to enforcement. We cannot take action in every case of misconduct. That being the case, the absence of ASIC action should not be regarded as endorsement or agreement.</p>
<p>Rather, we take action where we see the most serious harm &ndash; or a risk of it &ndash; and in cases most likely to send a strong message of deterrence to others.</p>
<p>To date, ASIC has taken a range of enforcement action, using existing laws.</p>
<p>We are not afraid to pursue cases where the law might be considered unclear. In our legislative and judicial system, the courts are the ultimate arbiter of these matters. This approach applies to all sectors under our regulatory remit &ndash; and is no different for crypto.</p>
<p>In February, for example, the Federal Court found Block Earner engaged in unlicensed financial services conduct when offering its crypto-backed Earner product. The &lsquo;Earner&rsquo; product was found to be a managed investment scheme. However, ASIC was unsuccessful in our allegation that the &lsquo;Access&rsquo; product was a financial product. I remind you, however, that each case depends on the specific facts in relation to the product, service and/or conduct.</p>
<p>In addition, late last week, the Federal Court found that Finder Wallet had not engaged in unlicensed financial services conduct when offering its Finder Earn product. We are still considering the judgement in that matter.</p>
<p>ASIC has a further two crypto-related matters before the courts currently.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, as I hope I have demonstrated, ASIC is committed to supporting innovation in a way that balances the other two regulatory objectives I mentioned earlier &ndash; consumer protection and market integrity.</p>
<p>We acknowledge the potential benefits of novel financial products and services, or new ways of offering existing products and services &ndash; as long as they are developed and distributed with appropriate regard for consumers, investors, and market integrity.</p>
<p>Both regulators and the regulated population work best when we have a clear set of rules to work within. When those rules are backed by mechanisms that allow us to enforce them effectively &ndash; and promote a culture of compliance among the entities that must adhere to them &ndash; this can result in enhanced trust from investors in particular classes of assets and in the financial system as a whole.</p>
<p>While there might be different views about the best approach to regulation to deliver that outcome, it&rsquo;s an outcome on which we can all agree.</p>
<p>For ASIC&rsquo;s part, we continue to strengthen our knowledge and capabilities in relation to digital assets, ensuring we are directing our resources effectively and building upon our existing expertise in this area.</p>
<p>And in doing so, we will continue to engage constructively with industry participants and their advisers, through opportunities like today&rsquo;s event.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time &ndash; and I now look forward to answering any questions you may have.</p>

<div> Mortgages, OCC, Performance, Foreclosures, Modifications
<br />
The OCC Mortgage Metrics Report for the fourth quarter of 2023 showed an increase in performing mortgages, a decrease in foreclosures, and a slight decrease in loan modifications.
<br /><br />Summary: The OCC's report on first-lien mortgages in the federal banking system for the fourth quarter of 2023 indicates improved mortgage performance, lower foreclosure initiations, and a slight decrease in loan modifications. <div>
<p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) reported on the performance of first-lien mortgages in the federal banking system during the fourth quarter of 2023.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<em>OCC Mortgage Metrics Report, Fourth Quarter 2023</em>&nbsp;showed that 97.2 percent of mortgages included in the report were current and performing at the end of the quarter, an increase from the 97.1 percent in fourth quarter 2022, and a decrease from the previous quarter&rsquo;s 97.3 percent.</p>
<p>The percentage of seriously delinquent mortgages&mdash;mortgages that are 60 or more days past due and all mortgages held by bankrupt borrowers whose payments are 30 or more days past due&mdash;increased from the prior quarter; however, it has trended down since the fourth quarter of 2021.</p>
<p>Servicers initiated 8,320 new foreclosures in the fourth quarter of 2023, a decrease from a year earlier and from the previous quarter.</p>
<p>Servicers completed 7,382 modifications during the fourth quarter of 2023, a 0.7 percent decrease from the previous quarter&rsquo;s 7,436 modifications. Of these 7,382 modifications, 6,416 or 86.9 percent, were &ldquo;combination modifications&rdquo;&mdash;modifications that included multiple actions affecting the affordability and sustainability of the loan, such as an interest rate reduction and a term extension.</p>
<p>The first-lien mortgages included in the OCC&rsquo;s quarterly report comprise 22.2 percent of all residential mortgage debt outstanding in the United States or approximately 11.7 million loans totaling $2.9 trillion in principal balances.</p>
<p>This report provides information on mortgage performance through December 31, 2023, and is available on the OCC&rsquo;s website,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.occ.treas.gov/index.html" title="Home">www.occ.gov</a>.</p>

<title>Treasury International Capital Data For January</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/treasury-international-capital-data-for-january-8/</link>

<div> TIC data, U.S. Department of the Treasury, foreign acquisitions, long-term securities, short-term U.S. securities<br />
Summary: TIC data released by the U.S. Department of the Treasury shows that in January 2024, there was a net TIC outflow of $8.8 billion. Foreign residents increased their holdings of long-term U.S. securities, while U.S. residents increased their holdings of long-term foreign securities. The data also shows the forthcoming new data on valuation changes in holdings of long-term securities, to be reported monthly starting in April 2024. There will be no change to the monthly TIC press release or to monthly reporting on banking claims and liabilities, derivatives, and claims and liabilities of nonfinancial firms. <div>
<p>The U.S. Department of the Treasury today released Treasury International Capital (TIC) data for January 2024.&nbsp; The next release, which will report on data for February 2024, is scheduled for April 17, 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sum total in January of all net foreign acquisitions of long-term securities, short-term U.S. securities, and banking flows was a net TIC outflow of $8.8 billion. &nbsp;Of this, net foreign private outflows were $26.9 billion, and net foreign official inflows were $18.1 billion.</p>
<p>Foreign residents increased their holdings of long-term U.S. securities in January; their net purchases were $79.8 billion.&nbsp; Net purchases by private foreign investors were $75.6 billion, while net purchases by foreign official institutions were $4.2 billion.</p>
<p>U.S. residents increased their holdings of long-term foreign securities, with net purchases of $43.7 billion.</p>
<p>After including adjustments, such as estimated foreign portfolio acquisitions of U.S. stocks through stock swaps, overall net foreign purchases of long-term securities are estimated to have been $36.1 billion in January.</p>
<p>Foreign residents decreased their holdings of U.S. Treasury bills by $27.8 billion.&nbsp; Foreign resident holdings of all dollar-denominated short-term U.S. securities and other custody liabilities decreased by $32.0 billion.</p>
<p>Banks&rsquo; own net dollar-denominated liabilities to foreign residents decreased by $12.8 billion.</p>
<p><a href="https://home.treasury.gov/data/treasury-international-capital-tic-system">Complete data are available on the Treasury website here</a>.</p>
<p>About TIC Data</p>
<p>The monthly data on holdings of long-term securities, as well as the monthly table on Major Foreign Holders of Treasury Securities, reflect foreign holdings of U.S. securities collected primarily on the basis of custodial data.&nbsp; These data help provide a window into foreign ownership of U.S. securities, but they cannot attribute holdings of U.S. securities with complete accuracy.&nbsp; For example, if a U.S. Treasury security purchased by a foreign resident is held in a custodial account in a third country, the true ownership of the security will not be reflected in the data.&nbsp; The custodial data will also not properly attribute U.S. Treasury securities managed by foreign private portfolio managers who invest on behalf of residents of other countries.&nbsp; In addition, foreign countries may hold dollars and other U.S. assets that are not captured in the TIC data.&nbsp; For these reasons, it is difficult to draw precise conclusions from TIC data about changes in the foreign holdings of U.S. financial assets by individual countries.</p>
<p>Forthcoming New Data on Valuation Changes in Holdings of Long-Term Securities</p>
<p>Starting with the April 17, 2024 release, the Treasury International Capital (TIC) system will begin reporting monthly valuation changes in holdings of long-term securities.&nbsp;<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/data/treasury-international-capital-tic-system">Data will be available on the Treasury website here</a>.</p>
<p>Tables 1, 2, and 3 on monthly holdings of securities, which currently have blank columns for valuation changes, will show valuation changes as far back as February 2023. The new data will show total monthly changes in the fair market value of holdings that result only from changes in the prices of the securities held. The data are becoming available for the first time because of changes in reporting on TIC Form SLT that began in February 2023 and that are described in the TIC press releases of&nbsp;<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1346">March 15, 2023</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1420">April 17, 2023</a>.</p>
<p>There will be no change to the monthly TIC press release or to monthly reporting on banking claims and liabilities, derivatives, and claims and liabilities of nonfinancial firms.</p>

<title>CalPERS Will Increase Private Markets Investments</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/calpers-will-increase-private-markets-investments/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/calpers-will-increase-private-markets-investments/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Private markets, CalPERS, investments, asset classes, portfolio
<br />
CalPERS Board approved increasing private market investments, prioritizing private equity and debt, while decreasing public equity and fixed income allocations. Discount rate remains at 6.8%. Next review in 2025.
<br /><br />Summary: CalPERS approved increased investments in private markets, specifically in private equity and debt, while decreasing allocations in public equity and fixed income. The discount rate remains at 6.8%. The next review is scheduled for 2025. <div>
<p>Moving to seize market opportunities and maximize returns from the highest performing asset classes, the CalPERS Board of Administration approved a proposal on Monday to raise the portfolio&rsquo;s investments into the private markets.</p>
<p>CalPERS continues to progress with the private asset strategy begun in 2022. The proposal will increase total private market allocations from 33% of plan assets to 40%. Private equity will increase from a target of 13% of the fund to 17% while private debt will increase from 5% to 8%. The private equity strategy has been successfully achieving its program goals for co-investment and investments in diverse managers while moving away from large buyout.</p>
<p>"Strong and ongoing growth in private equity returns is behind this measured and appropriate increase," said CalPERS Trustee David Miller, chair of the Investment Committee. "Market conditions are evolving, and the investment team needs latitude to deploy capital intelligently to keep the fund on track for sustainable returns."</p>
<p>Board members conducted a lengthy and full session to hear concerns raised about labor practices in some companies where CalPERS is invested.</p>
<p>"The board adopted stringent new labor principles last year, and we will rely on them in our engagement with companies to do the right thing," said CalPERS President Theresa Taylor.</p>
<p>A new CalPERS analysis finds that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.calpers.ca.gov/docs/board-agendas/202403/invest/item07b-01_a.pdf" target="_blank" title="opens in new window">private equity's 20-year annualized returns stand at 12.3% (PDF)</a>, making it the top performing asset class of the fund over that period. The returns from private equity over a five-year and 10-year period also outpaced every other asset class as of the end of 2023. The one-year return for private debt, which was established as a separate asset class in 2022, was 13.3% as of end of 2023.</p>
<p>The CalPERS Investment Office conducted a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.calpers.ca.gov/docs/board-agendas/202403/invest/item06a-01_a.pdf" target="_blank" title="opens in new window">mid-cycle asset allocation review (PDF)</a>&nbsp;and concluded that private equity remains the asset class with the highest expected long-term total return, which combined with the team&rsquo;s strong recent deployment has allowed the allocation to increase. The fund's Strategic Asset Allocation targets were last adjusted in 2021.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.calpers.ca.gov/docs/perf-monthly-update.pdf" target="_blank" title="opens in new window">most recent (PDF)</a>&nbsp;figures available for the fair value of the CalPERS private equity and private debt asset classes were $68.7 billion and $12.3 billion, respectively. Just&nbsp;<a href="https://www.calpers.ca.gov/docs/board-agendas/202311/invest/item06a-01_a.pdf" target="_blank" title="opens in new window">last year (PDF)</a>, values for private equity and private debt stood at $63.5 billion and $10.9 billion, respectively.</p>
<p>The target allocations for public equity and fixed income will decrease under the new policy. CalPERS' allocation for public equity will go to 37% of the fund and fixed income will be reduced to 28%. The Real Asset target is unchanged.</p>
<p>Although each asset class has a specified target allocation, the policy allows for a given range. For example, private equity's target is now set at 17%, but the range extends by five percentage points in either direction, between 12% to 22% of plan assets.</p>
<p>Fund allocations are evaluated every four years under a process known as Asset Liability Management, with mid-cycle reviews also conducted. The process examines CalPERS' assets and liabilities with an eye toward ensuring the portfolio is well-balanced and capable of meeting future pension costs.</p>
<p>CalPERS' discount rate, comparable to an assumed annual rate of return, will remain at 6.8%. Investment earnings are a crucial source of funding for member pensions. For each dollar spent on pensions, more than half is from returns, underscoring the need for a resilient portfolio.</p>
<p>The next Asset Liability Management review is scheduled for 2025.</p>

<title>Fifth Third Bank Moving To ICE’s End-To-End Mortgage Ecosystem To Improve Customer Experience - Integrated Data, Comprehensive Technology, And Consumer-Facing Digital Tools Streamline, Accelerate Housing Finance Cycle And Improve Long-Term Customer Relationship</title>

<div> ICE, Fifth Third, mortgage technology, data solutions, digital mortgage<br />
Summary:<br />
Fifth Third bank partners with ICE for end-to-end mortgage technology and data solutions, including loan origination, servicing, and analytics. <div>
<p><span><a href="https://www.ice.com/index" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Intercontinental Exchange</a>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.ice.com/index" rel="nofollow" shape="rect"><span>, Inc.</span>&nbsp;</a>(NYSE: ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today announced that&nbsp;<a href="http://www.53.com/" rel="nofollow" shape="rect"><span>Fifth Third Bank</span>&nbsp;</a>will move its origination and servicing operations to the end-to-end mortgage technology ecosystem from ICE.</p>
<p>Using the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.icemortgagetechnology.com/products/encompass" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Encompass<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;</a>and&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.icemortgagetechnology.com/products/msp-mortgage-servicing-system" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">MSP<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;</a></span>loan origination and servicing platforms gives the bank a seamlessly integrated system to handle both first lien and home equity products across all lending and servicing channels, from customer engagement and loan production through the long-term servicing of the mortgage. Fifth Third will also incorporate multiple ICE data and analytics solutions to help mitigate risk, identify opportunities, and gain crucial insights to support data-driven decision making.</p>
<p>Jay Plum, executive vice president and head of Mortgage for Fifth Third has played a leadership role in the bank&rsquo;s digital mortgage initiative. According to Plum, taking a truly end-to-end approach to the home finance lifecycle with integrated technologies and data solutions far exceeds the benefits of leveraging individual technological solutions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Fifth Third, we&rsquo;re working to digitize the overall homebuying experience, giving our customers control, choice and transparency along the journey,&rdquo; said Plum. &ldquo;ICE&rsquo;s approach to modernizing housing finance with integrated technology and seamless data sharing aligned perfectly with what we&rsquo;re seeking to accomplish for our customers. We share a vision for a smooth, simple, and accessible experience, from the start of a customer&rsquo;s mortgage journey all the way through their long-term servicing experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bank will benefit from the speed and accuracy afforded by the ICE Data &amp; Document Automation solution, ensuring clean data transfers. In addition to the Encompass and MSP core systems, Fifth Third will also be using ICE&rsquo;s consumer-facing Servicing Digital solution, which provides borrowers with self-serve capabilities and information about their loan, property and neighborhood. It also serves as a channel for lender-servicers to communicate opportunities for equity loans or refinancing, and for mortgage holders to seek assistance in times of distress.</p>
<p>Fifth Third will also deploy multiple ICE data and analytics solutions, with ICE&rsquo;s Rapid Analytics Platform (RAP) serving as the access point to ICE&rsquo;s robust mortgage and property data, valuation and indexing solutions, and behavioral models. RAP is a comprehensive analytics workspace with a marketplace of connections to ICE&rsquo;s many real estate, housing finance and other data sets. With RAP, data scientists and other users have the ability to upload and join proprietary data sources for analysis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifth Third is well known for its commitment to providing a premier digital mortgage experience,&rdquo; said Tim Bowler, president of ICE Mortgage Technology. &ldquo;That is a common goal we share. Fifth Third&rsquo;s use of Encompass and MSP to originate and service both first lien and home equity lending products, together with the data and analytics solutions ICE provides to enhance the customer experience, will help the bank to further its own digital initiative.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Cboe Global Markets Launches Options On Three New MSCI Indices</title>

<div> Options, Trading, Cboe, MSCI, Index
<br />
Cboe launches MSCI World, ACWI, and USA index options for global equity exposure, hedging, and income generation, expanding its MSCI product suite.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Cboe MSCI World Index Options (MXWLD), Cboe MSCI ACWI Index Options (MXACW), and Cboe MSCI USA Index Options (MXUSA) are available for trading&nbsp;</li>
<li>MXWLD and MXUSA options are based on 1/100th of index value &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Launch is part of broader initiative to expand&nbsp;Cboe's MSCI tradable product suite&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cboe Global Markets, Inc. (Cboe: CBOE), the world's leading derivatives and securities exchange network, announced it has launched for trading Cboe MSCI World Index Options (MXWLD), Cboe MSCI ACWI Index Options (MXACW), and Cboe MSCI USA Index Options (MXUSA). The launch is part of Cboe's deepening relationship with MSCI Inc. (MSCI), a leading provider of critical decision support tools and services for the global investment community.</p>
<div class="PRN_ImbeddedAssetReference" id="DivAssetPlaceHolder1"></div>
<p>The three new MSCI index options are designed to provide a range of investors exposure to international, developed and emerging markets and U.S. equity market performance.&nbsp;The new&nbsp;Cboe MSCI index options can provide pension funds, insurance companies, and other institutional investors more efficient ways to hedge their global equity exposure, while minimizing potential tracking error and currency risk. Additionally, each of MXWLD and MXUSA is based on a fraction (1/100th) of the value of its underlying index, making these options more accessible for retail investors.</p>
<p>"As more investors seek global equity exposure, adding three new options on MSCI's world renowned benchmarks was the natural next evolution for Cboe's suite of index options products," said Catherine Clay, Head of Global Derivatives at Cboe Global Markets.&nbsp;"Whether investors are looking to hedge their portfolios, generate yields, or make directional trades, we have seen heightened interest in the optionality derivatives can provide. These new index options, and the MSCI volatility benchmark indices launched recently will provide important tools in helping investors manage their global exposures. We look forward to building upon our relationship with MSCI and providing investors the global risk management tools they need."</p>
<p>For portfolio managers running options overlay strategies, these new index options are designed to allow investors to expand their overlay programs to their global portfolio and thus, diversify the sources of potential income in their portfolio. A potential benefit of overwriting the newly launched MSCI index options include their European-style cash settlement, which helps to eliminate risk of early exercise and physical settlement, two common pain points in running a yield enhancement strategy.</p>
<p>Cboe initially listed MXACW, MXUSA, and MXWLD with standard expiration on the third Friday of each month. Additionally, Cboe plans to list five end-of-week expirations that are expected to begin trading on March 21, 2024. The three new Cboe MSCI Index options are available for trading on the Cboe Options Exchange.</p>
<p>The new index options are in addition to the currently listed Cboe MSCI tradable products, which include Cboe MSCI EAFE Index Options (MXEA) and Cboe MSCI Emerging Markets Index Options (MXEF). Recently, Cboe expanded its suite of volatility indices with the Cboe MSCI EAFE Volatility Index (VXMXEA) and the Cboe MSCI Emerging Markets Volatility Index (VXMXEF). Developed using Cboe's proprietary VIX<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;Index methodology, these indices are based on existing MXEA and MXEF options and are designed to provide a transparent measure of the market's expectation of 30-day implied volatility by these respective MSCI index option classes. Similar to the VIX Index, which is designed to reflect investors' consensus view of future (30-day) expected U.S. stock market volatility, the new Cboe MSCI Volatility Indices aim to provide comparable measures for international and emerging equity market volatility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cboe and MSCI will be hosting a&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4117992-1&amp;h=795429152&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fcboe.zoom.us%2Fwebinar%2Fregister%2F6017105167622%2FWN_WDKL0CPoThSrqL9ITvabSg%23%2Fregistration&amp;a=webinar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">webinar</a>&nbsp;on the key benefits and opportunities provided by the new indices options on Wednesday, March 27.

<div> Collaboration, ADX, Eureeca, IPOs, investors
Summary:
ADX and Eureeca collaborate to offer international investors access to ADX IPOs. ADX's market capitalization increases, and Eureeca aims to become a global investment bank.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<ul>
<li><i>In a pioneering first initiative, the ADX-Eureeca collaboration will offer international investors compliant and user- friendly access to ADX IPOs. This endeavor aims to enhance international investor engagement on ADX whilst also expanding Eureeca's offerings by including ADX IPOs.</i></li>
<li><i style="font-family: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">ADX's collaboration with Eureeca capitalises on the Exchange&rsquo;s robust e-IPO investor portal, highlighting its commitment in simplifying the IPO investment process while leveraging Eureeca&rsquo;s multinational regulatory framework and advanced technology with the aim of improving access to ADX IPOs for regional and international investors.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange (ADX), one of the fastest-growing exchanges in the world, is collaborating with Eureeca, a global investment platform matching individual and institutional investors with growth and pre-IPO companies. This collaboration aims to bolster accessibility to ADX IPOs in a fully compliant manner, appealing to growing interest from regional and global retail investors and high net-worth individuals (HNWIs).</p>
<p>The collaboration between ADX and Eureeca capitalises on the Exchange&rsquo;s robust e-IPO investor portal, highlighting its commitment to simplifying the IPO process. By utilising Eureeca&rsquo;s efficient capabilities, ADX seeks to improve investors&rsquo; access to IPOs and enable a more efficient process for international investors. The partnership capitalises on Eureeca&rsquo;s multi-regulated status and international investor base, giving regional and international retail and HNWIs the opportunity to participate in ADX IPOs, positioning ADX IPOs on the global map.</p>
<p><b>Abdulla Salem</b><b> </b><b>Alnuaimi,</b><b> </b><b>Chief</b><b> Executive Officer of ADX</b>, said: "We are excited to announce our partnership with Eureeca, supporting our commitment to innovation and inclusivity in the financial sector. By leveraging Eureeca&rsquo;s advanced technological capabilities, we believe this new initiative, will significantly transform IPO accessibility and provide a simpler investment journey for a diverse range of investors who are looking to be part of ADX&rsquo;s growth.</p>

Being the first collaboration of its kind to enable international investors to subscribe to an IPO frictionlessly, whilst having the ability to sell at any given moment post the IPO&rsquo;s listing on the exchange via the Eureeca platform, is truly a game-changer. This initiative underscores our aim of establishing the first global, democratised digital investment bank. We look forward to enhancing the offering on a multiple country basis in order for investors to build a well-diversified multi-asset class, multi-jurisdictional investment portfolio using our platform.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The partnership aligns with ADX's strategic vision to enhance global connectivity and increase investment opportunities for retail investors globally, furthering its status as a leading financial hub in the region. Eureeca, with its global footprint and multi-regulatory platform, is positioned to support this vision, promising to open new avenues for investors worldwide.</p>
<p>In 2023, ADX&rsquo;s market capitalisation was up 17% to a total of AED 3 trillion (USD 817 billion), reinforcing its position as the largest capital market in the UAE and the second largest in the Middle East. The number of investors jumped by 59% year-on-year.

<title>FIA Urges CFTC To Fill Gaps In Customer Protections Before Approving Leveraged Direct Clearing</title>

<div> proposed rulemaking, FIA, clearing member funds, CFTC, customer protection
Summary:
FIA supports proposed rule for clearing member fund protection. Direct clearing models lack comparable protections to FCMs. Holistic review and action needed before approving new models.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p><span>FIA has filed&nbsp;</span><a href="https://email.fia.org/c/126bgz538qBHgfOIVBG3cSxE8fZn4B">comments</a><span>&nbsp;with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on its proposed rulemaking related to the protection of clearing member funds held by designated clearing organizations (DCOs). FIA&rsquo;s letter supports the proposed codification of segregation and additional protections for clearing member property, many of which are in place today at major clearinghouses. However, the letter cautions that the rulemaking is far from sound footing for the CFTC to approve new direct clearing models, such as the leveraged disintermediated clearing model first sought by FTX.</span><br /><span>&nbsp;</span><br /><span>&ldquo;The Commission&rsquo;s action is a constructive first step to close the gap between the protections available to customer property and those available to clearing member property,&rdquo; FIA President and CEO Walt Lukken said in the letter. &ldquo;But it is only a first step. Finalizing the [proposed rule] in a vacuum may give market participants &ndash; and, in particular, retail customers &ndash; the mistaken impression that when they commit funds to a [clearinghouse] clearing under the non-traditional models that the CFTC has begun to license, they will receive the same protections as customers of [futures commission merchants].&rdquo;</span><br /><span>&nbsp;</span><br /><span>The letter highlights numerous areas where, even if the proposed rule were enacted, a customer clearing directly with a clearinghouse would not receive comparable protections as a customer clearing through a futures clearing merchant (FCM). Not only would the direct customer not benefit from the independent and complementary functional relationships between registered intermediaries, exchanges, and clearinghouses, each of which has mutually reinforcing risk management obligations, but it also would lose the protections afforded by FCM disclosures, anti-money laundering and customer due diligence and regulatory oversight, notably in respect of customer-facing activities.</span><br /><span>&nbsp;</span><br /><span>Regulatory protections for market participants are the bedrock of US futures and derivatives markets, the letter emphasized. &ldquo;We should not jeopardize the standing of these markets, much less the safeguarding of customer property, in the rush of new and untested models to market,&rdquo; said Lukken.</span><br /><span>&nbsp;</span><br /><span>FIA&rsquo;s letter calls on the CFTC to perform a holistic review of its statutory authority, regulations and self-regulatory framework to ascertain what steps it needs to take to provide the same robust protections to customers across all clearing models. Only after this review is completed, and appropriate action taken, should the CFTC consider approving new models.</span></p>

<div> G-20, Pittsburgh, Basel III, derivatives, clearing
Summary:
The speaker discusses the risks of US regulatory changes on derivatives clearing, impacting global markets and increasing costs for end-users.<br /><br /> <div>
<p>Good afternoon.&nbsp; Thank you to the World Federation of Exchanges (&ldquo;WFE&rdquo;) for inviting me to participate in this year&rsquo;s WFEClear Conference, and thank you to the Bolsas y Mercados Espa&ntilde;oles for hosting all of us.&nbsp; I must first give my standard disclaimer: The views I share today are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of the United States Government, my fellow commissioners, or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (&ldquo;CFTC&rdquo;), on which I am proud to serve.</p>
<p>Throughout the programming over the next few days, the WFE organizers have highlighted a few themes that I would like to echo&mdash;clearing incentives, clearing structures, and market resilience&mdash;by offering my thoughts on certain current regulatory developments in the United States.&nbsp; I believe these developments risk undermining the post-financial crisis goals, carefully evaluated and laid out by the G-20 in 2009, of increasing the use of central clearing, strengthening the clearing system, and reducing systemic risk.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opamersinger7?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt1" id="fntref1" name="fntref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Before I get into these developments, I think it may be instructive to take a step back in time to September 2009 and that meeting of the G-20 Leaders, which was held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.&nbsp; This seminal moment may seem like just yesterday to many in this room, but it has been almost 15 years since that meeting.&nbsp; Although a lot has happened since 2009, many of the themes from that meeting in Pittsburgh are still relevant, and we continue to be well served by the goals that were articulated at that important summit.</p>
<p>Unless you are a fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers football team (American football, that is), or an alumnus of the University of Pittsburgh, you may be wondering (like I did):&nbsp; Why Pittsburgh?&nbsp; A few hours&rsquo; drive East would take you to Philadelphia, a city of historical significance to the United States.&nbsp; Or perhaps the summit could have been held in New York City, the seat of financial power in the United States thanks to Alexander Hamilton&rsquo;s ambition to create a national bank.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opamersinger7?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt2" id="fntref2" name="fntref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>So, why Pittsburgh?&nbsp; Well, it turns out that New York City was the first choice for the summit, but when that did not work out, it was instead held in Pittsburgh to highlight the city&rsquo;s economic transformation from the home of America&rsquo;s steel industry to a hub of high-tech innovation.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opamersinger7?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt3" id="fntref3" name="fntref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Pittsburgh has an interesting history that started well before the city&rsquo;s economic turnaround. &nbsp;I am admittedly a bit of a history nerd. &nbsp;I enjoy learning about the origins of the towns and cities throughout the United States, and I stumbled across a truly unusual historical fact about Pittsburgh&mdash;the story of how it came to be spelled with an &ldquo;h&rdquo; at the end. &nbsp;While there are other cities in the United States sharing this name, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania is the only city that is spelled using the &ldquo;h&rdquo; at the end of its name.</p>
<p>The mysterious existence of this silent &ldquo;h&rdquo; at the end of Pittsburgh dates back to 1758, in a letter sent to William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham, informing him that his name was being given to the territory&mdash;Pittsbourgh (or Pittsburgh)&mdash;with an &ldquo;h.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opamersinger7?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt4" id="fntref4" name="fntref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;When the city, then Pittsburgh, was chartered in 1816, an apparent printing error dropped the &ldquo;h&rdquo; from the charter.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opamersinger7?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt5" id="fntref5" name="fntref5">[5]</a>&nbsp; However, despite the missing &ldquo;h&rdquo; in the charter, the citizens of Pittsburgh continued to spell the city&rsquo;s name with an &ldquo;h.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opamersinger7?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt6" id="fntref6" name="fntref6">[6]</a></p>
<p>While it might seem as though this should have been the end of that story, in 1891, the United States Government stepped in to correct this supposed spelling error.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opamersinger7?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt7" id="fntref7" name="fntref7">[7]</a>&nbsp; The United States Board on Geographic Names declared that an &ldquo;h&rdquo; does not belong in the names of towns ending in &ldquo;burg.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opamersinger7?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt8" id="fntref8" name="fntref8">[8]</a>&nbsp; And, in case there was any doubt as to the government&rsquo;s decree being the correct outcome to this persistent spelling issue, the Board pointed to the misprinted city charter to bolster its argument that the &ldquo;h&rdquo; did not belong in Pittsburgh.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opamersinger7?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt9" id="fntref9" name="fntref9">[9]</a></p>
<p>But the good people of Pittsburgh did not see a problem with their preferred spelling of Pittsburgh, and they certainly did not accept the government&rsquo;s edict on the impropriety of a silent &ldquo;h&rdquo; in the names of towns ending in &ldquo;burg.&rdquo;&nbsp; In fact, the Pittsburgh Gazette, the University of Pittsburgh, and the Pittsburgh Stock Exchange refused to accept the government&rsquo;s new spelling and continued to use the &ldquo;h&rdquo; in spelling &ldquo;Pittsburgh&rdquo; until the Board on Geographic Names gave up the fight approximately 20 years later and officially restored the original spelling in 1911.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opamersinger7?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt10" id="fntref10" name="fntref10">[10]</a></p>
<p>I am sharing this story for a reason other than making all of us relive our fears of the dreaded elementary school spelling bee. &nbsp;There are numerous lessons in this story that we can learn from and apply today. &nbsp;First, proofreading is important. Second, change is not always positive. &nbsp;And third, imposing a solution that is contrary to the interests of those who bear its consequences is not the best way for a government to exercise its power.</p>
<p>Returning to where I started, the G-20 Leaders recognized at their Pittsburgh meeting that the cleared financial derivatives markets remained resilient during the financial crisis<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opamersinger7?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt11" id="fntref11" name="fntref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;&mdash;and, of course, we know what happened in the uncleared, over-the-counter derivatives markets.</p>
<p>With that understanding, the G-20 Leaders determined that clearing of standardized derivatives through central counterparties (&ldquo;CCPs&rdquo;) offered a solution to limit the counterparty credit risk of interconnected derivatives trading in the financial system.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opamersinger7?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt12" id="fntref12" name="fntref12">[12]</a>&nbsp; Thus, increasing central clearing through CCPs became a goal for derivatives markets across the globe, and much of the risk held by individual institutions has shifted to the central clearing model over the past decade.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opamersinger7?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt13" id="fntref13" name="fntref13">[13]</a></p>
<p>But recent policy proposals in the United States risk upending the success we have experienced through the efforts of the G-20 and the move to central clearing. &nbsp;In connection with their implementation of the Basel III framework, United States prudential bank regulators recently proposed increased risk-based capital requirements for banks providing client clearing services, despite the recognition by the G-20 Leaders of the beneficial, risk-reducing effect of clearing derivatives.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opamersinger7?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt14" id="fntref14" name="fntref14">[14]</a></p>
<p>This proposal, which we refer to as the Basel III Endgame Proposal, would diverge from (rather than harmonize with) the approach of our international colleagues, and would have a significant&mdash;and negative&mdash;impact on derivatives markets.</p>
<p>First, it would disincentivize firms from offering client clearing services to derivatives end-users&mdash;which is directly contrary to the goal of the G-20 Leaders to increase the use of central clearing.&nbsp; The Futures Industry Association has compiled data showing that the Basel III Endgame Proposal would increase the capital required to engage in client clearing activities by more than twenty-two percent.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opamersinger7?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt15" id="fntref15" name="fntref15">[15]</a>&nbsp; Banks are likely to react to this financial disincentive by passing along the higher cost of providing client clearing services to their customers and/or decreasing the extent to which they offer client clearing services. Either result would undermine our shared post-financial crisis goal of increased clearing.</p>
<p>Second, the Basel III Endgame Proposal would weaken the clearing system by exacerbating the downward trend in the number of entities offering client clearing services. &nbsp;In January 2004, there were 177 futures commission merchants (&ldquo;FCMs&rdquo;) registered with the CFTC.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opamersinger7?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt16" id="fntref16" name="fntref16">[16]</a>&nbsp; Twenty years later, as of January 2024, there are 62 FCMs registered with the CFTC<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opamersinger7?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt17" id="fntref17" name="fntref17">[17]</a>, representing a 65% decline. But over the same period, there has been a dramatic increase in customer funds held at FCMs to support derivatives trading.&nbsp; In January 2004, FCMs held over $87 billion of customer funds.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opamersinger7?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt18" id="fntref18" name="fntref18">[18]</a>&nbsp; Today, that smaller number of FCMs is holding five-and-a-half times that amount of customer funds&mdash;$490 billion.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opamersinger7?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt19" id="fntref19" name="fntref19">[19]</a>&nbsp; And of that customer money, approximately 60% is concentrated in the top five FCMs.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opamersinger7?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt20" id="fntref20" name="fntref20">[20]</a></p>
<p>By worsening this downward trend in the availability of entities to provide clearing services, the Basel III Endgame Proposal would weaken the clearing system, not strengthen it.&nbsp; In clearinghouses, when a clearing member fails, losses are mutualized among members. But with fewer members available amongst which a loss can be mutualized, clearing membership becomes a riskier activity&mdash;perhaps beyond the risk tolerance of some firms that might then choose to no longer remain members of a clearinghouse&hellip;and thus continues a vicious cycle.</p>
<p>Third, a further decline in the number of FCMs would create systemic risk. In addition to concentration concerns, a decline in the number of FCMs would raise serious challenges regarding the portability of customer positions should a clearing member fail. &nbsp;Consider this potential scenario: a clearing member defaults, and its customers&rsquo; positions need to be ported to a different clearing member; however, porting those positions proves difficult or even impossible because the Basel III Endgame Proposal has both decreased the number of clearing members and reduced client clearing capacity at the remaining clearing members.&nbsp; This outcome of the Basel III Endgame Proposal would increase systemic risk, not reduce systemic risk.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, then, these changes to bank capital requirements under the Basel III Endgame Proposal would have significant negative effects on cleared derivatives markets.&nbsp; The consequences would be most acute with respect to derivatives that are required to be cleared pursuant to post-financial crisis reforms. And these negative effects would be felt, first and foremost, by the end-users that our markets are supposed to serve&mdash;farmers, ranchers, energy producers, energy consumers, pension plans, endowments, and businesses both small and large.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Derivatives end-users would confront increased risk if the Basel III Endgame Proposal is adopted.&nbsp; Those that wish to clear through more than one FCM to mitigate the risk of their funds being tied up if their FCM fails may not be able to do so if the universe of FCMs dwindles.&nbsp; Worse, the resulting increased cost of hedging might compel end-users to leave some of their activities unhedged&mdash;and thus far riskier than they need to be.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the increased hedging costs resulting from adoption of the Basel III Endgame Proposal would mean price increases for those buying a house or a car, purchasing food to feed their families, or paying their electricity bills to keep the lights on.&nbsp; Given the global nature of today&rsquo;s derivatives markets, I would not expect these consequences to be confined to America&rsquo;s shores.</p>
<p>To end on a positive note, during a recent Congressional hearing, Federal Reserve Chairman Powell stated he expects that the Basel III Endgame Proposal would be significantly revised, and that the Federal Reserve Board would reach consensus on &ldquo;broad and material&rdquo; changes to the Proposal by the end of this year.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opamersinger7?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt21" id="fntref21" name="fntref21">[21]</a>&nbsp; For the overall strength and resilience of the global clearing system, I hope these changes reflect what I believe is the most important lesson of the Pittsburgh &ldquo;h,&rdquo;&mdash;namely, imposing a government-mandated solution that is contrary to the interests of those in the derivatives markets that will bear its consequences is not the best way for a government to exercise its power.</p>
<p>Of course, bank capital requirements are critical to our collective efforts to prevent another financial crisis.&nbsp; But addressing capital requirements should not impose undue costs on providing client clearing services.&nbsp; Such a result would undermine the G-20&rsquo;s goals, harm derivatives end-users that rely on clearing services, increase risk in the global financial system, and raise the cost of living for our families.</p>
<p>Thank you again to WFE for inviting me to speak with all of you today and to our gracious hosts for having us here.&nbsp; I would be happy to answer any questions you may have.</p>

<title>LME Proposes New Warehouse Location In Jeddah</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> LME, Jeddah, copper, zinc, consultation
Summary:
The LME plans to list Jeddah as a delivery point for copper and zinc pending a technical change consultation. Jeddah meets LME standards, and the proposed amendment aims to ensure easy access to metal in case of warehouse insolvency. Jeddah will become active three months after the approval of the first warehouse company in that location. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The London Metal Exchange (LME) is pleased to announce its intention to list Jeddah as a new delivery point for copper and zinc, subject to a short consultation on one technical change to the LME&rsquo;s warehouse location framework.</p>
<p>Matthew Chamberlain, LME CEO, commented: &ldquo;We are committed to evolving the LME warehouse network to ensure we provide maximum global connectivity for the metals community. Saudi Arabia is an increasingly important global metals hub, and Jeddah fully meets with the operational and logistical criteria for new warehouse locations &ndash; such as being an important area of net consumption and having an effective transport network.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Farooq Shaikh, LogiPoint CEO, commented: &ldquo;We very much welcome the LME intention to list Jeddah as a new LME Delivery Point for copper and zinc, and we are very pleased that the Jeddah Islamic Port and the Bonded Re-Export Zone meets the LME&rsquo;s exacting standards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The listing of Jeddah is a great illustration of the implementation of the 2019 National Industrial Development and Logistics Program (part of the Kingdom&rsquo;s Vision 2030) which aims to transform the Kingdom into a leading global player in the energy, mining, logistics and industry sectors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We look forward to a long future of cooperation with LME and to further developing our relationships with the international metals community to make Jeddah and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia a major metals logistics hub servicing the Middle East, North and East Africa regions.&rdquo;<span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The LME&rsquo;s consultation proposes to amend a general clause in the LME Policy on the Approval of Locations as Delivery Points related to warehouse insolvency. A key element of the Policy is to ensure that, in the unlikely event of a warehouse operator insolvency, metal owners can easily access their metal. The proposed amendment is intended to clarify that some jurisdictions may require a court order to allow the withdrawal of metal &ndash; and the LME considers that this is acceptable, provided that concerns do not exist as to the speed or effectiveness of the court process.</p>
<p>The consultation will close on 30 April 2024, and subject to feedback, the Policy change will take effect. It is then the LME&rsquo;s intention to list Jeddah as a delivery point. As per the usual process for location listings, Jeddah will then become active three months after the approval of the first warehouse company in that location.</p>

<title>CFTC Orders U.S. Bank To Pay $6 Million And Oppenheimer To Pay $1 Million For Recordkeeping And Supervision Failures For Firm-Wide Use Of Unapproved Communication Methods</title>

<div> enforcement, charges, recordkeeping, supervision, communication
Summary:<br />Commodity Futures Trading Commission issues charges and monetary penalties against U.S. Bank and Oppenheimer for recordkeeping and supervision violations. SEC also takes action. <div>
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today issued two orders simultaneously filing and settling charges against&nbsp;U.S. Bank, N.A., a swap dealer, and against&nbsp;Oppenheimer &amp; Co., Inc., an introducing broker, for failing to maintain and preserve records that were required to be kept under CFTC recordkeeping requirements and failing to diligently supervise matters related to their businesses as CFTC registrants.</p>
<p>The settling registrants admit the facts detailed in the orders, are ordered to cease and desist from further violations of recordkeeping and supervision requirements, and are ordered to&nbsp;comply with&nbsp;specified remedial undertakings.</p>
<p>The orders require U.S. Bank to pay a $6 million civil monetary penalty and Oppenheimer to pay a $1 million civil monetary penalty.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The orders find from at least 2019 to the present, both U.S. Bank and Oppenheimer failed to stop employees, including those at senior levels, from communicating using unapproved communication methods, including messages sent via personal text. The firms were required to keep certain of these written communications because they related to the firm&rsquo;s CFTC-registered businesses.&nbsp;These written communications generally were not maintained and preserved by either firm, and neither firm generally would have been able to provide them promptly to the CFTC if and when requested.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each order further finds the firm-wide use of unapproved communication methods violated each firm&rsquo;s internal policies and procedures, which generally prohibited business-related communication via unapproved methods. Further, some of the supervisory personnel responsible for ensuring compliance with the firm&rsquo;s policies and procedures also used unapproved communication methods to engage in business-related communications, in violation of firm policy.</p>
<p>Since December 2021, the CFTC has imposed $1.124 billion in civil monetary penalties on 22 financial institutions for their use of unapproved communication methods, in violation of CFTC recordkeeping and supervision requirements. [See CFTC Press Release Nos.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8470-21">8470-21</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8599-22">8599-22</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8699-23">8699-23</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8701-23">8701-23</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8762-23">8762-23</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8763-23">8763-23</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8794-23">8794-23</a>]</p>
<p>Related Civil Actions</p>
<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently announced entry of orders filing and settling charges against an SEC-registered U.S. Bank affiliate and Oppenheimer and imposing civil monetary penalties for recordkeeping and supervision violations related to the use of unapproved communication methods.</p>
<p>******</p>
<p>The Division of Enforcement staff responsible for these actions are Devin Cain; Alejandra de Urioste; R. Stephen Painter, Jr.; Lenel Hickson, Jr.; and Manal M. Sultan.</p>

<div> Tokenize, HSBC Euro Liquidity Fund, Moreliquid, MMMEUR token, blockchain technology<br />
Summary:<br />
Moreliquid tokenizes HSBC Euro Liquidity Fund with MMMEUR token, providing monthly coupon payments, managed on Polygon network, accessible to EEA investors, and secured by Dfns. <div>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.moreliquid.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">moreliquid</a><span class="s1">,</span>&nbsp;a leading digital securities investment platform, today announced its groundbreaking initiative to tokenize the HSBC Euro Liquidity Fund by introducing the Moreliquid Money Market EUR (MMMEUR) token. This move signifies a major advancement in integrating traditional financial instruments with blockchain technology, offering institutional and high-net-worth investors a unique and dynamic way to engage with the Euro money markets.</p>
<div class="dombanner"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">Regulated under the jurisdiction of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the MMMEUR token offers monthly coupon payments, providing a steady and predictable income stream for institutional and high-net-worth investors. The token&rsquo;s evergreen maturity date ensures long-term engagement possibilities. Reflecting its underlying asset, the HSBC Euro Liquidity Fund, the MMMEUR token is designed to give qualified investors exposure to a diverse portfolio of short-term securities, carefully curated to meet stringent criteria for maturity, issuer reputation, market listing, and credit ratings as required by law. The specifics about the HSBC Euro Liquidity Fund are available<span class="s1">&nbsp;<a href="https://www.assetmanagement.hsbc.co.uk/en/institutional-investor/funds/ie0030028439" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1">Issued on the Polygon network, the MMMEUR token sets its minimum investment at &euro;100,000. It requires investors to be residents of the EEA, targeting primarily institutional and high-net-worth investors interested in the Euro liquidity market. This requirement ensures that the fund attracts committed and qualified investors, contributing to a stable and focused investment environment.</p>
<p class="p1">Expanding the utility of real-world asset tokens, Moreliquid allows the MMMEUR token to be managed, transferred, or utilized as collateral for loans. This integration enhances the functionality of the MMMEUR token, providing investors with increased liquidity, versatility, and security in their investments. By leveraging moreliquid&rsquo;s secure and compliant DeFi platform, investors gain control and flexibility over their digital real-world assets, merging traditional finance with blockchain innovation.</p>

Utilizing the open-source ERC3643 standard for its issuance, the MMMEUR token ensures that blockchain-based securities regulations are met seamlessly, highlighting innovation, compliance, and transparency.&nbsp;<a href="https://copper.co/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Copper&nbsp;</a>and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dfns.co/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dfns</a>&nbsp;have been selected as the wallet management solution and infrastructure for the MMMEUR token, ensuring top-tier security and compliance.

<title>M-PESA Safaricom Partners With Onafriq, Enabling The Flow Of Remittances To Ethiopia</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/m-pesa-safaricom-partners-with-onafriq-enabling-the-flow-of-remittances-to-ethi/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/m-pesa-safaricom-partners-with-onafriq-enabling-the-flow-of-remittances-to-ethi/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://m-pesa.safaricom.et/">M-PESA Safaricom</a> has signed an International Money Transfer Agreement with <a href="https://onafriq.com/">Onafriq</a>, Africa&rsquo;s largest digital payments network, operating in 40 African countries, to help streamline remittance flows to Ethiopia.</p>
<p>M‑PESA provides individuals with quick and easy financial services through a mobile phone. Users do not need a bank account, just a Safaricom sim card. Through the agreement, individuals within Ethiopia are able to receive remittances from different parts of the world through M-PESA, based on the authorisation received from the National Bank of Ethiopia to start the remittance service in July 2023.</p>
<p>Last year, the <a href="https://ethiopianmonitor.com/2023/12/18/remittances-flow-to-ss-africa-up-by-1-9-to-54bln/">World Bank</a> stated that the remittances flow to countries in sub-Saharan Africa reached $54 billion in 2023 - an increase from the previous year's gain. This increase was driven by strong remittance growth in countries like Mozambique, Rwanda and Ethiopia.</p>
<p>While this increase is a move in the right direction, there is work to be done. The receipt of remittances plays a crucial role in reducing poverty as well as the GDP of a country. Ethiopia&rsquo;s Director General of Ethiopian Diaspora, Mohammed Endris, previously noted this, stating that in some countries remittances take up to 40-50% of the GDP, while the remittance sent by the <a href="https://www.ena.et/web/eng/w/eng_2952257">diaspora to Ethiopia is 5%.</a>&nbsp; A partnership such as the one between M-PESA Safaricom and Onafriq will only serve to contribute to this figure.</p>
<p>The incorporation of International Money Transfer capability into its offering allows M-PESA to tap into and leverage Onafriq&rsquo;s extensive network, connecting 500 million mobile money wallets and 200 million bank accounts. This vast reach enables domestic and cross-border disbursements and collections, card issuing and processing, agency banking, and treasury services.</p>
<p>Of this partnership, Paul Kavavu, General Manager at Safaricom Ethiopia, states: &ldquo;Our goal is to make payments easier, and the incorporation of International Money Transfer services into M-PESA serves that purpose perfectly. Ethiopia generates more than five billion USD in remittances annually and this partnership will provide the Ethiopian Diaspora with an easy and fast formal channel to send money to their loved ones in Ethiopia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nika Naghavi, Group Head of Growth at Onafriq, states that the partnership will directly stimulate the realisation of Ethiopia's digital transformation strategy. The strategy termed &lsquo;Digital Ethiopia 2025&rsquo;, places emphasis on enabling systems through digital transformation, of which digital payments form a crucial part. The country's solution to this includes ensuring financial inclusion, innovation in the banking system and the adoption of innovative solutions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have always believed that payments should be a simple process, as simple as a phone call - connecting individuals through increased access. The agreement with M-PESA Safaricom extends our reach in Africa even further and strengthens our position as the largest payment network on the continent. We are confident that this partnership will positively impact economic growth and the achievement of greater sustainable development goals,&rdquo; says Naghavi.</p>
<p>The service complements Ethiopia&rsquo;s efforts to generate foreign currency inflow through formal channels, offering a safe, inclusive and reliable service to customers through M-PESA.</p>

<title>Genesis Agrees To Pay $21 Million Penalty To Settle SEC Charges</title>

<div> SEC, Genesis Global Capital, LLC, civil penalty, crypto asset lending program, Gemini Earn program
<br />
Summary: 
SEC fines Genesis Global Capital $21 million for unregistered securities offering. Genesis unable to meet withdrawal requests, files for bankruptcy. <div>
<div class="article-body">
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Genesis Global Capital, LLC agreed to a final judgment ordering it to pay a $21 million civil penalty and imposing a permanent injunction to settle charges that it engaged in the unregistered offer and sale of securities through a crypto asset lending program known as the Gemini Earn program. Under the terms of the settlement, the SEC will not receive any portion of the penalty until after payment of all other allowed claims by the bankruptcy court, including claims by retail investors in the Gemini Earn program.</p>
<div class="dombanner"></div>
<br />
<p>&ldquo;We charged Genesis with failing to register its retail crypto lending product before offering it to the public, bypassing essential disclosure requirements designed to protect investors,&rdquo; said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s settlement builds on previous actions to make clear to the marketplace and the investing public that crypto lending platforms and other intermediaries need to comply with our time-tested securities laws. Doing so best protects investors. It promotes trust in markets. It&rsquo;s not optional. It&rsquo;s the law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The collapse of the Gemini Earn program underscores the unknown risks that investors are exposed to when market participants fail to comply with the federal securities laws,&rdquo; said Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;As this enforcement action makes clear, no amount of hype and advertising can substitute for the investor-protection disclosures required by the federal securities laws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-7">charged Genesis</a>&nbsp;and Gemini Trust Company, LLC (&ldquo;Gemini&rdquo;) on January 12, 2023. According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the Gemini Earn program was a purported investment opportunity where Gemini customers, including retail investors in the United States, loaned their crypto assets to Genesis in exchange for Genesis&rsquo; promise to pay interest earned from Genesis&rsquo; use of the loaned crypto assets. The complaint alleges that, in November 2022, Genesis announced that it would not allow the Gemini Earn investors to withdraw their crypto assets because Genesis lacked sufficient liquid assets to meet withdrawal requests following volatility in the crypto asset market. At the time, Genesis held approximately $900 million in crypto assets from 340,000 Gemini Earn investors.</p>
<p>Genesis and two affiliates filed voluntary Chapter 11 petitions in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York on January 19, 2023. Investors have been unable to access or withdraw the crypto assets they invested with Genesis via Gemini Earn.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, charged Genesis and Gemini with violating Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933. In addition to the civil penalty referenced above, Genesis, without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining Genesis from violating Section 5 of the Securities Act.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Jonathan Austin and Ashley Sprague and supervised by Deborah Tarasevich and Stacy Bogert. The litigation in the bankruptcy court was conducted by Therese Scheuer and William Uptegrove and supervised by Alistaire Bambach. The ongoing district court litigation against Gemini is being led by Edward Reilly and Laura Meehan and supervised by James Connor and Olivia Choe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The pace of pre-market issuance activity in some asset classes has been ramping up,&rdquo; said Gerard Faulkner, Director of Operations for CGS. &ldquo;Time will tell whether we&rsquo;re seeing a short-term blip in activity or whether this trend will continue throughout the first half of 2024.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Requests for international equity CUSIPs fell 30.4% in February and international debt CUSIP requests rose 6.4%. On an annualized basis, international equity CUSIP requests are down 17.9% and international debt CUSIP requests are up 55.7%.</p>

<div> Consumer Duty, wholesale market regulation, listing regime, financial wellbeing, data-led regulator
<br />
The FCA's 2024-25 Business Plan focuses on protecting consumers, promoting competition, and contributing to UK competitiveness through innovation and data-led regulation.
<br /><br />Summary: The FCA's 2024-25 Business Plan aims to protect consumers, support UK competitiveness, and become a world-class data-led regulator. <div>
<p>In its Business Plan for 2024-25, the FCA has set out an ambitious programme of work for the final year of its 3-year strategy to achieve better outcomes for consumers and markets.</p>
<div class="container">
<p>Nikhil Rathi, Chief Executive of the FCA, said:&nbsp;</p>
<p>'We&rsquo;ve already made significant progress in delivering against the bold vision we set out in our strategy two years ago, including the game-changing introduction of the Consumer Duty and proposing the most far-reaching reforms to wholesale market regulation and the listing regime in decades.&nbsp;</p>
<p>'We remain resolute in supporting the vital role the financial sector plays in the UK&rsquo;s long-term economic growth, embracing the potential benefits that technology presents both for us and the firms we regulate, while also continuing to protect consumers and ensure market integrity.'</p>
<p>The FCA will continue to deliver the 13 commitments in its strategy, which focuses on preventing serious harm, setting higher standards and promoting competition. Specific issues it will prioritise include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Protecting consumers by testing if firms are meeting the high standards set by the Consumer Duty, supporting people&rsquo;s long term financial wellbeing through the Advice Guidance Boundary Review and making sure pension products deliver value for money.</li>
<li>Contributing to UK competitiveness and growth by improving the attractiveness and reach of UK wholesale markets, supporting firms to invest, innovate and expand through our innovation services and continuing to make it quicker and easier for firms to apply for authorisation.</li>
<li>Building on the significant progress already made to become a world-class data-led regulator by automating more of its analytics tools to help it detect and respond to consumer harms faster and working with firms on the safe deployment of artificial intelligence.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>The planned programme of work builds on the progress made over recent years to become a more outcomes-based, assertive and data-led regulator.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The introduction of the Consumer Duty marked a major shift by setting higher and clearer standards of consumer protection and has already led to firms making changes to savings rates and fees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FCA is making better use of data to spot and stop harm faster and is being tougher on the firms that could cause harm. It removed over 10,000 potentially misleading adverts in 2023 and sent out 2,243 warnings about unauthorised firms and individuals. It also more than doubled the number of firm permissions cancelled, compared to the previous year, for failing to meet its minimum standards.</p>
<p>It has adapted its rules and improved its processes to ensure the UK remains an attractive place to invest. This includes proposing the most far-reaching package of reforms to the listing regime for decades to encourage a greater range of companies to list in the UK and compete on the global stage.</p>

Summary: CFC enters the carbon insurance market with Carbon Delivery Insurance, covering physical and political risks, rated based on the carbon project. Partnership with IncubEx. <div>

<div dir="ltr" id="dvprnejpg7125left"><img align="middle" alt="CFC Logo" id="prnejpg7125left" src="https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2363060/CFC_Logo.jpg" title="CFC Logo" /></div>
<p>CFC's innovative new&nbsp;<a href="http://email.prnewswire.com/ls/click?upn=u001.v-2BJ3gj6ki5QD5j-2Fn6dQLivWLeW7wmLd6HkGolGF0jm7UAVABiEpZh-2FHKzJrSbYN-2F-kws_pIbxPfpDI69aAybPrpOfg1n6CWmKMnb3conIyNKCYgr-2BTRqxLAwMRExIXLpGb5DJ7ljK1jpsH8usQoqKIf3iqzuqF1CAfDZZWw-2FQyXX2MFQ044e30xhgAUYq3nj9ka-2F1KlynSFoJkra9bdFszANvOgym5yX1tAtV1l-2Fs8eJo6SAbbce76gxyDqFMDpO3E2h4AW3x7HpIBvdAtoFLaD-2BN3O1R2kYI8O19Cdn2Bkl261Z7aqL5qM0yIRDx-2FVfA3rtV-2BAbBa8hBNeiRCKaMiDvZdWovzi8lJpEeB3Huzo-2FTOHgW2-2Bx1gB2wS-2FlUAgbLsm-2BxjgEKo4ioPUyPC1FGM-2BlMRWtL4uyig9TdO99J3zW8ZQf9xwi-2BcleCpSRQQptLHrJ4" target="_blank">Carbon Delivery Insurance</a>&nbsp;is the first to cover both the physical and political risks faced by businesses purchasing voluntary carbon credits on a forward basis. Carbon Delivery Insurance covers 100% of the purchaser's investment for non-delivery of carbon credits.</p>
<p>And in another first, CFC has built a sophisticated underwriting model that rates the carbon project itself rather than the policyholder. This makes the product easy to buy, and negates the need for lengthy, complex application forms and protracted discussions that take weeks to result in a quote. Rather, CFC can deliver same day quoting and binding for a buyer purchasing from one of over 300 carbon projects and counting.</p>
<p>To understand the increasing demand among leading market participants for carbon insurance to help mitigate the risks of the voluntary carbon market (VCM), CFC surveyed over 500 companies actively involved in the market.</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>75% of existing buyers are 'very concerned' about delivery shortfalls</li>
<li>65% have experienced losses from non-delivery</li>
<li>80% said they are very like to consider purchasing under-delivery insurance</li>
<li>50% of non-buyers said they would be more inclined to purchase voluntary carbon credits if they could insure them against non-delivery risk</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Insurance is&nbsp;<b><i>the</i></b>&nbsp;mechanism by which all parties involved in the voluntary carbon market can collaborate in their decarbonisation projects with full accountability. By facilitating risk transfer, we believe that insurers can drive positive change while getting ahead in a market whose value could exceed $1 trillion by 2050," said George Beattie, Head of Innovation at CFC. "The introduction of our Carbon Delivery Insurance product represents a further step forward by the industry to protect buyers and galvanise quality growth in this market, empowering market participants to overcome its inherent risks."</p>
<p>In addition to launching Carbon Delivery Insurance through its traditional broker distribution channel, CFC has also partnered with&nbsp;<a href="http://email.prnewswire.com/ls/click?upn=u001.O3qpIXqnd7Pxa810jdNlsUlmZ6gn-2FBxXLKVVTqHf-2B2g-3Dcy5B_pIbxPfpDI69aAybPrpOfg1n6CWmKMnb3conIyNKCYgr-2BTRqxLAwMRExIXLpGb5DJ7ljK1jpsH8usQoqKIf3iqzuqF1CAfDZZWw-2FQyXX2MFQ044e30xhgAUYq3nj9ka-2F1KlynSFoJkra9bdFszANvOgym5yX1tAtV1l-2Fs8eJo6SAbbce76gxyDqFMDpO3E2h4AW3x7HpIBvdAtoFLaD-2BN3O1R2kYI8O19Cdn2Bkl261ZXsqbxO56QeOekPd9W-2BRtkclu8VxhyDmdMa4n1jZXMD5jcf37VI-2F8hGLqJEy9KiyA-2FUMSyZn6rJPEbgB6AZSyrY7U9rPthf8dA596OsrSFV6FUKrpBlstw6DK0Mg2XOn-2F1BUOapoVcq3Oh7vT2MraZ" target="_blank">IncubEx</a>&nbsp;&ndash; a fast-growing carbon innovation platform at the cutting edge of the voluntary carbon market. The partnership aims to develop the insurance sector's role in the market, deliver API-based distribution of CFC's carbon insurance products within trading venues such as Incubex' TVCM carbon trading platform, and facilitate introduction to specialist insurance brokers who will ultimately execute every deal.</p>
<p>Neil Eckert, Chairman at IncubEx, added: "IncubEx recognises the role that the insurance markets have to play to take the carbon markets to scale. We have been delighted to support insurers in the market, such as CFC, who demonstrate the willingness and leadership to develop new products which will either protect and scale investments in nature and biodiversity, or will support the removal of carbon to tackle climate risk. CFC has a strong track record of innovation, underwriting expertise and distribution partnerships and will be a very welcome addition to the industry's offerings to take the carbon market to scale."</p>
<p>"Following 12 months' intensive research and consultation to ensure we're delivering a product that provides the peace of mind that the voluntary carbon market is looking for, our Carbon Delivery Insurance proposition marks our first step into the multi-faceted carbon market," added Beattie. "To facilitate investment and encourage liquidity across the voluntary carbon market, we already have a number of other products in development to meet the needs of different parts of the carbon value chain."</p>

Summary: The SFC warns of suspicious "KKR Global" websites impersonating licensed corporation for virtual asset fraud, urging vigilance and verification.<br /><br /> <div>
<p>The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) today warns the public of suspicious websites operating under the name of &ldquo;KKR Global&rdquo; for impersonating a licensed corporation and suspected virtual asset-related fraud (Note 1).</p>
<p>The websites impersonate the SFC-licensed corporation, KKR Capital Markets Asia Limited, and are suspected of fraudulent activities involving virtual assets. KKR Global also claimed to be headquartered in Hong Kong (Note 2).</p>
<p>Victims said they were solicited via instant messaging apps to invest in cryptocurrency products on these websites. They subsequently experienced difficulties in withdrawing funds from the websites, and were asked to pay exorbitant &ldquo;fees&rdquo; in order to &ldquo;verify their wallets&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The websites were posted on the SFC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sfc.hk/en/alert-list/suspicious-virtual-asset-trading-platforms" target="_blank">Suspicious Virtual Asset Trading Platforms Alert List&nbsp;</a>on 19 March 2024. While the websites are now inaccessible, the public should beware of websites with similar domain names which may be continuously created.</p>
<p>The SFC urges the public to make use of the SFC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://apps.sfc.hk/publicregWeb/searchByName?locale=en" target="_blank">Public Register of Licensed Persons and Registered Institutions</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sfc.hk/en/Welcome-to-the-Fintech-Contact-Point/Virtual-assets/Virtual-asset-trading-platforms-operators/Lists-of-virtual-asset-trading-platforms" target="_blank">List of licensed virtual asset trading platforms</a>&nbsp;for up-to-date information on licensed corporations, licensed virtual asset trading platforms and their official websites.</p>
<p>The SFC once again reminds the public that online investment scams may involve any type of assets and are perpetrated through multiple channels, including social media and instant messaging apps. Investors should stay vigilant and verify the legitimacy of an investment firm or a virtual asset trading platform before making any transactions.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>The suspicious websites are (i)&nbsp;<a href="http://www.kkrbit.coin/" target="_blank">www.kkrbit.coin</a>, (ii)&nbsp;<a href="http://www.kkrbit.vip/" target="_blank">www.kkrbit.vip</a>, (iii)&nbsp;<a href="http://www.kkrbit.pro/" target="_blank">www.kkrbit.pro</a>, and (iv)&nbsp;<a href="http://www.kkrbo.com/" target="_blank">www.kkrbo.com</a>.</li>
<li>The websites set out in Note 1 are not associated with KKR Capital Markets Asia Limited, a licensed corporation in Hong Kong or its affiliates operating under the website of&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.kkr.com/" target="_blank">www.kkr.com</a>.</li>

<title>ASIC - Climate Reporting And Greenwashing: What Small Businesses Need To Know</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-climate-reporting-and-greenwashing-what-small-businesses-need-to-know/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> climate reporting, mandatory, large businesses, scope 3 emissions, greenwashing<br />
Summary:<br />
The government plans to require large businesses to report on climate-related financial risks and opportunities, including scope 3 emissions. ASIC is cracking down on greenwashing. <div>
<h2>Mandatory climate reporting</h2>
<p>The government is proposing to introduce mandatory climate-related disclosure laws for large businesses and financial institutions. These laws would require large businesses to disclose information each year about their climate-related financial risks, opportunities, plans and strategies.</p>
<p>The reporting requirements are intended to apply only to large businesses and financial institutions, and will be phased in across three groups of businesses by size over time.</p>
<p>The first two groups will capture Australia&rsquo;s largest businesses and financial institutions. The third group is expected to encompass businesses that meet at least two of the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>consolidated revenue of $50 million or more,</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>consolidated gross assets of $25 million or more, and</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>employees numbering 100 or more.</li>
</ul>
<p>The majority of Australian small and medium businesses will&nbsp;<span>not</span>&nbsp;fall within this category. This means that those businesses are not expected to have any direct reporting requirements in the immediate future. However, many small businesses form part of the supply chain of larger businesses, which means they may need to engage with climate reporting considerations over time, even if they do not have any direct climate reporting obligations.</p>
<p>This is because the 'scope 3' emissions of a large business with reporting obligations may include the emissions of its small business suppliers. Scope 3 emissions are those emissions that occur up or down a company's supply chain.</p>
<p>Under the government's proposals, reporting entities will have to disclose their scope 3 emissions provided that this information is available at the reporting date without undue cost or effort. Scope 3 emissions reporting is required from the second year of reporting, which will provide additional time for reporting entities to develop the capabilities required to measure and report on them. The government expects that, in the immediate term, most scope 3 emissions will be estimates reflecting information that is accessible at the time of the disclosure.</p>
<p>Once the new laws come into effect, ASIC will work with small business representatives to develop practical guidance for small businesses in relation to the requirements of the new laws and how the new laws may impact them.</p>
<h2>Greenwashing</h2>
<p>Greenwashing refers to claims made about a product that it is environmentally friendly, sustainable or ethical, when it is not. It is a form of misleading or deceptive conduct. Consumers and investors need to be able to rely on the claims made to them about the environmental benefits of their products, and tackling greenwashing is an enforcement priority for ASIC.</p>
<p>We have recently taken action in cases including where:</p>
<ul>
<li>Listed companies described their operations, projects or products as &lsquo;carbon neutral&rsquo;, &lsquo;clean&rsquo; or &lsquo;green&rsquo; when there appeared to be no reasonable basis for these claims.</li>
<li>Financial products or managed funds were not &lsquo;true to label&rsquo; &ndash; that is, the names of the products or funds included sustainability-related terms that were inconsistent with investments made by the fund.</li>
<li>The scope or application of an investment screen or exclusion was vague or overstated in a Product Disclosure Statement or website.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our most recent greenwashing report (<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-763-asic-s-recent-greenwashing-interventions/" title="REP 763 ASIC&rsquo;s recent greenwashing interventions">REP 763</a>) highlights why and when ASIC intervened to correct disclosures made by listed companies and managed funds. We have also issued an information sheet (<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-services/how-to-avoid-greenwashing-when-offering-or-promoting-sustainability-related-products/" title="How to avoid greenwashing when offering or promoting sustainability-related products">INFO 271</a>) to help the entities that we regulate comply with their legal obligations. We encourage small businesses to consider this guidance if they intend to make sustainability-related claims in connection with the promotion or offering of financial products or services.</p>
<p>Our continued work in this area &ndash; alongside efforts from other regulators such as the ACCC &ndash; is designed to ensure that all participants in the financial system (including small businesses) can place greater trust and confidence in sustainability-related claims. The ACCC has produced some excellent reference materials relating to the Australian Consumer Law, including this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/about-us/publications/making-environmental-claims-a-guide-for-business">guide for businesses on making environmental claims</a>.</p>

<title>Hong Kong Securities And Futures Commission: Evolving Enforcement Strategies To Combat Financial Crime, ALB Pan Asian Regulatory And Anti-Corruption Compliance Summit 2024, Mr Christopher Wilson, Executive Director, Enforcement, 19 March 2024</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good morning and thank you to Thomson Reuters and Asian Legal Business (ALB) for  inviting me to address the Pan Asian Regulatory and Anti-Corruption Compliance Summit  this year. I am grateful for this opportunity to discuss some of the strategies the Securities  and Futures Commission (SFC) has implemented to combat financial crime and misconduct.</p>
<p>Recently, it feels as if a cornucopia of tools straight from science fiction movies is conspiring  to make the most vigilant of us fall prey to increasingly sophisticated scams.  The elaborate plot of a Hollywood movie such as &ldquo;Ocean&rsquo;s Eleven&rdquo; featuring conmen trying  to scam a Vegas casino owner may take two hours to unfold, but today this would take only  15 minutes in real life using deepfake technology and a Zoom call. And that would cost much  less than a cast including George Clooney and Julia Roberts.</p>
<p>As the methods and tools available to fraudsters are continuously upgraded with each new  wave of technological disruption, we must ensure that we adapt our strategies to those new  threats.</p>

<title>SEC Chair Gary Gensler On AI Washing</title>

<div> AI, transformative technology, finance, SEC, investment advisers

Summary:
SEC warns against false claims of AI use in finance. Companies and advisers must be truthful about their AI usage to investors. <div>
<p>This video can be viewed at the below&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L_jxkZ9V6U">link</a>.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/video-transcript/sec-chair-gary-gensler-ai-washing#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>I get why so many people are talking about artificial intelligence. AI is the most transformative technology of our time, fully on par with the internet.</p>
<p>It's already being used in finance, where it has the potential benefits of greater inclusion, efficiency, and user experience.</p>
<p>But let's face it, when new technologies come along, we've also seen time and again false claims to investors by those purporting to use those new technologies.</p>
<p>Think about it. Investment advisers or broker dealers might want to tap into the excitement about AI by telling you that they're using this new technology to help you get a better return. Public company execs, they might think that they will enhance their stock price by talking about their use of AI.</p>
<p>Well, here at the SEC, we want to make sure that these folks are telling the truth. In essence, they should say what they&rsquo;re doing, and do what they&rsquo;re saying. Investment advisers or broker dealers should not mislead the public by saying they are using an AI model when they're not, nor say that they're using an AI model in a particular way, but not do so.</p>
<p>Public companies should make sure they have a reasonable basis for the claims they make and yes, the particular risks they face about their AI use, and investors should be told that basis.</p>
<p>AI washing, whether it's by financial intermediaries such as investment advisers and broker dealers, or by companies raising money from the public, that AI washing may violate the securities laws.</p>
<p>So, everyone may be talking about AI, but when it comes to investment advisers, broker dealers, and public companies, they should make sure that what they say to investors is true.</p>

<div> NYSE: ICE, technology, data, Encompass, MSP
Summary:<br />Lennar partners with ICE for streamlined servicing operations, leveraging Encompass and MSP for compliance, risk management, and data-driven decision making. ICE's end-to-end technology ecosystem supports seamless mortgage lifecycle. <div>
<p><a href="https://www.ice.com/index" rel="nofollow" shape="rect"><span>Intercontinental Exchange</span>,&nbsp;<span>Inc</span>.</a>&nbsp;(NYSE: ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today announced that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lennarmortgage.com/home" rel="nofollow" shape="rect"><span>Lennar Mortgage</span>&nbsp;</a>will move its servicing operations onto the industry-leading ICE&nbsp;<a href="https://www.icemortgagetechnology.com/products/msp-mortgage-servicing-system" rel="nofollow" shape="rect"><span>MSP<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;loan servicing system</span>&nbsp;</a>. Already a longtime user of ICE&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.icemortgagetechnology.com/products/encompass" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Encompass<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;</a>digital lending platform, Lennar will see greater efficiencies and compliance support from the seamless integration of the systems via the ICE end-to-end technology ecosystem.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lennar values the relationship we&rsquo;ve developed and strengthened with ICE over the years,&rdquo; said Laura Escobar, President of Lennar Mortgage. &ldquo;We also see the clear benefit in leveraging the deep integrations between Encompass and MSP. Our loans are serviced in-house for a brief time, which means risk management, regulatory compliance, and customer-facing capabilities need to perform from minute one. It also means we need to be able to move loans quickly and seamlessly from origination into servicing, and then on to their final destination just as easily. ICE&rsquo;s mission to digitize and streamline all aspects of the housing finance lifecycle aligns perfectly with our goal to create the world&rsquo;s simplest path to homeownership.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An interim servicer, Lennar selected MSP for its strong focus on regulatory compliance and risk management, and for MSP&rsquo;s ease and digitization of servicing transfers. By using MSP in conjunction with Encompass, Lennar will reap the benefits of a seamless, digital mortgage ecosystem; helping to lower costs, save time and engage customers across its lending and servicing channels. Lennar will also use multiple data and analytics solutions powered by ICE&rsquo;s rich mortgage dataset to further help mitigate risk and gain critical insights to support data-driven decision making.</p>
<p>In addition to Encompass and MSP, Lennar will incorporate ICE&rsquo;s consumer-facing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.icemortgagetechnology.com/products/servicing-digital" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Servicing Digital<sup>℠</sup>&nbsp;</a>, which provides borrowers with self-service capabilities and information about their loan, property and neighborhood. It also serves as a channel for mortgage holders to seek assistance in times of distress.</p>
<p>With&nbsp;<a href="https://www.icemortgagetechnology.com/products/lien-alert" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Lien Alert<sup>℠</sup>&nbsp;</a>, an efficient, cost-effective portfolio monitoring solution, Lennar will receive early notifications of critical property-related events, helping the company respond quickly to competitive pressures and proactively manage risk.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.icemortgagetechnology.com/products/mcdash" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">McDash<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;</a>, ICE&rsquo;s loan-level dataset &ndash; the deepest and broadest such repository in the industry &ndash; will give Lennar an unparalleled view of mortgage performance across the U.S. for benchmarking and strategic planning. Plus, with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.icemortgagetechnology.com/products/actionable-intelligence-platform" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Actionable Intelligence Platform<sup>℠</sup>&nbsp;</a>(AIP<sup>℠</sup>), Lennar will be able to proactively monitor and manage their operations, using data to support organizational-level decision making.</p>
<p>&ldquo;ICE is digitizing and improving every aspect of housing finance for our clients, including both long-term servicers and interim servicers like Lennar,&rdquo; said Tim Bowler, President of ICE Mortgage Technology. &ldquo;By choosing MSP to work in concert with Encompass, Lennar is unifying the typically disparate halves of the mortgage equation, and will be well positioned to originate new loans, service them, and transfer them efficiently, while supporting changing regulations and safeguarding their customers&rsquo; personal data.&rdquo;</p>

<div> Establishment, Joint Bank Reporting Committee, harmonise, integrate, data reporting<br />
Summary:<br />
ECB and EBA form a Joint Bank Reporting Committee to harmonize and integrate data reporting by banking industry, aiming for common standards. <div>
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<ul>
<li><em>ECB and EBA establish Joint Bank Reporting Committee to make data reporting by the banking industry more efficient</em></li>
<li><em>New structure will harmonise and integrate reporting of&nbsp;statistical, supervisory and resolution data with the aim of developing common definitions and standards</em></li>
<li><em>Process will involve all relevant EU bodies, as well as national authorities and banking industry representatives</em>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The&nbsp;European Central Bank (ECB) and the European Banking Authority (EBA) aim to harmonise and integrate data reporting by the banking industry with the goal of improving efficiency and reducing the associated costs. To this end, the two institutions today established the Joint Bank Reporting Committee (JBRC), which is tasked with helping to develop common definitions and standards for the data that banks are required to report for statistical, supervisory and resolution purposes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;High-quality data is essential to fulfilling our mandate&rdquo;, said ECB Executive Board member Isabel Schnabel. &ldquo;I am pleased that we will have a structure in place to simplify and facilitate data reporting by the banking industry in an integrated, efficient and standardised system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A harmonised, proportionate and fit-for-purpose reporting system is a priority for the EBA,&rdquo; said EBA Chairperson Jos&eacute; Manuel Campa. &ldquo;I am glad that today we are setting up this committee to ensure a smooth and sound governance underpinning an integrated and efficient reporting process to the benefit of all stakeholders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This initiative is an important part of the&nbsp;<a href="https://finance.ec.europa.eu/publications/strategy-supervisory-data-eu-financial-services_en">European Commission&rsquo;s supervisory data strategy</a>&nbsp;and will streamline and modernise reporting for EU banks. Supervisory authorities and the financial sector need to work together to deliver a reporting system that gives supervisors the data that they need while increasing efficiency and minimising the burden for reporting entities. This contributes also to the Commission&rsquo;s reporting rationalisation exercise,&rdquo; said Mairead McGuinness, European Commissioner for Financial Stability, Financial Services and the Capital Markets Union.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I welcome this initiative and the Single Resolution Board (SRB) fully supports it. Streamlined and harmonised approaches will also improve the sharing of information between public authorities,&rdquo; said SRB Chair Dominique Laboureix.</p>
<p>The ECB, the EBA, the European Commission and the SRB will all be part of the JBRC, as will the relevant authorities with the power to issue supervisory, resolution and statistical reporting requirements in European Economic Area Member States. The banking industry will participate through a consultative body, the Reporting Contact Group.</p>
<p>One key tangible deliverable of the JBRC will be a common data dictionary for the reporting of statistical, supervisory and resolution data by banks. In this regard, the JBRC will work on establishing common concepts and definitions used in new and existing reporting.</p>
<p>The JBRC is established through a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/ecb.mou240318~bc6b929078.en.pdf">Memorandum of Understanding</a>&nbsp;that was signed today by the ECB and the EBA. More information can be found on the<a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/ecb_statistics/co-operation_and_standards/reporting/html/index.en.html">&nbsp;ECB&rsquo;s website</a>.</p>

<div> underrepresented, stock market, investment behavior, economic welfare, risk-taking
Summary:
Women are underrepresented in the stock market and men generally have larger portfolios. Women have higher returns, men take more risk but also diversify more.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p><span>The study confirms previous results showing that women are underrepresented in the stock market. The differences arise as early as three years of age, which shows that adults more often buy stocks for boys than for girls. We also see that men generally have larger stock portfolios than women throughout life, although women increase their stock wealth later in life.</span></p>
<div class="editor-content">
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Financial saving is central to individuals' economic security and long-term goals such as buying a home and retirement. Small differences in returns can over time have a significant impact on wealth and thus on an individual's personal finances. Differences in investment behaviour therefore contribute to inequalities in economic welfare.</p>
<p>There are differences in investment behaviour in many dimensions. The purpose of this analysis is to study the stock market investments of women and men. The analysis focuses on stock investments during different periods of life, the risks individuals take, and the returns they receive. Highlighting these issues is important for Finansinspektionen's (FI) work with financial education and consumer protection.</p>
<p>The study confirms previous results showing that women are underrepresented in the stock market. The differences arise as early as three years of age, which shows that adults more often buy stocks for boys than for girls. We also see that men generally have larger stock portfolios than women throughout life, although women increase their stock wealth later in life.</p>
<p>On average, women have a 0.13 per cent higher return in their stock portfolios than men do. One explanation may be that men tend to trade more opportunistically by trying to time the market, which reduces their returns. However, among the wealthiest individuals, the same gender difference in returns is not observed.</p>
<p>Men take more market risk in their stock portfolios than women do. At the same time, men seem to be better at managing the risk they take by more often diversifying their portfolios by buying different securities. A certain amount of financial risk is not bad in itself. Rather, it is often necessary to take some risk to generate returns on capital. But too much financial risk is not good, as excessive risk can lead to large losses. One of the simplest ways to reduce unnecessary risk-taking is to diversify a stock portfolio by spreading investments across several different stocks.</p>

FINRA fined M1 Finance $850,000 for misleading social media influencer posts promoting the firm, violating rules on fair communications and supervision.
<br /><br />Summary: FINRA fined M1 Finance for misleading influencer posts, violating communication and supervision rules, and required the firm to implement a compliant supervisory system. <div>
<p>FINRA announced today that it has fined&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/2024-03/m1_awc_no_20210725811.pdf">M1 Finance LLC</a>&nbsp;$850,000 for social media posts made by influencers on the firm&rsquo;s behalf that were not fair or balanced, or contained exaggerated, unwarranted, promissory or misleading claims. This case arises from FINRA&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/guidance/targeted-examination-letters/sweep-update-feb2023">targeted exam</a>&nbsp;of firm practices related to the acquisition of customers through social media channels and represents the first formal FINRA Enforcement disciplinary action involving a firm&rsquo;s supervision of social media influencers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As investors increasingly use social media to inform their financial decisions, FINRA&rsquo;s rules on communicating with the public are especially critical. FINRA will continue to consider whether firms are using practices and maintaining supervisory systems that are reasonably designed to address the risks related to social media influencer programs,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/about/bill-st-louis">Bill St. Louis, Executive Vice President and Head of Enforcement, FINRA</a>.</p>
<p>Between January 2020 and April 2023, M1 Finance paid social media influencers to post content promoting the firm, and instructed the influencers to include a unique hyperlink to the firm&rsquo;s website that potential new customers could use to open and fund an M1 Finance brokerage account. M1 Finance also provided its influencers with graphics and a &ldquo;Welcome Guide&rdquo; that described specific services and features available through M1 Finance that influencers could highlight to make their social media posts more effective.</p>
<p>The firm paid influencers who participated in its program a flat fee for every new account that was opened and funded by the customer using a unique link provided by M1 Finance. The firm did not limit compensation influencers could earn. During this period, more than 39,400 new accounts were opened and funded with the help of approximately 1,700 influencers working on the firm&rsquo;s behalf.</p>
<p>M1 Finance influencers made social media posts promoting the firm that were not fair and balanced, in violation of FINRA Rules&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulebooks/finra-rules/2210">2210</a>&nbsp;(Communications with the Public) and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulebooks/finra-rules/2010">2010</a>&nbsp;(Standards of Commercial Honor and Principles of Trade). For example, an influencer advertising M1 Finance&rsquo;s margin lending program stated that customers could &ldquo;pay [margin loans] back at any given time . . . &nbsp;there is no set time period.&rdquo; But in fact, investors who use margin are not entitled to any extension of time to meet the firm&rsquo;s margin requirements, and the firm can, without contacting such investors, increase the maintenance margin requirement on their accounts at any time, force a sale of securities in their accounts, and choose which securities to sell, if a margin call occurs.</p>
<p>M1 Finance did not review or approve the content in its influencers&rsquo; posts prior to use or retain those communications, as required by FINRA rules. M1 Finance also failed to have a reasonable system, including written procedures, for supervising the communications that the firm&rsquo;s influencers made on its behalf. These were in violation of FINRA Rules 2210, 2010,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulebooks/finra-rules/3110">3110</a>&nbsp;(Supervision) and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulebooks/finra-rules/4511">4511</a>&nbsp;(General Requirements-Books and Records), as well as the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Exchange Act Rules.</p>
<p>In settling this matter, M1 Finance consented to the entry of FINRA&rsquo;s findings without admitting or denying the charges. The firm also agreed to certify that it has remediated the issues identified by FINRA in a letter of acceptance, waiver and consent and implemented a supervisory system, including written supervisory procedures, that is reasonably designed to achieve compliance with Rule 2210.</p>
<p>FINRA publishes disciplinary complaints, decisions and other information on its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/oversight-enforcement/finra-disciplinary-actions-online">Disciplinary Actions Online</a>&nbsp;database and publishes on its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/oversight-enforcement/disciplinary-actions">Monthly Disciplinary Actions</a>&nbsp;page a summary of disciplinary actions against firms and individuals for violations of FINRA rules; federal securities laws, rules and regulations; and the rules of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board.</p>

<div> solutions, valuation, technology, data, mortgage
Summary:
ICE introduces new valuation solutions Validate ROV and Valuation Selector to address property valuation challenges, reduce manual steps for lenders, and provide efficient and transparent valuation methods. <br /><br /> <div>
<p><i>Enterprise suite of valuation solutions applies automated technology, data and analytics to help tackle high origination costs, valuation complexity and regulatory changes</i></p>
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE: ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today announced the addition of two new solutions to its growing suite of intelligent valuation tools for the real estate markets and housing finance industries. The newest solutions, Validate ROV<sup>SM</sup>&nbsp;and Valuation Selector<sup>SM&nbsp;</sup>each address particular challenges inherent in the need for swift, accurate, objective and compliant property valuations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Transparent and accurate property valuations are essential to housing finance,&rdquo; said Tim Bowler, President of ICE Mortgage Technology. &ldquo;ICE is proud of the work we&rsquo;ve been doing on this front, leveraging our technology and data to build a set of smart solutions that help homeowners, lenders and investors have confidence in the values underlying the mortgage process.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Validate ROV offers confidence to homeowners and buyers seeking reconsideration of an appraised home value, as outlined under the proposed federal Property Appraisal and Valuation Equity (PAVE) initiative.</p>
<p>After accessing a link provided by the lender, homeowners will use their mobile device to follow a series of prompts to take photos of the property, giving examples that show why they believe the appraisal may be in error. Validate ROV uses geofencing and time stamps to confirm that photographs are contemporaneous and accurately reflect current property condition. Through intelligent automation, Validate ROV helps reduce manual steps and paperwork for lenders, while ensuring the homeowner or a potential homebuyer is able to easily provide objective evidence as to why they are seeking reconsideration.</p>
<p>Valuation Selector offers confidence to lenders and investors, helping them to instantly identify the complexity of a particular property&rsquo;s valuation, and recommending the most suitable method for determining value. Pulling from public records, assessor and listing information, Valuation Selector applies advanced logic and analytics to recommend the most appropriate and cost-effective of the following valuation types: automated valuation model (AVM), AVM with inspection, desktop exterior, desktop interior or full appraisal.</p>
<p>By helping lenders and investors identify the fastest and most cost-effective valuation method upfront, Valuation Selector can reduce the time and cost of home finance, adding efficiency and simplicity to an often fragmented and ad hoc process.</p>
<p>Validate ROV and Valuation Selector add to the growing suite of ICE property valuation solutions, which includes industry-leading AVMs, intelligent data collection tools that support GSE valuation requirements, and Risk Profiler, which combines analytics, local market data, neighborhood demographic trends, comparable property sales and key collateral metrics to help reduce risk exposure on potentially problematic valuations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mortgage industry faces numerous challenges related to the valuation process today,&rdquo; said Bowler. &ldquo;Regulators are paying close attention to valuations for many valid reasons. As part of our overall mission to digitize the housing continuum, ICE is marrying technological innovation with our vast data assets to bring transparency and accuracy to a complex, often confusing market.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eurex, Europe&rsquo;s leading derivatives exchange, is expanding its suite of sector index futures. As of today, Deutsche Boerse&rsquo;s derivatives arm launched its first futures contract based on a semiconductor index. Eurex is thus responding to the growing relevance of the semiconductor industry during recent years.</p>
<p><strong>Semiconductor industry as new investment theme &nbsp;</strong><br />Semiconductors are essential for the areas of communication, technology, and defense. In particular, developments in artificial intelligence and autonomous driving have increased interest in this sector. As a result, investors are seeking more exposure to the largest semiconductor companies, globally.</p>
<p>In collaboration with Deutsche Boerse&rsquo;s index provider ISS STOXX, Eurex has developed an index that covers the 30 largest global semiconductor companies, listed on U.S. exchanges. This includes Nvidia, one of the most popular stocks in that industry recently. The index is a USD based price return index and was recently launched. STOXX Semiconductor 30 Index Futures will be trading around the clock from 1:00 CET (8a.m. Hong Kong / Singapore) to 22:15 CET, also covering the full trading day in the U.S. and Asia. The product launch will be supported by a liquidity provider scheme, offering regular rebates and revenue-sharing elements from day one.</p>
<p><strong>Strong interest from Asian investors</strong><br />Randolf Roth, Member of the Eurex Executive Board: &ldquo;Recent global uncertainties have prompted nations to prioritize the secure production and distribution of semiconductors. Consequently, our STOXX Semiconductor 30 Index Futures are reflecting the growing appetite for semiconductors as a new investment theme. We are seeing a noticeable demand from Asia in particular, as Taiwanese companies are well represented in the index.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Axel Lomholt, General Manager at STOXX: &ldquo;The STOXX&nbsp;<sup>&nbsp;</sup>Semiconductor 30 Index represents the leading companies within a rapidly flourishing industry, all meticulously selected through a rules-based and transparent methodology. Our great collaboration with Eurex reflects a terrific opportunity to further enrich the derivatives market, particularly in combination with themes and sectors, leveraging our innovative index-based solutions.&ldquo;</p>

<title>FSB Guidance On Arrangements To Support Operational Continuity In Resolution (Revised Version 2024)</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> guidance, financial institution, critical shared services, resolution, digitalisation
Summary:<br /><br />This article discusses the importance of continuity of critical shared services in resolving failing financial institutions, especially in the digital age. <div>
<p class="post-subheading">To resolve a failing financial institution in a manner that maintains continuity of its critical functions, it is important that there is continuity of critical shared services.</p>
<p><span class="post-content">
<p><em>This guidance was originally published on 18 August 2016. A supplementary note has now been added to the original guidance.</em></p>
<p>Critical shared services, such as information technology infrastructure and software-related services, are necessary to support the continued provision of a financial institution&rsquo;s critical functions.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<em>FSB Guidance on Arrangements to Support Operational Continuity in Resolution</em>, originally published in 2016, sets out arrangements to support the continuity of those services in the event of resolution.&nbsp;The guidance assists supervisory and resolution authorities and financial institutions to evaluate whether financial institutions that are subject to resolution planning requirements have appropriate arrangements to support operational continuity if the firm enters resolution. It covers legal, contractual and governance frameworks, resourcing, management information systems and financial resources.</p>
<p>As part of the digitalisation of the financial services sector, financial institutions have increased their dependencies on third-party service providers in supporting critical shared services in recent years. This can bring multiple benefits to financial institutions, including flexibility, innovation and improved operational resilience. However, if not properly managed, disruption to critical shared services could affect the continued provision of critical functions, posing risks to orderly resolution and, in some cases, financial stability.</p>
<p>The 2016 Guidance has been issued to include a supplementary note on the digitalisation of critical shared services as an addendum. The supplementary note does not create any new guidance or requirements. Rather, it specifies, for each section of the 2016 Guidance, how authorities and firms should think about the continuity of critical shared services in resolution when those services are digital.</p>

<li>In Europe, Value stocks continued underperforming through February, extending the trend observed in January.</li>

<title>SEC Charges Two Investment Advisers With Making False And Misleading Statements About Their Use Of Artificial Intelligence</title>

<div> Charges, Investment advisors, False statements, Artificial intelligence, Settlement
Summary:
SEC charged Delphia and Global Predictions for false AI claims, ordered to pay penalties. Firms consented to cease violations. SEC warns against AI investment fraud.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced settled charges against two investment advisers, Delphia (USA) Inc. and Global Predictions Inc., for making false and misleading statements about their purported use of artificial intelligence (AI). The firms agreed to settle the SEC&rsquo;s charges and pay $400,000 in total civil penalties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We find that Delphia and Global Predictions marketed to their clients and prospective clients that they were using AI in certain ways when, in fact, they were not,&rdquo; said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve seen time and again that when new technologies come along, they can create buzz from investors as well as false claims by those purporting to use those new technologies. Investment advisers should not mislead the public by saying they are using an AI model when they are not. Such AI washing hurts investors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As more and more investors consider using AI tools in making their investment decisions or deciding to invest in companies claiming to harness its transformational power, we are committed to protecting them against those engaged in &lsquo;AI washing,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;As today&rsquo;s enforcement actions make clear to the investment industry &ndash; if you claim to use AI in your investment processes, you need to ensure that your representations are not false or misleading. And public issuers making claims about their AI adoption must also remain vigilant about similar misstatements that may be material to individuals&rsquo; investing decisions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s order against Delphia, from 2019 to 2023, the Toronto-based firm made false and misleading statements in its SEC filings, in a press release, and on its website regarding its purported use of AI and machine learning that incorporated client data in its investment process. For example, according to the order, Delphia claimed that it &ldquo;put[s] collective data to work to make our artificial intelligence smarter so it can predict which companies and trends are about to make it big and invest in them before everyone else.&rdquo; The order finds that these statements were false and misleading because Delphia did not in fact have the AI and machine learning capabilities that it claimed. The firm was also charged with violating the Marketing Rule, which, among other things, prohibits a registered investment adviser from disseminating any advertisement that includes any untrue statement of material fact.</p>
<p>In the SEC&rsquo;s order against Global Predictions, the SEC found that the San Francisco-based firm made false and misleading claims in 2023 on its website and on social media about its purported use of AI. For example, the firm falsely claimed to be the &ldquo;first regulated AI financial advisor&rdquo; and misrepresented that its platform provided &ldquo;[e]xpert AI-driven forecasts.&rdquo; Global Predictions also violated the Marketing Rule, falsely claiming that it offered tax-loss harvesting services, and included an impermissible liability hedge clause in its advisory contract, among other securities law violations.</p>
<p>Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, Delphia and Global Predictions consented to the entry of orders finding that they violated the Advisers Act and ordering them to be censured and to cease and desist from violating the charged provisions. Delphia agreed to pay a civil penalty of $225,000, and Global Predictions agreed to pay a civil penalty of $175,000.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-alerts/artificial-intelligence-fraud">Investor Alert</a>&nbsp;about artificial intelligence and investment fraud.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigations were conducted by Anne Hancock, HelenAnne Listerman, and John Mulhern under the supervision of Kimberly Frederick, Brent Wilner, Corey Schuster, and Andrew Dean with the Division of Enforcement&rsquo;s Asset Management Unit. Ragni Walker, Thomas Grignol, and Peter J. Haggerty of the Division of Examinations and Roberto Grasso of the Division&rsquo;s Office of Risk and Strategy assisted with the investigations.</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Decides On £5.95m Fine And Industry Ban For Nailesh Teraiya In Latest Cum-Ex Case</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-financial-conduct-authority-decides-on-595m-fine-and-industry-ban-for-naile/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-financial-conduct-authority-decides-on-595m-fine-and-industry-ban-for-naile/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> FCA, Nailesh Teraiya, sham trading scheme, cum-ex trading, withholding tax<br />
Summary:<br />Nailesh Teraiya fined £5.95 million, banned from regulated activity, involved in sham trading scheme, received over £5.1 million personally, breaches Principle 1. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>Nailesh Teraiya has referred his Decision Notice to the Upper Tribunal. Any findings in the Decision Notice are therefore provisional and reflect the FCA&rsquo;s belief as to what occurred and how it considers his behaviour should be characterised.</p>
<p>The Financial Conduct Authority (&lsquo;FCA&rsquo;) has decided to fine Mr Teraiya, formerly the sole controller and chief executive of Indigo Global Partners Limited (&rsquo;Indigo&rsquo;), &pound;5.95 million and ban him from carrying out any regulated activity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FCA has found that Mr Teraiya was responsible for Indigo&rsquo;s participation in a sham trading scheme which obtained &ldquo;repayment&rdquo; of &euro;91.2 million from the Danish tax authority, SKAT. In reality, this was not a repayment of tax as the claim related to shares that did not exist, no dividends had been paid and no tax had been deducted.</p>
<p>The FCA has also found that, in addition to &pound;326,000 received through Indigo, Mr Teraiya received more than &pound;5.1 million through third parties in return for his part in the scheme.&nbsp;The fine that the FCA has decided to impose seeks to deprive Mr Teraiya of the financial benefit he has received from his involvement in this scheme.</p>
<p>The claims to SKAT were made using hundreds of false and misleading documents produced by Indigo. These documents falsely certified that clients of Indigo owned large numbers of shares, that dividends had been paid on these shares and that tax had been withheld on these dividends on behalf of the Danish tax authorities. The FCA has found that Mr Teraiya knew that the documents were false and misleading and that they were used to support &ldquo;reclaims&rdquo; of tax which had never actually been paid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FCA considers that by participating in this sham trading scheme and deliberately misleading the FCA, including by concealing the extent he had personally profited from the trading, Mr Teraiya acted dishonestly and with a lack of integrity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therese Chambers, joint Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight at the FCA, said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;As Chief Executive of Indigo and an experienced industry professional, Mr Teraiya knew that these were fake trades, supported by fake documents. He acted dishonestly and personally benefitted to the tune of more than &pound;5 million for his part in this scheme. There is no place for such conduct in UK markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a clear example of the action we take against individuals who abuse their position for personal gain and damage the integrity of the UK&rsquo;s financial system.&rsquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the sixth case brought by the FCA in relation to cum-ex trading, with fines for the practice now totalling nearly &pound;22.5 million. This work has been facilitated by the extensive engagement between the FCA and global law enforcement authorities.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/decision-notices/nailesh-manubhai-teraiya-2023.pdf" title="nailesh-manubhai-teraiya-2023.pdf">Read the Decision Notice&nbsp;for Mr Teraiya</a>.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Mr Teraiya breached Principle 1 of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/APER/" target="_blank">Statements of Principle for Approved Persons</a>&nbsp;which states that &ldquo;An approved person must act with integrity in carrying out his accountable functions&rdquo;.&nbsp;Mr Teraiya&rsquo;s conduct as set out in the Decision Notice was dishonest and lacked integrity.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Indigo Global Partners Limited was formerly known as Indigo Securities Limited, and is in creditor&rsquo;s voluntary liquidation. Liquidators were appointed on 20 October 2021.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The FCA have completed a number of cum-ex cases&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-fines-sapien-capital-ltd-serious-financial-crime-control-failings-relation-cum-ex-trading" target="_blank">May 2021</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/sunrise-brokers-llp-fine-serious-financial-crime-control-failings" target="_blank">November 2021</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-fines-tjm-partnership-limited-liquidation-serious-financial-crime-control-failings" target="_blank">July 2022</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-fines-bastion-capital-london-limited-25m-serious-financial-control-failings" target="_blank">July 2023</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-fines-edf-man-capital-markets-ltd-17m-serious-failings-enabled-millions-illegitimate-reclaims" target="_blank">June 2023</a>&nbsp;involving illegitimate claims against the Danish Exchequer and other investigations are continuing.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The intention of dividend arbitrage trading (of which cum-ex is an example) is to place shares in alternative tax jurisdictions around dividend dates, with the aim of minimising withholding tax or generating withholding tax reclaims. This may involve several different trading activities including trading and lending securities and trading derivatives, including futures and total return swaps, designed to hedge movements in the price of the securities over the dividend dates.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Withholding tax (WHT) is a levy deducted at source from income and passed to the government by the entity paying it. Many securities pay periodic income in the form of dividends or interest, and local tax regulations often impose a withholding tax on such income. In certain cases where WHT is levied on payments to a foreign entity it may be reclaimed if there is a formal treaty, called a double taxation agreement (DTA), between the country in which the income is paid and the country of residence of the recipient. DTAs allow for a reduction or rebate of the applicable WHT.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The FCA publication of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/newsletters/marketwatch-52.pdf" target="_blank">Market Watch 52</a>&nbsp;highlighted various issues and concerns around dividend arbitrage in 2017. FCA contributed to the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) Final Report on Cum-Ex, Cum-Cum and WHT in 2020.&nbsp;</li>

<div> Expectations, Consumer Protection, Arrears, Debt Advice, Financial Difficulty
Summary:<br />Expectations for firms to support consumers in debt, fines for failing standards, improving lender treatment, protection from cost of living pressures, and consumer benefits from debt solution providers.<br /> <div>
<p><span>Together with Ofgem, Ofwat and Ofcom, we've set out our expectations for firms across markets, as many consumers feel the strain from cost of living pressures.</span></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve joined forces with other regulators to&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://ukrn.org.uk/cost-of-living-working-group-joint-letter-2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">call on firms to improve debt collection practices<span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>. This is especially important as many consumers continue to feel the strain from cost of living pressures and risk falling into arrears.</p>
<p>Together with Ofgem, Ofwat and Ofcom, we've set out our expectations across markets, urging firms to:</p>
<ul>
<li>make sure customers in debt do not receive excessive communication</li>
<li>use supportive language</li>
<li>clearly signpost free debt advice</li>
<li>make it easy for debt advisers to contact them on behalf of clients</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The expectations are based on the comprehensive rules and guidance already in place in financial services. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/consumer-duty" title="Consumer Duty">Consumer Duty</a>&nbsp;has set a higher standard of consumer protection, building on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/finalised-guidance/guidance-firms-fair-treatment-vulnerable-customers" title="Guidance for firms on the fair treatment of vulnerable customers">guidance for how firms should support vulnerable customers</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/cost-of-living" title="Cost of living">borrowers in financial difficulty</a>.</p>
<p>Where firms fail to meet the high standards we expect, we take robust action.</p>
<p>In 2020, we fined firms a total of &pound;90m for failures in how they treat customers in arrears, with firms paying over &pound;570m in compensation to customers.</p>
<p>We've also worked with nearly 100 lenders to improve the way they treat customers in difficulty, securing almost &pound;60m in compensation for 270,000 customers.</p>
<p>To protect consumers dealing with the cost of living squeeze, we've also:</p>
<ul>
<li>reminded 3,500 lenders how we expect them to provide&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/research/borrowers-financial-difficulty-following-coronavirus-pandemic-key-findings" title="Borrowers in financial difficulty following the coronavirus pandemic - key findings">tailored support to borrowers</a>&nbsp;who get into financial difficulty</li>

<div> listing applications, review cases, disciplinary cases, global connections, IPO settlement
<br />
The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong reviewed listing applications, implemented new listing reforms, broadened global connections, and launched initiatives for IPO settlement and paperless communications.
<br /><br />Summary: The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong reviewed listing applications and cases, broadened global connections, launched IPO settlement initiatives, and modernized communications. <div>
<p class="spanHeading"><span>The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the Exchange), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX), today (Monday) published its Listing Committee Report for 2023, which includes a review of the committee&rsquo;s work during the year and an overview of its policy agenda for 2024 and beyond.</span></p>
<p class="spanHeading">In 2023, the Listing Committee considered 73 listing applications, in addition to hearing eight review and 28 disciplinary cases. The Exchange launched a new listing route for specialist technology companies and, on 1 January 2024, implemented GEM listing reforms to provide an efficient and supportive listing environment for small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="spanHeading">During the year, the Exchange further broadened its global connections, adding the Saudi Exchange and the Indonesian Stock Exchange to the list of Recognised Stock Exchanges, increasing the attractiveness of the Exchange globally and enhancing opportunities for issuers and investors.</p>
<p class="spanHeading">The Exchange also launched FINI<span class="spanHeading">1</span>&nbsp;in November to streamline the IPO settlement operations. FINI shortens the cycle between IPO pricing and the start of trading from five business days to two business days, giving investors quicker access to new listings, reducing market risk and improving efficiency for all parties. The Exchange also expanded its paperless initiative to modernise communications between issuers, investors and the public.</p>
<p class="spanHeading">&ldquo;In 2023, we continued to focus on enhancing the Exchange&rsquo;s market competitiveness and broadening capital markets access in Hong Kong, improving the efficiency of the listing process, whilst maintaining our high standards,&rdquo; said Renu Bhatia, Chairman of the Listing Committee.</p>
<p class="spanHeading">&ldquo;We look forward, in 2024, to publishing conclusions to our treasury shares consultation, giving issuers greater flexibility to manage their capital structure in response to market conditions. We will also launch a review of our Rules for structured products and expect to publish a consultation paper on enhancements to corporate governance requirements. This is all in addition to our conclusions on the adoption of ISSB<span class="spanHeading">2</span>&nbsp;climate disclosure standards for Hong Kong." Ms Bhatia added. &ldquo;These reforms will help build on the quality and attractiveness of our markets, allowing the Exchange to capture the many opportunities ahead and strengthening Hong Kong&rsquo;s leading position as an IFC.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="spanHeading"><span>The Listing Committee, which consists of 27 independent members and the HKEX Chief Executive Officer as an ex-officio member, acts both as an independent administrative decision maker and an advisory body for the Exchange. It oversees the Listing Division, provides policy advice to the Exchange on listing matters, takes decisions of material significance for listing applicants, listed issuers and the individuals concerned, and acts as a review body.</span></p>

<div> Malaysia, Derivatives, Soybean oil, Futures, DCE
Summary:<br /><br /> Bursa Malaysia Derivatives launched FSOY contract with DCE to manage price risks and enhance global accessibility and interest. <div>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">In a significant move to expand the breadth of its commodity offerings and enhance global accessibility and interest in Malaysian derivatives market, &nbsp;Bursa Malaysia Derivatives Berhad (&ldquo;Bursa Malaysia Derivatives&rdquo; or &ldquo;the Exchange&rdquo;) today commenced trading of the Bursa Malaysia DCE Soybean Oil Futures (&ldquo;FSOY&rdquo;) contract. This follows the agreement signing between Bursa Malaysia Derivatives and Dalian Commodity Exchange (&ldquo;DCE&rdquo;) for the licensing of soybean oil futures settlement price announced in November 2023.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">The FSOY contract marks the first non-palm-based edible oil futures contract to be listed on Bursa Malaysia Derivatives, the operator of the world&rsquo;s most liquid crude palm oil futures contract. DCE, on the other hand, operates the world&rsquo;s most liquid soybean oil futures contract. The relative prices of palm and soybean oils, the two most widely consumed edible oils, are important for market players particularly food manufacturers, as the oils are frequently used interchangeably as recipe ingredients.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Datuk Muhamad Umar Swift, Chairman of Bursa Malaysia Derivatives and Chief Executive Officer of Bursa Malaysia Berhad said, &ldquo;One important aspect of fostering a more facilitative and competitive marketplace entails expanding our derivatives offerings and establishing cross-exchange collaborations. We are pleased to be the first exchange outside of China to be granted licence to incorporate DCE's commodity futures settlement prices into our product offering. In addition to our existing futures contracts, market participants can now leverage FSOY as a risk-management tool to hedge against price fluctuations in times of market volatility and evolving complexities of international markets.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">A spokesperson of Dalian Commodity Exchange said,&nbsp;&ldquo;The launch of FSOY is a pragmatic outcome of cooperation that is in line with the "Belt and Road" initiative and celebrates the 50th anniversary of China-Malaysia diplomatic relations. It enriches the tools available for global oils and fats industry chain participants to manage price risks, and strengthens the connections between the two countries' futures markets. Moving forward, DCE will continue to explore ways to enhance communication and deepen cooperation with overseas exchanges, steadily increase its level of opening-up, and serve the stable and healthy development of global commodity trade.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">As the world's largest importer of soybeans and the largest consumer of soybean oil, China has been instrumental in driving the development of the soybean oil complex within the global derivatives market. In 2023, the DCE Soybean Oil Futures Contract remains the most traded soybean oil futures contract worldwide with 204 million contracts traded.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Mohd Saleem Kader Bakas, Director of Bursa Malaysia Derivatives said, &ldquo;The introduction of the FSOY contract is timely, given the evolving dynamics of soybean oil's usage as both cooking oil and feedstock for biofuels. FSOY allows international traders to participate in soybean oil futures trading based on China&rsquo;s market fundamentals, while simultaneously providing the flexibility to trade crude palm oil futures on the same exchange. This enables traders to seize arbitrage opportunities between the two commonly substituted commodities through spread trading.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">FSOY is a United States Dollar (&ldquo;USD&rdquo;)-denominated cash-settled contract, with the Final Settlement Price calculated based on the DCE Soybean Oil Futures Contract&rsquo;s one-off delivery settlement price on DCE&rsquo;s 10th trading day of the delivery month. The price is then adjusted for conversion from Renminbi (&ldquo;CNY&rdquo;) into USD, and rounded to the nearest USD 0.25. This adjustment allows international traders and exporters of physical soybean products to China to effectively hedge their price risk using the contract.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">FSOY is available for trading during Morning and Afternoon Trading Sessions, every Monday to Friday from 9:00 am to 6:00 pm (Malaysia Time). It is also available during After-Hours (T+1) Trading Session, every Monday to Thursday from 9:00 pm to 11:30 pm (Malaysia Time).&nbsp;</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">For more information about the FSOY contract, visit&nbsp;<a href="https://bit.ly/fsoy" title="Link: https://bit.ly/fsoy">https://bit.ly/fsoy</a></p>

<title>ASIC Issues New Legislative Instrument For Exchange Traded Funds</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-issues-new-legislative-instrument-for-exchange-traded-funds/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-issues-new-legislative-instrument-for-exchange-traded-funds/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC has released a new legislative instrument&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2024L00305/asmade/text">ASIC Corporations (Relief to Facilitate Admission of Exchange Traded Funds) Instrument 2024/147</a>.</em>&nbsp;It replaces [CO 13/721]&nbsp;<em>ASIC Corporations</em>&nbsp;(<em>Relief to facilitate quotation of exchange traded funds on the AQUA Market) 13/721</em>&nbsp;([CO 13/721]) which was due to sunset on 1 April 2024.</p>
<p>The new legislative instrument extends the relief in [CO 13/721] to a broader class of quoted funds, not limited to those which track an index.</p>
<p>ASIC made the new legislative instrument after considering the submissions received, in response to&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/consultation-papers/cp-374-remaking-asic-class-order-on-exchange-traded-funds-co-13-721/" title="CP 374 Remaking ASIC class order on exchange traded funds: [CO 13/721]">Consultation Paper 374</a>&nbsp;<em>Remaking ASIC class order on exchange traded funds: [CO 13/721]&nbsp;</em>(CP 374)<em>.</em>&nbsp;Respondents to CP 374 generally supported ASIC&rsquo;s proposals.</p>
<p><a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/consultation-papers/cp-374-remaking-asic-class-order-on-exchange-traded-funds-co-13-721/#submissions" title="CP 374 Remaking ASIC class order on exchange traded funds: [CO 13/721]">View the non-confidential submissions</a>&nbsp;received in response to CP 374.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Under the&nbsp;<em>Legislation Act 2003</em>, all class orders are repealed automatically or &lsquo;sunset&rsquo; after a period unless ASIC takes action to preserve them. This ensures that legislative instruments like class orders are kept up-to-date and only remain in force while they are fit for purpose and relevant.</p>

<title>Statement Of CFTC Commissioner Caroline D. Pham On Administrative Proceedings</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/statement-of-cftc-commissioner-caroline-d-pham-on-administrative-proceedings/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/statement-of-cftc-commissioner-caroline-d-pham-on-administrative-proceedings/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Separation, Administrative, Rights, Governmental, Commission<br />
Summary:<br />The use of administrative proceedings bypasses the courts, lacking checks-and-balances. The Constitution's emphasis on private rights raises concerns about administrative agencies' authority. The Commission's authority to revoke registration. <div>
<div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item">
<p>The appropriate use of agency administrative proceedings has generated much debate.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have previously shared my views on the Commission&rsquo;s use of administrative proceedings before a hearing officer in the absence of an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) and in lieu of filing an action in federal court.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement031524?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to other uses of the Commission&rsquo;s agency adjudication authority.&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal courts serve as an essential part of the checks-and-balances inherent in the separation of powers embodied in the United States Constitution, and therefore the use of administrative proceedings that bypasses the courts merits scrutiny.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement031524?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2">[2]</a></p>
<p align="center">I.</p>
<p>As I have previously noted, the federal courts impose discipline on the tendency for administrative agencies to exercise power for self-aggrandizement.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement031524?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3">[3]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Among other things, federal courts identify violations or deficiencies by administrative agencies in the application or interpretation of the law, sufficiency of factual evidence to support the alleged charges, lack of fair notice, and abuse of discretion or process.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement031524?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4">[4]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, administrative proceedings, where the agency is the prosecutor, judge, and jury, lack the checks-and-balances imposed by separation of powers between the executive and judicial branches of government to ensure a fair hearing and due process.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have noted the simple fact that the Commission has nearly boundless discretion in exercising its prosecutorial authority in bringing enforcement actions, and is rarely challenged in imposing administrative sanctions and penalties.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement031524?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5">[5]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;It thus falls upon the Commission to uphold the highest standards of integrity, diligence, and excellence in our administrative actions to maintain the public&rsquo;s trust in the CFTC&rsquo;s ability to oversee our markets with fairness and in service to justice.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement031524?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6">[6]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is paramount that the Commission is&nbsp;an objective finder of fact and neutral arbiter of law that respects the Constitution and Constitutional rights.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement031524?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7">[7]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;I say again that there must be no bias in the administration of justice and due process.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement031524?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8">[8]</a></p>
<p align="center">II.</p>
<p>Recent Supreme Court jurisprudence has stated that &ldquo;whether any form of administrative adjudication is constitutionally permissible likely turns on the nature of the right in question.&nbsp;&nbsp;If private rights are at stake, the Constitution likely requires plenary Article III adjudication,&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement031524?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9">[9]</a>&nbsp;and, &ldquo;[t]o the extent that administrative agencies could, consistent with the Constitution, function as courts, they might only be able to do so with respect to claims involving public or quasi-private rights&rdquo; (also referred to as governmental privileges or government benefits and entitlements).<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement031524?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10">[10]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Critically, &ldquo;[p]rivate rights encompass the three &lsquo;absolute&rsquo; rights, life, liberty, and property,&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement031524?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11">[11]</a>&nbsp;and serious issues have been raised regarding the authority of administrative agencies to routinely deprive persons of property through adjudication in administrative proceedings.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement031524?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12">[12]</a></p>
<p align="center">III.</p>
<p>With respect to public rights bestowed by the government, some examples include registration and licensing to conduct certain activities pursuant to regulatory frameworks.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commodity Exchange Act establishes various categories of market participants that must be registered in order to engage in activity in the derivatives markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;These CFTC registrants must comply with extensive requirements, including character and fitness standards.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, one of the important functions that is foundational to the mission of the CFTC to promote market integrity and protect against fraud, abuse, and manipulation in our markets, is the Commission&rsquo;s authority to oversee such a registration framework, and to revoke the registration of persons convicted of certain felony charges, including for financial crimes involving fraud, through an administrative proceeding.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement031524?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13">[13]</a></p>
<p>Because CFTC registration to conduct business in our markets is a governmental privilege, I believe administrative proceedings to revoke registration are appropriate.&nbsp;&nbsp;I commend CFTC staff and the Division of Enforcement for their vigilance in protecting our markets from misconduct.</p>

<title>Statement Of CFTC Commissioner Kristin N. Johnson Regarding Proposed Consent Order Against Empires Consulting Corp.</title>

<div> Ponzi scheme, CFTC, fraud, Empires Consulting, restitution<br />
Summary: CFTC filed Proposed Consent Order against Ponzi scheme operator Empires Consulting for defrauding over 12,500 individuals of $41.6 million. Enforcing strong action against fraud targeting retail customers. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>Today, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC or Commission) announced the filing of a Proposed Consent Order to resolve claims against a Ponzi-scheme operator that fraudulently solicited more than $41.6 million from at least 12,500 individuals in the U.S. and abroad.</p>
<p>From at least September 2020 through February 2022, Defendant Empires Consulting Corp. (Empires Consulting) and co-Defendants Emerson Pires, Flavio Goncalves, and Joshua Nicholas solicited funds from customers in the U.S. and abroad through commodity interest pools under the name of &ldquo;EmpiresX.&rdquo; Pool participants understood their funds were being invested into &ldquo;futures products&rdquo; such as commodity futures and binary options, as well as stocks and other products traded on multiple markets and available 24 hours a day. In fact, Defendants deposited only $1 million of participant funds in a futures trading account at Interactive Brokers. Defendants also used participant funds to hold or trade digital asset commodities, including bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), and tether tokens (USDT).</p>
<p>Throughout the scheme, Defendants made numerous misrepresentations, including creating fake websites that mimicked real trading websites, misrepresenting their trading success on weekly update calls, and creating statements for pool participants with false account balances and investment returns. Defendants also misrepresented that their registration status with the Commission. Defendants misappropriated over 75% of the customer funds deposited with their enterprise. The misappropriated funds were used for luxury travel, fine dining, expensive car leases, and retail shopping to facilitate celebrity-like lifestyles.</p>
<p>Nicholas is currently serving a 51-month prison sentence in Florida for securities fraud committed as a part of this scheme. Pires and Goncalves are believed to be in Brazil and the Department of Justice continues to seek their extradition.</p>
<p>On June 30, 2022, the CFTC charged Empires Consulting with violations of Sections 4m(1), 4o(1)(A) and (B), and 6(c)(1) of the Commodity Exchange Act. Empires Consulting is currently controlled by a receiver appointed by a Florida state court in a putative class action regarding the same conduct.</p>
<p>Under the Proposed Consent Order announced today, Empires Consulting faces permanent trading and registration bans and must pay $32 million in restitution and an additional $32 million as a civil monetary penalty. The Consent Order also requires Empires Consulting to continue to cooperate with the CFTC in the ongoing litigation and in any related future investigation or action.</p>
<p><em>Another Example of a Ponzi Scheme</em></p>
<p>Despite the high-tech gloss, the scheme here is simply garden-variety fraud and an old-school Ponzi scheme. This case represents yet another in a recent line of similar cases.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement031524b?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt1" id="fntref1" name="fntref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;As I have previously noted,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[t]his age-old sleight of hand gained its contemporary moniker &ldquo;Ponzi scheme&rdquo; from the 1920&rsquo;s financial fraud perpetuated by Charles Ponzi.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement031524b?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt2" id="fntref2" name="fntref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;For proof of the enduring and pernicious legacy of fraudsters such as Ponzi and his predecessors, recall the revelation of Bernie Madoff&rsquo;s $50 billion Ponzi scheme.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement031524b?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt3" id="fntref3" name="fntref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;Prosecutors continue to work today&mdash;a decade after Madoff confessed that his investment advisory fund was &ldquo;all just one big lie&rdquo; &mdash;to compensate victims.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement031524b?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt4" id="fntref4" name="fntref4">[4]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The CFTC has appropriately taken a strong stance in this matter, which reflects an intent to effectively address fraud in our markets, with a laser focus on eliminating fraud schemes that target retail customers. I have repeatedly made clear that protection of customer funds is one of the CFTC&rsquo;s core missions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>creating and enforcing effective, well-tailored rules governing the custody, investment, and preservation of customer funds must be among the Commission&rsquo;s highest priorities. Without these rules and rigorous enforcement, our markets would lack the foundation of trust upon which every transaction is built.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement031524b?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt5" id="fntref5" name="fntref5">[5]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The CFTC must act preemptively to protect customer funds through appropriate regulation, and I have continuously advocated for the preservation and extension of such customer-focused regulation. When misuse of funds and fraud nevertheless occurs, as here, the CFTC must forcefully respond with enforcement action.</p>
<p>I want to expressly recognize the hard work of the Division of Enforcement staff on this case, including Ben Sedrish, Heather Dasso, Elizabeth Pendleton, Scott Williamson, and Robert Howell.</p>

<div> Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Empires Consulting Corp., restitution, civil monetary penalty, fraud<br />
Summary:<br />
Empires Consulting defrauded participants in commodity pools, unlawfully operated pools, commingled funds, ordered to pay $64 million in fines and restitution. Whistleblowers can report violations. <br /> <div>
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced the U. S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida entered a consent order today imposing a permanent injunction, restitution, and civil monetary penalty against&nbsp;Empires Consulting Corp., a Florida corporation that operated commodity pools under the name EmpiresX.</p>
<p>The order finds, among other things, Empires Consulting defrauded participants in unlawfully operated commodity pools without being registered as required and commingled participant funds. The order resolves the CFTC&rsquo;s June 30, 2022 claims against Empires Consulting. [See CFTC Press Release No.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8551-22">8551-22</a>.]</p>
<p>Under the terms of the order, Empires Consulting is required to pay</p>
<p>$32,178,397 in restitution and a civil monetary penalty in the same amount, totaling $64,356,794 in fines. The order also permanently prohibits Empires Consulting from engaging in further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC regulations, as charged.</p>
<p>Case Background</p>
<p>The order stems from the CFTC&rsquo;s June 2022 complaint charging Empires Consulting, along with its founders, Emerson Pires and Flavio Goncalves, and head trader Joshua Nicholas with a scheme to defraud EmpiresX pool participants. The complaint alleges, beginning in approximately September 2020, Empires Consulting used&nbsp;the company&rsquo;s website and videos posted on social media platforms&nbsp;to solicit individuals (pool participants) to trade commodity futures, options, and digital assets with EmpiresX. Pool participants had the alleged ability to participate either through a &ldquo;private investment&rdquo; pool account directly managed by the company&rsquo;s head trader or through a pool account purportedly traded by an automated &ldquo;EX Bot&rdquo; that traded based on the head trader&rsquo;s&nbsp;trading.</p>
<p>The order finds Empires Consulting fraudulently obtained approximately $100 million from pool participants. According to the order, Empires Consulting, through its officers and employees, knowingly made false claims to prospective pool participants regarding its registration status, the use of participant funds, the size of the pools, and participant returns. The order also finds Empires Consulting commingled and misappropriated participant funds, and in or around November 2021, stopped honoring participant withdrawal requests. The CFTC&rsquo;s litigation against the individual defendants continues.</p>
<p>Parallel Civil and Criminal Actions</p>
<p>On the same day the CFTC initiated its enforcement action, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a parallel action against Empires Consulting, Pires, Goncalves, and Nicholas for related conduct. The SEC resolved its claims against Empires Consulting in 2023. The U.S. Department of Justice also filed a parallel criminal matter against certain employees or officers of Empires Consulting on June 30, 2022. [See<ins cite="mailto:Faulk-White,%20Donna" datetime="2024-03-06T13:42"><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-enforcement-action-charging-six-individuals-cryptocurrency-fraud">&nbsp;DOJ</a></ins>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<ins cite="mailto:Faulk-White,%20Donna" datetime="2024-03-06T13:26"><a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-119">SEC</a></ins>&nbsp;press releases.]</p>
<p>The CFTC thanks the SEC and the National Futures Association for their assistance in this matter.</p>
<p>The Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this matter are Ben Sedrish, Heather Dasso, Elizabeth N. Pendleton, Scott Williamson, and Robert Howell, and former staff member Margaret Aisenbrey. &nbsp;</p>

<div> AI, financial markets, regulation, risk management, governance

Summary:<br /><br />The article discusses the promise and peril of AI in financial markets, regulatory responses, domestic and international standards, and current and future implications. <div>
<p>Good morning. It is my pleasure to welcome you to the Market Risk Advisory Committee&rsquo;s (MRAC) Future of Finance (FoF) Subcommittee meeting.</p>
<p><span>The Promise and Peril of AI</span></p>
<p>Increasingly, diverse industries and sectors of our economy identify opportunities to integrate aspects of the assemblage of technologies that we commonly describe as artificial intelligence or AI technologies. AI enables doctors to diagnose and map diseases earlier, faster, and with greater accuracy than ever before in the history of medicine.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement031524?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;Farmers who cultivate crops that feed our nation may integrate AI to better manage access to vital resources such as freshwater, enabling more efficient irrigation, fertilization, and crop rotation leading to more sustainable farming.</p>
<p>In our markets, AI offers similar efficiencies for faster trade execution and settlement, more accurate pricing prediction, and more precise risk management oversight.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement031524?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;Markets have witnessed increased adoption of AI including AI-driven investment advising, trade execution, risk management, and market surveillance.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement031524?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Notwithstanding this promise, we must account for the potential perils of integrating innovation without proper guardrails. A few years ago, a branch manager of a Japanese company in Hong Kong received a call from the director of his parent business.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement031524?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;The instructions delivered during the call indicated that, in connection with a pending acquisition, the bank employee should transfer $35 million to a designated account. Having received emails confirming the legitimacy of the transaction, and because he spoke with the director by phone often and recognized his voice, the branch manager kindly obliged, followed the instructions, and transferred the funds. The calls and emails were deep fakes that relied on, among other technologies, AI voice-cloning technology and the transfer was an Oceans-Eleven style scam.</p>
<p>As this final use case illustrates, the ability of machines or more specifically supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms to process vast quantities of data to address disease, water management, or food scarcity is only part of the story.</p>
<p>Regulators have identified notable concerns regarding the development, testing, and deployment of AI.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement031524?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;Multiple standard setting authorities note the need for increased oversight regarding &ldquo;governance, development, testing, monitoring, data quality and bias, transparency and explainability, outsourcing; and ethical concerns.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement031524?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p>As a primary concern, it is imperative to increase market and prudential regulators&rsquo; understanding of how the underlying technology operates, the integrity of the inputs that it relies upon, the potential for neutral technologies to engender biased outcomes, and legal obligations to ensure that outcomes comply with principles of fairness and transparency.</p>
<p><span>Regulatory Responses</span></p>
<p>In October 2022, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy published The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights (&ldquo;AI Bill of Rights&rdquo;) to &ldquo;support the development of policies and practices that protect civil rights and promote democratic values&rdquo; in the development of artificial intelligence systems.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement031524?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;The White House engaged in significant collaboration with the public through panel discussions, public listening sessions, requests for information, and other informal means of engagement prior to publication to help guide the drafting of the AI Bill of Rights. Though it is non-binding, the AI Bill of Rights offers guidance to the American public on how to safely and responsibly deploy AI.The AI Bill of Rights outlines five key principles to guide the use and regulation of AI. These principles involve: (1) protection from unsafe and ineffective systems; (2) avoiding algorithmic discrimination; (3) data privacy protection; (4) notice and explanation and (5) opportunities to opt out and access to humans who can consider and remedy problems.</p>
<p><strong>AI Safety Institute</strong></p>
<p>At the end of last year, the Biden Administration announced the creation of an AI Safety Institute, housed within the Commerce Department, which will be established within NIST, the National Institute of Standards and Technology.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement031524?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;NIST was founded in 1901 and is one of the nation&rsquo;s oldest physical science laboratories. Congress established NIST to &ldquo;promote U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards, and technology.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement031524?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<p>The AI Institute will &ldquo;operationalize&rdquo; NIST&rsquo;s existing AI Risk Management Framework to &ldquo;create guidelines, tools, benchmarks, and best practices for evaluating and mitigating dangerous capabilities and conducting evaluations including red-teaming to identify and mitigate AI risk.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement031524?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;These guidelines will include &ldquo;technical guidance that will be used by regulators considering rulemaking and enforcement on issues such as authenticating content created by humans, watermarking AI-generated content, identifying and mitigating against harmful algorithmic discrimination, ensuring transparency, and enabling adoption of privacy-preserving AI.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement031524?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></p>
<p>To support the AI Institute, NIST announced this month the creation of the AI Safety Institute Consortium, which will gather together hundreds of stakeholder organizations across the public and private sectors to &ldquo;develop science-based and empirically backed guidelines and standards for AI measurement and policy, laying the foundation for AI safety across the world.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement031524?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;The Consortium members will contribute work in areas such as developing guidelines for identifying and evaluating AI capabilities, with a focus on capabilities that could potentially cause harm and developing tools, methods, protocols for the testing and development of AI, among several other planned workstreams.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement031524?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></p>
<p>We are not alone in our efforts to ensure responsible innovation. International standard setting authorities and other market and prudential regulators have outlined similar principles.</p>
<p><strong>Domestic and International Standards&mdash;A Principles-Based Framework</strong></p>
<p>As early as 2017, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) issued a report on market developments related to AI and the financial stability implications. The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) have published recommendations that offer guidelines for governing AI.</p>
<p>More recently, the International Organization of Securities Commissions issued a report following a consultation on the use of AI by market intermediaries. These efforts include a number of common threads, suggesting that, while many questions remain, there are important areas of consensus regarding the right approach to AI in financial markets. A few of these commonalities include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A focus on the governance of AI models.</strong>&nbsp;FSOC &ldquo;recommends monitoring the rapid developments in AI, including generative AI, to ensure that oversight structures keep up with or stay ahead of emerging risks to the financial system while facilitating efficiency and innovation.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement031524?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>&nbsp;&ldquo;Regulators should consider requiring firms to have designated senior management responsible for the oversight of the development, testing, deployment, monitoring and controls of AI and [machine learning]. This includes a documented internal governance framework, with clear lines of accountability.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement031524?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a><br /><br />CFTC regulations, for example, introduce important governance obligations for registered market participants. Designated Clearing Organizations must establish a Risk Management Committee &ldquo;comprised of clearing members and customers of clearing members on matters that could materially affect the risk profile of the DCO&rdquo; and Risk Management Working Groups composed of market participants.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement031524?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>&nbsp;Enhanced risk management oversight and governance best practices will play an important role in managing the development and implementation of this new technology.</li>
<li><strong>Promoting the explainability of AI models.</strong>&nbsp;Many AI models are &ldquo;black-box&rdquo; models, meaning that it may be difficult&nbsp;and in some cases impossible, to explain their decision-making processes. Accordingly, FSOC, IOSCO, the FSB, and FINRA have all emphasized the importance of addressing the explainability challenge.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement031524?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a>&nbsp;As FINRA explains put it, [i]ncorporating explainability as a key consideration in the model risk management process for AI-based applications.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement031524?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a></li>
<li><strong>The need for data controls. Data quality,</strong>&nbsp;security and privacy are central concerns for regulators as market participants adopt AI models. FSOC recent report notes, &ldquo;data controls like data quality, suitability, security, privacy, and timeliness are vital to sound AI use.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement031524?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a>&nbsp;Similarly, FINRA calls for &ldquo;data governance efforts&rdquo; including: &ldquo;data review for potential bias,&rdquo; &ldquo;data source verification,&rdquo; &ldquo;data integration,&rdquo; &ldquo;data security,&rdquo; and &ldquo;data quality benchmarks and metrics.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement031524?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a></li>
<li><strong>Implementing measures to address bias.</strong>&nbsp;In 2019, I testified before Congress and voiced my concerns that AI models trained on incomplete or inaccurate data may engender biased results. The White House AI Bill of Rights appropriate emphasizes the need to ensure fairness and guard against bias. In its report, FSOC notes that &ldquo;specific requirements to prevent discrimination or bias that apply to tools, models, or processes used in consumer compliance also apply to AI. This is an important consideration because without proper design, testing, and controls, AI can lead to disparate outcomes, which may cause direct consumer harm and/or raise consumer compliance risks.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement031524?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a></li>
<li><strong>Testing and monitoring output.</strong>&nbsp;Protecting against bias, promoting explainability, and implementing governance strategies are only possible where models are properly tested and monitored. FSOC, IOSCO, the FSB, and FINRA have each emphasized the importance of testing. FSOC notes the responsibility of financial institutions to &ldquo;monitor the quality and applicability of AI&rsquo;s output&rdquo; &ndash; the ability of regulators to &ldquo;help to ensure that they do so.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement031524?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a>&nbsp;Similarly, the FSB recognizes the importance of &ldquo;[a]ssessing AI and machine learning applications for risks, including adherence to any relevant protocols regarding data privacy, conduct risks, and cybersecurity.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement031524?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a>&nbsp;Existing approaches to issues like cybersecurity offer some guidance. Last year, in a statement regarding a proposed cyber resilience rulemaking, I noted the importance of comprehensive regulation in this area, including regulations that capture mission-critical third-party service providers.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/johnsonstatement031524?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a>&nbsp;Model testing and oversight, which concerns cybersecurity, and much more, must similarly be comprehensive in the parties and the issues that it captures.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Five years ago, I began to convene and participate in convenings of AI developers, adopters, academics, government and industry researchers and regulators and public interest organizations. In 2020, a co-author and I received invitations to publish two books, one of which examines the ethical implications of AI across diverse sectors of our society. In two recent speeches, a speech last month before the New York Bar Association and a speech at Japanese Fintech Week in Tokyo, Japan, I have advocated for the CFTC to begin to identify best practices for integrating AI in our markets.</p>
<p>I have advocated for greater visibility and transparency regarding our registrants&rsquo; use of AI by expanding our annual systems examination questionnaire to incorporate questions that directly inquire about the adoption of AI and related risks.</p>
<p>I have also advocated for the development of a principles-based framework. In consultation with members of this working group of the Market Risk Advisory committee, I look forward to exploring a principles-based regulatory framework that underscores intelligibility, risk management, compliance, oversight, market responsibility, notice, and explainability.</p>
<p>I have advocated for the Commission to consider introducing heightened penalties for those who intentionally use AI technologies to engage in fraud, market manipulation, or the evasion of our regulations.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission should lead in creating an inter-agency task force focused on information sharing and composed of market and prudential regulators including the CFTC, SEC, Federal Reserve System, OCC, CFPB, FDIC, FHFA, and NCUA.</p>
<p>The task force would support the AI Safety Institute in developing guidelines, tools, benchmarks, and best practices for the use and regulation of AI in the financial services industry. The task force may provide recommendations to the AI Safety Institute as well as evaluate proposals coming out of the Institute.</p>
<p>We are fortunate to have Jessica Reiner, MRAC Member and Future of Finance Subcommittee Member and Managing Director and Head of Digital Finance at the Institute of International Finance (one of the institutions that will help advance the development and deployment of safe, trustworthy AI under the AI Safety Institute.</p>

<div> Rule proposal, examination update, financial planning, SEC meeting, rule approval
<br />
The FINRA Board of Governors met to approve a rule proposal, enhance examination processes, discuss financial planning, and meet with SEC officials.
<br /><br />Summary: The FINRA Board approved a rule proposal, received an update on examinations, discussed financial planning, met with SEC officials, and approved modifications to arbitration procedures. <div>
<p>FINRA&rsquo;s Board of Governors met on March 6-7 for the first time in 2024. The Board approved a rule proposal, received a briefing on examinations and investigations&mdash;including an update on the automation of a scheduling tool for exams as part of a multi-year initiative to enhance the exam program&mdash;and continued discussions around FINRA&rsquo;s long-term financial planning.</p>
<p>As is customary for the first meeting of the year, the Board approved the allocation of prior-year fine monies to various capital initiatives in accordance with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/finra_financial_guiding_principles_0.pdf">FINRA&rsquo;s Financial Guiding Principles</a>. FINRA will release details about the allocations in an upcoming Report on the Use of 2023 Fine Monies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Board continues to embrace initiatives to enhance the exam program at FINRA,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/about/governance/finra-board-governors/eric-noll">FINRA Board Chair Eric Noll</a>. &ldquo;The creation of efficiencies in the exam scheduling process is another indication of FINRA&rsquo;s commitment to effectively oversee the activities of member firms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The FINRA Board often meets with Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) officials and various stakeholders in conjunction with its meetings. During the March meeting, the Board met with Haoxiang Zhu, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Trading and Markets, who discussed issues related to the securities industry and capital markets.</p>
<p><strong>Rulemaking</strong></p>
<p>The Board approved the following rule proposal at the March meeting. General information about FINRA&rsquo;s rulemaking process is available&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulemaking-process">here</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Modifications to proposed amendments to the Codes of Arbitration Procedure previously approved by the Board to accelerate case processing for elderly or seriously ill parties</strong>&mdash;These modifications were in response to feedback FINRA received on a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/notices/22-09">Request for Comment on the previous proposal</a>, which would lower the age at which parties would qualify for accelerated processing. The proposal will require SEC approval before going into effect.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next FINRA Board of Governors meeting is scheduled for May 8-9, 2024. More information regarding the Board's operations, including the membership and responsibilities of its committees, is available&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/governance">here</a>.</p>

<title>ISDA Responds To EBA On Standardized Approach For Counterparty Credit Risk</title>

<div> ISDA, AFME, response, EBA, SA-CCR <br />
Summary:<br />
ISDA and AFME submitted joint response to EBA's RTS consultation. Concerned with fragmented SA-CCR regulations, propose holistic international review, extended λ shift to all asset classes aligned with US agencies. <div>
<p>On March 14, ISDA and the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME) submitted a joint response to the European Banking Authority&rsquo;s (EBA) consultation on draft regulatory technical standards (RTS) relating to specific elements of the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk (SA-CCR).</p>
<p>In the response, the associations highlight their concerns about the fragmentation of regulatory requirements relating to SA-CCR across jurisdictions and believe it is crucial to perform a holistic review of the SA-CCR framework at the international level to improve SA-CCR risk sensitivity and minimize the risk of market fragmentation.</p>
<p>The draft RTS provides options to calculate the supervisory delta of commodities. However, there are instances where negative values of the instrument or risk factors underlying an option contract can occur in other asset classes as well. The associations recommend an extension to the application of the &lambda; shift to all asset classes. Furthermore, the associations propose the use of actual front office (FO) deltas or deltas derived from FO prices, such as in the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book. They also highlight that US agencies have proposed an extension of the &lambda; shift to all asset classes, not only commodities. The associations recommend the EBA aligns with the US agencies and extends the scope to all asset classes.</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority: Convicted Money Launderer Meets Confiscation Order After Imprisonment For Failure To Pay</title>

<div> Confiscation order, money laundering, solicitor, prison sentence, non-payment of order
Summary:<br /><br />Dale Robert Walker, a former solicitor, was sentenced for money laundering and aiding unauthorised activity, leading to a confiscation order and imprisonment. Walker failed to pay but was finally imprisoned for 62 days until the remaining amount was paid by a family member. The court imposed a reduced sentence due to the amount of money already paid. 
Summary: <div>
<p>Money launderer and ex-solicitor, Dale Robert Walker (64), has fully satisfied his confiscation order after being sentenced to 62 days&rsquo; imprisonment for previously failing to pay his order. &nbsp;</p>
<p><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>We prosecuted Mr Walker in April 2015 and he was convicted of:</p>
<ul>
<li>aiding and abetting the carrying on of an unauthorised regulated activity in the UK without authorisation or exemption</li>
<li>money laundering by possessing criminal property</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>Mr Walker was sentenced to 5 and a half years&rsquo; imprisonment.</p>
<p>From 2008 to 2011, Mr Walker helped to source land and undertook conveyancing, registration and consultancy services for plots of land being sold as part of an unauthorised collective investment scheme.</p>
<p>This scheme ultimately defrauded consumers of over &pound;4.25 million; on occasions Mr Walker even received monies from investors into his solicitor&rsquo;s client account. &nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default" id="section-confiscating-money-from-criminal-activity">
<div class="container">
<h2>Confiscating money from criminal activity</h2>
<p>In February 2017, a confiscation order was made to deprive Mr Walker of over &pound;887,000 of criminal proceeds. This was later varied to &pound;716,719.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-secures-eight-confiscation-orders-totalling-almost-22-million" title="FCA secures eight confiscation orders totalling almost &pound;2.2 million">Read our press release on securing confiscation orders totalling over &pound;2.1 million from eight defendants</a></p>
<p>The judge warned Mr Walker that he could serve up to 3 and a half years in prison if he failed to pay.</p>
<p>In May 2023, Mr Walker unsuccessfully tried to argue that he had no more assets or monies to pay the amount outstanding at that time of &pound;38,750.</p>
<p>Although Mr Walker did pay some further monies by instalment, on 23 February 2024, he was sentenced to 62 days in prison by City of London Magistrates&rsquo; Court for wilful and neglectful failure to pay the remaining &pound;33,500.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On 29 February 2024, these monies were finally paid on behalf of Mr Walker by a family member.</p>
<p>Steve Smart, joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight, said: &ldquo;Confiscation proceedings are a key tool in our work to ensure those who use their professional position to take advantage of others do not succeed in their criminal efforts at self-enrichment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We welcome the court&rsquo;s decision to impose a further custodial sentence on Mr Walker sending a clear message that non-payment is a serious matter and that the courts will use all appropriate tools to enforce these orders. It&rsquo;s clear that this did finally persuade Mr Walker to find the means to pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Walker&rsquo;s sentence of 62 days reflects a reduction from the original 3 and a half years due to the amount of monies already paid.</p>

<p class="component-text">In December 2023, the Net-Zero Data Public Utility (NZDPU) launched its Proof of Concept for the development of a centralized, global, open climate data repository as recommended by the Climate Data Steering Committee. In order to understand the needs and challenges of Japanese financial institutions and issuers in this space, Japan Exchange Group, Inc. (JPX) and the NZDPU are hosting a series of roundtable discussions beginning today, March 15th, and continuing through to fall.<br /><br />Climate transition-related data is required to make accurate, informed decisions in the net zero transition - from corporate transition planning, to public policy development, to assessing the carbon footprint and associated climate risk of specific investments. Building on the important work of the many initiatives helping to drive the availability and quality of private sector climate data operating across jurisdictions around the world, the NZDPU aims to centralize and increase the transparency of climate transition-related data, make it freely accessible to all stakeholders, and help ensure better data is available to meaningfully integrate climate transition-related data into their decision making.<br /><br />JPX is encouraging its listed companies to implement sustainable practices and information disclosure, as well as constructive dialogue with investors and other stakeholders; it considers improving accessibility to climate and other sustainability-related information one of the crucial issues within this. JPX is facilitating this roundtable series as an opportunity to reflect the opinions of Japanese financial institutions and issuers into the discussion on global data platform development.<br /><br />The roundtables, also observed by the Japan Financial Services Agency, bring together financial institutions and listed companies to discuss the main issues and trends around climate-related information disclosure practices and usage in Japan.<br /><br />Given the growing importance of better disclosure of and access to climate-related information, the discussion at these roundtables will aim to contribute not just to global platform development, but also to improving the quality and quantity and the usage of this information in the Japanese market.</p>

<h3 class="subhead-title" id="heading_1"><span>About the NZDPU and Climate Data Steering Committee</span></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p class="component-text">The mission of the NZDPU is to provide a central source of company-level climate transition-related data that is transparent and openly accessible to all. The NZDPU was formed at the recommendation of the Climate Data Steering Committee (CDSC) established by French President Emmanuel Macron and United Nations Special Envoy for Climate Ambition and Solutions Michael R. Bloomberg in June 2022.<br />In addition, the Climate Data Steering Committee is conducting an open public consultation until April 1st to inform the further development of the NZDPU repository based on feedback from issuers, investors, and other stakeholders from around the globe.<br /><br />Chaired by Mary Schapiro, the CDSC brings together regulators, policymakers, and standards setters, informed by data providers and civil society organizations, to help address climate data challenges across the global economy. In 2022, it recommended the development of a unified, global, open climate data repository: the NZDPU. The NZDPU is designed to be integrated with the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change&rsquo;s Global Climate Action Portal.</p>

<title>“Treating Customers Right” – Speech By Ms Ho Hern Shin, Deputy Managing Director (Financial Supervision), Monetary Authority Of Singapore, At The LIA Annual Luncheon, On 15 March 2024</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/treating-customers-right-speech-by-ms-ho-hern-shin-deputy-managing-director/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/treating-customers-right-speech-by-ms-ho-hern-shin-deputy-managing-director/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Mr Dennis Tan, President of the LIA Singapore</span></p>
<p><span>Distinguished Guests</span></p>
<p><span>Ladies and gentlemen</span></p>
<p><span>1. Thank you for the opportunity to speak at today&rsquo;s luncheon.</span></p>
<p><span>2. First, my congratulations to the re-appointment of the LIA Management Committee. Your leadership has helped the industry navigate the many challenges it has faced. From sudden shock events like the COVID-19 pandemic, to more sustained issues such as medical cost inflation and an aging society. You have rallied the industry to tackle common problems, and to remain resilient and to grow in challenging times. MAS looks forward to continued close engagement with you.</span></p>
<p><span>3. As the industry looks to the year ahead, armed with new initiatives outlined by Dennis, I would like to shine the light on the topic of &ldquo;treating customers right&rdquo;. The value of prioritising customer interests and delivering better outcomes for customers cannot be overstated. Happy customers are repeat customers. They do more business with you and bring other customers with them. This makes good business sense, and insurers already pursue this, with varying degrees of success. To do this well, every node of the insurance value chain, needs to be engaged and involved.</span></p>
<p><span>4.&nbsp;MAS will be updating our Guidelines on Fair Dealing in the coming weeks. The revised Guidelines will have an expanded scope and will apply to all financial institutions, and cover all financial products and services offered to all their customers. It will apply in a risk proportionate manner and provide guidance on what it means to treat customers fairly at various stages of the customer journey with a financial institution. Today, I would like to flesh out what fair dealing could look like for life insurers if the Guidelines are well applied.</span></p>
<p><span><span>PRODUCT DESIGN</span></span></p>
<p><span>5. First, product design. Good product design incentivises desirable behaviours and improve risk outcomes for policyholders. An example is insurers&rsquo; wellness programmes. In AIA's Vitality Active Benefits Program, there was an 18% increase in physical activity among members following the introduction of "Active Benefits", with the most significant increase observed in individuals over the age of 50.</span></p>
<p><span><span>6.&nbsp;</span>Another example is co-payment for medical expense products, such as integrated shield plan, to encourage responsible consumption of healthcare services. This furthers national efforts in managing rising healthcare costs. From April this year, integrated shield plans will also cover expenses related to receiving public hospital-level care in the comfort of our home. This can help improve medical outcomes for some patients, whilst easing the bed crunch in hospitals. It is a win-win situation for policyholders, insurers, and the healthcare system.</span></p>
<p><span>7. Bite size insurance products with flexible payment options like SNACK by Income lowers the entry barrier for those who otherwise may not buy any insurance.</span></p>
<p><span>8. Treating customers right must include continuous product innovation that delivers features that meet customer needs and drives superior risk outcomes for customers in a cost-effective manner.</span></p>
<p><span><span>UNDERWRITING</span></span></p>
<p><span>9. Second, underwriting. Insurers must practice fair and responsible underwriting towards all customers - this is the baseline. MOS Alvin Tan spoke at length in his address to Parliament last month on how this should be applied to persons with disabilities and those with mental health conditions.</span></p>
<p><span>10. All applications must be objectively assessed, using reliable data relevant to the risks being underwritten. No application should be rejected solely based on the applicant&rsquo;s declared personal information, such as the existence of a disability or medical condition. Where an application must be rejected or accepted with conditions given the higher risk it poses, the insurer should help their customers understand the basis for the decision.</span></p>
<p><span>11. I urge insurers to live out these expectations well. I further encourage insurers to continue their work with the medical and research communities to gather relevant data, so that more customers over time can enjoy good coverage at reasonable cost.</span></p>
<p><span>12. Treating customers right must involve robust and data driven assessments of their risk during underwriting.</span></p>
<p><span><span>SALES AND ADVISORY</span></span></p>
<p><span>13<em>.&nbsp;</em>Third, on sales and advisory. Insurers can do more to offer holistic financial advice and solutions, rather than merely selling products. In Singapore, we have tools to help insurers and their representatives do this well.</span></p>
<p><span>14. For example, SGFinDex allows customers to quickly pull together a holistic picture of their finances, including insurance coverage. This speeds up the fact-find process. For one insurer, this has shortened from two days to a few minutes.</span></p>
<p><span>15<em>.&nbsp;</em>Last year, MAS, MoneySense and the CPF Board, together with LIA and other industry associations, launched the Basic Financial Planning Guide. The Guide simplifies the financial planning journey for consumers. It provides easy to understand and easy to implement rules of thumb for individuals at different life stages. For instance, setting aside 3 to 6 months&rsquo; worth of expenses in cash or near cash products as emergency funds. Or spending no more than 15% of their take home salary on insurance protection.</span></p>
<p><span>16. The Guide also includes information on relevant government schemes. For example, how baseline schemes like MediShield Life should be taken into account when considering the purchase of additional medical insurance coverage.</span></p>
<p><span>17.&nbsp;<span>Put together, SGFinDex and the Guide allow a customer and his trusted financial advisor to quickly align on gaps in the customer&rsquo;s financial plans, as well as appropriate actions to close the gaps.&nbsp;</span>This could mean paying off a loan, or setting aside emergency funds, instead of purchasing an insurance product. Granted, not all conversations translate into immediate sales. However, we believe sound advice provided by insurers and their representatives will translate into greater customer loyalty, and future sales when new needs arise.</span></p>
<p><span><span>18.&nbsp;</span><span>MAS is also proposing to reduce the information that financial advisers are required to collect for the fact find process, if they recommend term life and standard critical illness policies based on the rules of thumb in the Guide. We hope that this will&nbsp;</span>encourage the sale and purchase of such simple and cost-effective products to help Singaporeans obtain sufficient insurance.</span></p>
<p><span>19. We would like to see all insurers come alongside this effort by incorporating the rules of thumb in your sales platforms and processes; and by training your representatives to use them intentionally and effectively, including training them on relevant government schemes. MAS will continue to progressively widen the data coverage of SGFinDex, and improve the user experience, to make it as useful as can be. Any feedback on how it can be improved is most welcomed.</span></p>
<p><span>20. Treating customers right must involve nurturing representatives and building processes that consistently prioritise sound advice to customers over clinching an immediate sale.</span></p>
<p><span><span>POST-SALES</span></span></p>
<p><span>21.<span><em>&nbsp;</em></span>Fourth, post-sales, customers should continue to receive fair treatment and a seamless user experience.</span></p>
<p><span>22. Life insurers have been empowering customers through digital tools. Today, customers can conveniently pay premiums, submit claims, or view policy documents through some insurers&rsquo; web portals.</span></p>
<p><span>23. To complement this, MAS has amended our regulations to allow online nomination of beneficiaries by policyholders. Some insurers have embraced this, with web portals enhanced to allow secure online attestation and online witnessing to be conducted at the policyholders' convenience. I encourage those who have not done so, not to fall behind.</span></p>
<p><span>24. Separately, should customers raise a complaint or face any difficulty that requires assistance by the insurer, insurers should have effective channels to address customers concerns promptly and effectively.</span></p>
<p><span>25. Treating customers right must involve continued investments in efficient, effective, and empathetic after sales service and engagement channels.</span></p>
<p><span><span>CONCLUSION</span></span></p>
<p><span>26. Finally, the tone from the top is critical to drive the right culture, where treating customers fairly and well are at the heart of all that you do. Board and senior management must send a clear signal that profits do not come before values and ethics. Compensation structures must motivate not just high performance but also right conduct. Treating customers right must include an engaged board and senior management who will model what it means to treat customers right in every area of business, and who will hold staff accountable on the same.</span></p>
<p><span>27. Building trust goes beyond doing what is legally and contractually required, and it is accomplished through the accumulation of small actions over time. Some of these actions will not be seen by your customers, like how you design products and reward representatives. But they nonetheless contribute to a culture within the firm and your agency force, that if you get right, will fuel a virtuous cycle. Representatives will advise their customers responsibly, complaints will be handled empathetically, and customers will have greater confidence in being assisted with their protection needs.</span></p>
<p><span>28. As MAS&rsquo; Guidelines on Fair Dealing is finalised, I hope that life insurers will respond with commitment, resolve, and investments, to deliver superior customer outcomes using levers in every part of your business, and to keep the Singapore life insurance industry resilient, vibrant, and a trusted partner, for life.</span></p>
<p><span>29. Thank you for your kind attention. Please enjoy the rest of the luncheon.</span></p>

<div> TSOs, Core region, capacity calculation, amendments, ACER <br />
Summary: ACER approved TSOs' amendments for intraday capacity calculation, aligning with ROSC process and introducing ATC validation. Implementation by July 2024.<br /><br /> <div>
<p><span>In April 2023, the regulatory authorities of the Core capacity calculation region&nbsp;<a href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtUUlMIVlUAB0xcBAcBHVYNVwIdUwAJUhoCUwNUUQtUUw9XUgMdWFxTUlpXBVMdWwhUDh0GWgMCGlQEBVQZAgNUBVBSCQBXBwdXRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" target="_blank">referred to ACER two proposals</a>&nbsp;from the Transmission System Operators (TSOs) to amend the Core region&rsquo;s Intraday Capacity Calculation Methodology (<a href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtTBANSAgRcUEwIA1ZWHVZdVAUdUw9UVBpWBFBUUVUMAFRTA1cdWFxTUlpXBVMdWwhUDh0GWgMCGlQEBVQZAgNUBVBSCQBXBwdXRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" target="_blank">Core ID CCM</a>).</span></p>
<p><span>After extensive discussions with Core TSOs and regulatory authorities, and having&nbsp;<a href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtUUldTBQRXWkxYUFAAHVYBAQ4dCgkCAhoCAQAOAgcBUgYDAAEdWFxTUlpXBVMdWwhUDh0GWgMCGlQEBVQZAgNUBVBSCQBXBwdXRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" target="_blank">consulted with stakeholders in summer 2023</a>, ACER has decided to approve the proposals, with some amendments.</span></p>
<p><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What's new?</span></span></p>
<p><span>The TSOs have proposed two amendments with the following objectives:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Ensure the methodology aligns with the parallel Regional Operational Security Coordination (ROSC) process.</span></li>
<li><span>Temporarily introduce the Available Transfer Capacity (ATC) as an additional validation solution (on top of the flow-based validation) to check the amount of electricity that can be safely traded across borders.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>By approving these amendments, ACER will facilitate the first implementation of intraday flow-based capacity calculation in Europe. This will enhance the efficiency of the intraday electricity market in the Core region and its further alignment with the congestion management process.</span></p>
<p><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the next steps?</span></span></p>
<p><span>The first intraday flow-based capacity calculations are to be implemented by early July 2024.&nbsp;</span></p>

<div> data collection, IDR report, financial firms, compliance, ASIC

Summary:<br />
ASIC collected IDR reports from financial firms, with 87% compliance, and will use the data to drive improvements and inform regulatory decisions. <div>
<h3>KEY POINTS</h3>
<ul>
<li>ASIC data collection shows 87% of financial firms successfully submitted an internal dispute resolution (IDR) report to ASIC between 1 January and 14 March 2024.</li>
<li>ASIC will be analysing the data to inform our approach to publication and we will communicate our approach in advance of publication.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of new data reporting requirements, between 1 January and 29 February 2024, over 8,600 financial firms were due to report internal dispute resolution (IDR) data to ASIC for the first time.</p>
<p>ASIC extended the submission window to 14 March to allow firms more time to complete this, understanding it is the first time most firms are engaging with the new reporting process.</p>
<p>Around 87% of financial firms successfully submitted an IDR data report to ASIC.</p>
<p>This submission window saw the balance (third group) of financial firms, which include many smaller firms, commence reporting their IDR data to ASIC.</p>
<ul>
<li>In early 2023, the first group of 97 large financial firms, including banks and some superannuation funds, commenced reporting their IDR data to ASIC (see&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2022-releases/22-071mr-asic-releases-final-internal-dispute-resolution-data-reporting-requirements/" title="22-071MR ASIC releases final internal dispute resolution data reporting requirements"><span>22-071MR</span></a>).</li>
<li>By August 2023, a second group of around 340 financial firms commenced their IDR reports for the first time.</li>
<li>The firms in these first two groups account for many of the largest financial firms and are likely to account for well over 60% of consumer and small business complaints made (see&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2023-releases/23-117mr-asic-updates-the-implementation-timeframe-for-the-internal-dispute-resolution-data-reporting-framework/" title="23-117MR ASIC updates the implementation timeframe for the internal dispute resolution data reporting framework"><span>23-117MR</span></a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The high level of compliance with this new requirement is encouraging. Firms are reminded of the need to meet this reporting requirement twice per year. ASIC will continue to engage with firms on meeting this requirement.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The IDR data reporting framework is the culmination of many years of work with industry to record, improve and standardise the quality of dispute resolution data.</p>
<p>Collecting, and ultimately publishing, internal dispute resolution data will give greater public visibility of where consumers may be having difficulties. It provides ASIC with an important data set to assist with regulatory decision making, and will drive firms to improve IDR practices.</p>
<p>ASIC will be analysing the data to inform our approach to publication. We will communicate our approach in advance of publication.</p>
<p>Financial firms can get more information on the requirements from ASIC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-services/dispute-resolution/internal-dispute-resolution-data-reporting/" title="Internal dispute resolution data reporting"><span>IDR data reporting page</span></a>, which includes frequently asked questions.</p>
<p><span>ASIC is Australia&rsquo;s corporate, markets and financial services regulator.</span></p>

<div> whistleblower, CFTC, award, misconduct, compliance
Summary: The CFTC awarded a whistleblower $1.25 million for reporting misconduct internally and to the CFTC, fulfilling job duties, and protecting their identity. <div>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced an&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>approximately $1.25 million&nbsp;<span>award to a whistleblower who reported misconduct to the CFTC after initially reporting it to the whistleblower&rsquo;s employer.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Alt<span>hough stricter requirements for whistleblower awards apply to employees with compliance or internal audit responsibilities, th</span>is<span>&nbsp;whistleblower satisfied the CFTC&rsquo;s whistleblower rules by raising the matter internally and then waiting at least 120 days to contact the CFTC after&nbsp;</span>the employer took&nbsp;<span>no meaningful remedial action. This award is the first to apply&nbsp;</span>the CFTC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<span>120-day safe harbor provision to a whistleblower who served in an entity&rsquo;s internal compliance or audit function.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>&ldquo;Insiders have some of the most valuable evidence about illegal activity in our markets,&rdquo; said Ian McGinley, Director of the Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s award recognizes the risks they take in coming forward to the CFTC, as well as the role of their information in amplifying the CFTC&rsquo;s enforcement efforts.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><a name="_Hlk138248526"><span><span><span>&ldquo;</span></span></span></a><span><span>The whistleblower first reported internally, fulfilling job duties and putting the entity on notice of its wrongdoing<span>,&rdquo; said Director of the Whistleblower Office Brian Young. &ldquo;The CFTC&rsquo;s Whistleblower Program rewards employees with compliance and audit responsibilities who first raise violations internally and then contact the CFTC if the employer sits on its hands.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Attorney Advisor Laurence Tai in the Whistleblower Office managed this whistleblower award.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>About the CFTC&rsquo;s Whistleblower Program</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The Whistleblower Program was created under Section 748 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. Since issuing its first award in 2014, the CFTC has granted whistleblower awards amounting to approximately $365 million. Those awards are associated with enforcement actions that have resulted in monetary sanctions totaling nearly $3.2 billion. The CFTC issues awards related not only to the agency&rsquo;s enforcement actions, but also in connection with related actions brought by other domestic or foreign regulators, if certain conditions are met.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) provides confidentiality protections for whistleblowers. Regardless of whether the CFTC grants an award, the CFTC will not disclose any information that could reasonably be expected to reveal a whistleblower&rsquo;s identity, except in limited circumstances. Consistent with this confidentiality protection, the CFTC will not disclose the name of the enforcement action in which the whistleblower provided information or the exact dollar amount of the award granted.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Whistleblowers may be eligible to receive between 10 and 30 percent of the monetary sanctions collected. All whistleblower awards are paid from the CFTC&rsquo;s Customer Protection Fund, which was established by Congress, and is financed entirely through monetary sanctions paid to the CFTC by violators of the CEA. No money is taken or withheld from injured customers to fund the program.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<title>SEC Charges 17 Individuals In $300 Million Crypto-Asset Ponzi Scheme Targeting The Latino Community</title>

<div> charged, Ponzi scheme, CryptoFX, investors, SEC <br />
Summary: <br />
- SEC charges 17 individuals in $300 million CryptoFX Ponzi scheme <br />
- Scheme targeted predominantly Latino investors in U.S. and two other countries <br />
- Scheme promised 'risk free' and 'guaranteed' crypto and foreign exchange investments <br />
- Individuals used investor funds for personal gain <br />
- SEC seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement, and civil penalties against each defendant <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged 17 individuals for their roles in a $300 million Ponzi scheme that involved Houston, Texas-based CryptoFX LLC and targeted more than 40,000 predominantly Latino investors in the U.S. and two other countries. Today&rsquo;s complaint follows the SEC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr-25547">successful emergency action</a>&nbsp;in September 2022 that halted the CryptoFX scheme and charged its two main principals, Mauricio Chavez and Giorgio Benvenuto.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We allege that CryptoFX was a $300 million Ponzi scheme that targeted Latino investors with promises of financial freedom and life-altering wealth from &lsquo;risk free&rsquo; and &lsquo;guaranteed&rsquo; crypto and foreign exchange investments,&rdquo; said Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;In the end, the only thing that CryptoFX guaranteed was a trail of thousands upon thousands of victims stretching across 10 states and two foreign countries. A scheme of that size requires lots of participants, and as today&rsquo;s action demonstrates, we will pursue charges against not just the principal architects of these massive schemes, but all those who further their fraud by unlawfully soliciting victims.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After filing the initial charges in this case and obtaining emergency relief, we continued our investigation to identify additional individuals who allegedly played roles in this massive Ponzi scheme,&rdquo; said Eric Werner, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Fort Worth Regional Office. &ldquo;Our efforts bore significant fruit as the charges and allegations today demonstrate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, CryptoFX purported to trade in crypto asset and foreign exchange markets for investors but was in reality a Ponzi scheme. The SEC&rsquo;s complaint alleges that, from May 2020 to October 2022, the 17 charged individuals from Texas, California, Louisiana, Illinois, and Florida, acted as leaders of the CryptoFX network and solicited investors by variously promising that CryptoFX&rsquo;s crypto asset and foreign exchange trading would generate returns of 15 to 100 percent. The complaint alleges that CryptoFX raised $300 million from investors but did not use most of the funds for its claimed trading purposes. Instead, the defendants allegedly used investor funds to pay supposed returns to other investors, to pay commissions and bonuses to themselves and investors, and to fund their own lifestyles. The complaint further alleges that two of the defendants, spouses Gabriel and Dulce Ochoa, continued to solicit investments after the court issued orders to halt the CryptoFX scheme in September 2022, and Gabriel Ochoa instructed two investors to rescind their complaints to the SEC for them to recover their investments. Another defendant, Maria Saravia, allegedly told investors that the SEC&rsquo;s lawsuit was fake.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, charges Gabriel and Dulce Ochoa, Saravia, Gloria Castaneda, Ismael Zarco Sanchez, and Roberto Zavala with violating the antifraud, securities-registration, and broker-registration provisions of the federal securities laws. The complaint charges Gabriel Arguelles, Hector Aquino, Orlin Wilifredo Turcios Castro, Carmen De La Cruz, Elizabeth Escoto, Reyna Guiffaro, Marco Antonio Lemus, Juan Puac, Luis Serrano, Julio Taffinder, and Claudia Velazquez with violating the securities-registration and broker-registration provisions. In addition, the complaint charges Gabriel Ochoa with violating the whistleblower protection provisions. The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against each defendant.</p>
<p>Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Serrano and Taffinder consented to the entry of final judgments, subject to court approval, that permanently restrain and enjoin them from violating the securities-registration and broker-registration provisions of the federal securities laws. Serrano and Taffinder agreed to pay more than $68,000 combined in civil penalties, disgorgement, and interest.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Jillian Harris, Carol Hahn, and Jamie Haussecker of the Fort Worth Regional Office and was supervised by Jim Etri and B. David Fraser. The litigation is being conducted by Matthew Gulde and supervised by Keefe Bernstein.</p>
<p>If you are an investor in CryptoFX and/or have information related to the CryptoFX scheme and you wish to contact the SEC staff, please reach out to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:CFXvictims@sec.gov">CFXvictims@sec.gov</a>&nbsp;or contact the court-appointed receiver in the SEC&rsquo;s ongoing action against CryptoFX, Chavez, and Benvenuto, at&nbsp;<a href="https://cryptofxreceiver.com/">https://cryptofxreceiver.com</a>, (713) 546-5653, or&nbsp;<a href="mailto:receivership@shb.com">receivership@shb.com</a>. The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investor.gov/">Investor.gov</a>. Investors also can learn more about the risks of investing in unregistered offerings by reading alerts issued by the SEC&rsquo;s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy.</p>

<title>US Office Of The Comptroller Of The Currency Assesses $250 Million Civil Money Penalty Against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Related To Bank’s Trade Surveillance Program</title>

<div> penalty, JPMorgan Chase Bank, trade surveillance program, deficiencies, cease and desist order
Summary:<br />JPMorgan Chase Bank was penalized $250 million for deficiencies in its trade surveillance program. A cease and desist order was issued for corrective actions. <div>
<p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) today announced a $250 million civil money penalty against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (JPMC) related to deficiencies in its trade surveillance program.</p>
<p>The OCC found that JPMC operated with gaps in trading venue coverage and without adequate data controls required to maintain an effective trade surveillance program. Generally, trading venues are systems or electronic platforms, operated by investment firms or market operators, that bring together multiple third party buying or selling interests in financial instruments to perform a transaction. The OCC expects banks to perform trade surveillance to monitor the market conduct of its traders and clients as part of its market conduct risk control framework. The OCC found that JPMC failed to surveil billions of instances of trading activity on at least 30 global trading venues. These gaps and deficiencies in JPMC&rsquo;s trade surveillance program constitute unsafe or unsound banking practices.</p>
<p>The OCC also issued a cease and desist order requiring JPMC to take broad and comprehensive corrective actions to improve its trade surveillance program. The order requires the bank to correct the deficiencies, to seek the OCC&rsquo;s non-objection before onboarding new trading venues, and to obtain an independent third party to conduct a trade surveillance program assessment.</p>
<p>The OCC&rsquo;s enforcement actions are separate from, but coordinated with, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System which announced a related enforcement action today against JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.</p>
<p>The OCC penalty has been paid to the U.S. Department of the Treasury.</p>

<p><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced the U.S.<span>&nbsp;District Court for the&nbsp;</span>Western District of Texas entered an order of final judgment against&nbsp;<span>Jonathan Cartu</span>,&nbsp;<span>Leeav Peretz</span>,&nbsp;<span>Nati Peretz</span>, all believed to be residents of Israel, and&nbsp;<span>Blue Moon Investments Inc.</span>, a Seychelles corporation. The order finds them liable for offering illegal, off-exchange binary options and committing fraud in connection with the illegal offering. This resolves the CFTC&rsquo;s September 2, 2020 case against the defendants. [See CFTC Press Release No.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8231-20">8231-20</a>]</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The court&rsquo;s order of default judgment and permanent injunction prohibits the defendants from engaging in conduct that violates the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA); orders them to pay $51,155,645 in disgorgement, jointly and severally; and a civil monetary penalty of $153,466,935. The order also permanently bans the defendants from registering with the CFTC and from trading on any registered entity.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Case Background</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The order finds that beginning approximately September 26, 2015, the defendants offered illegal, off-exchange binary options via an internet platform they operated and maintained. The order further finds the defendants not only made material misrepresentations to customers and potential customers concerning the level of risk of binary options, but also manipulated the results of some trades to force customer losses and generate profits for themselves. The order finds through this fraudulent scheme, the defendants fraudulently obtained more than $51,155,645 from customers in the United States.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The CFTC thanks and acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Ontario Securities Commission, Australian Securities and Investments Commission, International Financial Services Commission of Belize, Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission, Federal Financial Supervisory Authority of Germany, Central Bank of Ireland, Israel Securities Authority, Malta Financial Services Authority, Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority FINMA, and the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority.</span></span></p>

Summary:<br />Financial institutions are investing heavily in digital transformation and next-gen tech, prioritizing AI and cybersecurity, with a focus on talent strategy and innovation culture.<br /> <div>
<p>As the digital revolution accelerates, financial institutions are racing to create enterprise value by investing heavily through the economic cycle, according to a new study by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.broadridge.com/" target="_blank">Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.</a>&nbsp;(NYSE: BR). The study found that 75% of executives are confident in their tech transformation roadmap, but a digital maturity gap is growing between leaders and non-leaders. While more than two-thirds say they have made meaningful progress in modernizing their core IT platforms, organizations must make progress against multiple tech and talent frontiers as they grapple with new technologies like GenAI, rising cybersecurity challenges, and accelerating needs for seamless digital customer experiences.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.broadridge.com/2024-digital-transformation-study" target="_blank">The 2024 Digital Transformation and Next-Gen Tech Study</a>&nbsp;gauges the perspectives of 500 global C-suite and senior executives across the buy side and sell side, illuminating the forces driving the industry&rsquo;s technology modernization. The study categorized firms as digital "leaders" versus "non-leaders," based on their advancement levels across ten essential aspects of digital transformation, including modernized core IT, the use of automation tools, innovation culture, data management, and digital customer experiences, among others.</p>
<p>When it comes to areas of focus, more than 80% of all executives indicate that they are making the biggest day-to-day investments in cybersecurity technology and building an advanced IT cloud platform. Meanwhile the majority also expect to maintain or increase their investment in next-gen technologies like AI, quantum computing, crypto/digital assets, and blockchain over the next two years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no surprise that we are seeing significant momentum in the adoption of next-generation technology like GenAI from financial services firms looking to solve their most pressing business challenges, while they&rsquo;re also gaining measurable value from more established technologies including AI, blockchain, cloud and core infrastructure platforms,&rdquo; said Chris Perry, President of Broadridge. &ldquo;Focusing on the human aspect of digital transformation &ndash; attracting and retaining digital talent and fostering a culture of innovation &ndash; has proven to be just as critical to ensuring these initiatives succeed. Our study also revealed that firms with a decentralized approach to innovation are more likely to be leaders in transformation.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>AI-Centric Customer Experiences Anticipated to Be the New Norm</b></p>
<p>Personalized and seamless digital customer experiences have become an expectation in the financial services industry. In fact, 40% of respondents indicate that being customer obsessed with priorities deeply rooted in client needs is the top accelerator of digital transformation.</p>
<p>Fueling many of these changes in the customer experience paradigm is AI. Seventy percent of leaders (52% overall) indicate that they are prioritizing their AI investments in customer interaction to fuel stronger and more meaningful customer engagement.&nbsp;When it comes to Generative AI, leaders are more likely to be making large or moderate investments in the technology (44%), more than twice the level of non-leaders.</p>
<p>Despite the higher levels of investment by leaders, the lower cost of entry to deploy GenAI may allow non-leaders to get in on the action more easily, enabling them to catch up in their efforts to deploy the technology to both customer-focused and internal use cases.</p>
<p><b>Focus on Talent and Culture for Innovation Initiatives to Succeed</b></p>
<p>There have been significant IT advancements year-over year, however there is still work to be done in enterprise-wide skills development. Only 28% of all executives surveyed have reached the advanced stages of implementing a digital skills and talent strategy, a year-on-year increase of 4%.</p>
<p>In addition to the technology aspects of transformation, digital leaders have not neglected the human side. Seventy-one percent of leaders have reached the advanced stages of implementing digital skills and talent strategy, compared with 12% of non-leaders. A further 85% say they have created an advanced innovation culture versus 24% of non-leaders.</p>
<p><b>Cyber Risks are Still a Top Challenge</b></p>
<p>As financial organizations accelerate digital customer experiences, they continue to put enormous effort into strengthening trust and security.</p>
<p>Over the next<b>&nbsp;</b>two years, financial institutions plan to boost their investments in cybersecurity by 28% on average; impacting their internal security protocols, but also how they engage with third-party technology vendors. According to the study, cybersecurity is the top capability executives say they expect from their technology vendors, outpacing their ability to deliver projects on time and on budget and building next-generation technologies into their solutions.</p>
<p>Executives also cited cybersecurity risks as the top challenge currently inhibiting the pace of digital transformation at their company.</p>
<p>Tech executives, who often understand the risks of an insecure environment more than other senior leaders, tend to care more about cybersecurity than business executives.</p>
<p>The full 2024 Digital Transformation and Next-Gen Tech Study can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://www.broadridge.com/2024-digital-transformation-study" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p><b>Methodology</b></p>
<p>This Broadridge survey was conducted by ThoughtLab Group to understand how financial services companies are digitally transforming and adopting next-gen technologies. C-suite executives and their direct reports from 500 financial institutions globally on the buy side and sell side were surveyed, with fielding completed in Nov 2023. The total assets or AUM of companies in the sample ranged from $1 billion to over $250 billion. The study scored firms on a range of factors related to progress with digital transformation. Firms were then categorized as digital leaders or non-leaders in the Broadridge Digital Transformation Maturity Framework.

<p>Figment&rsquo;s and Liqwid&rsquo;s new products are available in three trading currencies.

The remaining 24 products are divided into six focusing on precious metals and eighteen on equity respectively fixed income underlyings. The listing brings the number of ETP issuers to 18.</p>

<p><span>Speaker:&nbsp;</span>Nikhil Rathi, Chief Executive<br /><span>Event:&nbsp;</span>Morgan Stanley Financials Conference<br /><span>Delivered:&nbsp;</span>14 March 2024<br /><br /></p>
<h2>Key points:</h2>
<ul>
<li>We want a deeper, more open relationship with investors, analysts, and the markets as a whole &ndash; particularly now that we have more freedom to tailor our rules to our markets.&nbsp;</li>
<li>We will be pragmatic when looking at enforcement of the Consumer Duty, tackling breaches that pose the greatest risk of harm but looking favourably on firms that have made reasonable efforts to address concerns.&nbsp;</li>
<li>We are not a price regulator and we will not stand in the way of well-run businesses making profits in the face of effective competition.&nbsp;</li>
<li>In dealing with motor finance claims, we have intervened now to establish the facts and are aiming for earlier clarity than previous redress events. The more quickly and comprehensively firms cooperate with requests for data, the sooner we can conclude our work.</li>
<li>Firms and their investors need honest conversations about the balance between short-term shareholder returns and long-term investment to ensure medium-term competitiveness.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<br /> 
<hr />
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I usually open speeches with a joke or anecdote. Some of you &ndash; who have heard my jokes before &ndash; will be relieved to hear not today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have too much to get through. At the FCA, we are keen to build a deeper, more open relationship with the market and the analyst community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I am grateful to be invited here this morning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To offer reassurance where I can and encourage a fair dose of reality too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Three years ago, I set out to transform the FCA to become a more innovative, adaptive, assertive regulator.</p>
<p>To place data at the heart of everything we do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To test and use our powers to the limit.</p>
<p>To deliver a step change in our operational performance, as we have done when it comes to authorisations, including to support financial services competitiveness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To sharpen our focus on outcomes with clearer metrics so we can be held to account.</p>
<p>We are now approaching the final year of that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/corporate/our-strategy-2022-25.pdf" title="Our Strategy 2022 to 2025">strategy</a>&nbsp;&ndash; and not a week goes by when we are not vigorously held to account!</p>
<p>Compared to our peers around the globe, we have a relatively unique regulatory set up. And a broad consumer and wholesale markets mandate.</p>
<p>Successfully achieving&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/about/what-we-do/the-fca" title="About the FCA">3 primary objectives</a>&nbsp;&ndash; market integrity, consumer protection, promotion of competition &ndash; requires a constant balancing act.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And one that has become finer now that our previous mindfulness of UK growth has been formalised in a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/about/what-we-do/secondary-objective" title="Our secondary objective">secondary international competitiveness and growth objective</a>&nbsp;&ndash; which we embrace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have been asked to &ndash; and have also embraced &ndash; the regulatory opportunities of Brexit, at the same time as Parliament asked us to consider strengthening consumer protection through a duty of care, what we call the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/consumer-duty" title="Consumer Duty">Consumer Duty</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are becoming accustomed to finding that delicate balance and want to communicate this more clearly, so the market and investors are clear about our approach.</p>
<p>Today I will set out more on topics we have heard investors are interested in: the Consumer Duty, redress, prudential impacts, and digital and data infrastructure.</p>
<p>And also highlight our shift to outcomes-focused regulation. A steady move away from prescriptive rules, beloved of compliance consultants.</p>
<p>Turning first to the Consumer Duty, which requires firms to act to deliver 4 good outcomes for retail customers.</p>
<p>Are the products and services well designed for their target market; are they sold honestly, and can people understand them; do people get fair value from them; and do they receive appropriate customer service?&nbsp;</p>
<p>We believe the Duty will mean fewer detailed or reactive rules. In fact, if firms get it right, analysts will spend less time talking about provisions for redressing issues of the past. That, over time, should reduce the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) levy, which has already started to stabilise. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Many firms have approached the Duty in the right spirit, putting themselves in customers&rsquo; shoes. They have: &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>used simpler and more accessible language &nbsp;</li>
<li>been more upfront about product exclusions &nbsp;</li>
<li>reviewed fair value, with some fees being removed or restructured &nbsp;</li>
<li>ended sludge practices which inhibited customer switching&nbsp;</li>
<li>committed to notify savers at least annually about better interest rates &nbsp;</li>
<li>made significant technology investment in customer insights and service</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/consumer-duty-information-firms" title="Consumer Duty &ndash; information for firms">Closed book products</a>&nbsp;come in scope from July.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not setting out to trip firms up by going after technical breaches. We look favourably on firms taking reasonable steps to identify and proactively address concerns, even if mistakes are made. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We want to be pragmatic, so have focused on the greatest harms &ndash; cash savings markets, both in the largest banks and on platforms, insurance products such as premium finance and GAP insurance. We have telegraphed these publicly over the last 2 years, so there should be no surprises.</p>
<h2>Fair value and fair play&nbsp;</h2>
<p>A consistent theme has been that the onus is on firms to satisfy themselves about fair value. That is not a Trojan horse for price regulation. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We do not want to regulate prices, just as we don&rsquo;t want to restrain profits for well-run businesses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indeed, firms which deliver the outcomes in the Consumer Duty well should have a competitive edge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are mindful of the risk of unintended consequences. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Historically, we have only acted on price where, as with payday lending, there were manifestly unacceptable outcomes even with competition. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Nor would we want to undermine firms&rsquo; capacity to attract capital to invest. Those firms that invest judiciously serve customers better, for one thing. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And we don&rsquo;t hesitate to counter those who claim there are excess profits, when in fact there is no evidence of these, for example on cash savings or motor insurance pricing. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We base our statements on evidence, and we set this out to be scrutinised.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But we will also act if we have concerns. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Take savings. For years too much is held in cash by a customer base that exhibits a high level of inertia. &nbsp;</p>
<p>That reduces savers&rsquo; returns and limits capital for productive investment in our economy. Our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/corporate-documents/consumer-investments-strategy-2-year-update" title="Consumer Investments Strategy - 2 Year Update">2021 consumer investment strategy</a>&nbsp;explicitly sought a shift away from large cash holdings towards market investments. This approach has evolved as interest rates have risen. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Rather than reach for drastic regulatory levers, such as a target for banks&rsquo; net interest margins (NIMs) or a minimum rate of interest, we sought to understand more. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We asked firms how they were sure they were delivering value to savers and communicating effectively with them. Some, frankly, have been more effective than others. The market moved. Savers responded to greater competition, particularly in term products, and no prices were set. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Where NIMs settle in the medium-term will in large part be driven by the vibrancy of this competition. And we will want to be satisfied with explanations from firms, particularly outliers. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We have heard concerns that our actions, alongside other funding pressures, put pressure on banking business models and margins. We have always been clear that if business models need to change in response to competition and a changing market, we would not stand in the way. For example, the free if in credit banking model in the UK is a market and commercial decision, not a regulatory requirement, other than for basic bank accounts. Other countries have different, fee-based approaches.  &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>As with cash savings, we will give firms time to act before we intervene. Lack of responsiveness will lead to firmer intervention. We are taking a similar approach for investment platforms and double dipping, where a fee is charged and a proportion of interest on cash savings kept. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In insurance, we&rsquo;ve repeatedly called for premium finance products, used by around a third of motor or home insurance customers, to be more reflective of the costs and credit risk involved, not least as many of these customers are amongst the most vulnerable. Following a limited response to our concerns over Guaranteed Asset Protection (GAP) insurance when we highlighted these in September, we are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/gap-insurers-agree-suspend-sales-following-fca-concerns-over-fair-value" title="GAP insurers agree to suspend sales following FCA concerns over fair value">now taking action</a>&nbsp;as we saw low value. On average only 6% of premiums were paid out in claims and up to 70% of premiums were paid in commission throughout the distribution chain. We have identified concerns about low replacement values being paid in motor insurance claims. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of the risks of poor value stem from a lack of consumer understanding about the products, or opaque fees or sludge practices.</p>
<h2>Redress for consumers</h2>
<p>Now, having spoken about our forward-looking approach to the Consumer Duty, let me talk about our approach to redress for past actions. After all, the fines we have levied (and recently often diverted to redress) are low in comparison to the potential cost of compensating for poor historic conduct. We are not retrospective and focus on conduct that may have breached the law in force at the time. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We aim to act proactively and thoroughly understand the problem. &nbsp;</p>
<p>That is how we are approaching historical motor finance commission arrangements. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We recognise this work has generated some uncertainty in terms of how we will assess outcomes. It has also attracted speculation about whether or not consumers are owed redress and if so, what the cost would be. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>We are working hard to get to the bottom of the facts and will set out next steps by the end of September.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is worth repeating some of the history here. In 2021, after the pandemic, we&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-ban-motor-finance-discretionary-commission-models" title="FCA to ban motor finance discretionary commission models">banned discretionary commissions</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps inevitably, complaints, at first in trickle and then in something more torrential, came in. The courts have and are considering legal cases, with mixed results. And the Ombudsman is assessing complaints. &nbsp;</p>
<p>With its first decisions, we acted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/information-firms-motor-finance-complaints" title="Information for firms on motor finance complaints">intervened to pause</a>, until September, the requirement for firms to give a final response to complaints within 8 weeks about agreements with discretionary commission arrangements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are mindful not just of ensuring that consumers are treated fairly but also our objective to ensure markets function well. And in a country where&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-travel-survey-2022/national-travel-survey-2022-factsheet-accessible#car-ownership" rel="noopener" target="_blank">78% of households own a car<span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>, it is obvious that we need to maintain a functioning, accessible and competitive motor finance market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a sure case of the balancing act I mentioned earlier.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Understandably, there are different estimates from analysts and campaigners of the cost and scale of this issue. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Some, not us, have sought to draw comparisons with payment protection insurance (PPI). &nbsp;</p>
<p>In PPI, the regulator&rsquo;s work took place over many years and this and action on redress dragged on for some time. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>With motor finance, because of the impact on firms, as well as consumers, we want to clarify matters in a more condensed time frame and on a basis that is robust and fair. Critically, this will depend on firms cooperating fully and providing data comprehensively and promptly as well as potentially the speed of any court processes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are elements of these cases that expose firms&rsquo; legal obligations and whether these were met in particular situations. The court system is available to firms as well as consumers to settle these points. We do not consider it complicates the work we are doing now if firms have a legal case they wish to pursue directly either by appealing County Court judgements or seeking judicial review of FOS decisions. Whether to do so is a matter for firms to decide and, if necessary, explain their choices to their investors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While certainty is not something I can provide today, and I cannot prejudge what we might find, I can say in my view it is improbable we will find nothing to report as we look at historic motor finance sales. Some firms will be better placed than others. Equally, I do not anticipate this issue playing out as PPI did, not least because we have intervened early in the interests of market orderliness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recognise too the interest in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/correspondence/dear-ceo-letter-fca-expectations-wealth-management-stockbroking-firms.pdf" title="Dear CEO letter: FCA expectations for wealth management and stockbroking firms">our work</a>&nbsp;on the issue of charges for ongoing advice for wealth management. &nbsp;Was the service paid for actually provided? &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, we have raised this publicly for some time. We have already seen some moves by some firms to address this. We are gathering information to better understand how widespread this issue is so we can make sound decisions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>More broadly, we are developing guidance for firms on our expectations on what they should be doing to deal with identified redress issues more quickly and effectively. We intend to consult on this and better complaints reporting this year. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Where we have concerns, where there is the possibility of the need for redress, we will seek to make that public or encourage firms to do so, as soon and in as much detail as we can. As we have done, recently. We want to give firms, consumers, the wider market information, and certainty when we can. All in line with our strategy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This brings me back to the Consumer Duty. Rectifying issues is costly. It takes time. It damages reputations. It deprives firms of cash that could fund investment. That is why we see firms fully embracing the Consumer Duty as the best means of prevention, bringing redress and compensation costs down and so supporting medium-term competitiveness. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Saying that, as we can see just from the instances of redress I have described here, the UK landscape stands out in Europe due to its combination of complexity and the scale of claims management activity, in part reflecting some particular challenges we have faced. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In the US, the class action system can have similar impacts. While recent legislation has strengthened how we cooperate, the&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Financial Ombudsman Service<span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;rightly takes independent decisions based on what the Ombudsman thinks is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of a case. This threshold was set by Parliament. The FCA has no powers to overrule them in individual cases. Courts also have established precedents, including on the nature of Ombudsman powers. And time bars can be very complex to determine given the interaction between regulation, statute, and judicial precedent.</p>
<p>How the level of redress is calculated can be inherently complex. And what falls under&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.fscs.org.uk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">FSCS<span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;coverage can raise hard legal questions at the boundary. Administration costs can also be high due to volumes of complaints (and some have called for fees to be charged to claims management companies and law firms) and subject access requests. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So, looking at all this together, I can understand why some would call for a wider review of the system by policymakers to see how further clarity could be provided, whilst ensuring fairness for consumers so that when compensation is due it goes to them not intermediaries and does so promptly as well as fairness for firms too so we have a system overall that supports the risk appetite the economy needs as well as regulatory certainty.</p>
<h2>Regulatory cooperation and our role as a prudential regulator&nbsp;</h2>
<p>When the intervention or redress events that I have spoken about today occur, they can have a significant financial impact on firms. Where firms are dual regulated, we work closely with the&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/explainers/what-is-the-prudential-regulation-authority-pra" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Prudential Regulation Authority<span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;to establish a common understanding of the potential impacts in different scenarios. For example, with respect to cash savings work, we exchange data on firms&rsquo; liquidity, impacts of&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/markets/term-funding-scheme-sme/quick-reference-guide.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TFSME repayments<span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;and implications for the wider funding markets. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The PRA is responsible for the prudential regulation and supervision of systemic institutions, including banks and insurers in the UK as well as credit unions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the FCA, we take responsibility for prudential regulation and supervision for the remaining authorised population in the UK, over 40,000 firms, making us we believe the largest prudential regulator by number of firms in Europe. This includes a large number of investment and trading firms active in wholesale markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are using financial resilience data on a more systematic basis. We want to strengthen the principle of 'polluter pays'.&nbsp; So, we are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/consultation/cp23-24.pdf" title="CP23/24">consulting on new rules</a>&nbsp;for financial advisers requiring them to calculate potential redress liabilities, deduct that from regulatory capital, and if that breaches minimum requirements then an automatic asset retention applies until the issue is resolved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also recognise the appropriateness of calibrating prudential rules in a proportionate way to support appropriate risk taking, international business and wholesale trading activity and we will have this in mind as we look at reviews of our frameworks in the coming year.    &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that will build on a far-reaching reform agenda we are already leading on wholesale markets, consistent with international standards.</p>
<h2>Supporting investment and innovation&nbsp;</h2>
<p>I gave a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/speeches/future-pensions-act-today-plan-tomorrow" title="The future of pensions: act today to plan for tomorrow">speech</a>&nbsp;recently at a JP Morgan event about our work with the Government and&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Pensions Regulator<span class="ext"></span></a>&nbsp;on pensions reforms, supporting investment in productive finance in the UK.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are doing more, whether that is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/consultation-papers/cp23-31-primary-markets-effectiveness-review-feedback-detailed-proposals-listing-rules" title="CP23/31: Primary Markets Effectiveness Review: Feedback to CP23/10 and detailed proposals for listing rules reforms">reforming listings rules</a>, creating the regime for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/policy-statements/ps23-7-broadening-retail-access-long-term-asset-fund" title="PS23/7: Broadening retail access to the long-term asset fund">long-term asset funds</a>, support innovation with tokenisation or setting sustainability disclosure standards. &nbsp;</p>
<p>A fundamentally different and more ambitious approach to data and digital infrastructure here in the UK is also vital to our competitiveness agenda. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And, not just that, it is part of our consumer agenda, too. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Firms that have most been able to meet the Consumer Duty objectives had tackled legacy data and tech infrastructure and invested in cutting edge technology to understand their consumers. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We know cost:income ratios are under pressure. We do not want to stand in the way of such investments, be that automation or new approaches to tackle financial crime.</p>
<p>On AI in financial services, it is not our instinct to jump in immediately and seek to regulate in detail, given we can rely on the Consumer Duty, our market integrity framework and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/senior-managers-certification-regime" title="Senior Managers and Certification Regime">Senior Managers and Certification Regime (SMCR)</a>&nbsp;accountability regime. Over the last week, we&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/corporate-documents/report-using-synthetic-data-financial-services" title="Report: Using Synthetic Data in Financial Services">set out how we can support use of synthetic data</a>&nbsp;to tackle fraud or financial exclusion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There will also be industry-wide projects that need funding, be that a move to the faster&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.finra.org/investors/insights/understanding-settlement-cycles" rel="noopener" target="_blank">T+1 settlement<span class="ext"></span></a>, development of a fixed income&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/financial-services-the-edinburgh-reforms" rel="noopener" target="_blank">consolidated tape<span class="ext"></span></a>, an investment research hub or campaigns to support UK capital markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For firms and investors, this also means a healthy conversation about the scale of investment that is needed both at firm level and by the market as a whole to build the infrastructure we need. &nbsp;</p>
<p>That conversation needs to weigh up the choice between short term shareholder distributions and long-term investment to ensure medium-term competitiveness. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And innovation does not need just to technological. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/discussion-papers/dp23-5-advice-guidance-boundary-review-proposals-closing-advice-gap" title="DP23/5: Advice Guidance Boundary Review &ndash; proposals for closing the advice gap">Advice Guidance Boundary Review</a>&nbsp;with the Treasury is testing some ambitious proposals to reform our regulatory approach. We want to solve a vexing problem &ndash; how to ensure consumers get the advice they need when they need it at a price they can afford to pay.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I hope I have been able to give you some insight into where we are coming from on the big issues investors have on their minds. &nbsp;</p>
<p>An outcome-based approach to regulation requires a mindset shift. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As we make this shift, we aim:&nbsp;</p>
<p>To act proportionately, based on evidence. &nbsp;</p>
<p>To collect more if we need it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>To balance our objectives. &nbsp;</p>
<p>To mitigate the risk of unintended consequences. &nbsp;</p>
<p>To flag issues early, allowing those we regulate to act before we feel we must. &nbsp;</p>
<p>To do what we say we will do. &nbsp;</p>
<p>To act fast where we see significant harm and to avoid a problem becoming larger than it need be. &nbsp;</p>
<p>To allow the space for firms to invest and innovate. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And play our part in supporting a thriving, attractive and competitive financial sector here in the UK. Thank you.</p>

<div> consultation paper, ASX, CHESS replacement, implementation plan, stakeholder engagement
<br /><br />Summary: 
ASX released a public consultation paper for feedback on the proposed two-stage approach for CHESS replacement and implementation plan in 2026-2029. <div>
<p>Today ASX released a public consultation paper calling for feedback on the two-stage approach it has proposed for the delivery of CHESS replacement, as well as the proposed implementation plan for the clearing service, which is to be delivered in the first release.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CHESS is the clearing and settlement system for Australia&rsquo;s securities market, and this consultation paper follows an extensive reassessment by ASX of the solution design for a replacement of CHESS that would serve the whole market. In November 2023 ASX announced it would proceed with a product based solution design for CHESS replacement that would be delivered by global technology provider TATA Consultancy Services (TCS).</p>
<p>As part of that announcement, ASX confirmed it was proposing to implement the new platform in two main releases, with the clearing service to be delivered in a first release (Release 1) and the settlement and subregister services to follow in a second release (Release 2).</p>
<p>ASX recognises that industry support is critical to the successful delivery of CHESS replacement and the release of today&rsquo;s paper is the first of two consultations ASX will conduct to ensure it is engaging with stakeholders on key elements of CHESS replacement&rsquo;s detailed design and implementation.</p>
<p><b>ASX Group Executive Securities &amp; Payments Clive Triance </b>said: &ldquo;Our decision to proceed with the product based solution for CHESS replacement was deeply informed by extensive stakeholder engagement, and we know that this next phase will also rely on ASX gathering feedback to drive toward an industry consensus on detailed design and implementation planning.</p>
<p><b>&ldquo;</b>This consultation paper covers the high-level project plan that has been proposed, and it will also focus on the scope and approach for Release 1 including messaging specifications, testing requirements and readiness activities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In developing this consultation paper, we engaged with key stakeholders including those on the ASX</p>
<p>Business Committee and the CHESS Replacement Technical Committee. ASX has also updated the Cash Equities Clearing and Settlement Advisory Group on this consultation process and expects to discuss its proposed response with the Advisory Group. The primary audience for feedback includes CHESS users such as Approved Market Operators (AMOs), software providers and clearing and settlement participants, but any interested stakeholder is welcome to contribute.</p>
<p>ASX has previously stated that the indicative timeframe for implementation of the first release is 2026 and that the scenarios being considered for the second release estimate implementation in 2028 or 2029.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stakeholders wishing to provide feedback on the draft consultation will have until 24 April 2024 to make a submission. ASX will then take the time to assess the submissions and provide its response paper in June. The second consultation paper is expected to be released in Q3 2024.</p>

<li>reporting form instructions to assist entities in reporting FAR breaches to APRA and ASIC.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The information package also includes a consultation that is relevant to insurance and superannuation entities, comprising:</p>
<ul>
<li>a joint letter introducing the consultation package and outlining steps insurance and superannuation entities should take ahead of the FAR&rsquo;s commencement on 15 March 2025, and</li>
<li>proposed amendments to the Regulator rules and draft key functions descriptions for insurance and superannuation entities.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The consultation is seeking industry feedback on the proposed list of key functions for the insurance and superannuation industries and the supporting key functions descriptions by 19 April 2024.</p>
<p>The regulators intend to engage further with industry as part of the consultation and implementation process over coming months.</p>
<p>The documents for consultation are available on APRA's website:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.apra.gov.au/financial-accountability-regime-final-regulator-rules-and-transitional-rules">Financial Accountability Regime &ndash; Regulator rules</a>.

<div> consultation, Canadian Sustainability Standards Board, climate-related disclosure rule, Canadian securities legislation, SEC's climate-related disclosures rule
<br />
The Canadian Securities Administrators welcomes the Canadian Sustainability Standards Board's consultation on its first set of standards, which may inform revisions to proposed climate-related disclosure rule. The CSA aims to adopt only necessary provisions from the CSSB standards and seeks public comments on various matters, including scope of application and additional time and/or guidance for reporting issuers to comply with certain disclosure requirements. The CSA also plans to coordinate and harmonize regulation for the Canadian capital markets. 
Summary: <br /><br />The Canadian Securities Administrators welcome the Canadian Sustainability Standards Board's consultation considering revisions to climate-related disclosure rules and seek to coordinate and harmonize regulations for Canadian capital markets. <div>
<p><span>The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) today welcome the launch of the Canadian Sustainability Standards Board&rsquo;s (CSSB) consultation on&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.frascanada.ca/en/cssb" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Canadian Sustainability Disclosure Standards 1 and 2</a><span>.</span><br /><br /><span>&ldquo;We are pleased to see publication of the CSSB&rsquo;s consultation on its first set of standards,&rdquo; said Stan Magidson, CSA Chair and Chair and CEO of the Alberta Securities Commission. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re interested in the feedback the CSSB receives generally and specific to certain questions, as it may help inform revisions to our proposed climate-related disclosure rule. We strongly encourage interested and affected parties to share their views on the proposed CSSB standards.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span>In order to become mandatory under Canadian securities legislation, the CSSB standards must first be incorporated into a CSA rule. Once the CSSB consultation is complete and its standards are finalized, the CSA anticipates seeking comment on a revised rule setting out climate-related disclosure requirements. The CSA proposal will consider the final CSSB standards and may include modifications appropriate for the Canadian capital markets. The CSA anticipates adopting only those provisions of the sustainability standards that are necessary to support climate-related disclosures.</span><br /><br /><span>The CSA continues to monitor and assess international developments in this area, including the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)'s climate-related disclosures rule approved on March 6, 2024.</span><br /><br /><span>As noted in previous market updates, the CSA remains committed to working towards disclosure requirements that support the assessment of material climate-related risks, reduce market fragmentation, and contribute to efficient capital markets while considering the needs and capabilities of issuers of different sizes. When the CSA publishes its revised rule, it will seek public comments on a number of matters, including the scope of application and the need for additional time and/or guidance for reporting issuers to comply with certain disclosure requirements.</span><br /><br /><span>The CSA, the council of the securities regulators of Canada&rsquo;s provinces and territories, coordinates and harmonizes regulation for the Canadian capital markets.</span><br /><br /><strong>For investor inquiries, please&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/about/contact-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">contact your local securities regulator</a>.</strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced it commenced a registration action against&nbsp;<span>Ted Brent Alexander</span>&nbsp;of Jackson, Mississippi. The CFTC action is based on Alexander&rsquo;s guilty plea to conspiracy to commit wire fraud in a federal criminal case.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The CFTC previously suspended Alexander&rsquo;s registrations as a commodity trading advisor (CTA) and associated person (AP) based on the federal criminal indictment charging Alexander with six felony counts of securities and commodities fraud conspiracy and wire fraud. [See CFTC Press Release No.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8480-22"><span>8480-22</span></a><span>].</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Alexander has been registered with the CFTC as a CTA and AP since 2008.

<div> draft RTS, complaints handling, asset reference tokens, MiCAR, EBA<br />
Summary: EBA published final draft RTS for handling complaints on asset reference tokens under MiCAR, incorporating feedback and aligning with ESMA. <div>
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="body"><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published the final draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) that set out the requirements, templates and procedures for handling complaints received by issuers of asset reference tokens (ARTs). The draft RTS fulfil a mandate conferred on the EBA in the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCAR) and were developed in close cooperation with the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA).</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="body"><span>The draft RTS set out requirements related to the complaints management policy and function, the provision of information to holders of ARTs and other interested parties, templates, recordings, languages, the procedure to investigate complaints and to communicate the outcome of the investigations to complainants, and specific provisions for complaints handling involving third-party entities.</span></p>
<p class="body"><span>The draft RTS were subject to a public consultation between 12 July 2023 and 12 October 2023.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>General support was shown by respondents for the approach proposed by the EBA, which they considered to be appropriately balanced. However, some respondents expressed their preference for a more uniform approach between the EBA&rsquo;s RTS and the equivalent RTS by ESMA on complaints handling for crypto asset service providers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="body"><span>Having assessed the responses, the EBA decided to make a small number of targeted amendments with the aim to provide greater clarity and to further align with ESMA, in relation to requirements on languages, data protection and procedure for submitting an electronic complaint.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4>Legal basis and background</h4>
<p class="body"><span>The mandate for these draft RTS is set out in Article 31 (5) of MiCAR, which provides that the EBA shall develop, in&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">close cooperation with ESMA, draft RTS to further specify the requirements, templates and procedures for handling complaints. The RTS&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the&nbsp;</span><em><i><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Official Journal of the European Union</span></i></em><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">.</span></p>

<div> Keywords: IMF, Managing Director, Selection Process, Nomination, Executive Board<br />
Summary:<br />
The IMF has adopted an open, merit-based, and transparent process for selecting the next Managing Director. Nominations by April 2024.<br /> <div>
<p>The Board Coordinators of the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Mr. Afonso S. Bevilaqua and Mr. Abdullah F. BinZarah, made the following statement today:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are very pleased to announce that the Executive Board has adopted an open, merit-based, and transparent process for the selection of the next Managing Director, similar to the one used in recent rounds. The Executive Board underscores the importance it places on the successful candidate having the requisite global standing to lead the Fund, which stands at the center of the global financial system.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Individuals may be nominated by a Fund Governor or Executive Director and as with past practice, we aim to reach a decision by consensus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Board intends to complete the process by end-April 2024.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Board approved the decision as outlined below:</p>
<p>1.The successful candidate for the position of Managing Director will have a distinguished record in economic policymaking at senior levels. He or she will have an outstanding professional background, will have demonstrated the managerial and diplomatic skills needed to lead a global institution, and will be a national of any of the Fund&rsquo;s members. As chief of the Fund&rsquo;s staff and as Chair of the Executive Board, (s)he will be capable of providing strategic vision for the work of a high quality, diverse, and dedicated staff; and will be firmly committed to advancing the goals of the Fund by building consensus on key policy and institutional issues, including through close collaboration with the Executive Board, under whose direction (s)he will fulfill his or her responsibilities. (S)he will have a proven understanding of the Fund and the policy challenges facing the Fund&rsquo;s diverse global membership. (S)he will have a firm commitment to, and an appreciation of, multilateral cooperation and will have a demonstrated capacity to be objective and impartial. (S)he will also be an effective communicator.</p>
<p>2. An individual may be nominated for the position of Managing Director by a Fund Governor or an Executive Director during a nomination period which shall commence on March 14, 2024, at 12:01 a.m. Washington, D.C. time and will close on April 3, 2024, at 11:59 p.m. Washington, D.C. time. All nominations shall be communicated to the Fund Secretary, who shall obtain confirmation from each nominee of his or her willingness to be considered as a candidate. The Fund Secretary shall hold the names of the nominees in confidence until the end of the nomination period.</p>
<p>3. At the end of the nomination period, the Secretary shall disclose to the Executive Board the names of those nominees who have confirmed their desire to be candidates. If the number of candidates exceeds three, the Executive Board will keep the names of these nominees in confidence until it has drawn up a shortlist of three candidates, taking into account the above candidate profile without geographical preferences. The shortlisting process will be implemented through indications of which candidates receive the most support among Directors, taking into account the Fund&rsquo;s weighted voting system, with the objective of completing the shortlisting process within seven days following the disclosure to the Board of the candidates. Although the Executive Board may adopt a shortlist by a majority of the votes cast, the objective of the Executive Board is to adopt a shortlist by consensus. The shortlist shall be published by the Fund.</p>
<p>4. The Executive Board will meet with the shortlisted candidates (or all of the candidates if there were fewer than four) in Washington, D.C. Thereafter, the Executive Board will meet to discuss the strengths of the candidates and make a selection. Although the Executive Board may select a Managing Director by a majority of the votes cast, the objective of the Executive Board is to select the Managing Director by consensus with the objective of completing the selection process by end-April 2024.</p>

<div> publishes, monitoring, obligations, recommendations, report
Summary:
ACER's first report on RCCs' reporting obligations found gaps in task reporting. Recommendations for improvement include defining KPIs and improving clarity. Next report in 2025. 
<br /><br /> <div>
<p><span><span> </span></span></p>
<p>Today, ACER publishes its first&nbsp;<a href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtVAgEAAFcABkwOVFUCHVYPBAQdCg8FXxoCBwZTDAMBVgZQB1IdBFNVUQxSDAAdU1sMVx0GDgZTGlQABA8ZCwIAAQZSBVJRAVEDRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" target="_blank">monitoring report on the reporting obligations of the Regional Coordination Centres (RCCs)</a>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is it about?</span></p>
<p>Since 2023, ACER is monitoring the regular reporting obligations of the RCCs, as required by the&nbsp;<a href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtUUgQFAlgCAkxcBg1QHVYIBQ8dUw0BBBoFVQICVwUDVgIGUFAdBFNVUQxSDAAdU1sMVx0GDgZTGlQABA8ZCwIAAQZSBVJRAVEDRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" target="_blank">ACER Regulation</a>, and intends to annually report on the topic.</p>
<p>This first ACER report was drafted in close cooperation with National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs), with input from the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) and RCCs. It covers the reporting period of second half of 2022 (reported by RCCs during 2023).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What did ACER monitoring find?</span></p>
<ul>
<li>The majority of RCCs have reported on 7 out of 16 mandatory tasks.</li>
<li>RCCs have generally submitted comprehensive reports to ACER and NRAs on tasks that are either fully or partially implemented, detailing the implementation status and timelines for each.</li>
<li>RCCs have not reported on tasks that are under development or without an established methodology. This led to a reporting gap on 5 tasks, which are dependent on the methodologies&rsquo;&nbsp;implementation progresses as of 2022.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What does ACER recommend?</span></p>
<p>ACER identifies areas where the RCC reporting can improve in clarity. Particularly, ACER suggests to better define the:</p>
<ul>
<li>Key performance indicators used in the reports to ensure transparency and consistent monitoring.</li>
<li>Terminology used for different tasks implementation stages.</li>
<li>Monitoring process.</li>
</ul>
<p>ACER offers recommendations for future reports, suggesting RCCs to:</p>
<ul>

<hr />
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Most of us can remember our first taste of freedom, be it the wind blowing through our hair as we hurtled downhill without training wheels for the first time, or our foray onto a train to see a friend across town, with no accompanying adult in sight, or partaking in the conviviality that is Freshers&rsquo; Week.</p>
<p>I say most of us as some may not remember that last example too well.</p>
<p>But each experience paves the way to greater independence. Often a bit of pain involved too &ndash; skinning our knee as we wobbled on that first two-wheel ride; getting off at the wrong station; or nursing the consequences of a night out on campus.</p>
<p>What does this have to do with pensions?</p>
<p>A decade ago, pension freedoms allowed those over 55 greater flexibility in accessing pension savings.</p>
<p>With freedom comes responsibility, particularly given the consequences for your future.</p>
<p>We know that freedom tastes all the better with some guidance and steering along the way &ndash; whether it is to wear long trousers before your first bike ride, have a designated meeting point if we get off at the wrong train stop, or take a Berocca before Freshers&rsquo; night.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And it is all the more important to get that support with a pension so that you can maximise your financial freedom in retirement.</p>
<p>We can look to the past to see where we can learn from mistakes or how we can bolster the future. But there is much we can do in the present.</p>
<p>Surveying today&rsquo;s pensions landscape, we must ask ourselves: are we saving enough, are the returns good enough and are we getting the right support to navigate the complex decisions?</p>
<p>And are funds invested in a way that is good for the economy over the long-term?&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The pensions adequacy question&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Over the last 12 years, millions have been enrolled in workplace pensions for the first time due to auto-enrolment. &nbsp;Today,&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/workplace-pension-participation-and-savings-trends-2009-to-2021/workplace-pension-participation-and-savings-trends-of-eligible-employees-2009-to-2021" rel="noopener" target="_blank">88% of workers<span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;have a workplace pension &ndash; up from 55% in 2012. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We should recognise auto enrolment for the success it has been.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But significant gaps and inadequacies remain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Much depends on what generation you belong to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One in 5 single pensioners has&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.independentage.org/sites/default/files/2023-06/Hidden_two_million.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">no income<span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;beyond the state pension and benefits to rely on.</p>
<p>Many retiring in a decade or two did not have access to workplace pensions early in their career and were also shut out of defined benefit pensions &ndash; so may well face a shortfall.</p>
<p>And while younger generations have the advantage of auto-enrolment, many feel too stretched with high rents and student loans to prioritise retirement savings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even before we mention the higher costs of home ownership.</p>
<p>Half of first-time buyers now take out home loans with&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/news-and-insight/press-release/half-new-first-time-buyer-mortgages-have-terms-over-30-years-quarter#:~:text=Half%20of%20new%20first%2Dtime,years%20ago%20%7C%20Insights%20%7C%20UK%20Finance" rel="noopener" target="_blank">terms greater than 30 years<span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;&ndash; doubling over a decade.</p>
<p>Many will not repay their mortgage until they are close to or over 70.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This cohort is also likely to face pressures funding more of their health and social care too.</p>
<p>There are also those that aren&rsquo;t captured by auto-enrolment, such as the self-employed and lower earners.</p>
<p>There remains a&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-66751474" rel="noopener" target="_blank">gender gap<span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;&ndash; leaving women 35% poorer when it comes to their private pension pots.</p>
<p>The FCA&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/financial-lives/financial-lives-survey-2022-key-findings.pdf" title="financial-lives-survey-2022-key-findings.pdf">Financial Lives Survey</a>&nbsp;highlights that adults from black, Asian or mixed ethnicity backgrounds have lower private pension provision than white adults.</p>
<h2>The pensions adequacy question &ndash; how to make system fit for the future</h2>
<p>To work out whether we are saving enough, we must ask what will pensions be expected to pay for?</p>
<p>To have a comfortable living in retirement today with a reasonable amount of financial freedom, a single person needs around &pound;43,000 a year today, according to the&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.plsa.co.uk/Policy-and-Research/Topics/Retirement-Living-Standards" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Pension and Lifetime Savings Association<span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;(PLSA).&nbsp;</p>
<p>To survive, they would need &pound;14,000 and to have a moderate lifestyle, they would need over &pound;31,000. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This assumes home ownership and continued state pension provision. None of these projections assume having to pay for social or health care.</p>
<p>If you earn a median salary and save at a minimum rate with a full state pension, you will fall between the moderate and minimum standard.<br />&nbsp;<br />Some want us to emulate countries like Australia, where employer contributions to the Superannuation fund are 11%, increasing to 12% in 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the UK, the total minimum contribution is 8% with the employer legally obliged to pay 3%. Lower than the amount contributed on behalf of an employee in a DB scheme, but still an affordability challenge for many businesses.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.abi.org.uk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Association of British Insurers<span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;(ABI) and others have called for contributions to rise to 12%. The PLSA has similarly said that 12%, and a later retirement date, could bring savers closer to an adequate retirement income.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of us are still not saving enough or engaging early enough with our pensions&rsquo; investments. Whatever the route to improving this and this is challenging as we come through of a cost-of-living squeeze, addressing the adequacy of savings is vital.</p>
<h2>Are products (and returns) good enough?</h2>
<p>Beyond saving more, we also need to test whether current products make the most of what savings are already accumulating. Does our pensions system support the risk appetite savers - and our economy - needs?</p>
<p>As you have heard this morning, the Government is approaching this question through proposed structural reforms, with a consolidation agenda for schemes not delivering value.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The proposed pension pot for life &ndash; which the Budget confirmed was being explored - could add simplicity but would also be a profound change to the system and the role of employers.</p>
<p><a class="ext" href="https://www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk/en/document-library/new-code-of-practice/collective-defined-contribution/what-is-a-cdc-scheme" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Collective Defined Contribution<span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;schemes are increasingly talked about as a route to increasing returns. Royal Mail has gone first. Some see this as way of rebuilding pensions as an income for life. However, CDCs are also complex and both the scheme and any communication to savers must be managed carefully.</p>
<p>CDC and the pension pot for life would need a clear delivery road map stretching over a decade. And once that map has been agreed, we will need a period of stability to focus on execution.</p>
<p>Structural reforms aside, we should also challenge ourselves whether products deliver the value they should.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The concept of value underpins our recently introduced Consumer Duty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>More than&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/ideas/2023/04/19/when-to-ditch-your-default-workplace-pension-fund/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">9 out of 10 workplace pension<span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;holders leave their funds in their employer&rsquo;s default scheme, so whether these deliver value matters enormously to outcomes. Under the Consumer Duty, industry can help by making good products the default, even if someone is not engaged.</p>
<p>Our proposed&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/value-for-money-a-framework-on-metrics-standards-and-disclosures/value-for-money-a-framework-on-metrics-standards-and-disclosures" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Value for Money framework<span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>, as the Chancellor has said, will refocus scrutiny away from a simple view on short-term fees.</p>
<p>The consultation proposals will require operators to be transparent about their investment returns, costs, and other metrics, allowing scrutiny as to whether value is genuinely achieved over the long term.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The aim is to protect consumers from having their pension savings eroded by languishing in underperforming schemes.</p>
<p>The framework and focus on overall value encourage consideration of a broader range of asset classes, hopefully leading to diversification and better long-term risk-adjusted returns.</p>
<h2>Future of productive finance and capital markets&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Driving a long-term focus on Value for Money could encourage more investment in productive assets, supporting economic growth.</p>
<p>This has particular relevance as pensions are reaching a crossover point: Latest data shows there were&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk/en/document-library/research-and-analysis/occupational-defined-benefit-landscape-in-the-uk-2023#bb893cc78a104a31800cab4e2ff7d66a" rel="noopener" target="_blank">&pound;1.4tn<span class="ext"></span></a>&nbsp;in assets in private DB at the end of last year &ndash; excluding assets in schemes winding up and the local government pension scheme.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t yet have all the 2023 data for the DC market, but assets in workplace and non-workplace DC were around &pound;1.4tn in 2022. The shift from DB to DC will accelerate as assets in DC continue to grow rapidly</p>
<p>Both DB and DC pots are significant pools of capital.</p>
<p>But as the Chancellor set&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-backs-british-business-with-pension-fund-reforms" rel="noopener" target="_blank">out last week<span class="ext"></span></a>, just 5% or less of UK pension assets are invested in the UK economy &ndash; far less than in other countries.&nbsp;<br />Defined benefit money is flowing to insurers in buyouts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will work with the&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/prudential-regulation" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PRA<span class="ext"></span></a>&nbsp;(Prudential Regulation Authority) and&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Pensions Regulator<span class="ext"></span></a>&nbsp;to manage potential risks and support the development of a more positive ecosystem for UK investment.</p>
<p>It is not for us as regulators to direct how schemes invest, but we want to remove inappropriate barriers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Industry also needs to tackle questions about cost, scale, cultural barriers and risk appetite, and how different players in the market work together.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last year, we published&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/policy-statements/ps23-7-broadening-retail-access-long-term-asset-fund" title="PS23/7: Broadening retail access to the long-term asset fund">rules</a>&nbsp;which broadened retail and pensions access to the Long Term Asset Fund (LTAF), and three umbrella funds alongside 5 sub-funds, have now been authorised, with a strong pipeline, and more expected shortly. The target assets under management after 3 years for LTAFs authorised to date is nearly &pound;6 billion.</p>
<p>It is also important that those that give advice to schemes, trustees and employers &ndash; typically consultants not currently regulated for that service, and we have recommended they should be &ndash; are set up and incentivised to provide recommendations focused on long term value.</p>
<h2>Advice Guidance Boundary Review</h2>
<p>However well pension schemes are invested, when retirement approaches, consumers have to choose how to turn their savings into income.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Almost a decade after pension freedoms, those decisions become harder. Those retiring today may still have a steady income from a DB scheme, supplemented by a DC pot. Over time, more people approaching retirement will only have a DC pot on which to rely.</p>
<p>The DC system expects consumers to take greater personal responsibility. Pensions is however a market marked by inertia, a lack of consumer understanding and ridden by fear.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most people never switch funds, many do not take timely advice in the years or decades before retirement, and half admit to being totally disengaged when it comes to pensions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We want to empower and support consumers through our work with the Treasury on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/discussion-papers/dp23-5-advice-guidance-boundary-review-proposals-closing-advice-gap" title="DP23/5: Advice Guidance Boundary Review &ndash; proposals for closing the advice gap ">Advice Guidance Boundary Review</a>&nbsp;launched last year.</p>
<p>More than half (53.58%) of all pots accessed for the first time in the contract-based retirement income market were accessed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/data/retirement-income-market-data-2021-22" title="Retirement income market data 2021/22">without advice or guidance</a>. More than a third &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/research/testing-what-gets-consumers-engaged-their-pension-and-why" title="Testing what gets consumers engaged with their pension &ndash; and why">34%</a>&nbsp;- of over-45s with DC funds don&rsquo;t understand their decumulation options.</p>
<p>That is why the Advice Guidance Boundary Review is important: too few people seek financial advice, so we need new mechanisms to ensure consumers have the support they need.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We want to support the emergence of commercially viable, high-quality models of support for consumers to access through regulated channels. &nbsp;We are open-minded as to how digitalisation can support these goals.</p>
<p>That means firms will have to manage risk rather than eliminate it. Firms must overcome their reticence to offer support for fear of being too close to the boundary or due to an overly cautious risk appetite.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, consumers need to accept that any investment carries risk, but we must be clear that receiving no support at all carries greater risk.</p>
<p>The AGBR builds on the experiences of the requirement for firms to offer pension pathways for certain situations. Default products akin to pathways could make consumer choices easier, and we have already observed some product innovation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Such support does not eliminate the need for consumers to engage and&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.pensionsdashboardsprogramme.org.uk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pension dashboards<span class="ext"></span></a>&nbsp;- which the FCA supports - are a tool that can help with that.</p>
<p>A secure digital interface where consumers can find clear information about their pensions as they build up their savings.</p>
<p>This should make it easier to plan for retirement, get advice and make informed decisions.</p>
<h2>Tackling fraud, protecting our markets and promoting competition</h2>
<p>As we pursue pensions reform, we won&rsquo;t lose sight of our core objectives either. &nbsp;We have primary objectives to protect consumers and market integrity. That is why we have had a relentless focus on preventing scams and fraud.</p>
<p>We have seen scammers contact consumers, posing as a firm or even the FCA, promising to help them release their pension before they are 55. These are in fact often frauds.</p>
<p>Our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/scamsmart" title="ScamSmart">ScamSmart</a>&nbsp;campaign aims to empower consumers by making it easy for them to check an investment or pension opportunity.</p>
<p>Following our intervention on financial promotions, we have also seen a withdrawal or change to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/financial-watchdog-stops-thousands-misleading-ads-promotions" title="Financial watchdog stops thousands of misleading ads and promotions">more than 10,000</a>&nbsp;potentially misleading advertisements in the last year, up 17% on the previous year.</p>
<p>We are alert to the fact that when pension dashboards go live, risks of scams may increase, and we want to work with you on measures to mitigate those risks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are also intervening where we see poor practice in firms, such as pockets of poor practice in SIPP (Self Invested Personal Pension) markets. Operators must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers and avoid causing foreseeable harm to them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In December, we&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-writes-firms-about-treatment-retained-interest-customers-cash-balances" title="FCA writes to firms about the treatment of retained interest on customers&rsquo; cash balances">highlighted</a>&nbsp;that the treatment of interest earned by firms on customers&rsquo; cash balances, including in SIPPs, may not be in line with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/consumer-duty" title="Consumer Duty">Consumer Duty</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We expect firms to ensure that their retention of interest on cash balances provides fair value and is understood by consumers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is not unreasonable to expect firms to review their approach and stop double-dipping &ndash; charging high fees but also taking a significant chunk of interest.</p>
<p>On a separate note, our work on Liability Driven Investment &ndash; LDI &ndash; highlights how we often work with other regulators and government on thornier issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before the LDI shock, we had a well-established system for dealing with systemic financial risk; one that was based on severe stress tests rather than nearly implausible ones.</p>
<p>We recognise that the use of LDI was intended to avoid volatility for Defined Benefit schemes.</p>
<p>But lessons have been learned and we have set out guidance for firms to develop increased resilience to deal with possible future volatility.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>From looking to how we can invest more at home to looking at best practice abroad: No conversation about pensions is complete without international comparison. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But we need to be mindful that jurisdictional histories determine where we and they are now and so not all ideas are immediately transferable across borders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an aside, the UK&rsquo;s pension system ranks&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.mercer.com/en-gb/about/newsroom/mercer-cfa-institute-global-pension-index-2022-highlights-uk-retirement-challenges/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reasonably well<span class="ext"></span></a>&nbsp;in comparative rankings in analyses of retirement savings across the globe. &nbsp;We will need to work hard to keep it that way or even improve.</p>
<p>There is a window of opportunity now, as we reach this generational crossover, to put in a framework fit for the future. A collective conversation has started on what we want from the system.</p>
<p>But there is no need for consumers, regulators or industry to wait for the outcome to emerge before taking action to engage consumers.</p>
<p>We can try to save more, receive, seek and impart better support and advice, improve value through transparency and hold a serious conversation about risk. &nbsp;We can check whether products really are value and are in invested in the right areas for savers and the economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Later life &ndash; for the lucky ones who get there - has a habit of sneaking up on you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Taking action now rather than waiting for a future perfect solution &ndash; will ensure those golden years are all the more fulfilling.</p>

<div> venture financing, biotech funding, industry partnerships, government grants, macroeconomic pressures
Summary:
44% of healthcare professionals optimistic about biotech funding recovery. Industry seeks alternative funding and government incentives to mitigate downturn. VC funding resilient. Optimism for future investments. <div>
<p><span><span>The biopharmaceutical industry is witnessing a shift in investor sentiment. Despite facing challenges such as declining venture financing and macroeconomic pressures, there exists optimism about a recovery in biotech funding. Healthcare professionals globally express cautious optimism, emphasizing the importance of alternative funding avenues and industry partnerships. This dynamic landscape sets the stage for potential growth and innovation in the biotech sector, says&nbsp;</span><a href="https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.gqh-2BaxUzlo7XKIuSly0rC502qyvSaH8suunkkct0v9mvfQCOd-2BH-2FL-2BYGtpYy-2FL-2FyLaZm1qwwVaPg8lPm6dvpuUGzmxcDRrpc-2BXaU-2BFHctKK2qwfJBe2dIC8cwTpUbkNKn4yN37FaiHVX8FXGb3WhnEUl1jttyxOEaeUbYCd7y-2BQvyAQhDUr-2BD-2BAMgyKdIHyIIedSCiJSAFX7cTX1LtbsqA-3D-3DmTyW_awSuR00uK8EZood8su7v4ItMFr0d7S5MNR1CcvAHRb7u8JiSB5Axp3o6-2Brp7TTn9jFAQeaiwuDUNp6ED3yPnAqPtLtA7N0aAz15yM-2Fa7YbLjEsQ0GRAa40BulYCiuXYl4GHwoT28XX1PmppnyLGsaRorPvC3HXrRaPbks6HyVGHNg74UcbigCXPdVX7So6w-2FLRGDP1mETI2isEJg1VtoF5031IPQD6YA4FjR7eV17SaQ7ZJFeP5xbI18l5cky0yaay0KCKaMcYYzVqgZ4bKCE-2FfOLzKA5hc0WoVABR8XCsCOjgLhtDKzeCts-2BXZSnqokvdg4LxZP3CYGyUXrkekN3px2BkjHsg02BtauN26-2FDL0-3D" target="_blank"><span><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">GlobalData</span></span></span></a><span>, a leading data and analytics company.</span></span></p>

This optimism follows a downturn in private biotech venture financing, where funding in 2023 declined by 43.2% and 52.3% compared to 2022 and 2021 respectively.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Ophelia Chan, Business Fundamentals Analyst at GlobalData, comments: &ldquo;This downturn was driven by macroeconomic pressures, prompting investors to be more cautious and focus on existing portfolios. The recent challenges such as high inflation, elevated interest rates, and geopolitical instability have further fueled investor caution.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>According to GlobalData&rsquo;s Pharma Intelligence Center Deals Database, venture financing for US-headquartered companies with innovator drugs surged by 104% to $20.7 billion in 2021, prompting numerous early-stage biotech to go public with high valuations. However, this resulted in overvalued biotechs failing to deliver milestone outcomes, leading to a decline in investor confidence and increased selectivity in new investments.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Nonetheless, biotechs are seeking alternative funding. In the same survey, 39% of respondents favored enhanced industry partnership as the most effective measure to address biotech funding downturns.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><img alt="GlobalData_BioTech_13to23" src="https://mondovisione.com/_assets/images/GlobalData_BioTech_13to23.jpg" title="GlobalData_BioTech_13to23" /><br /></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In Asia-Pacific (APAC), government incentives or grants are preferred over private venture capital (VC) investors to mitigate the downturn compared to those in North America and Europe. According to GlobalData&rsquo;s Pharma Intelligence Center Grants Database, US NIH grant funding for private companies headquartered in the US increased by 16.1% to $1.86 billion from 2021 to 2022, reflecting the importance of government funding bridging investment gaps received from VC investors.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Chan concludes: &ldquo;Despite challenges in private biotech funding, venture capital has sustained biotech innovation. Following a decline from record highs in 2021, VC funding has remained relatively resilient throughout 2022 and is now showing signs of returning to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels. Access to alternative capital sources such as enhanced industry partnerships and government grants, along with market stabilization and easing inflation, fosters a promising outlook for future biotech investments.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note: Includes all announced and completed deals for target companies headquartered in the US from 2013-2023 as a percentage growth from the baseline year 2013. Includes deals where at least one drug involved is an innovator for Marketed, Pre-Registration, Phase III, Phase II, Phase I, Preclinical, and Discovery development stages.</span></span></p>

<title>European Retail Investors Strongly Bullish On Natural Gas In February: Spectrum Markets</title>

<div> European retail investors, natural gas, Spectrum Markets, SERIX sentiment, bullish trading behavior
Summary:
Natural gas prices declined, but European retail investors showed bullish sentiment, expecting upward movement due to decreased Russian energy dependence. <br /><br /> <div>
<ul>
<li>Spectrum's SERIX sentiment indicator for natural gas reached 119 points </li>
<li>Sentiment suggests European retail investors were anticipating upward movement in gas prices as supply-demand dynamics evolved</li>
<li>Europe's efforts to reduce dependence on Russian energy could present opportunities for the natural gas sector</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spectrum Markets (&ldquo;Spectrum&rdquo;), the pan-European trading venue for securities, has published its SERIX sentiment data for European retail investors for February, revealing increasingly bullish trading behaviour linked to natural gas.</p>
<p>Since mid-January, the price of natural gas has experienced a decline, although there has been considerable volatility. After peaking in 2022 at around $10, the price has since been falling in 2023 and has rarely exceeded $2.</p>
<p>Spectrum Markets made instruments on natural gas available in March 2023, in response to investor demand, and it has seen bullish SERIX sentiment for all but one of the months since then, reaching 119 points in February 2024.</p>
<p>The SERIX value indicates retail investor sentiment, with a number above 100 marking bullish sentiment, and a number below 100 indicating bearish sentiment. (See below for more information on the methodology).</p>
<p><b>Market opinion</b></p>
<p>&ldquo;There are several reasons why the natural gas price has fallen since the beginning of the year. Among the factors are the attempts to diversify energy sources as a means of reducing emissions, as well as a decreasing domestic demand and high inventories resulting from a mild winter, coupled with a high production volume&rdquo;, says Michael Hall, Head of Distribution at Spectrum Markets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, from a European perspective there is a different view on this: Investors are noting a stable demand for LNG gas deliveries and observing increasing LNG shipments from the United States to European ports due to Europe&rsquo;s efforts to reduce dependence on Russian natural gas supplies. According to the Council of the European Union, the EU is already the&nbsp;largest LNG importer in the world. The ongoing conflict has prompted EU member states to further develop their LNG infrastructure and import capacity. That is why retail investors have tried to capitalise on the currently low price and took a long position on natural gas&rdquo;, adds Michael Hall.</p>
<p><b>Spectrum&rsquo;s February data</b></p>
<p>In February 2024, order book turnover on Spectrum was &euro;213.6 million, with 34.5% of trades taking place outside of traditional hours (i.e., between 17:30 and 9:00 CET).</p>
<p>80.8% of the order book turnover was on indices, 4.5% on currency pairs, 6.6% on commodities, 5% on equities and 3.1% on cryptocurrencies, with the top three traded underlying markets being DAX 40 (30.7%), NASDAQ 100 (23.7%), and DOW 30 (10.1%).</p>
<p>Looking at the SERIX data for the top three underlying markets, the DAX 40 sentiment dropped from 99 to 93. The NASDAQ 100 saw a similar decrease from 98 to 96, while the DOW 30 increased slightly from 98 to 99.&nbsp;</p>

<table border="0" style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<div>
<p align="center"><b>Calculating SERIX data</b></p>
<p>The Spectrum European Retail Investor Index (SERIX), uses the exchange&rsquo;s pan-European trading data to shed light on investor sentiment towards current development in financial markets.</p>
<p>The index is calculated on a monthly basis by analysing retail investor trades placed and subtracting the proportion of bearish trades from the proportion of bullish trades, to give a single figure (rebased at 100) that indicates the strength and direction of sentiment:</p>
<p align="center"><i>SERIX = (% bullish trades - % bearish trades) + 100</i></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;Trades where long instruments are bought and trades where short instruments are sold are both considered bullish trades, while trades where long instruments are sold and trades where short instruments are bought are considered bearish trades. Trades that are matched by retail clients are disregarded. (For a detailed methodology and examples, please visit this <a href="https://www.spectrum-markets.com/the-venue/spectrum-european-retail-investor-index?utm_source=Press%20Release%20-%20EN&amp;utm_medium=SERIX%20LINK&amp;utm_campaign=May%20Volumes%20Press%20Release&amp;utm_content=">link</a><span>).</span></p>

</ul>
<br />
<p>Jos Dijsselhof, CEO SIX: "We are proud to have outperformed the previous year&rsquo;s performance on an operational level. We are delivering on our growth strategy and the result is a testament of our diversified business model. Unfortunately, the strong operating result was affected by two major non-cash value adjustments. Nevertheless we're excited to leverage our skills and experience to deliver even more value to our clients. We are confident about our future growth, consistent financial performance, and ability to generate strong returns for our shareholders.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Overview of Key Figures</span><br />Total operating income grew by 2.1% (3.5% at constant exchange rates) to CHF 1,526.0 million. The increase was mainly driven by higher interest income and larger repo volumes in the Securities Services business unit, strong sales in the Financial Information business unit, and expanded revenues from debit and mobile services in the Banking Services business unit. By contrast, the Exchanges business unit faced low trading volumes, and net interest income at Swiss Euro Clearing Bank GmbH (SECB) in the Banking Services business unit was dampened by higher interest paid to depositories.</p>
<p><span>Results by Business Units</span><br />Overall, SIX recorded a decade-low in both trading volumes and volatilities in 2023, as was the trend throughout Europe. In the Exchanges business unit, SIX generated operating income of CHF 332.6 million. This is 9.8% lower than in the previous year (2022: CHF 368.6 million), and a minus of 8.3% at constant exchange rates.</p>
<p>The Securities Services business unit benefited from higher interest rates by successfully investing its cash reserves and earning income. The business unit recorded an operating income of CHF 533.9 million, up 14.6% or 15.6% at constant exchange rates compared to 2022 (2022: CHF 465.9 million).</p>
<p>In the Financial Information business unit, the growth trajectory that started in 2021 continued to show positive results. The unit closed the year with CHF 406.9 million in operating income, a gain of 3.9% or 6.5% at constant exchange rates (2022: CHF 391.5 million).</p>
<p>In the Banking Services business unit, SIX achieved strong customer and revenue growth in newly established business fields, but the unit suffered with SECB reporting a negative interest result due to rising interest rates in the eurozone. Operating income for the business unit was CHF 207.8 million, 7.9% below its previous-year performance (-7.6% at constant exchange rates; 2022: CHF 225.7 million). Excluding SECB, the Banking Services profit would have shown growth of 13.7%, underlining the strong operational performance of the different ecosystems.</p>
<p><span>Value Adjustments</span><br />As already announced on 14 December 2023 in a separate communication, two non-cash value adjustments led to negative earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of CHF &ndash;975.0 million. On the back of the share price decline at Worldline, SIX adjusted the value of the 10.5% stake in Worldline by CHF 862.3 million. The goodwill attributed to BME had to be adjusted by CHF 339.6 million as a result of increased discount rates as well as lower trading volumes in Spain and across Europe. The Group net result was CHF &ndash;1,006.2 million (2022: CHF 185.0 million). Excluding value adjustments, the Group net result amounts to CHF 181.1 million, slightly less than last year. At constant currency rates SIX would have outperformed previous years group net result by 1.3%.</p>
<p>The value adjustments did not affect the strong free cash flow generation in 2023, which increased by 31.2% compared to 2022. The capital position of SIX remains strong by reporting an adjusted equity ratio of 64.2% with a net leverage ratio of 1.5x EBITDA.</p>
<p><span>Both the investment in Worldline and the acquisition of BME continue to hold significant strategic importance for SIX.</span><br />Worldline remains a strategic investment for SIX as a key partner in its payments offering, particularly for Swiss banks. In 2018, the sale of SIX Payment Services to Worldline resulted in a positive one-off effect of CHF 2.7 billion for SIX, while significantly strengthening its equity.</p>
<p>BME plays a crucial role in the operational and financial success of SIX, remaining integral to the group's growth strategy and competitive positioning. In 2023, BME once again made a substantial contribution to the strong financial performance of SIX, generating 18.0% of the Group's total revenue, and 34.0% of the Group's total EBITDA for 2023.</p>
<p><span>Dividend</span><br />For 2023, in accordance with the dividend policy of SIX. the Board of Directors recommends that the Annual General Meeting approve an ordinary dividend of CHF&nbsp;5.20 per share, which equates an increase of 2.0% compared to the previous year (2022: CHF 5.10).</p>
<p><span>Financial and Business Outlook<br /></span>For 2024, SIX expects the political and macroeconomic landscape to be similarly challenging for the economy and society as in the previous year. The medium-term goal of SIX is to grow revenue by &gt; 3% p.a. while also extending profitability gains. Looking at the cost base, SIX will continue to rely on measures to unlock cost synergies and deliver targeted cost efficiencies. Bolt-on acquisitions and partnering opportunities will further strengthen its already strong portfolio.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given its ever-evolving business environment, SIX places an extra premium on ensuring financial market efficiency, stability, and security in our home markets of Switzerland and Spain, and on providing superior services for its clients now and in the future.</p>

<div> expansion, Asia, OMS, Risk solutions, client demand
Summary:<br />STT plans to expand into Asia by offering advanced OMS and Risk solutions in response to client demand for more efficient and competitive technology. <div>
<p><span>Sterling Trading Tech (STT), a leading global provider of technology in order management, risk and margin, and trading, today announced a 2024 expansion into Asia. STT focuses on client growth by delivering technology that provides clients with a competitive advantage. This announcement comes as the second in a series of strategic announcements for 2024 regarding plans for international expansion, following the recent onboarding of KBFG Securities America Inc.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The move is in response to the Asia markets and client demand for more advanced OMS and Risk solutions than are currently available in local markets. STT has identified Korea, Hong Kong, and Singapore as the focus for the expansion. STT will deploy its systems both locally and cross-border (focusing on U.S. operations of Asia entities).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sterling&rsquo;s multi-asset OMS enhances liquidity and alpha generation in U.S. equities and options. It fosters client growth and competitiveness by creating operational and infrastructure efficiencies.

<div> Offering, Convertible Senior Notes, Coinbase, Private offering, Rule 144A
Summary:
Coinbase plans to offer $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due 2030 in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers. The notes will be senior, unsecured obligations of Coinbase, offering a 30-day option to purchase additional notes. Proceeds will be used for debt repayment, general corporate purposes, capped call transactions, and potential investments. The notes will only be offered to qualified institutional buyers through a private offering memorandum. <div>
<p>Coinbase Global, Inc. (&ldquo;Coinbase&rdquo;) (Nasdaq: COIN) today announced its intention to offer, subject to market conditions and other factors, $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due 2030 (the &ldquo;notes&rdquo;) in a private offering (the &ldquo;offering&rdquo;) to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &ldquo;Securities Act&rdquo;). Coinbase also expects to grant the initial purchasers of the notes a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional $150.0 million principal amount of notes solely to cover over-allotments. The notes will be senior, unsecured obligations of Coinbase, will accrue interest payable semi-annually in arrears and will mature on April 1, 2030, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. The notes will be convertible into cash, shares of Coinbase&rsquo;s Class A common stock, or a combination thereof, at Coinbase&rsquo;s election. The interest rate, initial conversion rate, and other terms of the notes are to be determined upon pricing of the offering.</p>
<p>In connection with the pricing of the notes, Coinbase expects to enter into privately negotiated capped call transactions with one or more of the initial purchasers or their affiliates and/or other financial institutions (the &ldquo;option counterparties&rdquo;). The capped call transactions will cover, subject to customary adjustments, the number of shares of Coinbase&rsquo;s Class A common stock that will initially underlie the notes. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to Coinbase&rsquo;s Class A common stock upon any conversion of the notes and/or offset any potential cash payments Coinbase is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap.</p>
<p>Coinbase has been advised that, in connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates expect to enter into various derivative transactions with respect to Coinbase&rsquo;s Class A common stock and/or purchase shares of Coinbase&rsquo;s Class A common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the notes. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of Coinbase&rsquo;s Class A common stock or the notes at that time. In addition, Coinbase has been advised that the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to Coinbase&rsquo;s Class A common stock and/or purchasing or selling Coinbase&rsquo;s Class A common stock or other securities of Coinbase in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the notes and from time to time prior to the maturity of the notes (and are likely to do so during the relevant valuation period under the capped call transactions or following any early conversion of the notes, any repurchase of the notes by Coinbase on any fundamental change repurchase date, any redemption date or any other date on which the notes are retired by Coinbase, in each case if Coinbase exercises its option to terminate the relevant portion of the capped call transactions). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of Coinbase&rsquo;s Class A common stock or the notes, which could affect the ability of noteholders to convert the notes and, to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of the notes, it could affect the number of shares of Class A common stock, if any, and value of the consideration that noteholders will receive upon conversion of the notes.</p>
<p>Coinbase intends to use the net proceeds from the offering to repay at maturity, or repurchase or redeem prior to maturity, from time to time and subject to market conditions, its outstanding 0.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026, 3.375% Senior Notes due 2028, and 3.625% Senior Notes due 2031 and for other general corporate purposes, which may include working capital and capital expenditures, and to pay the cost of the capped call transactions. If the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes, Coinbase expects to use a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of such additional notes to enter into additional capped call transactions. Coinbase may also use a portion of the net proceeds to make investments in and acquisitions of other companies, products or technologies that Coinbase may identify from time to time.</p>
<p>The notes will only be offered and sold to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A promulgated under the Securities Act by means of a private offering memorandum. Neither the notes nor the shares of Coinbase&rsquo;s Class A common stock potentially issuable upon conversion of the notes, if any, have been, or will be, registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the United States, except pursuant to an applicable exemption from such registration requirements.</p>
<p>This announcement is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any of the notes or any shares of Class A common stock potentially issuable upon conversion of the notes and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation, or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation, or sale is unlawful.</p>

<div> response, IOSCO, voluntary carbon markets, regulation, VCCs
Summary: ISDA supports IOSCO's work on regulating voluntary carbon markets, emphasizing the need for clear legal categorization and harmonized international principles. Financial regulation should focus on market issues, not project-level ones. <div>
<p>On March 1, ISDA submitted a response to IOSCO&rsquo;s Voluntary Carbon Markets Consultation Report. The response welcomes IOSCO&rsquo;s work on developing good practices for regulation of voluntary carbon markets (VCMs), as well as its recognition of the critical role that financial market participants play in VCMs. Clear legal and regulatory categorisation of voluntary carbon credits is key to building liquidity in order to support scaling VCMs and to develop safe, efficient markets in VCC derivatives.</p>
<p>We support development of harmonised international principles for regulatory frameworks governing trading in Voluntary Carbon Credits (VCCs). As part of this work it is important to make a clear distinction between regulation of trading activity in VCCs that are already in issue, and the work ongoing at an international level to develop principles supporting the issuance of robust and verifiable VCCs at the project level. While many of the regulatory principles applicable to securities markets may be helpful in supporting VCMs, it will be important that financial regulation is focused on issues in the financial markets rather than in the underlying projects. Similarly, many aspects of trading in VCCs are already addressed by existing financial services regulation (e.g., with respect to trading in OTC derivatives), and any regulation specific to VCCs should be consistent with this and should not duplicate it.</p>

<title>SEC Charges Tallgrass Energy’s Former Board Member Roy Cook And Four Others With Insider Trading In Advance Of Blackstone Acquisition</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Insider trading, Roy Cook, Tallgrass Energy LP, SEC charges, Blackstone Infrastructure Partners<br />
Summary:<br />
SEC charged Roy Cook and four others with insider trading for trading on nonpublic info about Blackstone's offer to acquire Tallgrass. Cook failed to file required reports. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced insider trading charges against Roy Cook, a former board member of Tallgrass Energy LP, and four of his friends for trading on material nonpublic information in advance of a public announcement that Blackstone Infrastructure Partners had offered to acquire Tallgrass and take it private. The SEC also charged Cook for failing to file required disclosure reports concerning securities transactions by family trusts. All five of the defendants agreed to settlements that, in aggregate, include more than $2.2 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Cook learned in late July 2019 that Blackstone, which had acquired 44 percent of Tallgrass&rsquo;s public shares earlier that year, was planning to make an offer to acquire the remainder of Tallgrass&rsquo;s publicly traded shares. Within weeks of learning that information, Cook allegedly tipped his friends, Jeffrey Natrop, Peter Renner, James Rudolph, and Peter Williams, who all purchased Tallgrass securities prior to an August 27, 2019, public announcement of Blackstone&rsquo;s offer.</p>
<p>The complaint alleges that Natrop and Renner, who were friends and business associates of Cook&rsquo;s, purchased Tallgrass call options on August 8 and 9, 2019, which resulted in illicit profits of $43,862 for Natrop and $13,520 for Renner. The complaint further alleges that Cook tipped Rudolph while the two were in the Bahamas celebrating Rudolph&rsquo;s birthday on Rudolph&rsquo;s yacht and that Rudolph purchased Tallgrass stock on August 6, 2019, which resulted in illicit profits of $31,035. The complaint also alleges that Cook tipped Williams, his long-time friend and personal accountant, and that Williams purchased call options on August 19 and 21, 2019, which resulted in illicit profits of $463,000.</p>
<p>Following the August 27 announcement, which saw Tallgrass shares increase by 36 percent, Cook served for several months as chair of a Tallgrass Conflicts Committee tasked with assessing Blackstone&rsquo;s offer and negotiating the final terms of the transaction. In connection with this role, Cook allegedly learned material nonpublic information about the status of the negotiations that he communicated to Williams, who purchased Tallgrass stock in a Cook family trust account over which he had trading authority, resulting in $88,800 of illicit profits for Cook. The complaint further alleges that, on December 10, 2019, while on vacation in Chile, Cook tipped Williams more material nonpublic information about the status of the negotiations, and Williams purchased more call options in his personal account, resulting in additional illicit profits of $61,525.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As our complaint alleges, Roy Cook took advantage of his position as a Tallgrass director to repeatedly enrich himself and his friends,&rdquo; said Mark Cave, Associate Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;We will hold accountable board members and others who misuse inside information for their own benefit and violate the trust placed in them by shareholders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, charges the defendants with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and charges Cook with failing to file required reports concerning Tallgrass securities transactions by family trusts. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Cook agreed to pay a civil penalty of $801,742 and disgorge his illicit trading profits, with prejudgment interest. Cook also agreed to an officer-and-director bar.</p>
<p>Without admitting or denying the allegations, each of the other four defendants agreed to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of their allegedly illicit trading profits and disgorge their illicit trading profits, with prejudgment interest.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by David Frisof and Brian Vann, with assistance from Dean M. Conway, James Carlson, and Brian Shute. The case was supervised by Brian Quinn.</p>
<p>The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the FBI, and the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the District of New Jersey.</p>

The new green bond tags will enable fixed income market participants to instantly identify and categorize securities that contain specific environmentally sustainable growth attributes, based on Climate Bonds' internationally recognized taxonomy for evaluating green finance principles and establishing green bond standards.</p>
<p>The CUSIP is a nine-character alphanumeric security identifier that captures the unique attributes of issuers and their financial instruments throughout the U.S. and&nbsp;Canada. In the U.S. bond market, the CUSIP is used by investors to uniquely identify and track securities and link them with the underlying issuing entity. With this enhancement of its data feed and desktop products, CGS will append a text-based descriptor to the standard CUSIP ID for green bonds. The new attributes, which include more granular use of proceeds information and non-alignment details, cover municipal and corporate debt issued globally and are provided at no additional cost to CGS customers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Green, social and sustainability-linked bond issuance accounted for roughly $1 trillion in bond issuance last year, as corporate and municipal issuers increasingly focus on this market segment,&rdquo; said Scott Preiss, Senior Vice President and Global Head, CUSIP Global Services. &ldquo;By providing green bond tags as part of our data feed and desktop products, we are making it possible for market participants to quickly and reliably identify securities that meet key sustainable finance criteria using Climate Bonds' proven evaluation standard.&rdquo;</p>

Summary:<br />
The CFTC celebrates its 50th anniversary, addressing regulatory priorities for derivatives markets, including AI, and seeking industry engagement. <div>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Good morning and thank you, Alicia, for the kind introduction.</p>
<p>There may be a few FIA Futures Hall of Fame members in the audience who know or can recall the origin of the CFTC.&nbsp; This October, the CFTC will commemorate the 50th&nbsp;anniversary of the passage of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Act of 1974.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam43?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act established the CFTC as an independent agency with exclusive jurisdiction over futures trading in&nbsp;<i>all&nbsp;</i>commodities.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam43?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2">[2]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Next year, we will mark the 50th&nbsp;anniversary of the swearing in of the first four Commissioners and the official transfer of authority from our predecessor in the U.S. Department of Agriculture to the CFTC.&nbsp; This 50th&nbsp;milestone is referred to as a golden anniversary or jubilee.</p>
<p>Many of us are familiar with the phrase to &ldquo;Stay gold, Ponyboy,&rdquo; a quote from S.E. Hinton&rsquo;s&nbsp;<i>The Outsiders</i><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam43?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3">[3]</a><i>&mdash;</i>which is actually a reference to Robert Frost&rsquo;s poem &ldquo;Nothing Gold Can Stay.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam43?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4">[4]</a>&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a phrase used to remind someone to stay true to their convictions&mdash;to have personal strength, because change is inevitable. &nbsp;The &ldquo;golden standard&rdquo; is therefore, so to speak, having the strength and principles to show up every day, and meet the challenges of constant change and unavoidable conflicts together.&nbsp; In this current era, many of our issues wrestle with transition and acknowledging new market realities in the derivatives industry that may require changes in the way we regulate our markets.</p>
<p>If you have been in attendance these last few years, this all may sound familiar.&nbsp; In 2022, I remarked that our collective dedication was a testament to our resilience as an industry.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam43?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5">[5]</a>&nbsp; Last year, I acknowledged that the modern futures ecosystem was taking off.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam43?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6">[6]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;I invited you to show up, and to be generous with your time, comments, input, and feedback.&nbsp; And I am showing up today to again ask that, if you believe in the derivatives markets and feel strongly about the direction we are moving in, that you engage, meaningfully.</p>
<p>Before sitting down with Walt, I would like to provide a brief overview of the CFTC&rsquo;s current priorities.</p>
<p>The Current Agenda</p>
<p>In early 2023, I outlined a Commission agenda to consider and vote on roughly 30 regulatory and policy matters in addition to all of the rules and orders proposed in the prior year.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam43?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7">[7]</a>&nbsp; I bucketed them into themes that addressed the following:&nbsp;risk management and resilience; customer protections; efficiency and innovation; reporting and data policy; duplicative regulatory requirements; and international comity.</p>
<p>Underlying all of these themes is the need for our ruleset to address the derivatives industry&rsquo;s current course as a few seek to move away from the traditional and familiar model towards structures that combine unique activities. &nbsp;I touched upon these concepts in 2022, identifying disintermediation and decentralized finance as the dominant disruptors of our current era, raising important questions about conflicts of interest, the strength of capital, margin, and segregation requirements, the role and responsibilities of self-regulatory organizations, affiliate risk management, and, of course, customer protections.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam43?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8">[8]</a></p>
<p>I was not surprised that by last summer, vertical integration, an outgrowth of electronification and DeFi,<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam43?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9">[9]</a>&nbsp;had grown.&nbsp; Our markets are no longer physically delineated by geographical separation of activities among distinguishable market actors.&nbsp; And, to be clear, there is nothing per se unreasonable or problematic about innovative approaches. &nbsp;The bottom line is that, when presented with legally sound proposals to facilitate the transfer and mitigation of financial risk, we must engage, grapple with the questions they raise and ask our own, apply pressure&mdash;sometimes a healthy dose, be transparent, and move with caution and collective wisdom.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve consistently stated, our role is to regulate a market, ensure integrity and resilience, and protect customers.</p>
<p>Accordingly, last summer&nbsp;I&nbsp;directed staff to draft and issue the Request for Comment on the Impact of Affiliations on Certain CFTC-Regulated Entities (the &ldquo;RFC&rdquo;).<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam43?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10">[10]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Your comments have been received and reviewed, and I anticipate that by the summer the Commission will consider a proposal specifically addressing potential risks, conflicts, and governance issues that may be raised by new market structures and affiliate relationships.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I envision that while any new policy will be informed in part by the comments received in the RFC and the Commission&rsquo;s real-time observations, the goal is to continue using, as a template and anchor, the models and structures that have been time-tested and developed over decades to promote market resiliency and protect customers.&nbsp; Notably, these structures historically include iterations of vertical integration to varying degrees that arguably may be considered the global gold standard for financial market structure in their respective asset classes.</p>
<p>Recent stories and some commenters have struggled in articulating differentiations between Commission rulemakings, policy determinations, and the straightforward exercise of its authorities particularly when it comes to matters that involve digital assets. &nbsp;These stories, in part, are fed by inaccurate narratives illustrative of what I can only believe is an overt hyperfocus on the sensational over the less than attention-grabbing substance of an industry regulator engaging in the business-as-usual meeting of our statutory directives.&nbsp; Fueling much of the debate may be the innate challenge to appreciating where the necessary and appropriate friction resides in a principles-based regime.</p>
<p>There is nothing light touch when it comes to principles-based regulation.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam43?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11">[11]</a>&nbsp; Rather, principles-based regulation preserves the concrete, foundational objectives of the underlying law while providing for flexibility and innovation.&nbsp; The discretion it affords requires respect on both sides of the regulatory line such that risk is addressed in the most effective and efficient manner. &nbsp;And, to the extent more prescriptive rules are necessary, they are informed by the individuals and entities who have the greatest experience and expertise.</p>
<p>As I have said throughout my tenure at the Commission, &ldquo;[t]he best principles-based rules in the world will not succeed absent: (1) clear guidance from regulators; (2) adequate means to measure and ensure compliance; and (3) willingness to enforce compliance and punish those who fail to ensure compliance with the rules.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam43?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12">[12]</a>&nbsp; As Chairman, I would not put forth a proposal, policy, practice, or procedure that does anything less.</p>
<p>In addressing matters before the Commission, including applications for registration that present novel structures, my intent&mdash;as always&mdash;is to carry out our duty under the&nbsp;Commodity Exchange Act, informed by facts and circumstances, and nothing else.&nbsp; As I have said before, we must continually be fair and consistent in evaluating the products and proposals presented for our consideration.&nbsp; The Commission must abide by core regulatory principles that prioritize, among other things, customer protections, market stability, and resilience.&nbsp; And, we must ensure a level playing field, regardless of the asset class.</p>
<p>The alternative is to inject a level of subjective decision making moved by the prevailing winds of the day, which could lead to a future unmoored from the compass that guides us, the Commodity Exchange Act.</p>
<p>I am pleased to share that we have moved through much of the 2023-2024 agenda, having proposed and finalized changes intended to strengthen governance, improve risk management and resilience, and ensure that&nbsp;<i>all</i>&nbsp;market participants get the information they need and protections they are entitled to, regardless of sophistication.</p>
<p>The Commission will spend the remainder of 2024 largely focused on finalizing rules and considering a few additional proposals currently in drafting. &nbsp;In the upcoming months, we anticipate considering a proposal to amend CFTC rules that address the treatment of certain types of event contracts, in order to provide additional regulatory clarity both for exchanges that seek to list event contracts, and for market participants.</p>
<p>Among the proposals that should be finalized within the year are amendments to the Part 39 rules to address the protection of clearing member funds held by DCOs commonly referred to as the &ldquo;Member Property&rdquo; proposal.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam43?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13">[13]</a>&nbsp; The straightforward proposal aims to accomplish a simple and very important objective: to provide protections for clearing member funds, analogous to the existing protections of funds belonging to customers of a futures commission merchant.</p>
<p>The comment period for the Member Property proposal remains open through Monday (March 18th),<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam43?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14">[14]</a>&nbsp;so there is still time to engage.</p>
<p>While it is too early to tell where 2024 will take us in terms of artificial intelligence (&ldquo;AI&rdquo;), the Commission is eager to engage.&nbsp; In January, the CFTC&rsquo;s new AI Task Force issued a request for comment (&ldquo;AI RFC&rdquo;) on the use of AI in CFTC-regulated markets.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam43?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15">[15]</a>&nbsp; This AI RFC prioritizes promoting responsible innovation and ensuring that we understand AI applications and the associated risks and impacts in our jurisdictional markets and the larger financial system.&nbsp;&nbsp;The AI RFC will be open through April 24th, and we need your input so that&nbsp;we can better engage and evaluate the need for future regulation, guidance, or other Commission action.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>At 49 years, our relationship is now 7 times the normal 7-year itch.&nbsp; Not everyone will agree with where the CFTC&rsquo;s boundaries are or where its resources are best prioritized, but that does not change the commitments we have made to ensuring the derivatives industry not only endures, but flourishes.</p>
<p>There is no question that we will hit that golden anniversary. &nbsp;And I believe that the fact that we have debates, and that we agree to disagree sometimes, demonstrates each of our commitments to stay gold.</p>
<p>Every day, we strive to ensure that our rules, policies, and guidance address the complexities of the derivatives markets with logic and forethought. &nbsp;We approach every policy and legal question, with the judiciousness, care, and craft that the entirety and complexity of our markets demand, even if, acknowledging our humility, we know we may need to adapt and reassess in the future.</p>
<p>I appreciate the time and trust you have given me, and thank you for your engagement.</p>

<title>DTCC’s FICC Treasury Clearing Volumes Grow 31%, Now Represent USD$7 Trillion In Daily Average Activity - FICC Sponsored Service Also Experiences Growth, With Sponsored Service Buyside Volumes Increasing By 74% And Sponsored Member Firms Increasing By 60%</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/dtccs-ficc-treasury-clearing-volumes-grow-31-now-represent-usd7-trillion-in/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>DTCC, the premier post-trade market infrastructure for the global financial services industry, today announced that its Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC) Treasury clearing volumes have grown 31% year over year, processing a daily average volume of USD$7.019 trillion. This growth comes at a time when market participant firms are assessing the impact of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s (SEC) new requirements that expand the application of central clearing to certain U.S. Treasury repo and secondary market cash transactions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are pleased to see the continued increase in clearing activity and expect that trend to continue as we move toward go-live for the expanded Treasury Clearing requirement. The growth to a daily average volume of USD$7.019 trillion is roughly double the volume that is expected to migrate into central clearing as a result of the Treasury clearing requirement. DTCC is well-prepared for the implementation, which we view as a logical expansion of the large-scale, resilient, proven services that FICC has provided for nearly 40 years,&rdquo; stated Brian Steele, Managing Director, President, Clearing &amp; Securities Services.</p>
<p>In addition to the increase in overall clearing volumes, FICC&rsquo;s Sponsored Service has also experienced growth in the last year. Sponsored Service clearing volumes increased 74% to a daily average of USD$938 billion. The number of Sponsored Members participating in FICC also increased 60% to 2,414 firms that represent a diverse set of asset managers of different profiles and regulated statuses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fact that more and more firms are voluntarily choosing to clear their trades through FICC&rsquo;s Sponsored Service, which is reflected in the growth of the community and in volumes, is a testament to the value central clearing delivers to market participants. It also reflects the industry&rsquo;s confidence in FICC&rsquo;s risk management capabilities, and support for our unique ownership and governance structure, which allows us to take a long-term view of risk and make decisions that are in the best interest of the marketplace,&rdquo; said Laura Klimpel, Managing Director, Head of Fixed Income and Financing Solutions. &ldquo;FICC provides certainty and stability to the Treasury market while enabling firms to maximize liquidity, take advantage of netting and generate balance sheet relief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>FICC&rsquo;s Sponsored Service, offered through its Government Securities Division (GSD), is one of the many access methods that FICC offers that clients can choose to best meet their business needs and goals. Additional access models provide participants with the ability to have their activity submitted directly to FICC or agency-intermediary style.</p>
<p>Added Klimpel, &ldquo;Our clients frequently tell us about the value and efficiencies that the Sponsored Service brings to their firms&rsquo; resilience and risk management practices today, with many of these firms consistently processing significant volumes with us. We look forward to building on our strong track record of delivering innovative solutions to further mitigate risk, optimize collateral usage, reduce capital requirements, and enhance overall market efficiency.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The methodology (first approved by ACER in 2020) is used to identify the most relevant electricity crisis scenarios at regional level, including cross border dependencies.</p>
<p>It introduces a structured approach for regional electricity crisis scenarios (prepared by the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E)) and national ones (prepared by national competent authorities) and thus serves as the basis&nbsp;for the development of consistent risk-preparedness plans.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the main improvements in the methodology?</span></p>
<p>The key changes of the methodology are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A top-down process:   
<ul>
<li>starting with 31 regional electricity crisis scenarios (from 2020);</li>
<li>merging certain scenarios or adding new ones; and</li>
<li>focusing on extreme scenarios with regional impact.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Earlier engagement of Member States and competent authorities.</li>
<li>A more pragmatic approach: ENTSO-E to undertake quantitative methods and model-based simulations where seasonal adequacy tools can be applied.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Summary: JPX Market Explorer, a new service using Bridgewise's generative AI, provides market information on TSE-listed companies in multiple languages.<br /> <div>
<div>
<p class="component-text">Today, JPX Market Innovation &amp; Research, Inc. (JPXI) announced the launch of a proof of concept (PoC) for "JPX Market Explorer," a new service that uses the technology of Bridgewise, a generative AI provider, to disseminate information on the Japanese market. The service will enable investors to easily obtain information on all companies that are listed on Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE).<br /><br />JPX Market Explorer is a free service website for investors both inside and outside Japan. Investors can easily search for business overviews of listed companies and summaries of their most recent financial results as well as analyze their financial conditions and compare them with the financial conditions of their competitors.<br /><br />The content and analysis are generated using Bridgewise's generative AI technology. There are over 3,900 companies that are listed on TSE, and we have received requests from overseas investors for more complete information about them in English.<br /><br />Using generative AI will enable investors to obtain a wider range of information on listed companies than can be fully covered by human analysts. In addition, all content will be disseminated not only in Japanese but also in 10 other languages, including English. This will enable us to disseminate more information on TSE-listed companies to Japanese and foreign investors than ever before.<br /><br />In this PoC, we will examine how the use of generative AI will help investors gather information and help us disseminate information on listed companies and the Japanese market as a whole.</p>

<div> Franchise, Futures, Interest Rate Benchmarks, Singapore Exchange, Risk Management Tools
Summary:<br /><br />Singapore Exchange (SGX Group) will introduce SORA and TONA Futures to hedge interest rate risks, enhancing capital efficiency and liquidity. Market demand for transparent and cost-effective risk management tools drives expansion. <div>
<ul>
<li>Derivatives franchise will expand to include futures linked to Singapore and Japan&rsquo;s overnight interest rate benchmarks, to support strong emerging demand for more risk management tools in an uncertain interest rate environment</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Singapore Exchange (SGX Group) will introduce short-term interest rate futures linked to the Singapore Overnight Rate Average (SORA)<a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/#_ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;and Tokyo Overnight Average Rate (TONA)<a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/#_ftn2">[2]</a>, as global investors increasingly seek more transparent and cost-effective tools to hedge and trade fluctuations in interest rates. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Three-month SORA and TONA Futures contracts are targeted to be launched in the second half of this year, subject to regulatory approval. These contracts build upon SGX Group&rsquo;s current suite of long-term interest rate futures &ndash; 10-year Full-Sized and Mini Japanese Government Bond (JGB) futures &ndash; which have attracted diverse international market participants. &nbsp;</p>
<p>SGX Group is driving the futurisation of OTC derivatives to enhance greater capital efficiency, price discovery and liquidity in Singapore&rsquo;s Singapore Dollar (SGD) interest rates market. SORA Futures will be a new hedging tool for market participants to manage their exposure to interest rate risks, amid growing issuance of SGD cash market products that reference SORA. The contract will augment SGX Group&rsquo;s Singapore product shelf including its flagship SGX MSCI Singapore Index Futures and SGX USD/SGD Full-Sized and Mini FX Futures. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The three-month TONA Futures will also complement SGX Group&rsquo;s portfolio of Japanese derivatives including JGB futures, SGX Nikkei 225 Index futures and options, as well as SGX USD/JPY FX futures. This comes on the back of market expectations that Japan&rsquo;s negative interest rate policy will come to an end, together with rising interest in the world&rsquo;s third largest government bond market and record-highs in the Nikkei 225 equity benchmark.</p>
<p>KC Lam, Global Head of FX &amp; Rates, SGX Group, said, &ldquo;The uncertain interest rate environment, coupled with inflation and volatility in the macroenvironment, has increased the appeal and usage of interest rate derivatives as a cost-effective, transparent hedging and trading tool. Our planned SORA and TONA Futures will complement our expanding multi-asset derivatives franchise and provide additional cross-margining tools for global participants.&rdquo;</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/#_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;SORA, published by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, is the volume-weighted average rate of borrowing transactions in the unsecured overnight interbank Singapore Dollar (SGD) cash market in Singapore.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/#_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;TONA, published by the Bank of Japan, is the volume-weighted average of actual transactions in the Japanese Yen (JPY) unsecured overnight money market.</p>

It&rsquo;s a time that our markets take stock as a global community.<br /><br />We gather here in the south Florida sunshine with our colleagues, clients, and competitors to hear the latest trends and measure ourselves against the best and the brightest.<br /><br />And we have a little fun as well.<br /><br />Boca causes us to reflect as leaders and ask probing questions of ourselves.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<li>Do I have an advantage over my competition?</li>
<li>What innovation can give me an edge?</li>
<li>What trends are people talking about and why?</li>
<li>Are there strategic partnerships worth pursuing?&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This annual gathering causes us to strive to do better. To try harder. Think more creatively. And innovate as an industry.<br /><br />Boca helps us to raise our game.<br /><br />Now I have a confession to make. When I took over the FIA twelve years ago, I really only had one non-negotiable assignment when being handed the keys: Don&rsquo;t screw up Boca!<br /><br />I often ask myself: what makes Boca special?<br /><br />Is it the C-suite attendees? The exchange leaders panel? The sunny weather? The Palm Court bar?<br /><br />There seems to be several ingredients in this special cocktail that contribute to the magic.<br /><br />But I&rsquo;ve concluded that there is one key thread over time that fuels Boca&rsquo;s success and it has been a constant and relentless heartbeat since Boca&rsquo;s beginnings.<br /><br />And that&rsquo;s competition.<br /><br />Competition is what drives this industry and this event. Think about it.<br /><br />There are legendary stories of Bocas past recounting major deal announcements, early morning merger counteroffers, and even more recently, a late-night &ldquo;debate&rdquo; at the Palm Court bar among famous and infamous characters from our industry. &nbsp;<br /><br />At the core of these stories are colorful characters with a singular desire to compete and win. It&rsquo;s just part of our DNA. I see this at all levels of the industry from CEOs to startups.<br /><br />But what I also love about this industry is this competition comes with a healthy respect for those on the other side of the battlefield. We compete with all our conviction, but we respect the contest.<br /><br />I liken it to elite professional athletes that have made it to the top of their game. They compete like hell on the pitch, ice rink or basketball court but afterwards, they are trading jerseys or shaking hands in a sign of mutual respect.<br /><br />Our industry appreciates the courage it takes to compete. In his Man in the Arena speech, US President Teddy Roosevelt aptly described the character of the risktaker. Roosevelt, who prided himself on being a cowboy and rough rider, despised those who stood on the sidelines to criticize without ever entering the battlefield.<br /><br />Rather, he saved his admiration for those who dared to take risks and compete, even if they came up short. These are the builders, creators, and achievers of our society.<br /><br />Roosevelt could have been describing the founders of our industry or our current exchange leaders or even our startup companies.<br /><br />Our industry respects those true competitors who enter the arena for a worthy cause, whether they succeed or fail.<br /><br />That&rsquo;s why I love the resilient people of this industry. They enter the arena without hesitating.<br /><br />Now, there are many reasons to be optimistic about our business. Last year the listed derivatives markets</span><span>&nbsp;<a href="https://email.fia.org/c/125JFGMt9B6TyeIkyHtTz9YIKSYpLs">traded over 130 billion contracts globally</a></span><span>&mdash;the first time crossing the 100 billion contract mark. That is a 64 percent increase over last year and the sixth consecutive record year of global volume.<br /><br />We are also seeing innovative new products like micro contracts and zero-day options helping to drive this growth. This new growth comes with a resurgence of traditional asset classes like rates and energy as well as developing regions like India, Brazil, and Dubai. Our story is one of diversified growth.<br /><br />Another exciting opportunity is the US Treasury Market, which is valued at $27 trillion today and is expected to grow to $45 trillion in just ten years.<br /><br />If you close your eyes and I told you that a Washington regulatory agency was mandating a trillion-dollar market to clear, you might think it was 2009, not 2024.<br /><br />In a d&eacute;j&agrave; vu moment, SEC Chair Gary Gensler is repeating his OTC playbook from Dodd-Frank but this time his target is the US treasury market.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />But Walt, that&rsquo;s cash treasuries, not futures or swaps. Why should we care?<br /><br />Because this mandate will force treasuries and repos into a client clearing model similar to the futures markets. And guess what? We know a little something about how that model works and operates.<br /><br />And by the way, DTCC estimates that the treasury and repo mandate could bring as much as $1.6 trillion dollars into clearing daily. Yes, 1.6 trillion daily!<br /><br />And once the cash treasury market begins to clear, related products like cleared treasury futures and interest rate swaps can be portfolio-margined or cross-margined together. This will release significant amounts of trapped liquidity and regulatory capital back into the marketplace and economy.<br /><br />Now that&rsquo;s exciting and that&rsquo;s why we should care.<br /><br />Now, with all this potential growth, we must ask ourselves: Are we ready?<br /><br />Is there capacity in our markets to take on these new opportunities? Is our infrastructure sound?&nbsp;<br /><br />Are we prepared for the products and markets of the future?<br /><br />If we are being honest, the answer is unclear. Sure, our ecosystem works well today but are we prepared for the promise of growth ahead? Have we future-proofed as an industry?<br /><br />Just as our DNA causes us to boldly enter the arena, we equally stand ready to roll up our sleeves as a community to solve problems together. The people of our industry are always eager to take off their competitive hats for a common cause.<br /><br />We have seen this time and time again over the years. And this year is no exception.<br /><br />In fact, the past year we have witnessed members of our industry stepping up to help modernize our infrastructure, defend the principles of open markets, or fight against wrong-headed policies.<br /><br />I am proud to be associated with such people.<br /><br />To recognize those individuals in our membership that have demonstrated such exceptional leadership, FIA created its President&rsquo;s Award that highlights their efforts for the greater good of the markets.</span><br /><br /><span><a href="https://email.fia.org/c/125JFHg7JEZAWBrX0chzEjXKbHhdyl">This year&rsquo;s recipients include</a>:</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Natalia Da Gama of Santander CIB for her outstanding work on EU clearing</li>
<li>Helen Gordon of JP Morgan for her advocacy on Basel capital reforms</li>
<li>Martin Kalnins of Nasdaq for his solutions-driven efforts on European reporting</li>
<li>Julian O&rsquo;Leary of GH Financial for his consensus-building work around cyber resilience</li>
<li>Lou Rosato of BlackRock for his vocal leadership in support of standards and DMIST</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I invite those recipients in attendance to stand. Please join me in congratulating these individuals who have worked so hard to improve our markets.<br /><br />Today, more than ever, we need individuals like these to help us lay the foundations for the growth and change to come.&nbsp;<br /><br />The good news is that we have already begun this journey to build a better ecosystem. Every gardener knows that the key to a successful garden is cultivating the right balance of conditions for plants to grow.<br /><br />Our industry is no different. There are some fundamental conditions that have allowed our markets to flourish over time. It doesn't just happen by chance.<br /><br />Healthy markets need the rule of law to make them predictable and orderly. You also need smart regulations that are fit for purpose to stop bad actors and encourage competition.<br /><br />You need strong risk management and adequate capital to protect the markets from contagion. You need market infrastructure that is safe, accessible, and resilient for the inevitable volatility ahead.<br /><br />Like a gardener, FIA works with its members to get the right balance of these conditions. We nurture an ecosystem that allows our markets to innovate and thrive.<br /><br />And if we get these conditions right, we will be better prepared for the inevitable change ahead.<br /><br />To this end, FIA is doubling down on our commitment to DMIST, the industry&rsquo;s standards body for the futures and options markets. Last year, DMIST adopted&nbsp;its first standard for the timing of allocations and give-ups.<br /><br />This year,&nbsp;</span><span><a href="https://email.fia.org/c/125JFHJMjISikYbzrH5fJtWLCvA1le">DMIST</a>&nbsp;</span><span>is adding more members, more resources and developing a long-term roadmap that provides a plan for simplifying our workflows. This forum aims to make the operations of our marketplace more resilient, more efficient, and more competitive.<br /><br />FIA is also working hard to ensure that the incentives to hedge in our markets are properly aligned, especially when it comes to bank capital. US bank regulators have proposed new capital reforms that would increase the amount of capital for cleared derivatives by 80 percent.<br /><br />This is the main reason that these capital proposals were listed as the top concern of our industry by the recent&nbsp;</span><span><a href="https://email.fia.org/c/125JFIdqTMKZJkVbTbSVODVN3jSP87">FIA-Coalition Greenwich survey</a></span><span>.<br /><br />These capital proposals, which fail to properly recognize the risk-reducing nature of clearing, could lead to fewer end users in our markets, less capacity in the system, and more concentration among clearing firms.<br /><br />Our industry stands united in our opposition, and FIA will continue to advocate for a more risk-based approach to capital that recognizes the important public benefit of clearing.<br /><br />Another area of great promise for modernizing our infrastructure is tokenization. For years, our markets have been talking about blockchain but without a sense of its practical application.<br /><br />Today, that vision is becoming clearer. Our industry is beginning to explore ways to use tokenized collateral as a faster and safer way of moving margin and settling trades.<br /><br />In our markets, time is risk. The longer a trade goes unsettled, the more likely a default can disrupt our markets. If we can quicken the movement of collateral, settlement risk is reduced significantly.<br /><br />The tokenization of collateral could have immediate benefits for our markets such as allowing settlement on public holidays when banks or markets are closed.<br /><br />Looking into the future, tokenization would also enable around-the-clock settlement as our markets move to 24/7 operations.<br /><br />These are early days of these discussions, but the promise is exciting and worth our cultivation in the coming months. &nbsp;I challenge our industry to advance this work in the coming year.<br /><br />As we raise the starting gun of Boca, we are reminded of the great promise of our industry&rsquo;s future and the importance of modernizing our infrastructure to support it. &nbsp;<br /><br />And if we get it right, we will create an environment that allows a new generation of risktakers to enter the arena without hesitation to compete, innovate and create.<br /><br />If we succeed, we are building the foundations for the next fifty Bocas.<br /><br />In kicking off the program, I want to humbly thank all of you for allowing FIA to represent this industry. We are truly grateful to be stewards of this amazing community.<br /><br />I also want to express my appreciation to our incredible sponsors and exhibitors for all they do to make Boca a reality. You allow the magic to occur, and we appreciate it. Please join me in a round of applause for these outstanding companies.<br /><br />I also want to thank the many participants in our program,</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>CFTC Chair Russ Behnam,</li>
<li>Citadel founder and CEO Ken Griffin,</li>
<li>The ever-popular exchange leaders,</li>
<li>American Petroleum Institute CEO Mike Summers at tomorrow&rsquo;s ICE Energy Breakfast,</li>
<li>Bestselling author and energy historian Daniel Yergin at the DTCC lunch.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This year&rsquo;s program is one of our best.<br /><br />I also hope you take a moment to give back to those in need and donate to our industry charity&mdash;Futures for Kids.&nbsp;You can play in our Charity Golf Event, buy a raffle ticket, or donate to the Rama Kilt Challenge. All these efforts raise funds for charities helping disadvantaged youth.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Lastly, I want to highlight the</span><span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://email.fia.org/c/125JFIH5tQDH7HEOkGGBTNUOu8bCV0">Futures Industry Hall of Fame</a><span>&nbsp;</span><span>ceremony that takes place tomorrow afternoon here in the Grand Ballroom. Come celebrate the many achievements of these 12 individuals from our industry as we raise a glass on their behalf.<br /><br />Thank you all, again, for being here, at this arena we call Boca, and with that, let the games begin!</span></p>

<title>SIFMA Statement On The DOL Fiduciary Rule</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sifma-statement-on-the-dol-fiduciary-rule/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sifma-statement-on-the-dol-fiduciary-rule/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> DOL, fiduciary rule, rushed, stakeholders, investor protection
Summary:<br />
- DOL rushed final fiduciary rule
- Process lacked stakeholder input and cost-benefit analysis
- Result will limit investor access to advice
- Hasty approach indicates lack of legal error rectification
- Policy outcome pre-baked and politically driven<br />Summary: <div>
<p>SIFMA today issued the following statement from president and CEO Kenneth E. Bentsen, Jr. regarding developments related to the Department of Labor (DOL) fiduciary rule:</p>
<p>&ldquo;On Friday, the Department of Labor sent the final version of its latest fiduciary rule to the Office of Management and Budget, the last stage of the regulatory process before the publication of a final rule, only two months after the close of the comment period on the proposal.&nbsp; The fact that the Department rushed the comment period and now is rushing a final rule makes clear the process was never designed to obtain and thoughtfully consider input from stakeholders or conduct robust cost-benefit analysis.&nbsp; Even with its flawed and subsequently vacated 2015 rule proposal, the Department spent nearly a year reviewing comments and talking to stakeholders.&nbsp; In this instance, it is obvious the outcome of this rulemaking was pre-baked and politically driven. Unfortunately, such a hasty approach will result in policy that does not ensure consistent investor protection and will limit investors&rsquo; access to advice and education and their ability to choose how they receive that advice and education.&nbsp; The Department&rsquo;s haste also indicates it is not making the changes needed to rectify legal errors in the proposal, which was in clear conflict with the 2018 court decision striking down the Department&rsquo;s last fiduciary rule.&rdquo;</p>

These early efforts led ultimately to the founding of what is today known as the SIFMA Compliance &amp; Legal Society, and Al Rauschman served as its first president.</p>

<div> cover pool, covered bonds, loan-to-value ratio, residential properties, Finansinspektionen
Summary:<br />Finansinspektionen considers cover pool for pre-8 July 2022 covered bonds to include loans against residential properties with 80% LTV ratio. No transitional provisions exist.<br /><br /> <div>
<p><span>In this legal position, Finansinspektionen considers the matter of whether the cover pool for covered bonds issued prior to 8 July 2022 may consist of loans granted against collateral in residential properties to the extent that the credit in relation to the collateral lies within the loan-to-value ratio of 80 per cent.</span></p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The cover pool for covered bonds may consist of loans granted against collateral in residential properties to the extent that the loans in relation to the collateral are within a loan-to-value ratio of 80 per cent even if the cover pool is linked to covered bonds issued prior to 8 July 2022.</p>
<h2>Question</h2>
<p>In this position, Finansinspektionen discusses the matter of whether the cover pool for covered bonds issued prior to 8 July 2022 may consist of loans granted against collateral in residential properties to the extent the loan in relation to the collateral is within a loan-to-value ratio of 80 per cent.</p>
<h2>Governing law</h2>
<p>Chapter 3, section 3 of the Covered Bonds (Issuance) Act (2003:1223) and Article 129(1)(d) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and amending Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 (CRR), states that a loan granted against collateral in one or several residential properties may be included in the cover pool to the extent that the loan in relation to the collateral is within a loan-to-value ratio of 80 per cent.</p>
<p>On 8 July 2022, some amendments to the Covered Bonds (Issuance) Act went into force (see the Amendment [2022:803] to the Covered Bonds (Issuance) Act [2003:1223]). The amendments entail in part an increase to the highest loan-to-value ratio allowed for loans granted with collateral in residential properties that are included in the cover pool. The highest allowable loan-to-value ratio was raised from 75 to 80 per cent.</p>
<p>There are no transitional provisions regulating what the highest allowable loan-to-value ratio should be for loans included in a cover pool to which there are links to covered bonds issued prior to 8 July 2022.</p>
<p>One question that has arisen is whether, in this case, it is possible to allow a highest loan-to-value ratio of 80 per cent for all loans in the common cover pool.</p>
<p>In the preparatory works for the amendments to the Covered Bonds (Issuance) Act (Bill 2021/22:76 p. 87f.), the Government states that the underlying EU Directive does not specify how the regulation should be applied in a situation where older and new bonds are secured by a single cover pool. The Government takes the position that it is necessary that there are prerequisites to apply such an issuance in order not to disrupt existing, well-functioning markets like the Swedish market. The Government defers to the practical application of the law to settle the matter.</p>
<h2>Assessment</h2>
<p>Finansinspektionen notes that the legislator, since 8 July 2022, allows a higher loan-to-value ratio than before for credits collateralised by residential properties that are included in the cover pool for covered bonds. Special transitional provisions have not been implemented that preserve the previous &ndash; and more stringent &ndash; requirements on loans included in the cover pool if the loans secure bonds issued prior to 8 July 2022.</p>
<p>The alternative to allowing older and new covered bonds linked to the same cover pool, where loans granted against collateral in residential properties may be included up to a loan-to-value ratio of at the most 80 percent, is to require separate cover pools depending on whether a loan-to-value ratio of a maximum of 75 or 80 per cent is used.</p>
<p>Finansinspektionen makes the assessment that the cover pool for covered bonds issued prior to 8 July 2022 may consist of loans granted against collateral in residential properties to the extent the loan in relation to the collateral is within a loan-to-value ratio of 80 per cent. For this assessment, the authority has considered the statements in the preparatory work referred to above and given special consideration to such a position not giving rise to any risks or impacts that must be considered.</p>
<p>This legal position is applicable until further notice.</p>

Summary:<br />FSOC and Brookings will host a conference on AI and financial stability, exploring risks and oversight, aiming to balance innovation and mitigation. <div>
<p>The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) in partnership with the Brookings Institution, will host a two-day conference on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Financial Stability. AI in financial services has grown rapidly. Innovations in AI can offer many benefits, such as reducing costs and improving efficiencies, but they can also introduce or exacerbate risks to the financial system. This conference will be an opportunity for the public and private sectors to convene to discuss potential systemic risks posed by AI in financial services, to explore the balance between encouraging innovation and mitigating risks, and to share insights on effective oversight of AI-related risks to financial stability.</p>
<p>The first day of the conference will be held at the U.S. Department of the Treasury on June 6, 2024, and the second day of the conference will be held at the Brookings Institution on June 7, 2024. A live webcast of the conference will be available to the public.&nbsp;<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-markets-financial-institutions-and-fiscal-service/financial-stability-oversight-council/2024-conference-on-artificial-intelligence-financial-stability">More details can be found on the Treasury website here</a>.</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Updates Position On Cryptoasset Exchange Traded Notes For Professional Investors</title>

<div> Exchanges, cETNs, FCA, professional investors, cryptoassets<br />
Summary:<br />
FCA approves UK listed market segment for cETNs for professional investors. Exchanges must ensure proper controls and safeguards.<br /><br /> <div>
<p>The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) will not object to requests from Recognised Investment Exchanges (RIEs) to create a UK listed market segment for cryptoasset-backed Exchange Traded Notes (cETNs). These products would be available for professional investors, such as investment firms and credit institutions authorised or regulated to operate in financial markets only.</p>
<div class="dombanner"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="container">
<p>Exchanges will need to continue to make sure sufficient controls are in place, so trading is orderly and proper protection is afforded to professional investors. cETNs must meet all the requirements of the UK Listing Regime, for example on prospectuses and on-going disclosure.</p>
<p>With increased insight and data due to a longer period of trading history, the FCA believes exchanges and professional investors should now be able to better establish whether cETNs meet their risk appetite.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
The FCA continues to believe cETNs and crypto derivatives are ill-suited for retail consumers due to the harm they pose. As a result, the ban on the sale of cETNs (and crypto derivatives) to retail consumers remains in place.&nbsp;
<p>The FCA continues to remind people that cryptoassets are high risk and largely unregulated. Those who invest should be prepared to lose all their money.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FCA is collaborating with government, international partners and industry to develop the UK&rsquo;s cryptoasset regulatory regime and lead international standards in this space.</p>
<h3>Further information</h3>
<ol start="1">
<li> If an RIE creates a new UK listed market segment, the FCA will consider applications on a case-by-case basis for listing cETNs on&nbsp;<a href="https://marketsecurities.fca.org.uk/officiallist" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">the Official List.</a>&nbsp; </li>
</ol><ol start="2">
<li> We will review applications for cETNs to be listed on the UK RIEs for professional only market segments. It is for the RIEs to put the professional only market segments in place.&nbsp; </li>
</ol><ol start="3">
<li> The FCA will assess applications for listing where there is a regulated market for the cETN based on the criteria set out in the Listing Rules. As per RIE&nbsp;<a href="https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/REC.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Recognition Requirements 2.6.1</a>, UK trading venues must make sure sufficient controls are in place to ensure trading is conducted in an orderly manner and to afford proper protection to investors.&nbsp; </li>
</ol><ol start="4">
<li> Exchanges must have the appropriate safeguards in place to ensure that the market segment is accessible to professional investors only. Exchanges must also make sure that they fully understand the nature of the risks of admitting crypto-linked instruments to trading and are satisfied that their admission to trading criteria and trading controls will adequately mitigate those risks.&nbsp; </li>

They can also be referred to as 'professional clients'.&nbsp; </li>
</ol><ol start="6">
<li> In January 2020, the FCA introduced a ban on UK firms offering or selling crypto derivatives and ETNs that reference certain types of cryptoassets to UK retail consumers. This remains in place as part of the FCA&rsquo;s conduct of business sourcebook (COBS)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/COBS/22/6.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">rules</a>&nbsp;and would apply to any cETNs that are admitted to trading.&nbsp; </li>
</ol><ol start="7">
<li> <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/policy/ps20-10.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">This prohibition advances our objective of ensuring an appropriate degree of protection for consumers and supports our objective of protecting and enhancing the integrity of the UK financial system</a>. </li>
</ol><ol start="8">
<li> The FCA has previously communicated that it would continue to keep its position on cETNs under review, noting the concerns outlined in the&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/752070/cryptoassets_taskforce_final_report_final_web.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">CATF report<span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;in line with our legal obligations.&nbsp; </li>
</ol><ol start="9">
<li> The FCA continues to work with government to develop the UK&rsquo;s approach to regulating cryptoassets.

<div> regulatory requirements, funding costs, liquidity challenges, margin analytics, collateral allocation
Summary:<br />Cassini addresses liquidity challenges with margin analytics, collateral allocation, and stress testing, meeting financial institutions' multifaceted needs. Recognized for global contributions. <div>
<p>The evolving macro-economic landscape, new regulatory requirements and ongoing geo-political tensions have resulted in higher margin calls that increase funding costs, introduce new liquidity challenges, and impact returns.</p>
<p>In the APAC region, regulators have taken decisive action to address concerns around collateral and liquidity risks by mandating SFC Type 11 and SPS 530. These changes have accelerated the need for money managers to embrace new front-to-back operating models built on collateral resilience as the key objective.</p>
<p>Cassini has distinguished itself as the leading technology provider solving liquidity risk challenges across the capital structure. Through its comprehensive suite of margin and collateral optimization and stress testing analytics,<strong>&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://click.icptrack.com/icp/relay.php?r=59597334&amp;msgid=623278&amp;act=FNP7&amp;c=783105&amp;pid=4487872&amp;destination=https%3A%2F%2Fcassini.com%3Futm_source%3DPress%2Brelease%2B-%2BRegtech%2BAward%26utm_medium%3DPress%2Brelease%2B%26utm_campaign%3DPress%2Brelease%2Bbacklinks%2B-%2B%2B-%2BRegtech%2BAward%26utm_id%3DPress%2Brelease%2Bbacklinks&amp;cf=3638&amp;v=aa03761d542bb315328a4af7248697ed9ccbc3b63f63a618043d4adb917092fc" target="_blank">Cassini</a>&nbsp;provides customers and partners with tools designed to minimize margin requirements and maximize HQLA by calculating the true cost of funding ahead of execution.</p>
<p><strong>Liam Huxley, Founder and CEO of Cassini reflects on the company's trajectory:</strong>&nbsp;"The past year has seen a significant surge in demand for our collateral optimization services. A confluence of factors &ndash; from volatility and rising interest rates to regulatory pressures &ndash; has compelled firms to seek out efficiencies in liquidity management. It's gratifying to see our approach, which melds intelligence with innovation, receive global acknowledgement. Our recent accolade, the 'Best Analytics Solution for Capital Requirements/Liquidity Risk' at the RegTech APAC Awards 2024, is a testament to our commitment and a signal of the industry's recognition of our contributions."</p>
<p>Cassini's recognition stems from its holistic approach to liquidity management at an important time for managers looking to address organizational challenges resulting from new market dynamics.</p>
<p>The suite of solutions offered by Cassini is designed to meet the multifaceted needs of today's financial institutions:</p>

<div> Capital efficiency, operational efficiency, economic uncertainty, market volatility, regulatory reporting<br />
<br />
Summary: The report highlights the need for capital and operational efficiency, the impact of economic uncertainty and market volatility, and potential growth drivers. <br /><br /> <div>
<ul>
<li>Report authored by Coalition Greenwich       based on more than 200 responses to joint research study</li>
<li>Need for capital and operational       efficiency is top priority for respondents</li>
<li>Economic uncertainty and market       volatility key variable for trading volume over next five years</li>
<li>Regulatory reporting, allocations and       give-ups ranked as top pain points in trading operations</li>
<li>Standardization and tokenization seen as       potential game-changers for clearing workflow</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FIA today announces the release of a <strong><a href="https://email.fia.org/c/125HygtG4QZCd0KPBtRjgzKzoNlN4r">report </a></strong>authored       by Coalition Greenwich on how participants in the global listed and       cleared derivatives markets view current issues facing the industry as       well as the key trends shaping the industry's future.<br /> <br /> The 14-page report, Derivatives Market Structure 2024: Focusing on       Capital and Workflow Efficiency, provides a unique perspective into the       key drivers for the global clearing business. The report is based on       findings from research of market participants conducted jointly by FIA       and Coalition Greenwich, a provider of strategic benchmarking, analytics       and insights to the financial services industry. The study was conducted       in November and December 2023 and received responses from more than 200       people working at a wide range of firms, including brokers, clearing       firms, asset managers, hedge funds, exchanges, and technology vendors.<br /> <br /> The findings highlight a common theme across the responses &ndash; the urgent       need for greater capital and operational efficiency. The impact of       capital requirements is viewed as the single greatest issue facing the       industry, and many respondents flagged the need for margin and collateral       optimization as a top priority for their organizations. Regarding       operational efficiency, respondents pointed to regulatory reporting and       allocations/give-ups as the most urgent pain points in trading and       clearing processes. They said that standardization of operational       processes and tokenization in collateral management have the greatest       potential to be "game changers" for the trading and clearing       workflow.<br /> <br /> The report also identifies several potential sources for growth in       trading activity, a key metric for the health of the list and cleared       derivatives markets. Research participants generally agreed that       macro-economic uncertainty and financial market volatility had the       greatest potential to stimulate more trading of derivatives over the next       five years. On the other hand, the findings revealed differences within       the industry on other potential drivers. Intermediaries such as clearing       firms see relatively high potential in the rapidly growing futures and       options markets in China and India. In contrast, two other industry       segments &ndash; market operators such as exchanges and end-users such as asset       managers &ndash; see relatively more potential from continued growth of retail       participation.<br /> <br /> The report is being released in conjunction with FIA's annual <strong><a href="https://email.fia.org/c/125HygXkEUSjBnus2YEZlJJAPBEARk">International       Futures Industry Conference</a></strong> in Boca Raton,       Fla. The conference brings together some 1,200 senior executives, thought       leaders and government officials from more than 20 countries around the       world to discuss current trends in the global listed and cleared       derivatives industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <br /> The research findings are based on responses from 210 individuals,       including: 87 professionals working at clearing firms, brokers, swap       dealers, and other intermediaries; 50 working at asset managers, hedge       funds and other end users; and 30 working at exchanges, clearinghouses       and other market infrastructure operators. The majority are focused on       exchange-traded derivatives, but many are involved with cleared OTC       derivatives such as interest-rate swaps. Half are based in North America,       the other half split between Europe and Asia-Pacific. Questions explored       the key drivers of change in the derivatives market, strategic       priorities, challenges in today&rsquo;s market, and how firms will respond to       regulation</p>

<div> launch, MSCI, futures, ICE, TRF <br />
Summary:<br />
Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. launches MSCI Index Total Return Futures (TRFs). Offer exposure to MSCI flagship indices, using U.S. funding rate SOFR. Contracts available to trade through 2033. ICE MSCI futures traded over 53 million contracts in 2023. Goldman Sachs and MSCI express support for the new product. <div>
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE: ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, and home to the most liquid markets for trading MSCI<span>&reg;&nbsp;</span>futures, today announced the launch of MSCI<span>&reg;</span>&nbsp;Index Total Return Futures (TRFs).</p>
<p>ICE&rsquo;s MSCI<span>&reg;</span>&nbsp;TRFs offer investors a way to gain exposure to MSCI&rsquo;s flagship indices: MSCI EAFE Index, MSCI Emerging Markets Index, MSCI USA Index and MSCI World Index. The TRF contracts serve as an exchange listed alternative to over-the-counter total return swaps that seek to replicate the performance of MSCI&rsquo;s indices in a more capital-efficient and transparent way.</p>
<p>The contracts use the underlying U.S. funding rate SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) which measures the cost of overnight cash borrowing. Contracts are available to trade out the curve to 2033, with quarterly and yearly expiries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;ICE&rsquo;s markets account for over 70% of global MSCI futures trading by volume, making ICE the natural home for customers to trade MSCI Total Return Futures alongside our deeply liquid suite of MSCI Futures,&rdquo; said Caterina Caramaschi, Vice President, Financial Derivatives at ICE. &ldquo;We have worked directly with the market to design the TRF contracts, which allow clients to benefit from trading in a U.S. time zone, against the closing MSCI index level and report the trade on the same day, utilizing the truly global nature of ICE&rsquo;s equity derivatives offering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>ICE offers the most liquid futures on MSCI EAFE, MSCI Emerging Markets, MSCI ESG and MSCI Climate indices, providing participants around the world with a set of tools to manage equity risk. In 2023, the average daily volume for ICE&rsquo;s MSCI complex was approximately 214,000 contracts, equal to an estimated $14 billion of notional value. ICE MSCI futures traded over 53 million contracts in 2023.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goldman Sachs is excited about the launch of ICE MSCI Index TRFs. We expect it to be an excellent product for clients seeking a cost-effective solution to access a range of flagship MSCI indices,&rdquo; said Daria Sentuc, Managing Director, Emerging Markets Global Synthetics at Goldman Sachs. &ldquo;As a long-established provider of liquidity across the MSCI complex, we look forward to supporting growth in this new product.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re pleased to license ICE as they expand their TRF segment to include MSCI indices,&rdquo; said George Harrington, Managing Director, Global Head of Fixed Income and Derivatives at MSCI. &ldquo;This reflects the increasing demand for new products linked to MSCI&rsquo;s global benchmarks.&rdquo;</p>

<div> AI, predictive model, machine learning, live data, trading strategies <br />
Summary: CQG developed an AI predictive model using machine learning, achieving 80% accuracy in live trading, aiming to provide new tools for traders. <br /><br /> <div>
<p><a href="http://email.prnewswire.com/ls/click?upn=u001.v9xoTZaCB3KDvUFxTt6K9ITfJcLtx-2FOvmuVizoBK57Bvb6-2BRjv4Pio6tS6m3-2FaJvZpCGPWXhRHvW2u4LmLTkTBVBCD9JsMlrfy19nD-2BTbVvi3mcSC2-2FdoRKfLbjq0iUOXFv2RBzuhQ3djnrj3uCr2Q-3D-3DbPxU_pIbxPfpDI69aAybPrpOfg1n6CWmKMnb3conIyNKCYgr-2BTRqxLAwMRExIXLpGb5DJkTU9AMaqQ5VbygY-2Bx4y0T1y8IQPwcUjtpeIoI1oRWL1bzFD3QQbypFkdjUqahZ2tFrYuL8sJ1eUvP6rXS6S0FJRGu4H-2BU1q2EHRYvhqD2HPsQI5OPJAcfhVqruP3V16aX9Ir4SCRHCSuLJzPqFo-2FPXM8eLnvX-2F3-2Fatm4HKvxbR6goWhnjNOQRUcAkOotZ1X3X2qkUT8obIkIqmDkLHQ68pztoPAUTzLVs-2Fb4s6wXzwSEMZQg2gJq5w2dLFacN-2FPp3pz76cqZCIDqnYddIKr6UVMTOg6D-2B8ETmUTg314vPkfJlLHagmwOY9shvKToEfmm" target="_blank">CQG</a>, a leading global provider of high-performance technology solutions for market makers, traders, brokers, commercial hedgers and exchanges, today announced completion of internal testing and proof-of-concept using live data on what the firm believes to be a first-of-its kind artificial intelligence (AI) predictive model for traders. Following extensive machine learning (ML) training in a back-testing environment, the firm just started applying the technology to live data, with an extremely high level of predictive success in anticipating futures market moves. CQG made the announcement on the first full day of FIA Boca, the International Futures Industry Conference.</p>
<div dir="ltr" id="dvprnejpgb5b6left"><img align="middle" alt=" " id="prnejpgb5b6left" title=" " /></div>
<p>Based on the firm's deep experience in analytics, mathematics and market intelligence, the new ML initiative aims to offer retail traders and buy-side firms, including proprietary trading firms and hedge funds, unprecedented tools for identifying new trading and analytics opportunities, guiding trading strategies, and managing their positions. CQG has been exploring the field of AI for the past year in the context of solving for its clients' challenges, testing the technology in a state-of-the-art multi-platform lab. Last week, for the first time, the company tested its next-generation machine learning toolkit in a live trading environment and achieved 80% predictive accuracy &ndash; matching the results attained in the back-testing environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CQG CEO Ryan Moroney said: "In early 2023, we decided we wanted to do something different in machine learning and AI that leveraged our unique position in the market, building off our comprehensive database of historical trade data and analytics in a way that could help our clients and prospects analyze, predict and trade markets through a new lens. We built a lab, and Kevin Darby &ndash; our Vice President of Execution Technologies &ndash; has done an extraordinary job of turning that effort into an exciting reality with results that have significantly surpassed our expectations."</p>
<p>Darby said: "We first had to solve multiple real-world challenges, such as storing and curating terabytes of historical market data while retaining the ability to make decisions in microseconds in real-time environments. We built bridges between the current ML infrastructure, based on the Python language, and the reliance of the financial industry infrastructure on C++. We also needed to recast the traditional ML training pipeline to optimize for generative time series prediction to estimate conditional probability distributions in a mathematically satisfying and stable way."</p>
<p>He said the firm's AI in a live environment was consistently able to predict with 80% accuracy whether the next movement in the E-mini S&amp;P 500 futures contract would be up, down or unchanged.</p>
<p>Moroney said CQG has already identified multiple uses related to algorithms (algos), charting and research and is starting to explore other applications with key partners.</p>
<p>He said: "What we've built is portable. We can give a firm a set of encrypted files, and they can see how our technology predicts moves in liquid futures contracts with a high rate of accuracy. They will be able to use our ML lab, apply cloud computing resources and create their own models, either leveraging our models as foundational or making their own from scratch using our historical data and ML toolkit. They can then use CQG for charting and trading with those models. We have extremely smart, creative clients. This is a truly innovative breakthrough, and we're looking forward to collaborating with them on the potential uses we haven't even considered yet."</p>
<p>Moroney said: "For the past 40 years CQG has built sophisticated, intuitive tools for customers to better visualize and analyze market data to make smarter trading decisions. We view our new ML offering as the next breakthrough for mission-critical trading tools delivered by CQG."</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Fines Financial Advice Firm And Bans Arthur Cobill And William Hofstetter For British Steel Pension Scheme Advice And Oversight Failings</title>

<div> FCA, Inspirational Financial Management Ltd, pension transfer, unsuitable advice, financial penalty
Summary:<br />IFM fined £897,840 for unsuitable pension transfer advice, banned advisers from pension advising, and agreed to contribute to compensation.<br /> <div>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA has fined Inspirational Financial Management Ltd (IFM), which is in administration, &pound;897,840.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p><span>IFM poorly advised people to transfer out of defined benefit (DB) pension schemes, including the British Steel Pension Scheme (BSPS).</span></p>
<p><span>Arthur Cobill, an adviser at IFM, and William Hofstetter, one of its directors, have been banned by the FCA from advising customers on pension transfers and pension opt outs. Mr Hofstetter has also been banned from holding any senior management function at any regulated firm.</span></p>
<p><span>Mr Cobill and Mr Hofstetter agreed to pay &pound;120,000 and &pound;40,000, respectively, to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) to contribute to compensation for IFM&rsquo;s customers.</span></p>
<p><span>Between 8 June 2015 and 22 December 2017, IFM provided unsuitable pension transfer advice and failed to properly consider whether it would be in customers&rsquo; best interests to transfer out of their secure DB pensions. The firm operated a contingent charging model, only collecting fees if customers transferred out of their DB pension schemes following the firm&rsquo;s advice. While this approach benefited IFM, Mr Hofstetter and Mr Cobill, it risked the long-term financial health and interests of their customers. A review by the FCA found that 83% of IFM&rsquo;s pension transfer advice failed to comply with its minimum required standards, and customers risked financial loss as a result of the poor advice they received.</span></p>
<p><span>Out of 307 IFM customers advised to transfer out of their DB pension scheme, 261 completed the process. Mr Cobill advised 245 of those, including 198 members of the BSPS. In total, the BSPS members advised by Mr Cobill had pension benefits worth over &pound;90 million.</span></p>
<p><span>Mr Hofstetter was responsible for the compliance oversight of IFM&rsquo;s process for pension transfer advice.</span></p>
<p><span>Customers transferring out of the BSPS were already in a vulnerable position due to the uncertainty surrounding the future of their pension scheme, so it was critical that they received good advice.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Therese Chambers, Joint Executive Director of Enforcement &amp; Market Oversight, said:</span></span></p>
<p><span>&lsquo;Pensions are the safety net people spend their lives building. For many customers, their DB pension was their most valuable asset, and it was their only retirement provision other than their state pension.</span></p>
<p><span>&lsquo;As experienced advisers, Mr Cobill and Mr Hofstetter, and IFM should have known better than to unravel this.</span></p>
<p><span>&lsquo;It is only right that Mr Cobill and Mr Hofstetter contribute towards compensating those affected.&rsquo;&nbsp;</span></p>

The FCA recognises that there may be a significant liability for redress for IFM&rsquo;s customers which will likely fall to the FSCS. In these circumstances, the FCA has agreed with Mr Cobill and Mr Hofstetter that in lieu of the imposition of a financial penalty, they will pay &pound;120,000 and &pound;40,000, respectively, to the FSCS to contribute towards any redress due to IFM&rsquo;s customers.

<title>SET Market Report For February 2024</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/set-market-report-for-february-2024/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/set-market-report-for-february-2024/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> February, SET Index, foreign investors, dividend yield, Futures Exchange
Summary: 
- SET Index rose, foreign funds returned
- Dividend yield exceeded Asian average
- New companies listed
- TFEX trading volume decreased
- Thai stock market remained attractive
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>Even though investors in February lowered their expectations for the Federal Reserve (Fed)&rsquo;s policy rate cut to only three times this year, the overall risk assets rallied as seen by Bitcoin and the US stocks hit records, commodities prices such as oil and gold climbed.</p>
<p><b>Senior Executive Vice President of The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) Soraphol Tulayasathien</b> said that foreign funds flew back to the Thai stock market in February, in line with other regional markets. However, the National Economic and Social Development Council&rsquo;s economic growth forecast downgrade to 2.2-3.2 percent for 2024 hindered the stock market prospects. Other tailwinds included export growth buoyed by the world&rsquo;s trade rebound and solid consumption growth on the back of the continuous recovery of tourism sector. These encouraged analysts to start raising profit forecasts of companies engaged in relevant businesses and securities prices of these industry groups started to bounce back. However, analysts recommended investors to pour money into high dividend stocks for passive income amid the local and global uncertainties. Moreover, returns of these high dividend-paying stocks continuously outpaced SET Index, while they are considered as defensive stocks with lower beta than the market average.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Key highlights for February</b><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<ul>
<li>At the end of February 2024, SET Index rose by 0.5 percent from the previous month to close at 1,370.67 points, moving in line with the regional peers. However, the benchmark dropped 3.2 percent from the end of 2023.</li>
<li>In February, industry groups that outperformed SET Index when compared with the end of 2023 were Consumer Products, Services, Agro &amp; Food Industry, and Resources.</li>
<li>SET&rsquo;s and Market for Alternative Investment (mai)&rsquo;s average daily trading value in February 2024 dropped 29.5 percent from a year earlier to THB 47.27 billion (approx. USD 1.32 billion). Both markets&rsquo; trading value averaged THB 47.19 billion a day for the January-to-February period. Foreign investors were net buyers of THB 3.25 billion in February while they sold a net THB 27.62 billion for the first two months of this year. Their trading ratio was higher than any other types of investors for 22 consecutive months. </li>
<li>In February, there were two newly listed companies on SET: NL Development pcl (NL) and Thai Credit Bank pcl (CREDIT), and three newly listed companies on mai: PanelesMatic Solutions pcl (PANEL), NAT Absolute Technologies pcl (NAT) and Euro Creations pcl (EURO). </li>
<li>The Thai stock exchange&rsquo;s forward P/E ratio at the end of February 2024 was 14.3 times, above the Asian stock market&rsquo;s average of 12.9 times. The historical P/E ratio stood at 16.3 times, exceeding the Asian stock market&rsquo;s average of 15.3 times. </li>
<li>Dividend yield ratio at the end of February 2024 was 3.31 percent, surpassing the Asian stock market&rsquo;s average of 3.19 percent.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Derivatives Market</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Thailand Futures Exchange (TFEX)&rsquo;s daily trading volume in February 2024 averaged 393,850 contracts, down 2.6 percent from the previous month largely due to the lower trading volume of SET50 Index Futures. For the first two months of 2024. TFEX&rsquo;s daily trading volume fell 25.6 percent from a year before to 399,395 contracts mainly due to the decline in trading volume of SET50 Index Futures and Single Stock Futures.</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Nigerian Exchange Group (NGX) and its subsidiaries joined the rest of the world on Friday, March 8, 2024, to commemorate the International Women&rsquo;s Day (IWD) by leveraging its Closing Gong Ceremony to &ldquo;Ring the Bell for Gender Equality&rdquo;. With the theme, &ldquo;Invest in Women: Accelerate Progress&rdquo;, the event focused on individual actions, conversations, behaviours and mindsets that will accelerate progress and impact on the advancement of women across all spheres of life.</p>
<p>The event, organized in partnership with the International Finance Corporation (IFC), UN Women, the United Nations Global Compact Network Nigeria (GCNN), Chartered Institute of Stockbrokers (CIS), Central Securities Clearing System (CSCS), the SterlingOne Foundation and Association of Securities Dealing Houses of Nigeria (ASHON) brought together prominent female leaders within the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Delivering her opening remarks, Dr Irene Robinson-Ayanwale, Divisional Head, Business Support Services Division, NGX welcomed all to the 10th Ring the Bell for Gender Equality. She said, &ldquo;When I learnt of this year&rsquo;s theme, &ldquo;Invest in Women: Accelerate Progress&rdquo;, it resonates deeply with us. It serves as a powerful reminder of the need to establish equal opportunities for everyone while fostering an enabling environment for women across all sectors. This initiative represents a significant step forward in our efforts to promote gender equality and support women&rsquo;s economic empowerment. Through innovative financial instruments such as gender bonds, we can mobilise capital towards projects that benefit women and advance gender equality across various sectors of the economy&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Dahlia Khalifa, Regional Director, Central Africa and Anglophone West Africa, IFC, who was represented by Alexandra Celestin, Regional Industry Manager, Financial Institutions Group, Anglophone West Africa and Central Africa, said &ldquo;This Ring the Bell for Gender Equality event highlights the importance of gender equality for economic development and growth. Economies that reduce barriers to women as leaders, employees, and entrepreneurs promote inclusive societies and pave the way for sustainable development. Collective, coordinated, and bold action by private sector leaders will be instrumental in accelerating progress towards gender parity and igniting greater resilience. IFC continues to collaborate with partners and stock exchanges like the Nigerian Exchange Group to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion in the private sector.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On her part, Mrs Elizabeth Ebi, Group Chief Executive Officer, Futureview Group said "The implications of a truly equal and balanced world; a world where men and women make equal contributions to the society, enjoy equal opportunities, and even enjoy the same rewards and benefits. Going by the growing body of evidence out there, it is safe to conclude that the multiplier effect on families, businesses, communities, economies and ultimately, nations would be indeed phenomenal.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The event served to raise awareness about the importance of investing in women, to inspire inclusive leadership and to advocate for gender responsive policies. By championing these principles, stakeholders can create empowering environments where every individual can thrive and contribute to collective success.</p>
<p>Bolanle Austen-Peters, Founder, Terra Academy for the Arts said, &ldquo;We use art to change the narrative about women. Our story telling in the past has mostly been done by foreigners which heavily skews the image of Nigerians and Nigerian women. Our focus is to tell the stories of female heroes, champions in history like Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti. These are the kind of women we celebrate today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the Closing Gong Ceremony, Mrs. Yemisi Ayeni, Chairperson, NASCON Allied Industries called for increased female representation in corporate organisations, equitable inclusion in workplace and more participation in the society, in line with the sustainable development goals.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The SME Governance Working Group<sup>1</sup> , chaired by the Securities Commission Malaysia (SC), today issued the draft Governance Code for Malaysian MSMEs for public consultation.</p>
<p>The development of the Code is aligned with the 12<sup>th</sup> Malaysia Plan and the National Entrepreneurship Policy 2030, which aims to improve transparency and integrity, and ensure a competitive business environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SC Chairman Dato&rsquo; Seri Dr Awang Adek Hussin stressed the importance of promoting good governance practices among MSMEs, which are an integral part of the Malaysian economy. MSMEs account for 97.4% of the country&rsquo;s business establishments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strengthening the resilience of MSMEs through a stronger governance foundation is critical to thrive in today&rsquo;s dynamic market.&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Adoption of the Code by MSMEs will be voluntary, with the Code complementing other existing guidance available for MSMEs including the Simplified ESG Disclosure Guide and the ESG Quick Guide for MSMEs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Code focuses specifically on governance practices, including those required to ensure clear accountability for decision making in relation to the management of sustainability risks and opportunities of a company. The governance practices in the Code are recommended based on the size and business maturity spectrum of MSMEs.</p>
<p>The Code also aligns with the principles of the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance (MCCG), which is aimed at listed companies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The implementation of the Code will be led by the Malaysian Institute of Corporate Governance (MICG) together with SME Corp. Malaysia and other relevant agencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interested parties and the public are invited to submit their comments on the draft Code at <a href="http://www.micg.org.my/msmecode">www.micg.org.my/msmecode</a><a href="http://www.micg.org.my/msmecode"> </a>before 30 April 2024. For any queries related to this consultation paper, please contact <span style="text-decoration: underline;">info@micg.org.my</span>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;

<title>SET Foundation And Partners Establish The First Integrated Model Province For Child Brain Development In Chiang Rai</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/set-foundation-and-partners-establish-the-first-integrated-model-province-for-ch/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/set-foundation-and-partners-establish-the-first-integrated-model-province-for-ch/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The SET Foundation, together with partner network, has constantly promoted Executive Functions Approach (EF) and the immunity boost to prepare the early childhood children to grow into mature adults knowledgeable about how to fully manage their life. Chiang Rai Province, in synergy with the SET Foundation and partners, has educated public health network personnel and enhanced early childhood teachers&rsquo; potential continuously for the 5<sup>th</sup> consecutive year, positioning Chiang Rai as the country&rsquo;s first prototype province in EF. Significantly, over 50 organizations in Chiang Rai have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to collaboratively drive and create sustainability, with a provincial committee to&nbsp; further drive the efforts towards the set goals.</p>
<p><b>SET Senior Executive Vice President-Head of Legal Affairs Division and overseeing Social Responsibility Management Department Rongrak Phanapavudhikul</b>, as a director and treasurer of the SET Foundation, said that the SET Foundation has been implementing the "EF&rdquo; project in Chiang Rai province since 2020 until now, Under the project, the concept of EF has been shared to public health network personnel, early childhood teachers, and parents gradually and continuously covering all districts of Chiang Rai, highlighting Phaya Mengrai district as a key success model.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The project&rsquo;s findings revealed that changes in the approach to caring for and raising children have significantly improved early childhood children with 70 percent of them having good to very good levels of EF brain skills. The project&rsquo;s success stories demonstrate better behavior of caregivers and children. For examples, children stopped mobile phone addiction and aggression to engage storybooks, social play, and normalized interactions. Moreover, school students have adopted positive skills including working memory, shift/cognitive flexibility, inhibitory control, emotional control, self- monitoring, focus,&nbsp; initiating, &nbsp;planning &amp; organizing and goal-directed persistence &nbsp;after teachers have joined the project and revised teaching methods to align with EF guidelines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such knowledge and wisdom will form a valuable model, enabling Chiang Rai Province to become an important learning source for human resource development, with outcome that can further expand to other areas broadly with ripple effect throughout the country. This will help create positive impact in a sustainable manner,&rdquo; added Rongrak.</p>
<p><b>Chiang Rai Provincial Education Officer and Secretary of Chiang Rai Province EF Development and Promotion Committee Wanlop Maijampa </b>said that Chiang Rai Province borders a high-risk drug trafficking zone while the economic situation has forced parents to leave home to work, causing children to have delayed development and be at risk of going down the wrong path. After the SET Foundation has implemented the "EF Approach" project using the EF prototype developed in Phaya Mengrai district to drive EF in Chiang Rai Province, significant advancements in early childhood development were witnessed. The project yielded a remarkable 20 percent higher in children&rsquo;s EF value than the national average (norm).<b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>Chiang Rai Province has 57,853 early childhood children aged 0-6 years, accounting for 46.3 percent of all children and youth in the province. Currently, 35,377 children and 39,177 public health personnel, early childhood teachers, parents and community leaders have participated in the project. There are also more than 270 people who are knowledgeable about EF or EF Facilitators who work together to disseminate this knowledge to achieve broader results. In addition, the province has appointed the Executive Function committee for Chiang Rai Province to support in-depth operations and serve as an important learning center for human resource development to build a solid foundation.<b style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit;">&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>RLG Institute Managing Director Subhawadee Harnmethee</b> said that EF brain skills begin developing from the first year of life to around 25 years but the best development at 3-6 years old. Early childhood is therefore the foundation of life. Children who continuously develop their brain skills or EF will be able to build good life immunity, have discipline and responsibility, and be ready to push themselves towards their goals in life.</p>
<p>In addition, EF brain skills are the foundation for the development of more complex thinking processes and personality, or called "higher order thinking" which will lead to "21st century skills" that are essential for living in the modern world.</p>
<p>The SET Foundation believes that the development to uplift the quality of life of the people who are the foundation of society is an integral part for the country's sustainable economic development. This involves working with partners from the government, business and civil society sectors to improve the quality of life and create well-being for all Thais.<i style="font-family: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>The SET Foundation firmly adheres to &ldquo;Power of collaboration for better society&rdquo; (Partner for Better Society).</p>

<p><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Center for Risk Management Education and Research at Kansas State University (K-State) today announced the agenda for the third Agricultural Commodity Futures Conference (AgCon2024). The conference is scheduled for April 11-12 in Overland Park, Kansas. See the full&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/10336/AgCon2024_Agenda/download">conference agenda</a>.&nbsp;<a href="https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcommerce.cashnet.com%2Fcrmer&amp;data=05%7C01%7CDFaulk-White%40CFTC.gov%7C0bfa477034c945304bf408dbf5096574%7Cff902a6348374fa7905b52887c7f3cff%7C0%7C0%7C638373192954749508%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=oa%2BWKN8IQvW%2BBitL0xNqMM1%2BmwQMfgcGOgrr10bCMyU%3D&amp;reserved=0">Register</a>&nbsp;for AgCon2024.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The conference brings together leading voices from academia, agribusiness, as well as the private and public sectors to explore a range of current issues and topics facing the agricultural futures markets.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&ldquo;</span>The ability of&nbsp;<span>America&rsquo;s farmers and ranchers&nbsp;</span>to manage all types of risk predictably and without undue burdens directly impacts the prices American consumers pay for food and fuel, and also directly impacts the livelihood of families across the country<span>,&rdquo; said CFTC Chairman&nbsp;</span>Rostin Behnam<span>. &ldquo;As I&rsquo;ve said many times before,&nbsp;</span>the health of the agricultural value and supply chains trickles down throughout the entire U.S. economy, impacting the regions they occupy in meaningful ways<span>.&nbsp;</span>B<span>ringing together experts, regulators, and stakeholders to discuss the issues our futures markets currently face helps foster&nbsp;</span>healthier markets, lower prices, and a stronger economy<span>. I look forward&nbsp;</span>to engaging with everyone in America&rsquo;s heartland<span>.&rdquo;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Highlights this year include remarks from:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span>Roger Marshall, M.D., U.S. Senator (Kansas) and Member of the Senate Agriculture Committee</span></span></li>
<li><span><span>Jeffrey R. Schmid, President, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City</span></span></li>
<li><span><span>Ambassador Doug McKalip, U.S. Chief Agricultural Negotiator, Office of the U.S. Trade Representative</span></span></li>

<div> House of Representatives, Improving Disclosure for Investors Act of 2024, Expanding Access to Capital Act of 2023, SIFMA, regulatory burdens
Summary:
House passes capital formation legislation, including Improving Disclosure for Investors Act of 2024. SIFMA commends bipartisan support and looks forward to further reforms. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>SIFMA today issued the following statement from president and CEO Kenneth E. Bentsen, Jr. on the passage of the&nbsp;<em>Improving Disclosure for Investors Act of 2024</em>&nbsp;as part of an important capital formation legislative package, H.R. 2799, the&nbsp;<em>Expanding Access to Capital Act of 2023</em>:</p>
<p>&ldquo;SIFMA commends the House of Representatives for passing the&nbsp;<em>Improving Disclosure for Investors Act of 2024</em>&nbsp;as an amendment to a broader legislative package focused on enhancing capital formation &ndash; H.R. 2799, the&nbsp;<em>Expanding Access to Capital Act of 2023.</em>&nbsp;Many of the reforms in the legislation passed today will help strengthen our capital markets, and our economy that depends on them, by reducing regulatory burdens that too often hinder capital formation. Notably, we applaud the sponsors of the&nbsp;<em>Improving Disclosure for Investors Act of 2024</em>, Reps. Bill Huizenga (R-MI), Jake Auchincloss (D-MA), Bryan Steil (R-WI), and Wiley Nickel (D-NC). This bill is an important step in modernizing the SEC&rsquo;s disclosure delivery regulations to keep pace with changing investor preferences and technological advancements, while maintaining the highest levels of investor protections. Accordingly, it received broad bipartisan support as an amendment to H.R. 2799.</p>
<p>We appreciate the leadership of the House in passing this vital legislative package and look forward to working with members across Congress to continue advancing reforms to strengthen our capital markets and protect investors.&rdquo;</p>

<div> grain markets, CFTC, risk management, geopolitics, climate

Summary:
- Importance of grain industry, market regulation, and evolution
- Historical context of U.S. grain markets
- Impact of geopolitics on wheat futures and CFTC response
- Effect of drought on shipping and logistical challenges
- CFTC initiatives in climate risk and carbon markets<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>Good morning. I want to begin by extending my thanks to the North American Millers&rsquo; Association (NAMA), NAMA Chair Brian Doyle of King Milling Company, and NAMA President Jane DeMarchi, as well as staff member Megan Baker, for the invitation to your 2023 Annual Meeting. It is an honor to speak to NAMA members about the importance of the milling industry and grain markets&mdash;these are truly kitchen table issues that we all care about.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opapham10?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1">[1]</a></p>
<p>I also want to take a moment to express my deepest gratitude to NAMA for your support throughout my nomination process as one of the five Presidentially-appointed and Senate-confirmed Commissioners of the CFTC. It is because of dedicated organizations like NAMA, committed to upholding the highest standards in our agricultural economy, that I am privileged to serve as a CFTC Commissioner and safeguard the markets that agricultural producers rely upon for risk management and price discovery. Without all of you, we wouldn&rsquo;t have our favorite cereal at breakfast, sandwiches at lunch, pasta at dinner, and let&rsquo;s not forget cake for dessert.</p>
<p>Last night I had the pleasure of joining you for your awards dinner and hearing wonderful stories about the rich history of the milling industry and the strength of the community. Earlier this week, I was in Chicago, speaking to the Futures Industry Association (FIA) about innovation in accelerating collateral management, and it&rsquo;s great to be able to come here to end a great week. I think it truly shows the breadth of the CFTC&rsquo;s mission and thank you again for hosting me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll provide my standard disclaimer that the views I share today are my own in my official capacity as a Commissioner, and do not necessarily reflect those of the CFTC or my fellow Commissioners.</p>
<p>Agriculture Is About Community</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to begin by giving a little background about myself for those I haven&rsquo;t had the pleasure of meeting yet. I was born and raised in Modesto, which is in the Central Valley of California, also known as the &ldquo;food basket of the world.&rdquo; Growing up, horses and orchards were two big features&mdash;the horses that I rode on the ranch and showed in 4-H at the county and state fair, and the orchards that my family owned and that surrounded our neighborhood until times changed and development came. Before I lived and worked in the big city, agriculture was all around me and part of my community. As a CFTC Commissioner, I&rsquo;ve appreciated being able to recognize and honor my roots, and that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s special to me to have the honor of speaking to you all, as leaders of a global agricultural community that is focused on food safety in milled products, nutrition for American consumers and people around the world, and the grain supply chain.</p>
<p>This is actually my fourth time at the CFTC. There&rsquo;s nothing like starting at the bottom and working your way up. Right after the 2008 financial crisis, there was a lot of focus on prices in the commodity markets. During that time, I worked on the CFTC&rsquo;s efforts to implement a federal position limits rule that would apply to our agricultural futures, including futures and options on wheat, corn, and oats. We at the CFTC heard from producers and commercial end-users about how we needed to get it right because the stakes for the real economy were so high. This very involved and complex change to our agricultural futures markets underscored, for me, that our Nation&rsquo;s agricultural economy needed to be supported with thoughtful, balanced regulation&mdash;not a rule that could be the final straw that broke the camel&rsquo;s back. Running a business and taking care of your employees and customers is challenging enough without someone in Washington, D.C., making it worse. It left a lasting impression on me, and when I went to work in the private sector, that direct engagement with agricultural producers was key to my understanding of the commodities business and the needs of our corporate and commercial clients better.</p>
<p>Our Nation&rsquo;s earliest leaders knew that the American economy was a three-legged stool that relied on commerce, manufacturing, and agriculture.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opapham10?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2">[2]</a>&nbsp;My hands-on experiences showed me that behind every grain future traded, there is a farmer or a miller on one side of the contract and a bank or liquidity provider on the other side of the contract. The value chain includes everything from financing, labor, growing, processing, packaging, shipping, merchandising, and more, all eventually to food on a plate enjoyed by a family sitting around the dinner table. Our CFTC markets are not theoretical or academic exercises&mdash;a huge part of our markets are things that you can feel and touch and eat at the end of the day.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m back at the CFTC as a Commissioner, and I carry these experiences with me every day. I understand that the grain industry is not just about prices, but also about people and communities and nourishment. It&rsquo;s about the hardworking men and women across the country who rise before dawn to tend their fields. It&rsquo;s about the millers who turn these grains into the foods that feed our entire country, many other countries, and livestock and pets. And it&rsquo;s about the market participants in our grain futures markets who manage risk and depend upon the CFTC ensuring that our markets function effectively.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on the job, and I want you all to know that I am working hard to support the health and vitality of the grain futures markets. From my international listening tour last year, particularly learning about trade and exports, I&rsquo;ve heard about the challenges you face from geopolitical issues to unpredictable weather patterns to shifting global demands and sustainability, and I encourage you to reach out about others. I want to keep hearing about the issues you care about and any challenges in our grain futures markets. I&rsquo;ll try to explain now what we&rsquo;ve done so far and where I hope we can all end up.</p>
<p>The grain industry has an outsized role in ensuring our nation&rsquo;s food security, our economic stability, and our collective well-being. No matter what headlines are in the news, it&rsquo;s incredibly grounding to never forget that the derivatives markets have their origins in the grain markets and the agricultural community.</p>
<p>Birthplace of a U.S. Grain Market and a Regulator</p>
<p>The history of the U.S. grain markets is an interesting one with equal parts innovation and perseverance. A dynamic timeline that stretches back to the early 19th&nbsp;century, the grain markets have played a significant role in shaping the country&rsquo;s economic and agricultural landscape.</p>
<p>The first organized grain market in the United States originated with the establishment of the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) in 1848.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opapham10?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3">[3]</a>&nbsp;The CBOT initially served as a centralized marketplace for cash transactions involving grains like wheat, oats, and corn. It wasn&rsquo;t until 1865 that the CBOT introduced the first standardized futures contracts for grain, which allowed for the purchase and sale of these commodities for future delivery and the benefits of price discovery and hedging.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opapham10?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4">[4]</a>&nbsp;These contracts provided a hedge against price fluctuations and helped stabilize the market. They also marked the beginning of the modern commodity futures markets, with wheat being the first commodity to be traded in this manner in the United States.</p>
<p>But the development of the grain futures markets in Chicago was no accident. It was the result of several economic factors, including Chicago&rsquo;s location near the Great Lakes, the arrival and expansion of railroads, the CBOT&rsquo;s introduction of standardized grain grades and the use of grain elevators to facilitate trading and the need for risk management by farmers in and around the Midwest who often faced price uncertainties due to weather, transport issues, and fluctuating demand.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opapham10?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5">[5]</a>&nbsp;The creation of the grain futures markets revolutionized the agricultural sector, providing a vital risk management and price discovery mechanism for the grain industry that continues to this day, and laying the groundwork for our current grain derivatives markets.</p>
<p>Between the late 1840&rsquo;s and early 1920&rsquo;s, grain futures trading was largely unregulated, and a patchwork of state laws proved inadequate for this booming market. The Grain Futures Act of 1922 was a pivotal piece of legislation established in the United States to regulate the grain futures markets.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opapham10?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6">[6]</a>&nbsp;Prior to its passage, the lack of federal oversight opened the door for manipulation in our grain markets along with excessive speculation, leading to price volatility that hurt grain market participants throughout the supply chain.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opapham10?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7">[7]</a></p>
<p>The market collapse of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression brought significant challenges to the grain markets, however, both had a profound effect on all American industries, including grain. The Commodity Exchange Act of 1936, a cornerstone in the regulatory framework that the CFTC oversees today, was in part response to the challenges of that era, replacing the Grain Futures Act and creating the Commodity Exchange Commission, the CFTC&rsquo;s predecessor.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opapham10?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8">[8]</a></p>
<p>In the post-war era, the U.S. wheat market took on an increasingly global role. Advances in shipping and communication technologies, coupled with the liberalization of international trade, led to the integration of the U.S. wheat market, in particular, with markets around the world. At the same time, the CBOT became a global hub for wheat futures trading. This market expanded rapidly, and soon it was setting the price for wheat worldwide.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Modernizing Grain Markets through Technology</p>
<p>Fast forward to the latter half of the 20th century, we witnessed another revolution&mdash;the advent of technology. In our grain markets, new irrigation technologies allowed for better water management and increased productivity. We also developed GMOs to resist certain pests, diseases, and other harsh conditions and benefitted from improved trucking and shipping to facilitate more cost-effective grain transport.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opapham10?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9">[9]</a>&nbsp;On the derivatives side, no longer were trading floors the primary landscapes of our markets.</p>
<p>Instead, we stepped into an era of electronic trading, where markets became faster, more efficient, yet also more complex and susceptible to new kinds of risks. These technologies made the grain markets more efficient and facilitated greater global trading.</p>
<p>As we moved into the 21st century, the financial crisis of 2008 reminded us that while innovation may drive our markets forward, it can also expose vulnerabilities. The financial instruments that contributed to the crisis were complex, but the lessons were straightforward: transparency along with a principles-based approach to regulation is necessary.</p>
<p>The bedrock of our Nation is its agricultural industry. Today we are in the era of innovation and AgTech, as agribusinesses plan and strategize for the future&mdash;whether to implement blockchain technology to improve operations, or overhaul their infrastructure in anticipation of voluntary carbon markets.</p>
<p>There have been other challenges, too. There are the economic ripples that linger from the COVID-19 pandemic to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, both of which disrupted global supply chains and increased costs for agriculture. There are the relentless concerns posed by low water levels from devastating drought. But there has been one constant through all this: the resiliency of our U.S. grain markets.</p>
<p>Geopolitics and Grain Markets</p>
<p>The Russian invasion of Ukraine at the end of February 2022 sent shockwaves throughout the global agricultural markets, with cash wheat prices experiencing a significant surge.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opapham10?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10">[10]</a>&nbsp;As two of the world&rsquo;s largest wheat exporters, Russia and Ukraine collectively account for approximately 30% of the global wheat export market.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opapham10?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11">[11]</a>&nbsp;Consequently, the conflict brought about substantial uncertainty around the future supply of wheat, causing an increase in cash prices.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opapham10?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12">[12]</a></p>
<p>In the immediate aftermath of the invasion, wheat futures also experienced unprecedented volatility and soared to their highest level in over a decade.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opapham10?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13">[13]</a>&nbsp;This sudden increase reflected the market&rsquo;s reaction to the potential disruption of wheat supply from the Black Sea region, which is a critical export hub for Russian and Ukrainian wheat.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opapham10?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14">[14]</a>&nbsp;The geopolitical turmoil also led to increased risk premiums, as market participants scrambled to secure contracts amidst the escalating uncertainty.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opapham10?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15">[15]</a></p>
<p>The repercussions of the Russia-Ukraine conflict extended far beyond borders. Countries heavily dependent on wheat imports from these two nations have also been hit hard by the price spikes. The surging wheat prices exacerbated global food inflation, which was already at alarming levels due to the COVID-19 pandemic and other supply chain disruptions.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opapham10?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16">[16]</a></p>
<p>The CFTC&rsquo;s Response to Wheat Market Volatility</p>
<p>When the wheat futures markets experienced unprecedented volatility in response to the Russian Ukraine invasion, the CME and CFTC were engaged in on-going dialogues to ensure the stability of our grain futures markets. The CFTC closely monitored the situation.&nbsp;As a result of the conflict, conditions in wheat futures changed and the CFTC was aware that wheat futures contracts reached price limits&mdash;driven by market reaction to the conflict and fear of low inventory. However, once price limits are reached, trading in these contracts stops for the remainder of the day, preventing the markets from functioning as intended.&nbsp;In March 2022, the CFTC approved a temporary&nbsp;increase in daily price limits for CBOT futures on&nbsp;Wheat, Mini-Sized Wheat, KC HRW Wheat, and Mini-Sized KC HRW Wheat contracts&nbsp;following multiple limit-move days due to significant volatility caused by short supplies of high-protein wheat and the war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Again in August 2022,&nbsp;the CFTC approved the CBOT&rsquo;s wheat contract amendments on an expedited basis to expand price limits to increase when one contract within the first five non-spot contract months settles at the initial price limit rather than two contract months within the first five non-spot contract months to enable the markets to fulfill their price discovery and hedging functions.&nbsp;The CFTC continues to review and analyze our markets to safeguard their resilience and ensure their stable operations.</p>
<p>The Effect of Drought on Mississippi River and Panama Canal Levels</p>
<p>Beyond geopolitical issues, our grain industry is also dealing with weather-related challenges. We know that droughts can have profound impacts on agriculture and related economic sectors. One aspect that does not get enough attention is the effect of drought on the cost of shipping grains. As droughts alter waterway conditions and impede transportation, they disrupt global supply chains. This disruption can reverberate through futures markets on grains, as market participants adjust their expectations and strategies based on the projected grain availability.</p>
<p>In the U.S., our waterways span over 12,000 miles and include a multitude of tributaries, serving as the veins and arteries of America&rsquo;s agricultural export system. They traverse 28 states and are navigation-critical for transporting various commodities.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opapham10?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17">[17]</a>&nbsp;Each year, more than 500 million tons of goods worth $130 billion are moved through these waterways, with 60% of America's grain exports dependent on them.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opapham10?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn18">[18]</a></p>
<p>The Mississippi River and Panama Canal, two major arteries of global grain trade, continue to experience record low levels due to drought.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opapham10?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn19">[19]</a>&nbsp;The Mississippi River is not just one of the largest rivers in the world, stretching over 2,300 miles, but it is also an indispensable trade corridor for our grain industry. This river basin is uniquely situated between the Appalachian and Rocky Mountain ranges, and is responsible for 92% of the nation&rsquo;s total agricultural exports, including&nbsp;78% of the world&rsquo;s exports in feed grains and soybeans.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opapham10?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn20">[20]</a>&nbsp;Unfortunately, our current situation merits discussion. Record low water levels in the Mississippi River have caused economic ramifications, such as increased barge rates by 42% in 2023 and 85% over the last three years, effectively halving the amount of grain each can carry and slowing down barge traffic.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opapham10?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn21">[21]</a>&nbsp;This has resulted in a tightening of the U.S. barge supply, necessitating twice as many barges to transport the same volume of goods.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opapham10?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn22">[22]</a>&nbsp;With 78% of all U.S. grain exports passing through the Mississippi River, the impact is felt not only at home, but abroad as U.S. grain export prices become less competitive.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opapham10?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn23">[23]</a></p>
<p>But weather patterns are not confined to the U.S. A similar international weather-related logistical impact is happening at the Panama Canal, which is close to having the lowest water level on record, due to rainfall 50% less than normal this year.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opapham10?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn24">[24]</a>&nbsp;The Panama Canal is usually the fastest and least expensive way to move commodities which leave the U.S. Gulf for Asia. As I&rsquo;m sure you all know, the U.S. is the largest user of the Panama Canal. According to the numbers, total U.S. commodity export and import containers account for roughly 70% of Panama Canal traffic, with forty percent of all U.S. container traffic traveling through the Panama Canal every year, representing $270 billion dollars in U.S. cargo annually.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opapham10?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn25">[25]</a>&nbsp;But just like in the Mississippi, drought conditions are causing weight limits and rising&nbsp;surcharges for vessels moving through the Panama Canal, which is resulting in rising shipping costs and prolonged wait times to ship.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opapham10?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn26">[26]</a></p>
<p>Amidst the recent challenges, milling companies have been focused on improving efficiency and process automation to combat rising costs due to weather, increased competition, and energy initiatives. As grain elevators, milling operators, and merchandisers might adjust their operations to offset the impacts of droughts, they may need to access our derivatives markets as a hedge against these challenging conditions. Some may increase their storage capacities to accommodate larger grain reserves, insulating them against potential supply disruptions. Others might diversify their sourcing, purchasing grains from regions less affected by drought.</p>
<p>These changes are a testament to the grain industry because it continues to show resilience by adapting to challenging conditions. What these challenges have shown is that the American grain industry is incredibly efficient and resilient. Our grain industry is a well-oiled machine. The interplay of geopolitics, climate, and economic variables creates a complex tapestry that influences and continues to influence our grain markets. As we navigate through these multifaceted dynamics, it is crucial to remain adaptive and vigilant, recognizing both the perennial and evolving conditions that shape our world.</p>
<p>The Importance of Derivatives Markets</p>
<p>The CFTC&rsquo;s derivatives markets, which include futures and options on wheat, corn, and oats, play a pivotal role in the cash grain markets. Our markets provide sound risk management for market participants and price discovery to the broader markets, thus providing a level of predictability and stability to the cash grain markets.</p>
<p>Price discovery is a critical function of the CFTC&rsquo;s derivatives markets. Through the trading of futures on agricultural commodities like wheat, corn, and oats, these markets reveal information about expected future prices. As a result, producers, consumers, and traders can make informed decisions about production, consumption, and investment activities.</p>
<p>Hedging is another crucial function of the CFTC's derivatives markets. Producers and consumers of grains can use futures contracts to protect themselves from adverse price movements. The derivatives markets&rsquo; price discovery and hedging functions have profound implications for cash grain markets. They reduce price uncertainty and facilitate long-term planning.</p>
<p>The cash and derivatives markets are interdependent. As we&rsquo;ve recently experienced, changes in the cash grain market can influence futures prices of grain contracts, and vice versa. This interdependence means that the CFTC&rsquo;s grain derivatives markets are constantly reflecting and shaping the realities of the cash grain markets. And that&rsquo;s why the role of the CFTC in overseeing these markets is paramount. The CFTC ensures the integrity, resiliency, and vibrancy of the U.S. derivatives markets, protecting market participants and promoting fair competition. Without the CFTC&rsquo;s regulatory oversight, the derivatives markets might be susceptible to excessive speculation and manipulation, which could distort price discovery and undermine the effectiveness of hedging in our grain contracts.</p>
<p>Transparency and trust are fundamental to the functioning of the CFTC&rsquo;s derivatives markets. Market participants need to trust that the futures prices accurately reflect expected future cash prices and that they can effectively hedge their risks. The CFTC&rsquo;s commitment to transparency and accountability helps to maintain this trust and ensure the smooth functioning of our grain markets.</p>
<p>The Global Economy and the Road Ahead</p>
<p>When I began my term as Commissioner in April 2022, the grain markets were in the process of adapting to the volatility they faced in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. At that time, I decided that I wanted my tenure as Commissioner to focus on actionable solutions to real issues faced by market participants in our markets.</p>
<p>I decided early on that I wanted my core values that I stand for as a Commissioner to be growth, progress, and access to markets.</p>
<p>By tradition, each Commissioner sponsors an advisory committee that oftentimes explores what the sponsoring Commissioner views as key priorities for our markets. I am proud to sponsor the CFTC&rsquo;s Global Markets Advisory Committee, or GMAC. The big picture is that the GMAC promotes a level playing field for global business and global markets. Under my sponsorship, the GMAC has focused on firms, global business strategy and operations, and the markets that are needed to support growth and effective risk management. It is an international forum for executive leaders from both the public and private sectors to come together and create a shared vision for the future of markets.&nbsp;We need global solutions to global challenges.</p>
<p>As described in its charter, the GMAC was created to advise the CFTC on issues that affect the integrity and competitiveness of U.S. markets and U.S. firms engaged in global business, including the regulatory challenges of a global marketplace that reflects the increasing interconnectedness of markets, and the multinational nature of business. The GMAC also makes recommendations regarding international standards for regulating futures, swaps, options, and derivatives markets, as well as intermediaries. Members include financial market infrastructures, swap data repositories, intermediaries including swap dealers and FCMs, market participants, end users, service providers, and regulators.</p>
<p>The GMAC had its inaugural meeting in Washington, D.C., on February 13th&nbsp;this year.&nbsp;It was an important meeting&nbsp;because we heard from end users about market fundamentals, among other issues.</p>
<p>We heard from one GMAC member about the transition to&nbsp;affordable, secure, and low carbon energy and that by 2050, it can be expected that their shipping and trading business will be less carbon intensive. Another GMAC member discussed domestic logistic situations in our agricultural markets and the current reliability problem. The GMAC member highlighted several market risks and implications of supply chain issues, including that they create shortages of supply, basis levels are impacted, there is an increase in costs, long lead times are needed, there is a loss of sales, there are increased counterparty risks, and that geopolitical disruptions exacerbate supply chain problems. Another GMAC member spoke about how recent geopolitical issues have impacted commodity markets and the global food crisis. In addition, we also heard from GMAC members about global commodity market volatility, noting that while energy prices remain elevated this year, volatility has retreated.</p>
<p>At the beginning of my term, I said that my approach is to get all the information, learn as much as possible, and then come up with pragmatic solutions. And that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve done. Over the past year and a half, I went on a global stock-taking exercise.&nbsp;Throughout my travels, I was fortunate enough to travel all over the country to meet with our market participants and end users. I&rsquo;ve also been fortunate enough to visit over a dozen countries, and speak with finance ministers, policymakers, and leaders in each country.&nbsp;As a result of my global stock-taking initiative, earlier this year I announced the GMAC&rsquo;s proposed work program. This proposal is a key milestone for the GMAC and the result of my global stock-taking exercise over the past year and a half concerning the markets, including public comments and international policy dialogues.</p>
<p>Therefore, earlier this year I proposed for the GMAC&rsquo;s 2023-2025 work program that the Global Market Structure Subcommittee examine proposals and recommendation for market volatility controls and circuit breakers, and I look forward to seeing the work of this Subcommittee in this critical area.&nbsp;The GMAC work program is now underway and serves as a platform for global market participants, regulators, and other stakeholders to come together and address the challenges and opportunities presented in our markets.</p>
<p>I am proud to announce that we have an upcoming GMAC meeting on November 6th&nbsp;in Washington, D.C. At that meeting, the Global Market Structure Subcommittee will discuss the work that they are doing and I hope you will all stay tuned for actionable recommendations by the GMAC regarding our derivatives markets that will be made to the Commission in the months ahead.</p>
<p>Other CFTC Initiatives&mdash;Climate Risk and Carbon Markets</p>
<p>The CFTC has a climate risk unit, and over the past year or so has held two voluntary carbon market convenings to make greater progress through public-private partnerships towards ensuring that the developing carbon and carbon related products and markets have integrity and adhere to basic market regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>As our CFTC Chairman has described, the CFTC has received comments from over 80 stakeholders, expressing views from the halls of Congress to farmers, ranchers, and others along the traditional agricultural value and supply change that serve as our historical core constituency, as well as traditional financial market participants. We received comments from forestry experts, environmental public interest groups, energy traders, carbon credit rating agencies, carbon credit registries, CFTC-registered exchanges and clearinghouses, and derivatives trade associations.</p>
<p>The two takeaways are that the CFTC should use its anti-fraud and anti-manipulation enforcement authority to the fullest extent possible, and that the CFTC should support the development of standards to promote the growth of high integrity carbon offsets. The CFTC has launched initiatives towards these goals.</p>
<p>I believe in market-driven solutions. I look forward to hearing from you and other stakeholders on what you think the CFTC&rsquo;s role should be and what issues to tackle in carbon markets.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>As regulators, we have a responsibility to adapt and evolve alongside the markets we oversee. In the case of our agricultural markets, in particular our grain markets, this means understanding and responding to the changes affecting our markets. In seeking solutions, we must engage in measured, thoughtful action that balances the need for market stability with the potential for innovation to ensure our market participants are able to use our markets. We must also maintain the core principles of transparency, integrity, and customer protection that underpin our financial markets.</p>
<p>Our efforts must be informed by a thorough understanding of our market&rsquo;s structure and operations. This requires data, analysis, and the expertise that is unique to the CFTC in regulating the derivatives markets.</p>
<p>I wish to emphasize the critical importance of collaboration between market participants and the CFTC in understanding our markets. Our respective expertise complements each other, and collaboration is essential to ensuring a comprehensive and effective oversight. It is only through our combined efforts that we can hope to achieve a well-regulated and secure grain derivatives markets that continues to serve the needs of our millers and farmers and in turn their standings within the greater global agricultural markets.</p>
<p>As we look ahead, I am optimistic. Grain millers have continually innovated, adapted, and flourished, even in the most challenging of times. Whether it&rsquo;s new milling technologies or more efficient supply chain logistics, your contributions ensure the well-being and sustenance of this great nation, our neighbors to the North, and many other countries. And with organizations like NAMA leading the charge, I have no doubt the future is bright.</p>
<p>In closing, I want to reiterate the critical role each of you plays in making America&rsquo;s agricultural sector, which is the envy of the world. Thank you, and let&rsquo;s continue to sow the seeds of success.</p>

<title>U.S. Department Of The Treasury And State Insurance Regulators Launch Coordinated Effort On Homeowners Insurance Data Collection To Assess The Effects Of Climate Risk On U.S. Insurance Markets - FIO Expects To Begin Receiving Data This Summer</title>

<div> Treasury, insurance, climate-related, data collection, collaboration
Summary: The U.S. Department of the Treasury's Federal Insurance Office collaborates with NAIC and state regulators to collect ZIP code-level data on climate-related financial risks for homeowners insurance. This collaboration addresses the impacts of climate-related disasters on insurance policies nationwide, as requested by FIO in consultation with states.<br /><br /> <div>
<p>Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury&rsquo;s Federal Insurance Office (FIO) advanced its efforts to collect insurance data to better understand the impacts of climate-related financial risks on the insurance sector, by launching a first-of-its kind collaboration with state insurance regulators and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). This FIO and NAIC collaboration represents the next step of FIO&rsquo;s efforts that were first&nbsp;<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1030">publicly announced over one year ago</a>.</p>
<p>The NAIC will be collecting, on behalf of participating state insurance regulators, ZIP Code-level data from the largest homeowners insurers. FIO will be closely coordinating with the NAIC as the NAIC shares granular information with FIO in the coming months. FIO will use this data to conduct a nationwide assessment of climate-related financial risks to consumers across the United States.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Americans across the country are seeing the affordability and availability of their insurance policies decline as a result of increasingly severe climate-related disasters,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span>Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen</span>. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pleased that the Federal Insurance Office, state insurance regulators, and the NAIC are collaborating on this important data collection. Analysis of homeowners insurance data is essential to understanding the market impacts on consumers and helping policymakers across the country respond appropriately to the risks.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>FIO previously proposed to collect climate-related data directly from insurance companies, as approved by the&nbsp;<a class="external" href="https://omb.report/icr/202311-1505-001">Office of Management and Budget</a>&nbsp;earlier this year. In light of the agreement by the NAIC and state insurance regulators to provide FIO with timely data comparable to its proposed collection, and to help mitigate reporting burdens on relevant insurance companies, FIO will pursue its efforts as part of the data collection collaboration with the NAIC rather than issue&nbsp; its own separate data collection at this time.</p>
<p>The NAIC and FIO have agreed that the NAIC will begin sending the data to FIO in June 2024, shortly after the close of the NAIC data collection. The NAIC has agreed to provide FIO with final data in late September.</p>
<p>FIO&rsquo;s analysis of the data received will help respond to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/20/executive-order-on-climate-related-financial-risk/">President Biden&rsquo;s Executive Order on Climate-related Financial Risk, EO 14030&nbsp;</a>(May 20, 2021), which called on FIO to &ldquo;assess, in consultation with States, the potential for major disruptions of private insurance coverage in regions of the country particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts.&rdquo; The data analysis will also advance FIO&rsquo;s statutory mandates, including to monitor the extent to which traditionally underserved communities and consumers, minorities, and low- and moderate-income persons have access to affordable insurance products and to monitor all aspects of the insurance industry. FIO&rsquo;s work to monitor the nationwide insurance industry complements the work of the states, which are the primary regulators of the insurance industry.</p>
<p>More information on the state insurance regulator data collection that will be shared with FIO is available&nbsp;<a class="external" href="https://content.naic.org/article/state-property-casualty-market-data-call">here</a>. Separately, more information on FIO&rsquo;s analysis is available through a&nbsp;<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/FIO-Revised-Data-Collection-Federal-Register-Notice.pdf">Federal Register notice</a>&nbsp;issued in November 2023 requesting public comment on the proposed FIO data collection.

<title>Finansinspektionen Would Like The Financial Market To Shift Its Sustainability Work Into The Next Gear</title>

<div> sustainability, financial market, risks, regulations, action <br />
<br />
Firms in the financial market need to improve their integration of sustainability, identify and manage risks, and take action based on current regulations. Counteracting illegal financial flows is also crucial.<br /><br />Summary: Firms in the financial market need to integrate sustainability, manage risks, take action based on current regulations, and counteract illegal financial flows. <div>
<p><span>There is a lot of work left to do before the financial market fully contributes to a sustainable economy. For example, firms need to be better at identifying and integrating sustainability risks. One condition for this is that they have the right competence in sustainability-related matters. Firms also are responsible for preventing their operations from being used for criminal purposes. These are several of the conclusions we draw in our sustainability report that is being published today.</span></p>
<div class="editor-content">
<p>The financial sector fills an important function in the transition to a sustainable economy. FI's assignment includes a responsibility to ensure that financial corporations contribute to sustainable development. As part of this work, we adopted at the end of 2022 a roadmap for sustainable finance up to 2025. Our follow-up of the firms' work in this area indicates that more needs to be done. Therefore, the firms must shift their sustainability work into the next gear.</p>
<p>"Coasting is not an option. The area of sustainability is developing rapidly, and it is now time for all firms to take action and ensure that they are fully compliant with the new rules and manage relevant sustainability risks," says Tove Husell, acting head of sustainability at FI.</p>
<p>Firms need to be better at identifying risks linked to, for example, climate change and risks that the operations will be used for criminal purposes. We also see that firms need to improve their integration of sustainability into relevant parts of their operations. The competence at the Board level, in central functions, and in other relevant parts of the operations also needs to develop as the knowledge situation changes. FI would also like to emphasise that the signals the board sends are important for how well sustainability aspects &ndash; both risks and opportunities &ndash; are integrated into the organisation.</p>
<p>We do understand that there are many new complex rules being introduced into the area of sustainability. However, this should not prevent firms from transitioning away from the analysis and preparation stages and starting to take action based on the current regulations. As new regulations enter into force, we will focus on risk-based and forward-looking supervision.</p>
<p>Going forward, we highlight three focus areas in particular that firms need to continue to work with:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Time to take action based on the current rules</strong><br />Many sustainability rules have entered into force, and firms have been working to prepare for the implementation of these rules. It is now time for firms to start to take action based on the current regulatory framework.</li>
<li><strong>Counteract illegal financial flows</strong><br />Firms are responsible for preventing their operations from being used for criminal purposes, for example by criminal actors trying to hide illicit gains or finance terrorism.</li>
<li><strong>Continue integrating sustainability</strong><br />The integration of sustainability is a necessity for firms to successfully comply with the regulatory framework governing sustainable finance &ndash; where corporate governance is the natural starting point. Because climate and environmental risks are expected to increase going forward, there is a need for forward-looking tools, for example transition plans and scenario analyses. It is important that tools like these are integrated operationally as soon as possible. Firms also need to ensure that they meet the need for increased knowledge and competence at the board level, among senior management and in other relevant functions in the organisation.</li>

("<span class="ak">BCP York</span>") (an entity owned by a consortium of certain investment funds affiliated with Blackstone Inc. and including an affiliate of Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, an affiliate of GIC Special Investments Pte.

<p class="ar"><span class="an">Following completion of the Off-Market Purchase, LSEG confirms that its share capital consists of: (i) 520,422,421 voting ordinary shares of 6<sup>79/86</sup>&nbsp;pence each (excluding treasury shares), which carry one vote each; and (ii)&nbsp;15,179,384 limited-voting ordinary shares of 6<sup>79/86</sup>&nbsp;pence each, which carry one-tenth of a vote each.

Therefore, the total number of voting rights in LSEG on 8 March 2024 is 521,940,359.&nbsp; This figure for the total number of voting rights may be used by shareholders (and others with notification obligations) as the denominator for the calculation by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the Company under the FCA's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules. As previously indicated by the Company, the Company expects to execute up to &pound;1 billion of share buybacks during 2024.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<div> CFTC, GMAC, recommendations, global markets, digital assets
Summary:
- Addressed challenges in global markets
- GMAC made significant recommendations
- Keynotes from FSB Secretary General
- Discussions on market liquidity and digital asset taxonomy
- Impact on policy approach and international priorities
- Commissioner's two-year anniversary and reflections on the journey
.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p class="paragraph">Good morning.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you to everyone who has joined this meeting, both in person here in Washington, D.C., and virtually, and thank you to my fellow Commissioners.&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to thank the CFTC&rsquo;s Global Markets Advisory Committee (GMAC) leadership team&mdash;Amy Hong, Darcy Bradbury, Brad Tully, Michael Winnike, Allison Lurton, Tara Kruse, Caroline Butler, and Sandy Kaul&mdash;for your continued hard work and commitment to tackling some of the biggest challenges facing global markets, particularly in light of macroeconomic factors, geopolitical dynamics, and the changing world around us.&nbsp;&nbsp;I especially want to recognize the members of the GMAC&rsquo;s Subcommittees and the workstream leads who contributed substantial time and resources to developing the recommendations that we will hear today.</p>
<p class="paragraph">I also want to thank my team&mdash;Harry Jung, the GMAC Designated Federal Officer, and Nicholas Elliot, the GMAC Alternate Designated Federal Officer, as well as Meghan Tente and Taylor Foy for their tireless efforts and dedication to excellence.&nbsp;&nbsp;And, as always, many thanks to all the CFTC staff who are hosting and supporting the GMAC&rsquo;s meeting today.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="paragraph">Looking back, it was just over a year ago that we kicked off the newly-reconstituted GMAC.&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, I noted that it was the 50th&nbsp;anniversary of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which is the genesis of the GMAC and the hundreds of other advisory committees sponsored by government agencies.</p>
<p class="paragraph">This year, we will mark the 50th&nbsp;anniversary of the enactment of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Act of 1974, the legislation that created the current iteration of this agency.&nbsp;&nbsp;I look forward to celebrating the CFTC&rsquo;s proud history and stewardship of our markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;I particularly want to commend the CFTC staff over the years who have worked hard to uphold the CFTC&rsquo;s mission in safeguarding market integrity.&nbsp;&nbsp;At last year&rsquo;s Chairman&rsquo;s Awards ceremony, we recognized employees with 45 years of service.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is amazing to think about the continuity and institutional knowledge that we have here at the agency.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that historical perspective reminds us of our roots in agriculture over a hundred years ago, and helps us stay true to the trust placed in us by the American people.&nbsp;&nbsp;The CFTC is a special place steeped in culture and tradition, and that&rsquo;s why I am honored to serve at the agency for the fourth time in my career.</p>
<p class="paragraph">The GMAC&rsquo;s Progress</p>
<p class="paragraph">As you all know, in the real world you are evaluated on results.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;d like to take a moment to highlight what the GMAC set out to do, what we&rsquo;ve accomplished, and what&rsquo;s to come.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it&rsquo;s clear to see that the GMAC has delivered results and proposed pragmatic solutions to real-world problems.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Last year, we relaunched the GMAC with a public request for feedback on the GMAC&rsquo;s agenda and performed a global stock-take of the most significant issues in markets, as each of you sat in this room and presented.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was incredible to have representation from such a broad swath of market participants, market infrastructures, service providers, commercial end users, and regulators flying in to join us in Washington, DC from over a dozen cities all over the world.</p>
<p class="paragraph">From there, the GMAC published a proposed two-year work program to identify and examine key issues and assess and inform international standards through engagement with international policymakers and authorities in other jurisdictions.&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed work program included global market structure issues, such as U.S. Treasury market reform; asset-liability management and funding markets; market volatility controls; improving liquidity across asset classes with respect to capital, clearing, and collateral requirements; and international alignment of trading and clearing obligations to address market fragmentation.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Proposed technical issues included international standardization and amalgamation of trade reporting for market oversight; global coordination of market events such as closures, drills, or recovery from disruption; efficiencies in post-trade processes; and other infrastructure issues that impact cross-border activity and access to markets.</p>
<p class="paragraph">And, proposed digital asset markets issues included industry standards and best practices for tokenized asset markets including (i) digital assets taxonomy, (ii) pre-trade, execution, and post-trade requirements, and (iii) governance, risk, and control frameworks; the regulation of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and utility tokens; and other issues in digital finance and tokenization of assets, non-financial activities and Web3, and blockchain technology.</p>
<p class="paragraph">The GMAC and its Subcommittees wasted no time getting to work.&nbsp;&nbsp;Last fall, the GMAC met to advance&nbsp;<i>eight</i>&nbsp;recommendations to the Commission<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement030623?utm_source=govdelivery#_edn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;&ndash; the most of any CFTC advisory committee at a single meeting.&nbsp;&nbsp;Those recommendations have already had real impact.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Technical Issues Subcommittee&rsquo;s work on swap data reporting was part of the Commission&rsquo;s consideration when it approved proposed amendments to swap data requirements in December<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement030623?utm_source=govdelivery#_edn2">[2]</a>, and the Subcommittee submitted its recommendations to the public comment file for the proposed rules.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Today&rsquo;s GMAC Meeting</p>
<p class="paragraph">We are again covering significant territory today with presentations and recommendations from each of our Subcommittees.</p>
<p class="paragraph">I want to thank Financial Stability Board (FSB) Secretary General John Schindler for providing today&rsquo;s keynote on the FSB&rsquo;s work program and priorities in 2024.&nbsp;&nbsp;Secretary General Schindler joined the FSB in February 2023, after more than 20 years at the Federal Reserve Board (FRB), most recently as a Senior Associate Director in the FRB&rsquo;s Division of Financial Stability.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an honor to have you here with us today.&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of its mandate, the GMAC and its work program are very much aligned with the work programs of the FSB, International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), and other international standard setters, so your international perspective is very much appreciated here today.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="paragraph">We&rsquo;ll then hear from Michael Winnike on the Global Market Structure Subcommittee&rsquo;s recommendation regarding the use of U.S. Treasury exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as eligible initial margin for uncleared swaps.&nbsp;&nbsp;Michael is a Director and Head of U.S. Market Structure at BlackRock.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is timely for the eligibility of U.S. Treasury ETFs to be considered within the uncleared margin collateral framework given their potential benefits in enhancing market resiliency, liquidity, and efficiency, among other things.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Wendy Yun will provide an update on the Subcommittee&rsquo;s Swap Block and Cap Size Recommendation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Wendy is a Managing Director at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.&nbsp;&nbsp;She&rsquo;s also our SIFMA AMG representative.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Subcommittee has spent considerable time thinking about ways to engage with the Commission in this area to enhance market liquidity and promote financial stability, and I look forward to hearing the update on what next steps could hold.</p>
<p class="paragraph">From the Technical Issues Subcommittee, we&rsquo;ll hear from Charles DeSimone on the recommendation to publish a T+1 securities settlement transition resource document crafted by the Subcommittee.&nbsp;&nbsp;Charles is a Managing Director at SIFMA.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am looking forward to what I am sure will be an incredible resource for the industry during such a significant transition that has global implications.&nbsp;&nbsp;It truly reflects the dedication of the Subcommittee in helping inform and prepare market participants for regulatory implementation.</p>
<p class="paragraph">I&rsquo;m looking forward to our panel discussion on Basel III Endgame: Perspectives from Derivatives Market Participants.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our panelists include:</p>
<ul>
<li class="paragraph">Reggie Griffith, Global Chief Compliance Officer at Louis Dreyfus Company;</li>
<li class="paragraph">Dan Gallagher, Director of Commodity Sales and Trading at Basin Electric Power Cooperative, speaking on behalf of the National Association of Rural Electric Cooperatives;</li>
<li class="paragraph">Elisabeth Kirby, Head of Market Structure at Tradeweb; and</li>
<li class="paragraph">Joseph Hwang, Managing Director at Goldman Sachs. He is representing FIA and ISDA.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="paragraph">I greatly appreciate the diverse perspectives on the panel, especially from commercial end users, given that the derivatives markets originally came to exist in order to facilitate risk management and price discovery for U.S. producers, growers, merchants, and other key pillars of the real economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the CFTC needs to act in this area&mdash;in particular for impacted end users&mdash;this panel&rsquo;s insights could help inform and facilitate any CFTC engagement.&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate the recent discussion hosted by the CFTC&rsquo;s Environmental and Energy Markets Advisory Committee (EEMAC), sponsored by Commissioner Summer Mersinger, to explore the impact of the Basel III endgame proposal on energy markets, and I&rsquo;m glad we can continue that discussion.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Finally, we&rsquo;ll hear from the Digital Asset Markets Subcommittee on its highly anticipated digital asset taxonomy proposal.&nbsp;&nbsp;Presenting this recommendation are:</p>
<ul>
<li class="paragraph">Caroline Butler, Global Head of Digital Assets at BNY Mellon;</li>
<li class="paragraph">Sandy Kaul, Senior Vice President and Head of Digital and Industry Advisory Services at Franklin Templeton;</li>
<li class="paragraph">Adam Farkas, Chief Executive Officer of GFMA and Chief Executive Officer of AFME;</li>
<li class="paragraph">Diana Barrero Zalles, Head of Research and Sustainability at Global Blockchain Business Council; and</li>
<li class="paragraph">Ninad Nirgudka, Consultant at Boston Consulting Group</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="paragraph">The Subcommittee&rsquo;s work coincides with and will help inform the modernization of clearing, settlement, and post-trade processes, and is an important first step in creating a common framework that will grow and adapt over time.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Looking Ahead</p>
<p class="paragraph">I think the takeaway from this meeting today is that the GMAC&rsquo;s work is having a real impact on the policy approach to developing pragmatic solutions to address the most significant issues in global markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have shared the GMAC&rsquo;s recommendations to promote the resiliency and efficiency of global markets with international standard setters and regulatory counterparts around the world, and there has been great interest in the GMAC&rsquo;s work since it is aligned with key international priorities of the FSB and IOSCO.&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the GMAC recommendations can be considered as part of key international working groups and task forces, as you heard earlier today.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also discussed with Chairman Behnam whether some of these recommendations could become new rules here at the CFTC, and I appreciate his leadership in overseeing our markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;I look forward to working with the Chairman and my fellow Commissioners on proposing rules where appropriate.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="paragraph">Next month will mark my two-year anniversary as a Commissioner, and I re-watched our confirmation hearing and re-read my testimony to reflect on our journey so far. I wanted to be a Commissioner to make a difference and to make our markets better.&nbsp;&nbsp;Through all of your efforts, the GMAC is delivering on what we set out to do, and I want to thank you for helping me to make a difference through my leadership as a Commissioner.</p>

<div> Executive Officer, Stephan Leithner, Deutsche Börse AG, Theodor Weimer, Supervisory Board

Summary:<br />
Stephan Leithner appointed new CEO, to co-lead with Theodor Weimer, who will resign in 2024, recognized for expertise in capital markets. <div>
<p>The Supervisory Board of Deutsche B&ouml;rse AG today appointed Stephan Leithner as the company's new Chief Executive Officer. The 57-year-old will take up his new position on 1 October 2024 and initially lead Deutsche B&ouml;rse as a Co-CEO together with Theodor Weimer until the end of the year. Theodor Weimer will then be 65 and resign from the Executive Board. His contract expires at the end of 2024.</p>
<div class="image float--left"><img alt="Stephan Leithner" class="image float--left" src="https://www.deutsche-boerse.com/resource/blob/134408/f97e9bfbec915b390c750a86aae976d2/data/stephan-leithner_173x231.jpg" /></div>
<p>Stephan Leithner has been a member of the Executive Board of Deutsche B&ouml;rse AG since 2018, responsible for Pre- &amp; Post-Trading. His current areas of responsibility include the strategically important Investment Management Solutions segment with ISS STOXX and SimCorp as well as the Group&rsquo;s post-trading business with Clearstream. A decision on his succession will be made in due course.</p>
<p>From 2016 bis 2018, Stephan Leithner served as a partner of EQT, a leading private equity company. Prior to this, he was with Deutsche Bank AG from 2000 to 2015, initially responsible for building up the capital markets and M&amp;A business, and from 2012 as a member of the Executive Board. Before joining Deutsche Bank, he was a partner at McKinsey &amp; Company. Stephan Leithner studied and obtained his PhD at the University of St. Gallen.</p>
<div class="image float--left"><img alt="Martin Jetter" class="image float--left" src="https://www.deutsche-boerse.com/resource/blob/134510/2511b158c45eae4430296cc17cf3cac0/data/jetter.jpg" /></div>

We are convinced that Stephan Leithner has all the prerequisites to continue Deutsche B&ouml;rse's successful development.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking back on Theodor Weimer's term of office, Martin Jetter said: &ldquo;In 2018, Theodor Weimer was faced with the challenge of leading Deutsche B&ouml;rse out of a period of deep uncertainty. He and his team have accomplished this challenge with brilliance. The annualised growth in net revenue and EBITDA of 13 per cent during his term speaks for itself. Today, Deutsche B&ouml;rse is once again a self-confident company that enjoys a high level of public trust. I would like to thank Theodor Weimer for leading Deutsche B&ouml;rse to new strength.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stephan Leithner commented on the Supervisory Board's decision: &ldquo;I would like to thank the Supervisory Board for this vote of confidence and I am delighted to take on my new role.

The challenge now is to further realise this potential across the Group to shape the markets of the future.&rdquo;</p>

<div> supervised, FMUs, operational risk management, cyber resilience, compliance
Summary: 
The Federal Reserve Board finalized rule updates for systemically important financial market utilities, emphasizing incident management, business continuity, third-party risk, and cyber resilience. FMUs must comply within 180 days. <div>
<p>The Federal Reserve Board on Friday announced a final rule that updates risk management requirements for certain systemically important financial market utilities (FMUs) supervised by the Board. FMUs provide essential infrastructure to clear and settle payments and other financial transactions to allow financial markets and the broader economy to function effectively.</p>
<p>The final updates provide additional clarity and specificity to existing requirements in four key areas of operational risk management: incident management and notification; business continuity management and planning; third-party risk management; and review and testing of operational risk management measures. For example, the updates explicitly require FMUs to establish an incident management framework and emphasize the need for FMUs to continue to advance their cyber resilience capabilities.</p>
<p>The final updates are substantively similar to the proposal and largely consistent with existing measures that FMUs take to comply with the current requirements.</p>
<p>FMUs subject to the rule must be in compliance with certain updates by 90 days and all updates by 180 days after publication in the&nbsp;<em>Federal Register</em>.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> agro & food industry, property & construction, financials, mai-listed companies, operating profits<br />
Summary: In 2023, mai-listed companies saw a 2.1% increase in total sales but a 10.2% decrease in operating profits. Agro & Food, Property & Construction, and Financials industries experienced growth.<br /> <div>
<ul>
<li><b>2023 total sales up 2.1% to THB 200 bln</b></li>
<li><b style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit;">Yearly operating profits down 10.2% to THB12.19 bln</b></li>
<li><b style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit;">Agro &amp; Food Industry, Property &amp; Construction and Financials Industry Groups</b><b style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit;"> saw higher growth in sales and net profits</b></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Market for Alternative Investment (mai)-listed companies reported a 2.1 percent year-on-year increase in the combined sales to THB 200.18 billion (approx. USD 5.75 billion) in 2023. However, a 0.5 percent rise in 2023 cost of goods sold to THB 147.99 billion and a 13.4 percent increase in selling, general and administrative expense (SG&amp;A) erode operating profits, decreasing 10.2 percent from a year earlier. Agro &amp; Food Industry, Property &amp; Construction and Financials were the three industry groups recorded growth in both sales and profits.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>mai President Prapan Charoenprawatt said that 207 mai-listed companies or 96 percent of the total 215 companies (excluding those in the non-compliance or NC group and those with different accounting period close) submitted their financial reports. Of the total, 148 listed companies, accounting for 72 percent of those submitted financial statements, delivered net profits.</p>
<p>Despite an increase in gross profit margin (GPM) to 26.1 percent in 2023 from 24.9 percent in the previous year, their operating profit dropped by 10.2 percent to THB12.19 billion and net profit fell by 35.1 percent to THB 5.90 billion largely due to the 13.4 percent increase in SG&amp;A expense.</p>
<p>"In 2023, most of listed companies saw the higher sales, in the wake of the country&rsquo;s reopening but the rise in SG&amp;A expense bumped up by the rising economic activities, coupled with higher financial costs lowered listed companies&rsquo; profitability. Nevertheless, three industry groups, namely the Agro &amp; Food Industry, the Property &amp; construction, and the Financials continued to show growth in both sales and net profits," added Prapan.</p>
<p>In terms of financial position, mai-listed companies&rsquo; total assets at the end of 2023 rose 10.11 percent from the previous year to THB 339.05 billion. The overall financial structure was strengthened, with debt-to-equity ratio (D/E ratio) of 0.79 times, down from 0.81 times at the end of 2022.</p>
<p>As of March 7, 2024, there were 215 mai-listed companies. mai index closed at 409.80 points, with the total market capitalization of THB 414.24 billion and average daily trading value of THB 2.02 billion.</p>

<div> companies, sales, profits, SG&amp;A, Thailand<br />
Summary:<br />
Listed companies' total sales and net profits decreased due to lower oil and agricultural prices, higher SG&amp;A, and high interest rates in Thailand. Mai-listed companies also saw a decline in profits. <br /><br /> <div>
<ul>
<li><b>SET-listed companies&rsquo; total sales down 2.6% in 2023 to THB 17.23 trn</b></li>
<li><b style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit;">2023 net profits down 10.7% on higher SG&amp;A</b></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Listed companies&rsquo; total sales and net profits fell in 2023, dragged down by operating performance of oil-related and Agro &amp; Food Industry Groups. Tourism-related and Technology Industry Groups continuously delivered growth.</p>
<p><b>Senior Executive Vice President of The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) Manpong Senanarong</b> said that 817 companies, representing 99.51 percent of 821 companies listed on SET and Market for Alternative Investment (mai) (excluding property funds and infrastructure funds) reported the 2023 financial performance, ending December 31, 2023. A total of 626 companies posted net profits, accounting for 76.62 percent of SET- and mai-listed companies that submitted their financial statements.</p>
<p>SET-listed companies&rsquo; total sales fell 2.6 percent to THB 17.23 trillion in 2023 (approx. USD 496.40 billion). Production costs were down 2.2 percent while selling, general and administrative expense (SG&amp;A) rose 3.9 percent, resulting in a 12.4 percent decline in core operating profits to THB 1.65 trillion and a 10.7 percent fall in net profits to THB 961.04 billion.</p>
<p>Regarding financial position, Thai listed firms, excluding the Financials Industry Group, had a debt-to-equity ratio (D/E ratio) at 1.51 times as of December 31, 2023, down from 1.54 times over the same period a year before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The overall sales and net profits lowered, affected by the decline in prices of various commodities including oil, agricultural products and food; the rise in SG&amp;A expense; and interest rates which stay at high level. However, tourism-related industry such as aviation, hotels, space rental, retail, and telecommunications apparently turned around and continuously grew owing to the government policies,&rdquo; added Manpong.</p>
<p>As for the operating results of mai-listed companies in 2023, total sales rose 2.1 percent to THB 200.18 billion. Production costs which rose by 0.5 percent to THB 147.99 billion and SG&amp;A expense which increased by 13.4 percent to THB 40.01 billion took a bite out of operating profits and net profits which fell 10.2 percent and 35.1 percent to THB 12.19 billion and THB 5.90 billion, respectively.&nbsp;</p>

Summary:<br />Keisha Bell, Head of Talent Management at DTCC, reaffirms their commitment to diversity, equity, inclusion, mentorship, and empowerment for women in the workplace. <div>
<p><img alt="Keisha_DTCC" src="https://mondovisione.com/_assets/images/Keisha_DTCC.jpg" title="Keisha_DTCC" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit;">&nbsp;</b><b style="font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit;">Keisha Bell, Managing Director, Head of Talent Management and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) at DTCC</b></p>
<p><b>Keisha Bell,&nbsp;<span lang="EN-US">Head of Talent Management and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) at DTCC,<b>&nbsp;commenting on&nbsp;<span>of International Women's Day, said:</span></b></span></b></p>
<p>&ldquo;On International Women's Day, we renew our commitment to fostering a workplace where every voice is heard, every talent is recognized, and every woman has the opportunity to rise.</p>
<p>At DTCC, we stand firm in our dedication to diversity, equity, and inclusion.&nbsp; It is through the collective strength of all voices that we drive innovation, inspire change, and shape a brighter future for generations to come. These core values guide us in developing strategies that enable us to reach our full potential, achieve business goals and deliver maximum client value.</p>
<p>Our vision is clear: to foster an environment where every voice is welcomed and valued. A significant focus for DTCC is using research, data, analysis and thoughtful recommendations to continue to evolve our ways of working so that we can more effectively serve our clients and the financial services industry. Doing so enables us to identify organizational patterns and opportunities for improvement, all to foster a more inclusive workplace where everyone can thrive.</p>
<p>One area of focus has been addressing the concept of the "broken rung" phenomenon, which can hinder women's progress as they climb the career ladder. Through initiatives like DTCC's Emerging Women Leaders (EWL) program, we've worked tirelessly to provide women with the support, mentorship, and networking opportunities they need to excel. And our efforts have yielded tangible results: our analysis has shown that participating in mentorship activities and programs like EWL directly correlates with increased networking diversity and career advancement.</p>
<p>Further, through initiatives like the Girls Who Code program and our DTCC Future Stars program, we aim to provide opportunities for young women to learn, network and explore future career opportunities. By fostering mentorship, education, and support, we believe in creating a more equitable and inclusive environment where women can thrive and contribute their talents to our collective success.</p>
<p>This International Women&rsquo;s Day, we reaffirm our commitment to the pursuit of gender equality and empowerment in the workplace and beyond. Together, we can continue to drive positive change and build a future where every individual has the opportunity to thrive in a fair working environment.&rdquo;</p>

<br />
BME commemorates International Women's Day with Honorary Bell Ringing for Gender Equality. Over 100 stock exchanges join initiative promoting gender equality. UN Global Compact and CNMV participate.
<br /><br />Summary: 
BME marks International Women's Day with a Bell Ringing event for Gender Equality, joined by over 100 stock exchanges, promoting UN Global Compact's sustainable goals. <div>

<ul>
<li>More than 100 stock exchanges around the world join the initiative, which celebrates its tenth anniversary this year</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BME, who operates the Spanish stock exchange, commemorates International Women's Day with an Honorary Bell Ringing for Gender Equality. The event is part of the&nbsp;<a href="https://sseinitiative.org/sse-event/2024-ring-the-bell-for-gender-equality/">Ring the Bell for Gender Equality initiative</a>&nbsp;promoted by the World Federation of Exchanges and Sustainable Stock Exchanges together with Global Compact, UN Woman and IFC. This is the seventh consecutive time that BME has joined this initiative, which this year celebrates its tenth anniversary. It aims to promote gender equality and empowerment of women in their work environment, the financial community, and to raise awareness of the benefits of doing so.</p>
<p>Ring the Bell For Gender Equality is celebrated in more than a hundred financial centers around the world, including the Zurich Stock Exchange, managed by SIX Group, which owns BME.</p>
<p>Cristina S&aacute;nchez, executive director of the United Nations Global Compact Spain, and Monserrat Mart&iacute;nez-Parera, vice-president of the CNMV, took part in the ringing of the bell. They were accompanied by Javier Hernani, CEO of BME, and Beatriz Alonso-Majagranzas, Director of Markets.</p>
<p><span>Cristina S&aacute;nchez</span>&nbsp;highlighted that 83% of the IBEX 35&reg; has a gender equality policy and 91% have set targets to increase the representation of women in the workforce and in decision-making bodies. "However, there is still much to be done. Investing in women is an imperative for building fair societies," she said.</p>
<p>For&nbsp;<span>Monserrat Mart&iacute;nez Parera</span>, the presence of women in the private sector has improved and today listed companies are close to the CNMV's Good Governance Code recommendation of 40%, although less than 10% reach executive positions. "The Spanish business reality is broad and the measures cannot be the same for everyone, but with a good diagnosis and good incentives we will achieve a more inclusive society that favors progress for everyone", she concluded.</p>
<p>"The stock exchange plays a dual role in promoting gender equality," said&nbsp;<span>Javier Hernani</span>. "On the one hand, as a company, and with respect to our stakeholders. On the other, as a reference and mirror in which to look, since listed companies are those that meet the best governance standards."&nbsp;<span>Beatriz Alonso-Majagranzas</span>&nbsp;pointed out that the development of stock market indices, together with ESG bonds, is one of the ways in which BME promotes the Sustainable Development Goals, and added: "All listed companies want to be part of the IBEX&reg; Gender Equality and this concern is one more traction to improve the ratios of gender representation in their main decision-making bodies.</p>
<p>BME has been part of the United Nations Global Compact since 2011 and of the Sustainable Stock Exchanges initiative, which seeks to promote sustainable investment through the Sustainable Development Goals established by the UN for the 2030 Agenda, since 2015.</p>

<title>Impacts Of EU Gas Storage Regulations Examined In New ACER-CEER Consultancy Study</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> study, impact, gas storage regulations, ACER, CEER
Summary: The study examines EU Member States' gas storage measures and makes recommendations for their improvement, including support schemes and congestion management mechanisms. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>Today, ACER and the Council of European Energy Regulators (CEER) publish&nbsp;<a href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtTAAdQWQdUUEwKUFVSHVYBA1MdUwlQUBoEAQIDUVYBDlUHVVMdWFNWU11VB1cdBwtRUx0GCFRRGg1RUg4ZVgAPVFRTBFlZBltVRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" target="_blank">the second part of a two-fold consultancy study</a>&nbsp;on the impact of the EU and national gas storage regulations.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is the study about?</span></p>
<p>ACER and CEER commissioned a consultancy (VIS Economic &amp; Energy Consultants) to analyse the measures adopted by Member States to strengthen the use of underground storage facilities in the EU and their contribution to the objectives of the EU gas storage regulation.</p>
<p>The first part of the study (<a href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtSAwQDA1RSV0wOVAZSHVZcVAIdCw8BUxoHAVUBBQJXBgdSUwAdWFNWU11VB1cdBwtRUx0GCFRRGg1RUg4ZVgAPVFRTBFlZBltVRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" target="_blank">published in October 2023</a>) focused on collecting and assessing storage measures recently applied by EU Member States. This second part assesses storage arrangements in Member States without gas storage facilities, identifies lessons learnt and makes recommendations for better use and implementation of storage measures.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the key lessons learnt and recommendations?</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Support schemes for storage:&nbsp;</strong>They have motivated market participants to use storage, especially when contracting capacity is linked with filling targets. These schemes should complement storage users&rsquo; obligations.</li>
<li><strong>Storage filling of last resort:&nbsp;</strong>The efficiency of this measure could be enhanced by facilitating access to futures markets for price hedging and by implementing a strategy for releasing gas stocks back into the market.</li>
<li><strong>Cross-border impacts and cost recovery</strong>: The release of gas stocks should not oblige entities to reserve excess capacity at cross-border interconnection points (IPs). Cost recovery mechanisms should not include charges and levies imposed at IPs.</li>
<li><strong>Use-it-or-lose-it mechanism of storage capacity</strong>: A congestion management mechanism, including a streamlined process for capacity release at specific milestones, is useful for efficient use of storage capacity.</li>
<li><strong>Contracts for differences (CfDs):</strong>&nbsp;They should be defined and offered well in advance of the injection period. Direct subsidies should be provided as a last resort only if the interest in CfDs is limited.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><span><span>Bose concludes: &ldquo;In an ever-changing VC landscape, the decline in late-stage funding rounds across APAC reflects a cautious investor sentiment. However, it also presents an opportunity for early-stage startups to shine, demonstrating their agility and potential to disrupt industries.&rdquo;</span></span></span></p>

<div> Fund inflows, Stock Connect, GEM listing reforms, license applications, public awareness<br />
Summary:<br /> 
Asset management inflows surged. Stock Connect trading increased. GEM listing reforms approved. License applications rose. Public warned of investment risks. Collaboration against fraudulent activities established. <div>
<p>The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) today published its latest&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sfc.hk/-/media/EN/files/COM/QR-Reports/202310-12/0-SFC-Quarterly-Report-OctDec-2023EN.pdf?rev=40806423ee184141ae0f28279cddb359" target="_blank">Quarterly Report</a>&nbsp;to provide operational and financial highlights for the quarter ending 31 December 2023.</p>
<p>The asset management space fared strongly during the quarter. Net fund inflows into Hong Kong domiciled funds surged 179% quarter-on-quarter to HK$33.5 billion. For full-year 2023, these inflows jumped 92.9% year-on-year (YoY) to HK$87.1 billion. As at 31 December, the assets under management of the 914 Hong Kong-domiciled funds increased 4.9% YoY. In addition, the SFC authorised Asia&rsquo;s first and the world&rsquo;s largest exchange-traded fund investing in Saudi Arabian listed stocks, which listed in November.</p>
<p>Mainland-Hong Kong Stock Connect kept up its momentum. Average daily northbound trading rose 8% YoY in 2023 whilst average daily southbound trading remained steady. Their shares in both Mainland and Hong Kong stock market turnovers increased. Moreover, both northbound and southbound trading recorded net buys last year, amounting to RMB43.7 billion and RMB292.9 billion.</p>
<p>To facilitate the development of the listing market, the SFC approved rule amendments for GEM listing reforms by the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited, which introduced&nbsp;a new route for GEM listing and a streamlined mechanism for Main Board transfer. During the quarter, the SFC processed 135 listing applications, totalling 270 for full-year 2023, with average processing time reduced by 11% YoY to 108 business days.</p>
<p>The number of SFC licensees and registrants remained stable at 48,091 (Note 1) as of 31 December. Licence applications received rose 16% YoY for the whole year (Note 2) and picked up 8% YoY for the quarter. Of the 56 licensed corporation applications approved by the SFC in the quarter (Note 3), Type 9 (asset management) and Type 4 (advising on securities) regulated activities accounted for 88% and 66%. Six virtual asset trading platforms (VATPs) submitted their corporate licence applications during the quarter (Note 4).&nbsp;</p>
<p>To raise the public&rsquo;s awareness of investment scams and risks, the SFC warned the public against VA-related frauds and suspicious investment products through press briefings, press releases, social media posts and alert lists (Note 5). It also launched a comprehensive publicity campaign, including a television drama, debuting a YouTube channel, radio broadcasts, bus advertisements and online banners.</p>
<p>In an effort to combat fraudulent activities, the SFC also established a joint working group with the Hong Kong Police Force to enhance collaboration on monitoring and investigating VA-related illegal activities. The SFC and the Police have been sharing information twice a week since December to promptly address potential fraud.</p>
<p>The quarterly report is available on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sfc.hk/en/Published-resources/Corporate-publications/Quarterly-report" target="_blank">SFC website</a>.<br /><br /></p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Comprising 3,257 licensed corporations, 112 registered institutions and 44,722 individuals.</li>
<li>Around 7,200 licence applications were received, including around 7,000 individuals and 185 corporations.</li>
<li>Each licensed corporation may have multiple SFC regulated activity licences.</li>
<li>A total of 24 applications under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance were received when the deadline for licence applications under the transitional arrangements of the VATP licensing regime closed on 29 February 2024.&nbsp;</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) have released final rules and further guidance to support the financial services industry in implementing the Financial Accountability Regime (FAR).</p>
<p>The FAR, which replaces the Banking Executive Accountability Regime (BEAR), imposes a stronger responsibility and accountability framework for APRA-regulated entities in the banking, insurance and superannuation industries and their directors as well as their most senior executives. In doing so, the FAR aims to improve the risk and governance cultures of those financial institutions.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s package includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Regulator rules, which prescribe information for inclusion in the FAR register of accountable persons,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2024L00285/latest/text" target="_top"><em>Financial Accountability Regime Act (Information for register) Regulator Rules 2024</em></a>,</li>
<li>the Transitional rules, which prescribe information to be provided by authorised deposit-taking institutions (ADIs) in relation to their existing accountable persons under the BEAR at the transition point to the FAR,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2024L00286/latest/text" target="_top"><em>Financial Accountability Regime (Consequential Amendments) Transitional Rules 2024</em></a>,</li>
<li>descriptions of ADI key functions to assist banking entities in the allocation of key functions, and</li>
<li>reporting form instructions to assist banking entities in providing the required information to ASIC and APRA.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The release of these materials follows a joint public&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2023-releases/23-194mr-apra-and-asic-commence-early-consultation-on-far/" title="23-194MR APRA and ASIC commence early consultation on FAR">consultation</a>&nbsp;on the draft Regulator rules, Transitional rules and ADI key functions descriptions.</p>
<p>ASIC and APRA have also issued a joint letter summarising key issues raised during consultation and their response, including the collection of information and data for the FAR register and the concept and application of key functions.</p>
<p>The finalised rules and guidance complement the&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2023-releases/23-265mr-apra-and-asic-commence-joint-administration-of-the-new-financial-accountability-regime/" title="23-265MR APRA and ASIC commence joint administration of the new Financial Accountability Regime">FAR information package released on 3 October 2023</a>&nbsp;by ASIC and APRA.</p>
<p>The FAR will come into force for the banking industry on 15 March 2024 and for the superannuation and insurance industries on 15 March 2025. ASIC and APRA will next consult on the proposed key functions for insurance and superannuation entities.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Skechers U.S.A. Inc., a footwear company based in California, agreed to settle charges for failing to disclose payments for the benefit of its executives and their immediate family members. Skechers agreed to pay a $1.25 million civil penalty to settle the SEC&rsquo;s charges.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s order, from 2019 through 2022, Skechers did not comply with related person transaction disclosure requirements when it failed to disclose its employment of two relatives of its executives and did not disclose a consulting relationship involving a person who shared a household with one of its executives. Furthermore, according to the SEC&rsquo;s order, for multiple years, Skechers failed to disclose that two of its executives owed more than $120,000 to the company for personal expenses that had been paid for by Skechers but not yet reimbursed by the executives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disclosure of related person transactions provides important information for investors to evaluate the overall relationship between a company and its officers and directors,&rdquo; said Scott A. Thompson, Associate Director of Enforcement in the SEC&rsquo;s Philadelphia Regional Office. &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s action is a reminder that companies should take appropriate measures to ensure proper disclosure of such transactions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that Skechers violated reporting and proxy solicitation provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s findings, Skechers agreed to a cease-and-desist order and to pay the civil monetary penalty referenced above.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Oreste P. McClung and Brian R. Higgins and was supervised by Brendan P. McGlynn, Mr. Thompson, and Nicholas P. Grippo, all with the Philadelphia Regional Office.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/About/AdvisoryCommittees/GMAC">Global Markets Advisory Committee</a>&nbsp;(GMAC), sponsored by Commissioner Caroline D. Pham, advanced three new recommendations to promote U.S. Treasury markets resiliency and efficiency, provide resources on the upcoming transition to T+1 securities settlement, and publish a first-ever digital asset taxonomy to support U.S. regulatory clarity and international alignment.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&ldquo;A year ago, the relaunched GMAC set out to develop pragmatic solutions to address the most significant issues in our markets,&rdquo; Commissioner Pham said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud of the real impact the GMAC continues to deliver to enhance resiliency and efficiency in global markets and ensure a level playing field. With this latest set of recommendations, the GMAC has now published a total of 11 recommendations spanning U.S. Treasury market liquidity, well-functioning repo and funding markets, exchange volatility controls, T+1 securities settlement, better collateral management, CCP default simulation, and improvement of trade reporting data to monitor systemic risk.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Commissioner Pham added, &ldquo;In a major step forward, the digital asset taxonomy framework provides valuable foundational guidelines to further advance the discussion and promote U.S. regulatory clarity, and was extensively vetted by stakeholders such as regulatory authorities, financial institutions, asset managers, market infrastructures, and service providers. I&rsquo;m grateful to all of the GMAC and Subcommittee members, especially the workstream leads, and the GMAC leadership team for their substantial work.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Each recommendation was approved without objection at the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/Events/opaeventgmac030624">GMAC meeting</a>&nbsp;Wednesday, March 6. The meeting also included a keynote presentation from Financial Stability Board (FSB) Secretary General John Schindler on the FSB&rsquo;s 2024 work program and priorities, a panel discussion on the impact of the Basel III endgame proposal on derivatives markets and access to clearing, and an update on the GMAC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8860-24#:~:text=GMSS%20Recommendation%201%20%E2%80%93%20New%20Block%20and%20Cap%20Sizes">earlier recommendation</a>&nbsp;regarding appropriately calibrated swap block and cap sizes to enhance market liquidity and financial stability<span>.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Recommendations</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><i>Global Market Structure Subcommittee Recommendation - Inclusion of U.S. Treasury ETFs as Eligible Initial Margin Collateral [forthcoming[</i></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The use of exchange traded funds (ETFs) that invest in U.S. Treasury bonds has dramatically increased in recent years. While standalone U.S. Treasury bonds can be used as initial margin (IM) collateral for uncleared swaps, ETFs that invest in them are not similarly eligible as collateral, despite being more diversified which can mitigate idiosyncratic risk.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>During many historic volatile trading sessions, certain UST ETFs have acted globally as &ldquo;shock absorbers,&rdquo; providing real-time prices and liquidity. Most notably, during the bond market volatility in 2020, volatility increased in U.S. Treasury bonds as dealers&rsquo; balance sheets were constrained. During this time, many UST ETFs traded at tighter bid-ask spreads than their portfolio of underlying bonds. For example, dislocations in U.S. Treasuries caused the bid/ask spreads of &ldquo;off-the-run&rdquo; bonds with a maturity of 20+ years to widen to almost 20 times that of the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The inclusion of U.S. Treasury ETFs as eligible IM collateral under the CFTC Margin Rules for Covered Swap Entities would enhance the robustness and resilience of the collateral pipeline. This enhancement, driven by factors such as diversification, liquidity, efficiency, and market stability, could prove beneficial for end-users seeking a wider range of eligible IM, CSEs and the broader financial markets. Allowing UST ETFs as IM collateral could not only help safeguard CSEs from counterparty default, but also help reduce the overall risk in the financial system and limit the potential for contagion arising from uncleared swaps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The GMAC recommends the CFTC expand the universe of liquid assets that can be posted as uncleared margin, specifically to include U.S. Treasury ETFs.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i>Technical Issues Subcommittee Recommendation</i></span><i>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;</i><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/10326/GMAC_T+1_Resources_030624/download"><i>Publication of Resource Document to Support Transition to T+1 Securities Settlement</i></a></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>As the United States prepares to transition to next-day trade settlement (T+1) for securities in May 2024, the Subcommittee crafted a resource document to support market participants. The document details products covered by the transition to T+1, timelines for transition in various markets, and the benefits to the transition. The document also highlights the implications T+1 has for various markets &ndash; particularly foreign exchange markets, and&nbsp;discusses its impacts on transaction processes for various products, including cross-border impacts. Further, it provides a list of resources to help firms prepare for the transition.</span></span></p>
<p><span><i><span><span>Digital Asset Markets Subcommittee Recommendation</span></span></i></span><i><span><span>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;</span></span></i><span><span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/10321/CFTC_GMAC_DAM_Classification_Approach_and_Taxonomy_for_Digital_Assets_030624/download"><i>Adoption of an Approach for the Classification and Understanding of Digital Assets</i></a></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>A clear,&nbsp;consensus-driven&nbsp;approach to&nbsp;classifying assets&nbsp;and the functions they serve underpins robust markets&nbsp;and&nbsp;effective regulation.&nbsp;The&nbsp;evolving&nbsp;digital asset&nbsp;ecosystem&nbsp;has&nbsp;led&nbsp;many&nbsp;to develop proprietary&nbsp;taxonomies to classify&nbsp;digital assets&nbsp;and their related technology.&nbsp;In recognition of this progress,&nbsp;the&nbsp;Subcommittee has&nbsp;engaged&nbsp;digital asset&nbsp;stakeholders across&nbsp;the broader&nbsp;digital asset ecosystem&nbsp;to build a common approach for the classification and understanding of digital assets.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This approach aims to set out consistent language for participants in the digital asset ecosystem to promote innovation, identify and address risk considerations, and enable effective regulatory understanding. With this objective in mind, the approach builds upon the considerable classification efforts of global prudential standard setters and regional authorities, including the Bank for International Settlements, the Financial Stability Board and others.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The GMAC recommends this approach be considered an initial basis for a consensus-driven, functional taxonomy. However, as the digital asset ecosystem continues to evolve, so too will the terminology used to classify it. The Subcommittee will reassess any future developments to provide further recommendations to this approach, based on the guidance of its members. The Subcommittee seeks to support effective rules and regulations for digital assets, and recommends continued collaboration between industry, standard-setting bodies, and the regulatory community.</span></span></p>

<div> SEC, Investor Advisory Committee, equity market structure reform, materiality, Predictive Data Analytics<br />
Summary:<br />
- Discussion of SEC's equity market structure reform proposals
- Concerns about climate disclosure rule not based in materiality
- Consideration of draft recommendation on Predictive Data Analytics proposal
- Critique of rushed discussions and changes to draft recommendation
- Appreciation for departing Investor Advisory Committee members <div>
<p>Thank you, Christopher [Mirabile]. Good morning and thank you to our assembled Committee members and panelists for your participation in this first gathering of the Investor Advisory Committee for 2024. It is wonderful to see you all here in person. As you know, this is also, sadly, the last meeting of the IAC for Christopher Mirabile, Cien Asoera, Ted Daniels, Elissa Germaine, and Lori Lucas. Being selected as a member of the Investor Advisory Committee is an honor, but it comes at a cost. I appreciate each of you for the time and energy that you have dedicated to the IAC during your terms.</p>
<p>I look forward to the panel discussion on the Commission&rsquo;s 2022 equity market structure reform proposals. We adopted the first&mdash;and least controversial&mdash;of these rules yesterday, and now the question is whether and, if so, when and in what form the Commission will move forward on the remaining proposals to change equity market structure. Each of the remaining rules raises significant questions, including, in connection with at least a couple of them, what problem are we trying to solve? Assessing the improved execution quality information that will come from yesterday&rsquo;s Rule 605 amendments once they are implemented should help us answer those questions. Today&rsquo;s discussion also will be helpful as we think through those questions.</p>
<p>The second panel on materiality coincidentally relates to the other rule the Commission adopted yesterday&mdash;the long-awaited climate disclosure rule for public companies. I did not support the climate rule, in part because&mdash;despite protestations to the contrary&mdash;it is not based in materiality. Climate-related information may be material, but our rule presumes that a highly detailed set of climate disclosures is material across all companies. Information is material if there is a substantial likelihood that an objectively reasonable investor would consider the information important to an investment or voting decision. All reasonable investors value financial returns, but they may diverge on which non-economic considerations are important. A regime rooted in materiality helps companies inform investors without serving up a blizzard of immaterial information. Moving away from materiality, or changing it to allow for the consideration of non-economic interests, as I said yesterday, &ldquo;could trigger a hodgepodge of requirements tailored to meet the demands of a vast and ever-expanding panoply of special interests.&rdquo; What is the limiting principle? Specific to the climate rule, but illustrative of the danger of redefining materiality, I would be curious to hear what the Panelists and Committee members think a materiality determination would look like with respect to greenhouse gas emissions. (Yesterday&rsquo;s rule requires disclosure of Scopes 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions only when they are material.)</p>
<p>The Committee also will consider a draft recommendation concerning the Commission&rsquo;s recent Predictive Data Analytics proposal.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-iac-030724?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;Today&rsquo;s draft recommendation supersedes the draft recommendation introduced&mdash;but not voted on&mdash;at the Committee&rsquo;s December 7 meeting.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-iac-030724?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2">[2]</a>&nbsp;While I am interested in hearing today&rsquo;s discussion on the recommendation, I would have liked to see more time allotted to it. The discussion of the draft recommendation at the last meeting seemed rushed. Other conversations about the draft recommendation apparently had taken place before the meeting, including with non-Committee members. Based on those conversations, it seems that a decision was made to rewrite the recommendation before putting it up for a vote. I would have liked to hear more about why this decision was made, particularly because the draft before the Committee today is quite different from the last draft. I would like to understand the rationale for the specific changes and to hear from all Committee members their thoughts on the draft recommendation. What, for instance, explains the notable departure from the December 7 draft&rsquo;s emphasis on the often-curative role disclosure plays when a conflict is present and the concerns that the proposed rule could upend that?<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-iac-030724?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3">[3]</a>&nbsp;And why is today&rsquo;s draft toned down so considerably?<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-remarks-iac-030724?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4">[4]</a>&nbsp;The half hour allotted to discussion makes it impossible to get a full view into why the draft changed and what Committee members think of the controversial predictive data analytics rulemaking to which the recommendation pertains. I do not want to cut the other interesting discussions on today&rsquo;s agenda short, but the Committee should set its schedule to allow robust public deliberation on recommendations.</p>
<p>Thank you all once more for your willingness to dedicate so much of your time and passion to the Investor Advisory Committee, and farewell, to our departing members. I also wish to thank Cristina Martin-Firvida, Marc Sharma, and Toni Tornatore for their work. I very much look forward to the discussions to come.</p>

(&ldquo;For example, Regulation Best Interest allows a broker-dealer to have a limited product set such as distributing only mutual funds advised by an affiliate. Additionally, some investment advisers only offer investments in the funds they manage. These practices are permissible under Regulation Best Interest and the Adviser Fiduciary Duty Interpretation with full and fair disclosure. However, under the PDA Rule Proposal, a broker-dealer or investment adviser cannot simply disclose the conflict of interest related to covered technologies, they must &lsquo;eliminate or neutralize&rsquo; that conflict. The obligation to eliminate or neutralize the conflict is without regard to whether it can be fully and fairly disclosed. Clearly, deeply complex and opaque artificial intelligence algorithms cannot be fully and fairly disclosed, and the IAC is not proposing that they be handled with disclosure. But some adjacent and more benign and understandable technologies might be adequately handled by a disclosure-based approach. The PDA Rule Proposal appears to assume that any interests or conflicts related to covered technologies may never be adequately disclosed.&rdquo;).&nbsp;<i>Id</i>. at 7-8.</p>

Summary:<br />Canadian Securities Administrators published revised guidance on ESG-related investment fund disclosure, addressing various areas including marketing and fund names. Staff Notice summarizes ESG-focused reviews. <div>
<p><span>The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) today published&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.asc.ca/-/media/ASC-Documents-part-1/Regulatory-Instruments/2024/03/6132649-CSA-Staff-Notice-81-334-Revised-ESG-related-Investment-Fund-Discl.ashx">updated guidance</a><span>&nbsp;for investment funds on disclosure practices as they relate to environmental, social and governance (</span><strong>ESG</strong><span>) matters.</span><br /><br /><span>The revised notice does not change the guidance that was published in</span><a href="https://www.asc.ca/-/media/ASC-Documents-part-1/Regulatory-Instruments/2022/01/6000339-v2-CSA_Staff_Notice_ESG-Related_Investment_Fund_Disclosure.ashx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;January 2022</a><span>. It addresses matters that were not covered in the original notice and reflects developments and issues that have arisen since. The update also includes guidance addressing different levels of disclosure expectations for funds whose investment objectives do not reference ESG factors but that use ESG strategies.

<div> consultation, Basel Committee, G-SIB framework, window-dressing, banking supervision
Summary:
The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is consulting on G-SIB framework revisions to address window-dressing behavior, requiring average indicator values reporting. <div>
<ul>
<li>The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has published a consultation on potential measures to address window-dressing behaviour in the context of the framework for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). </li>
<li>Potential revisions would require banks to report and disclose the indicators used to calculate G-SIB scores based on average values over the reporting year, rather than year-end values. </li>
<li>The Committee invites comments on the consultation by 7 June 2024. </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued today a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d571.htm"><span class="firstword">consultation</span></a>&nbsp;on revisions to the global systemically important bank (G-SIB) assessment framework aimed at mitigating "window-dressing" behaviour by some banks in the context of the G-SIB framework.</p>
<p>Such regulatory arbitrage behaviour seeks to temporarily reduce banks' perceived systemic footprint around the reference dates used for the reporting and public disclosure of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/gsib/index.htm"><span class="firstword">G-SIB</span>&nbsp;scores</a>.</p>
<p>As noted&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs_nl20.htm"><span class="firstword">previously</span></a>&nbsp;by the Committee, window-dressing by banks is unacceptable. Such behaviour undermines the intended policy objectives of the Committee's standards and risks disrupting the operations of financial markets.</p>
<p>The proposed revisions aim at constraining banks' ability to lower their G-SIB scores through window-dressing. This will be achieved by requiring banks participating in the G-SIB assessment exercise to report and disclose most G-SIB indicators based on an average of values over the reporting year, rather than year-end values. An accompanying&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/wp42.htm"><span class="firstword">working</span>&nbsp;paper</a>&nbsp;sets out the analysis supporting the consultation.</p>
<div class="bisobjboxbulletpoints" id="bullet">
<p>The Committee welcomes comments on all aspects of the consultation from stakeholders. Comments should be submitted&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/commentupload.htm"><span class="firstword">here</span></a>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<strong>7 June 2024</strong>. All comments will be published on the website of the Bank for International Settlements unless a respondent specifically requests confidential treatment.</p>
</div>
<p>Also published today is a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/wp41.htm"><span class="firstword">working</span>&nbsp;paper</a>&nbsp;assessing G-SIB score dynamics over the past decade.</p>
<p><em>Background:&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>The Basel Committee is the primary global standard setter for the prudential regulation of banks and provides a forum for cooperation on banking supervisory matters. Its mandate is to strengthen the regulation, supervision and practices of banks worldwide with the purpose of enhancing financial stability. The Committee reports to the Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision and seeks its endorsement for major decisions. The Committee has no formal supranational authority, and its decisions have no legal force. Rather, the Committee relies on its members' commitments to achieve its mandate. The Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision is chaired by Tiff Macklem, Governor of the Bank of Canada. The Basel Committee is chaired by Pablo Hern&aacute;ndez de Cos, Governor of the Bank of Spain.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Working papers contain technical analysis on topical subjects carried out by Committee experts, working groups, BCBS member institutions or the Secretariat. The views expressed in the working papers are those of their authors and do not represent the official views of the Committee, its member institutions or the BIS.</em></p>

<br />
The Canadian Securities Administrators reminds Canadians to be vigilant of investment scams, verify sources, work with professionals, and educate themselves about potential risks.
<br /><br />Summary: 
The CSA urges Canadians to be cautious of investment fraud, verify information sources, work with registered professionals, and educate themselves about potential risks. <div>
<p>To mark Fraud Prevention Month, the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) is reminding Canadians to remain vigilant about potential investment scams and misleading advice. While online financial advice is readily available, the CSA encourages investors to verify information sources and work with registered professionals to reduce the risk of becoming victims of fraud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Investment fraud is prevalent and increasingly sophisticated, affecting investors across the country,&rdquo; said Stan Magidson, CSA Chair and Chair and CEO of the Alberta Securities Commission. &ldquo;It's more crucial than ever for people to safeguard their financial interests by learning more about current scams, and verifying sources of investment information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although social media platforms, apps and websites have become a popular source of investing information, Canadians should recognize that not all information is provided by qualified or well-intentioned individuals. To help protect investors from fraud, the CSA encourages Canadians to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verify information sources: Don't rely solely on online content or influencers that promote investment advice. When uncertain about the quality of an information source, consult a qualified and registered investment advisor or financial professional.</li>
<li>Work with registered professionals and firms: Ensure that individuals involved in securities trading or advising are registered with a Canadian securities regulator. Use the&nbsp;<a class="is-external" href="https://info.securities-administrators.ca/nrsmobile/nrssearch.aspx" target="_blank">CSA&rsquo;s National Registration Search&nbsp;<span class="icon-wrapper external-wrapper typo3-search-exclude"><img class="external" height="10" src="https://lautorite.qc.ca/typo3conf/ext/amf_site_lautorite/Resources/Public/Assets/svg/originals/external.svg" width="10" /></span><span class="visuallyhidden typo3-search-exclude">This link will open in a new window</span></a>&nbsp;to confirm the credentials of any potential advisor or service provider.</li>
<li>For crypto investments, opt for registered crypto trading platforms&nbsp;(CTPs): Canadians interested in crypto asset transactions should exclusively use&nbsp;<a class="is-external" href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/crypto-trading-platforms-regulation-and-enforcement-actions/crypto-trading-platforms-authorized-to-do-business-with-canadians/" target="_blank">platforms registered with Canadian securities regulators&nbsp;<span class="icon-wrapper external-wrapper typo3-search-exclude"><img class="external" height="10" src="https://lautorite.qc.ca/typo3conf/ext/amf_site_lautorite/Resources/Public/Assets/svg/originals/external.svg" width="10" /></span><span class="visuallyhidden typo3-search-exclude">This link will open in a new window</span></a>. Non-compliant platforms are more likely to pose risks or lack necessary investor protections. It's crucial to recognize that crypto investments entail high risks. Educate yourself about these risks before committing funds.</li>
<li>Be wary of these common scam tactics:  
<ul>
<li>Guaranteed and/or high profits: Many fraudulent pitches promise high returns or guaranteed profits, showing examples of high account balances or affluent lifestyles to reinforce their pitch. In reality, all investments come with some level of risk, and if it sounds too good to be true, it likely is.</li>
<li>No risk and urgent action: Scammers often rely on messaging that pushes quick action, while promising little to no risk. These tactics encourage investors to move quickly, without taking the time to check the information or the source. These scams often have &ldquo;once in a lifetime&rdquo; messaging.</li>
<li>Requiring access to electronic devices: Scammers will often ask for direct access to your electronic devices, such as your phone, laptop or tablet. Never provide access to your electronic devices.</li>
<li>Loss recovery: Once an individual has become a victim of a scam, scammers will re-target them with false promises to get lost money back, which often results in additional financial loss.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<title>Finansinspektionen: Interest Rate Puts Pressure On Indebted Households</title>

<div> mortgage report, new mortgagors, interest rates, household debt, housing market
Summary:
Households are borrowing less due to high interest rates, with fewer mortgagors and lower borrowing. However, the high household debt remains a concern.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p><span>Households continue to be under pressure from both higher interest rates and other costs. This is evident in FI&rsquo;s mortgage report, which is being published today. The report looks at new mortgagors during the autumn of 2023. We can see that there are fewer mortgagors than in previous years. Home buyers also bought slightly less expensive homes and borrowed slightly less. Total lending to households has stagnated, but despite this household indebtedness continues to be high.</span></p>
<div class="editor-content">
<p>The Swedish economy is in a recession. Inflation continued to be high in 2023, and mortgage rates continued to increase. Today, the average interest rate is the highest it has been since 2008. The interest rate is expected to decrease in the near future, but according to most forecasters, it will continue to be high for the next few years rather than returning to the low level we had up to 2022.</p>
<p>These changes in the economy are also influencing the housing market: the situation is cautious, and sales are low. This is evident in FI's mortgage report.</p>
<p>"A home buyer today must be prepared to spend a larger share of their income on interest expenses compared to in recent years. This impacts both how many households can borrow and how much they want to borrow. But even if lending to households has stagnated, total household debt continued to be high. We are watching this," says FI's Director General Daniel Barr.</p>
<h2>Fewer new borrowers and fewer with large debt</h2>
<p>We see that the number of households that took out a new mortgage decreased significantly. In earlier reports, the sample, which follows the development in new lending, included approximately 25,000 households. This number began to decline in the autumn of 2022, and in the autumn of 2023 the sample consisted of approximately 16,000 households. This reflects the economic development and the lower activity on the housing market in general.</p>
<p>Households that took out a new mortgage and amortised it spent on average after interest rate deductions 18 per cent of their disposable income on interest rate and amortisation payments. This is an increase of approximately 7 percentage points compared to the years 2017&ndash;2021, when interest rates were lower. In 2023, every tenth household spent at least 28 per cent of their disposable income on interest and amortisation payments.</p>
<p>Fewer households had a mortgage that exceeded 4.5 times their annual income before tax. In 2023, this percentage was approximately 5 per cent compared to 9 per cent in 2022. Both the average loan-to-income ratio and the percentage of households with a loan-to-income ratio higher than 450 per cent were back down at the level from 2018. That was when the stricter amortisation requirement was introduced.</p>
<h2>The valve in the amortisation requirement is working</h2>
<p>A bank may grant a mortgagor an exemption from the amortisation requirements for a given period if special grounds exist. The number of granted exemptions is still at a higher level than before. This shows that the valve in the amortisation requirement is working.</p>
<p>"When households' aggregate costs increase, the households become more vulnerable to changes that entail a loss of income, for example unemployment or illness. For these households, a temporary exemption from amortisation payments can be a huge relief," says Daniel Barr.</p>

<title>European Central Bank - Monetary Policy Decisions</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/european-central-bank-monetary-policy-decisions-16/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/european-central-bank-monetary-policy-decisions-16/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Governing Council today decided to keep the three key ECB interest rates unchanged. Since the last Governing Council meeting in January, inflation has declined further. In the latest ECB staff projections, inflation has been revised down, in particular for 2024 which mainly reflects a lower contribution from energy prices. Staff now project inflation to average 2.3% in 2024, 2.0% in 2025 and 1.9% in 2026. The projections for inflation excluding energy and food have also been revised down and average 2.6% for 2024, 2.1% for 2025 and 2.0% for 2026. Although most measures of underlying inflation have eased further, domestic price pressures remain high, in part owing to strong growth in wages. Financing conditions are restrictive and the past interest rate increases continue to weigh on demand, which is helping push down inflation. Staff have revised down their growth projection for 2024 to 0.6%, with economic activity expected to remain subdued in the near term. Thereafter, staff expect the economy to pick up and to grow at 1.5% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026, supported initially by consumption and later also by investment.</p>
<p>The Governing Council is determined to ensure that inflation returns to its 2% medium-term target in a timely manner. Based on its current assessment, the Governing Council considers that the key ECB interest rates are at levels that, maintained for a sufficiently long duration, will make a substantial contribution to this goal. The Governing Council&rsquo;s future decisions will ensure that policy rates will be set at sufficiently restrictive levels for as long as necessary.</p>
<p>The Governing Council will continue to follow a data-dependent approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction. In particular, the Governing Council&rsquo;s interest rate decisions will be based on its assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission.</p>
<h2>Key ECB interest rates</h2>
<p>The interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 4.50%, 4.75% and 4.00% respectively.</p>
<h2>Asset purchase programme (APP) and pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP)</h2>
<p>The APP portfolio is declining at a measured and predictable pace, as the Eurosystem no longer reinvests the principal payments from maturing securities.</p>
<p>The Governing Council intends to continue to reinvest, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the PEPP during the first half of 2024. Over the second half of the year, it intends to reduce the PEPP portfolio by &euro;7.5 billion per month on average. The Governing Council intends to discontinue reinvestments under the PEPP at the end of 2024.</p>
<p>The Governing Council will continue applying flexibility in reinvesting redemptions coming due in the PEPP portfolio, with a view to countering risks to the monetary policy transmission mechanism related to the pandemic.</p>
<h2>Refinancing operations</h2>
<p>As banks are repaying the amounts borrowed under the targeted longer-term refinancing operations, the Governing Council will regularly assess how targeted lending operations and their ongoing repayment are contributing to its monetary policy stance.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments within its mandate to ensure that inflation returns to its 2% target over the medium term and to preserve the smooth functioning of monetary policy transmission. Moreover, the Transmission Protection Instrument is available to counter unwarranted, disorderly market dynamics that pose a serious threat to the transmission of monetary policy across all euro area countries, thus allowing the Governing Council to more effectively deliver on its price stability mandate.</p>
<p>The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 14:45 CET today.</p>

<title>Prepared Remarks Before The Investor Advisory Committee, SEC Chair Gary Gensler, Washington, D.C., March 7, 2024</title>

<div> Securities and Exchange Commission, IAC, equity market, materiality, digital engagement<br />
<br />
The Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission discusses updates to equity market rules, the definition of materiality, and recommendations on digital engagement practices.<br />
- Equity market updates including settlement cycle and order execution quality<br />
- The importance of materiality in disclosure requirements under federal securities laws<br />
- Integration of materiality in international disclosure standards and sustainability-related disclosure standards<br />
- SEC proposal addressing potential conflicts of interest related to digital engagement practices<br />Summary: <div>
<p>Good morning. I am pleased to speak with the Investor Advisory Committee (IAC). As is customary, I&rsquo;d like to note that my views are my own as Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and I am not speaking on behalf of my fellow Commissioners or the staff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to start by thanking the five IAC members whose terms expire in May: Christopher Mirabile, Cien Asoera, Ted Daniels, Elissa Germaine, and Lori Lucas. I greatly appreciate your work in support of the Commission&rsquo;s investor protection mission.</p>
<p>I understand today you will discuss equity market structure rules, the definition of materiality, and a recommendation regarding digital engagement practices.</p>
<p>First, as it relates to equity markets, we finalized a rule to shorten the settlement cycle to one day for most broker-dealer transactions, including equity trades.</p>
<p>In fact, in 2015, when the settlement cycle was still three days, the IAC recommended shortening the settlement cycle to one day.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-speech-prepared-remarks-investor-advisory-committee-03-07-24?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1">[1]</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to say that in just a few months, after Memorial Day weekend, we will achieve that goal.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-speech-prepared-remarks-investor-advisory-committee-03-07-24?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Time is money. Time is risk.</p>
<p>For everyday investors who sell their stock on a Monday, they will get their money on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Second, just yesterday, we updated a 24-year-old rule, known as Rule 605, on disclosure of order execution quality.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-speech-prepared-remarks-investor-advisory-committee-03-07-24?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3">[3]</a>&nbsp;It will improve transparency for execution quality and facilitate investors&rsquo; ability to compare brokers, thereby enhancing competition in our markets.</p>
<p>Third, we have a proposal updating key features with regard to the National Market System. This includes minimum pricing increments for quoting and trading, access fees, and round lot order sizes.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-speech-prepared-remarks-investor-advisory-committee-03-07-24?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4">[4]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fourth we proposed that the Commission adopt a best execution standard for broker dealers&mdash;in essence, that broker-dealers seek the best execution for customers when they buy or sell securities. This rule would cover all sectors of the securities markets, including equity, fixed-income, and crypto asset securities.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-speech-prepared-remarks-investor-advisory-committee-03-07-24?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5">[5]</a></p>
<p>Fifth, we put out a proposal to bring greater competition for a segment of the market related to individual investors&rsquo; marketable orders.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-speech-prepared-remarks-investor-advisory-committee-03-07-24?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6">[6]</a></p>
<p>Lastly, on my most recent birthday, we proposed a rule regarding exchanges&rsquo; volume-based rebates and fees.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-speech-prepared-remarks-investor-advisory-committee-03-07-24?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7">[7]</a></p>
<p>As to your second topic, this year is the 25th&nbsp;anniversary of Staff Accounting Bulletin 99 &ndash; Materiality. It&rsquo;s also the 90th&nbsp;anniversary of the SEC.</p>
<p>Our federal securities laws lay out a basic bargain. Investors get to decide which risks they want to take so long as companies raising money from the public make what President Franklin Roosevelt called &ldquo;complete and truthful disclosure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the SEC, as I said in my confirmation hearing, I am guided by materiality as it relates to disclosure requirements under the federal securities laws.</p>
<p>Just yesterday, the Commission adopted final rules to mandate climate risk disclosures by public companies and in public offerings. Consistent with this agency&rsquo;s disclosure rules over the decades, these final rules are grounded in materiality.</p>
<p>Materiality represents a fundamental building block of the disclosure requirements under the federal securities laws. The Supreme Court articulated the meaning of materiality in cases in the 1970s and 1980s.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-speech-prepared-remarks-investor-advisory-committee-03-07-24?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8">[8]</a>&nbsp;It is this standard of materiality that is reflected in Commission rules.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-speech-prepared-remarks-investor-advisory-committee-03-07-24?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9">[9]</a>&nbsp;It is this same materiality standard that appears in numerous disclosure rules governing registration statements and public company annual reports.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-speech-prepared-remarks-investor-advisory-committee-03-07-24?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10">[10]</a>&nbsp;It is this same materiality standard that is used throughout the final rules we adopted yesterday.</p>
<p>I would note that materiality also has been incorporated in many international disclosure standards. For instance, it has been integrated throughout the International Sustainability Standards Board&rsquo;s recently adopted sustainability and climate-related disclosure standards.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-speech-prepared-remarks-investor-advisory-committee-03-07-24?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11">[11]</a>&nbsp;This applies as well to the required greenhouse gas emissions disclosures under those standards.</p>
<p>Finally, you will consider recommendations on digital engagement practices.</p>
<p>In finance, predictive data analytics has potential benefits of greater financial inclusion and enhanced user experience. It already has fueled a rapid change in the field of robo-advisers and brokerage apps.</p>
<p>AI also can also raise issues if the optimization function in the AI system is taking the interest of the platform into consideration as well as the interest of the customer. This can lead to conflicts of interest. In finance, when brokers or advisers act on those conflicts and optimize to place their interests ahead of their investors&rsquo; interests, investors may suffer financial harm.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the SEC proposed a rule last year regarding how best to address such potential conflicts across the range of investor interactions.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-speech-prepared-remarks-investor-advisory-committee-03-07-24?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12">[12]</a></p>

<div> Monetary policy, economy, bank regulation, bank supervision, banking industry<br />
Summary:<br />
- The speaker shared insights on the economy and monetary policy, along with concerns about bank regulation, liquidity requirements, and trends in bank supervision. <br /> <div>
<p>I would like to thank the New Jersey Bankers Association for the invitation to share my thoughts with you today.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240307a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;While I welcome the opportunity to share my thoughts about monetary policy, the economy, and the path of regulatory reform, I find it even more valuable to hear your views on local banking and economic conditions in the communities you serve, and your perspectives on trends in bank regulation and supervision. These conversations provide valuable insights to inform my work at the Federal Reserve&mdash;both for my understanding of the economy and the banking environment.</p>
<p>Before discussing bank regulation, I would like to briefly touch on the economy and monetary policy.</p>
<p><strong>Monetary Policy</strong><br />Over the past two years, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy to address high inflation. At our most recent meeting in January, we voted to continue to hold the federal funds rate target range at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent and to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve's securities holdings.</p>
<p>We have seen continued progress on inflation over the past year, with the 12-month readings through January of total and core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation moving down to 2.4 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively, both at the lowest rates we have seen since early 2021. Although inflation declined over the second half of 2023, the January inflation data suggest that progress in bringing inflation down further may be slower going forward. Throughout this time, economic activity has remained strong with ongoing strength in consumer spending. We had also seen signs of the labor market coming into better balance, but recent strong jobs reports&mdash;including upward revisions to employment growth&mdash;show a continued tight labor market. Last year, the average pace of job gains slowed and the labor force participation rate rose through November, with the unemployment rate edging up to 3.7 percent. In recent months, however, job growth has rebounded, and the labor force participation rate declined, retracing some of its earlier gains.</p>
<p>At its current setting, our monetary policy stance is restrictive and appears to be appropriately calibrated to reduce inflationary pressures. As I've noted recently, my baseline outlook continues to be that inflation will decline further with the policy rate held steady, but I still see a number of upside inflation risks that affect my outlook. These include risks from geopolitical developments, including the risk of spillovers from geopolitical conflicts and the extent to which food and energy markets and supply chains remain exposed to these influences. There is also the risk that a loosening in financial conditions and additional fiscal stimulus could add momentum to demand, stalling any further progress or even causing inflation to reaccelerate. Finally, there is a risk that continued labor market tightness could lead to persistently high core services inflation. Recent labor market data suggest ongoing elevated wage growth as some businesses continue to report above-average wage increases to compensate for elevated prices and high inflation.</p>
<p>Given these risks, and the general uncertainty regarding the economic outlook, I will continue to watch the data closely as I assess the appropriate path of monetary policy. The frequency and extent of data revisions over the past few years, as seen in the most recent employment report, make the task of assessing the current state of the economy as well as predicting how the economy will evolve even more challenging, and I will remain cautious in my approach to considering future changes in the stance of policy. Should the incoming data continue to indicate that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2 percent goal, it will eventually become appropriate to gradually lower our policy rate to prevent monetary policy from becoming overly restrictive. In my view, we are not yet at that point. Reducing our policy rate too soon could result in requiring further future policy rate increases to return inflation to 2 percent over the longer run.</p>
<p>It is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. My colleagues and I will make our decisions at each FOMC meeting based on the incoming data and the implications for the outlook. While the current stance of monetary policy appears to be at a restrictive level that will bring inflation down to 2 percent over time, I remain willing to raise the federal funds rate at a future meeting should the incoming data indicate that progress on inflation has stalled or reversed. Restoring price stability is essential for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.</p>
<p><strong>Notable Developments in Bank Regulation and Supervision</strong><br />As I look at the bank regulatory agenda, I am struck by the sheer volume of matters that have recently been completed, that have been proposed, and that are in the pipeline. These reforms touch on a wide range of topics that directly or indirectly impact banks of all sizes. This work shows no signs of slowing down. The large number of finalized, proposed, and potential changes suggest insufficient prioritization in furthering the primary goal of prudential bank regulation and supervision&mdash;promoting a safe and sound banking system. In fulfilling this statutory objective, we must also focus on efficiency and effectiveness and always consider how regulatory reforms affect the banking market, the economy, and those who use banking services. We should also ensure, in our pursuit of reform, that our efforts result in a bank framework that is appropriately tailored and calibrated.</p>
<p>I have spoken at length over the past few months about some recent notable developments in bank regulation, touching on capital reform, the Community Reinvestment Act, the cap on debit card interchange fees, and climate-related financial risk guidance.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240307a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;Today, I want to recap my views on some of these developments, particularly around bank mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A), liquidity regulation, and trends in bank supervision.</p>
<p><strong>Bank mergers and acquisitions</strong><br />Bank mergers and acquisitions continue to be an important part of the banking ecosystem. In this process, timing is key. However, this is another policy area where I expect to see ongoing focus from federal regulators, the Department of Justice, and others. As policymakers engage on this topic, a key consideration should be whether the application process is fair, transparent, and consistent with the applicable statutory requirements.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240307a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;And yet, policy reforms may make bank M&amp;A transactions more difficult for regulators to approve and slow the application processing timeline.</p>
<p>As all bankers know, application processing delays can be quite harmful, resulting in greater operational risk, increased expenses due in part to contract delays, reputational risk, and staff attrition due to the prolonged uncertainty. In the broader context, reducing the efficiency of bank mergers and acquisitions may also act as a deterrent to a healthy evolution of the banking system. Taken together, reducing merger or acquisition activity could have the consequence of prohibiting transactions that may preserve the presence of banks in rural or underserved areas, transactions that may further prudent growth strategies, or transactions that may result in increased competition with larger peers.</p>
<p>Regulatory reforms in this area should prioritize speed and timeliness. Stakeholders who are concerned about current bank M&amp;A procedures and policies should consider direct engagement with regulators.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240307a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a></p>
<p><strong>Liquidity</strong><br />Following the bank failures last spring, significant attention has been paid to the alleged "lessons learned" creating a path for regulatory reform efforts. This has generated discussion among both policymakers and the public on how to think about liquidity regulation: Should these requirements be expanded to a broader range of institutions? Should the calibration or operation of liquidity requirements like the Liquidity Coverage Ratio and Net Stable Funding Ratio be modified? Should we consider new liquidity requirements, and if so, what form should they take?</p>
<p>I have significant concerns about the path ahead as it comes to regulatory reforms involving liquidity requirements. All banks must manage their liquidity but should have flexibility based on a range of factors, including risk, business model, size, complexity, funding needs, vulnerability to deposit runs, and other considerations. Liquidity requirements, if not appropriately designed and calibrated, could trap resources that would otherwise be put to better use, like lending to bank customers. Before moving forward, we need to identify gaps in the current framework and build a foundation for any proposed changes that is based on research, evidence, and data.</p>
<p>Liquidity regulation also has the potential to impose significant costs and limit the lending capacity and business operations of banks, which we must recognize and take into account before imposing any new requirements.</p>
<p>We must think about liquidity broadly, including the sources and uses of liquidity that institutions use today, including the Federal Reserve's discount window and its role as lender of last resort, advances from the Federal Home Loan Banks, and other sources that may be available in the market. In this context, we must be honest about the capability and capacity of these resources, and the challenges and limits of these tools.</p>
<p>Revisions to the liquidity framework must also be coordinated to ensure that reform efforts are complementary and can support the banking system's liquidity needs. When considering new liquidity requirements, we must think about not only calibration and scope, but also the unintended consequences of any such requirements and whether these measures will be effective during stressed conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Trends in supervision</strong><br />During 2023 and into 2024, many banks reported very material shifts in bank examinations and ongoing intensification in supervisory expectations. Many of these examination-related shifts have received little public acknowledgement or attention in large part because the rules designed to protect confidential supervisory information frustrate visibility into structural shifts in the supervisory process. As you all know well, changes in supervisory expectations frequently come without the benefit of guidance, advance notice, or published rulemaking, and in the worst-case scenario these shifts, cloaked by the veil of supervisory opacity, can have significant financial and reputational impacts or can disrupt the management and operations of affected banks.</p>
<p>These changes largely occurred after the bank failures in the spring of 2023 and the ensuing banking stress. In part, the changes in supervisory practices may be attributable to flawed post-mortem reviews conducted in the immediate aftermath of these failures. Many of these reviews suffered from serious shortcomings, including compressed timeframes for completion and the significantly limited matters that were within the scope of review. Nevertheless, these reviews were, and continue to be, singularly relied upon as a basis for resetting regulatory and supervisory priorities. These trends in supervision are concerning and add to the already significant burdens placed on regulated institutions from an aggressive regulatory reform agenda. I worry that the mere fact of bank failures and the material banking stress we experienced last year has been interpreted as a "blank check" to remake supervision as a blunt instrument, one that ignores the unique characteristics of each firm and the benefits of an approach that prioritizes engagement and communication between banks and examiners.</p>
<p>Of course, the banking agencies cannot regulate our way to better or more effective supervision; in the aftermath of the banking stress, it is appropriate to look carefully at what is working, and what isn't, in the realm of bank supervision. But in doing so, we must appropriately manage our supervisory programs and teams to ensure that effective and consistent supervision is implemented within each firm, and that it is effective and consistent across our regulated entities. Conducting supervision in a manner that respects due process and provides transparency around supervisory expectations can help us accomplish these goals.</p>
<p><strong>Closing Thoughts</strong><br />Thank you again for the opportunity to speak with you today. We are experiencing significant changes in the banking industry, not least of which are those coming from the regulators. It is imperative that you continue engaging on all matters involving regulatory reform. Policymakers cannot fulfill the responsibility of promoting a safe and sound banking system if we ignore efficiency, tailoring, and appropriate calibration of requirements in the reform agenda. These tenets should be central to the reform process. I welcome your insight on what is working, what is not, and the real-world consequences of regulations and regulatory reform efforts. Your input helps us ensure that the bank regulatory framework supports safety and soundness in an efficient and fair way.</p>
<p>Thank you for your continued engagement, and I look forward to our conversation.</p>

<div> Developer, Sukuk, Nasdaq Dubai, listing, Binghatti
Summary:
Binghatti Holding lists inaugural USD 300 million Sukuk on Nasdaq Dubai, enhancing financial landscape and diversifying real estate financing options.<br /><br /> <div>
<ul>
<li>Dubai&rsquo;s leading property developer- Binghatti, lists its inaugural Sukuk on Nasdaq Dubai. </li>
<li>The listing boosts exchange&rsquo;s total value of listed debt issuances to USD 131 billion with 152 total listings.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nasdaq Dubai welcomes the inaugural Sukuk listing by Binghatti Holding, a leading Dubai-based property developer on the region&rsquo;s esteemed international financial exchange.</p>
<p>The debut issuance, valued at USD 300 million, emphasizes the pivotal role of Sukuk financing within the regional financial landscape. The listing further enhances Nasdaq Dubai's position as a premier venue, reinforcing its role in facilitating innovative financial instruments, contributing to the exchange's expanding portfolio of listed debt securities.</p>
<p>The issuance holds particular importance in diversifying financing options for the real estate sector. Binghatti's Sukuk listing sets a new standard as the first real estate benchmark USD-denominated Sukuk from MENA in 2024, paving the way for future issuances and solidifying the region's prominence in the global Islamic finance arena. Notably, Fitch Ratings recently awarded Binghatti Holding a B+ credit rating with a positive outlook, underscoring the company's financial strength and market confidence.</p>
<p>Comprising a coupon rate of 9.625 per cent and maturing in 2027, the listing reflects the company's strategic financial planning and commitment to offering attractive investment opportunities. The Sukuk issuance was over 2 times over-subscribed and was priced competitively with a 30 basis points tightening resulting from investor demand based on Binghatti's compelling investor roadshows. This listing was the first real estate Sukuk issuance from the MENA region in 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To commemorate the listing, Muhammad BinGhatti, CEO of Binghatti Holding, joined by Hamed Ali, CEO of Nasdaq Dubai and Dubai Financial Market (DFM), rang the market opening bell at Nasdaq Dubai, in the presence of a list of supporting banks.</p>
<p>Commenting on this, <b>Muhammad BinGhatti, CEO of Binghatti Holding</b> said: "This milestone reflects our strategic vision and unwavering dedication to driving growth and excellence in the region's financial landscape. Our successful Sukuk listing is a testament to the unwavering trust placed in Binghatti by investors and financial institutions. It underscores our commitment to transparency, reliability, and delivering value, further solidifying our position as a trusted partner in the financial arena."</p>
<p><b>Hamed Ali, CEO of Nasdaq Dubai and DFM</b> said: &ldquo;This listing by Binghatti Holding not only represents our continuous endeavours to position Dubai as a global hub for Sukuk financing but also reinforces our steadfast commitment to delivering financial solutions to companies in the region. The increasing interest in the Islamic financial market is a testament to the evolving and robust financial ecosystem offered through Nasdaq Dubai.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Boosting a total debt issuance value of USD 131 billion, comprising USD 43 billion in bond listings and USD 88 billion in Sukuk issuances, Nasdaq Dubai continues to solidify its position as a leading exchange for fixed income listings and the prominent destination for debt issuance.</p>

<title>Vienna Stock Exchange - International Women's Day: Study Reveals Large Gap In Private Pension Provision</title>

<div> Stock Exchange, Gender Equality, Financial Education, Securities Ownership, International Women's Day
Summary: Vienna Stock Exchange promotes gender equality, emphasizes financial education. Women lack knowledge, hinder securities ownership, initiatives to improve education. Securities ownership increasing, need for financial education persists.<br /><br /> <div>
<p>On the occasion of International Women's Day, the Vienna Stock Exchange will once again "Ring the Bell for Gender Equality". The event on 8 March &ndash; part of an initiative involving around 120 stock exchanges worldwide &ndash; aims to raise awareness of women's economic participation and equality. Financial education is a key topic in this regard, as the "Aktienbarometer" &ndash; a study by Aktienforum, the Federation of Austrian Industries (IV) and the Vienna Stock Exchange &ndash; shows. Although there is an urgent need for financial education in society as a whole, the survey found that women have a particularly high need to catch up when it comes to financial knowledge.</p>
<h2>Securities ownership: education as a key factor</h2>
<p>According to the "Aktienbarometer&rdquo;, women rate their financial knowledge as significantly less profound than men. 77% of the women surveyed stated that they refrain from investing in securities due to a lack of financial literacy. By comparison, men also require training and further education, although the proportion of those rating their financial expertise as inadequate is clearly lower at 61%. This also reflects in securities ownership, as while 19% of women use securities for long-term wealth accumulation, almost twice as many men do so at 36%.</p>
<p>Andrea Herrmann, CFO of Wiener B&ouml;rse, emphasises: "In order to close the gender pension gap, we need to foster private pension provision. By empowering women with the necessary financial knowledge and skills, we can encourage them to make informed decisions about their finances and take their financial future into their own hands."</p>
<p>In any case, the study illustrates that securities ownership correlates strongly with the level of education. The proportion of investors with a compulsory (14%, 2023: 11%) or technical college degree (24%, 2023: 22%) has increased compared to the last survey. Nevertheless, the majority of security holders have a university degree (45%) or at least a high level diploma (39%). In addition to financial knowledge, the available financial resources also affect the willingness to invest in securities. Many are of the opinion that they do not have enough money to make investing in securities worthwhile &ndash; among women, this is the second most common reason for not investing (73%).</p>
<p>"Even small amounts invested regularly can make a big difference in the long term. Many people underestimate the enormous impact of the compound interest effect or are not even aware of it," explains Angelika Sommer-Hemetsberger. Deputy Chairwoman of the Supervisory Board of the Vienna Stock Exchange.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The compound interest unfolds its effect above all by taking into account an important investment principle: the long term. Investors in a savings plan who, for example, have invested EUR 30 per month in an ATX Total Return portfolio since the start of the calculation in 1991, held EUR 41,608 (before deduction of fees and taxes) as at 29 February 2024 &ndash; with a deposit amount of EUR 11,970.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Vienna Stock Exchange takes active measures to improve financial education</h3>
<p>The Vienna Stock Exchange has been taking measures to strengthen financial education for many years and actively supports the "National Financial Literacy Strategy". For example, teaching materials are provided to teachers and school lectures are held. The &ldquo;Wiener B&ouml;rse Akademie&rdquo; also offers a comprehensive programme in cooperation with the WIFI Management Forum. The academy offers seminars and workshops for every level of expertise - from stock exchange novices to qualified securities traders. The training programme is constantly being expanded and adapted to demand and current trends. For example, an introductory seminar is also offered specifically for women.</p>
<h3>Aktienbarometer 2024 &ndash; Security ownership continues to rise</h3>
<p>The Austrian Aktienbarometer is an annual survey commissioned by Aktienforum, Federation of Austrian Industries (IV), and the Vienna Stock Exchange and provides a detailed insight into securities ownership in Austria. In addition to the unbroken need for financial education, the recent study also highlights a positive development: securities ownership among the Austrian population has increased compared to the previous year. While 25% of those surveyed in 2023 stated that they owned securities, this figure had already risen to 27% in the current study. In absolute figures, this corresponds to an increase of 200,000 people within one year.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Athens Exchange Group, the Greek stock exchange referred to as ATHEX, today announced their selection of Mysten Labs as their partner to evaluate the technical capability of upgrading its Electronic Book Building (EBB) to a distributed ledger technology platform using Sui, the layer 1 smart contract platform created and contributed to the public by the core research team behind Facebook's Libra/Diem and Move projects.</p>
<p>The EBB is a new fund-raising mechanism provided centrally as a meta-layer over the existing trading order routing system, to effectively use the network of ATHEX Members (banks and brokerage firms) and their clients, with the aim of offering liquidity for business proposals of companies seeking funds. ATHEX's EBB offers many advantages for customers, such as determination of best offer price for transferable securities such as stocks and bonds, increased transfer efficiency and more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In collaboration with Mysten Labs, the web3 infrastructure company and original contributor to Sui, ATHEX will leverage Sui's unique architecture to reimagine its EBB benefiting from Sui's combined focus on speed, security and a developer-friendly experience. ATHEX's technologists are also receiving assistance on a local level, as Mysten Labs' Solutions Engineering team is based in Athens, where they support partners worldwide.</p>
<p><strong>Yianos Kontopoulos, CEO of ATHEX Group</strong>, said, "We are delighted to partner with Mysten Labs to create the next iteration of our EBB service - from their highly experienced team to the capabilities of Sui itself, we believe we have found the right team to help us harness the true potential of blockchain technology."</p>
<p><strong>Evan Cheng, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Mysten Labs,</strong>&nbsp;said, "Collaborating with a globally recognized financial institution like ATHEX is a momentous step forward not just for the Sui blockchain, but also for web3 itself. Financial tools have long been touted as a use case for blockchain technology, but we have yet to see real world adoption. We are honored to be working with the ATHEX team and look forward to realizing the promise of the blockchain among traditional investors."</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It is a great pleasure for me to welcome all our guests to the SC today, in particular:</p>
<p>My predecessors:</p>
<p>Tan Sri Dr. Munir Majid, Datuk Ali Abdul Kadir,&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Tan Sri Zarinah Anwar, Tan Sri Ranjit and Datuk Syed Zaid Albar,&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately Tan Sri Md Nor Yusof is not able to be with us this morning due to unforeseen circumstances, and he has asked me to convey his &ldquo;Salam&rdquo; to all. &nbsp;</p>
<p>SC Board Members, past and present,</p>
<p>Industry captains, distinguished guests, &nbsp;</p>
<p>Members of the media,</p>
<p>Fellow colleagues, &nbsp;</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen. &nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Soon after I took over as chairman of the Securities Commission Malaysia in June 2022, I was informed that the SC would celebrate its 30th anniversary in 2023. In the past, the SC had published two anniversary books for its 10<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> anniversaries. </li>
<li>I thought another book seemed to be a reasonable proposition, but I wanted something a little different. Living history comes not only from the recounting&nbsp; of facts and events, but rather from the memories of those who lived through those times. </li>
<li>And who better to tell these stories, than my predecessors, the previous SC chairmen, who had experienced firsthand all that had happened within the organisation. Some of these stories in the book have not been told before. </li>
<li>We were lucky. We managed to get all six previous chairmen to contribute; We even managed to catch Tan Sri Ranjit, who was back in Malaysia on a brief visit from Washington DC, for his contribution. I think this was a unique opportunity in our lifetime. (If we were to do this for the 40<sup>th</sup><span style="font-size: 11px;"> anniversary, maybe some of&nbsp;</span>us may no longer be around). In any case, we pray all of us will have a long and fruitful life ahead of us.</li>
<li>Interviewing the past chairmen was not just a way of making history come alive. It was at the same time, my way of honouring and acknowledging their contributions, the bricks they put in place to make the SC what it is today. We will be forever grateful to Tan Sri Munir for giving us this iconic building where we sit in today. </li>
<li>When I assumed this position, I realised very quickly that at the SC, the buck stops with the chairman. So I&rsquo;m sure that my predecessors would have a wealth of knowledge, insights and many interesting stories to tell. After all, the past three decades have been nothing, if not tumultuous, from a capital market perspective. </li>
<li>I would like to thank my colleagues for being so gracious and spending so much of their time and wisdom towards the book. And not just the previous chairmen, but the former senior management, as well as the people who worked behind the scenes to keep the market on an even footing despite numerous challenges they had to face. </li>
<li>I was impressed with the role the SC has played at the international level and its impact on how markets are regulated worldwide. I know Tan Sri Munir, during his time, had a strong voice for emerging markets at international forums. We were also the Chair of the ASEAN Capital Market Forum from 2006 to 2008 under Tan Sri Zarinah, and 2014 to 2018 under Tan Sri Ranjit, about 6 years in all. And we will be chair again in 2025. &nbsp;</li>
<li>The SC has also been on the board of the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) since 2012. Before that, we were on the IOSCO Executive Committee from 1996 to 2004. Virtually, all the chairmen of the SC have served in a leadership position within IOSCO. We were the chair of the IOSCO Growth and Emerging Markets Committee from 1996 to 1999 under Tan Sri Munir, and 2012 to 2018 under Tan Sri Ranjit.&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
<li>We were also the chair of IOSCO Asia Pacific Regional Committee from 2000 to 2004 under Datuk Ali Kadir. </li>
<li>I am so happy that we managed to publish this book for the 30<sup>th</sup> anniversary in its present form. I did not want just any typical history book, but one that came direct from the horses&rsquo; mouths. I wanted something that we all would want to pick up and find interesting to read more about. When the stories are not recorded, they are lost forever, as people leave the organisation or pass on. </li>
<li>The stories that make up an organisation are its living breathing soul. When we record the past, we become part of its story. Otherwise, we are just separate cogs in a wheel, with no sense of history, tradition and belonging. </li>
<li>This then, is my gift to the staff of the SC, both present and those who are yet to join. They can read the stories of those who came before them to know why certain policies are in place and why the SC does things the way it does. You learn from the past, take it forward and become part of the tapestry. &nbsp;</li>
<li><b>To the young generation, please understand that its not only what you do that matters, but also what others have done before you, which should be accorded equal importance</b>. &nbsp;</li>
<li>What makes this book even more special is that our Prime Minister Yang Amat Berhormat Dato&rsquo; Seri Anwar Ibrahim, consented to write the foreword. It is most befitting as he was the one who established the SC and was very much part of the SC&rsquo;s history. &nbsp;</li>
<li>His perspective has been invaluable and his advice will continue to guide the SC going forward. </li>
<li>I would like to thank my colleagues once again, all the previous chairmen of the SC, for making all this possible. They were not only willing to contribute after leaving office for so long, but were so passionate and committed about continuing to say the right thing for the SC, and keeping our flag flying high. &nbsp;</li>
<li>I know that their experiences will provide a better pathway for the SC going forward in terms of handling challenges, which I am sure will continue to confront us. </li>
<li>A word of appreciation to all our stakeholders, senior and long-serving staff and even past staff who have been willing to contribute their experiences as well. &nbsp;</li>
<li>From the very beginning, the SC has been, not just a national, but an international organisation, operating in close cooperation with our regional and international counterparts. I would like to thank the ASEAN regulators and even the IOSCO chairman, for contributing their kind words to this book. </li>
<li>And finally, I would like to thank all of you for attending the event here today. As a way to show our appreciation, you will be getting a copy of the book, the first bite at the apple, so to speak. </li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<title>SGX RegCo Details How Sustainability Reports Should Incorporate ISSB Standards</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> consultation, ISSB standards, sustainability reporting, climate-related disclosures, mandatory reporting
Summary:<br /><br />SGX RegCo is consulting on incorporating ISSB standards and making climate-related disclosures mandatory in sustainability reporting from FY 2025. MAS supports the move. <div>
<p>Singapore Exchange Regulation (SGX RegCo) is consulting the market on details of how the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) standards are to be incorporated into its sustainability reporting rules for climate-related disclosures, in line with the Sustainability Reporting Advisory Committee&rsquo;s recommendations announced on 28 February 2024.</p>
<p>Feedback is also sought on a proposal to make mandatory the reporting on the primary components of a sustainability report (Primary Components)<a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/#_ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;from the current &ldquo;comply or explain&rdquo; basis.</p>
<p>Sustainability reporting was introduced to SGX-listed issuers on a voluntary basis in 2011. It was made mandatory in 2016 with description of the Primary Components on a &ldquo;comply or explain&rdquo; basis. Listed issuers have progressed since.</p>
<p>Climate reporting based on the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) was mandated for financial year (FY) 2022 on a &ldquo;comply or explain&rdquo; basis for all issuers, and FY 2023 and FY 2024 for issuers in certain carbon intensive industries, on a mandatory basis in phases.</p>
<p>&ldquo;SGX-listed issuers have improved their sustainability reporting over the years. Most already undertake climate-related disclosures based on the TCFD recommendations. The ISSB Standards have since been launched globally to meet demand for more consistent and comparable disclosures. We want to help issuers report based on these new standards so that they are ready for a low-carbon future,&rdquo; said Tan Boon Gin, CEO of SGX RegCo.</p>
<p>Mr Lim Tuang Lee, Assistant Managing Director (Capital Markets), Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), said, &ldquo;MAS is supportive of Singapore Exchange&rsquo;s move to incorporate ISSB standards into the disclosure requirements for listed companies in Singapore. This is in line with the drive towards consistent and comparable disclosures across jurisdictions to catalyse the global net zero transition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among others, SGX RegCo proposes that its listing rules be amended, and its Sustainability Reporting Guide encompass, the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>from FY 2025, issuers should refer to both ISSB&rsquo;s IFRS S1 and IFRS S2 in preparing climate-related disclosures, including any (permanent) structural and (temporary) transition reliefs;</li>
<li>issuers should disclose Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the measurement approach from FY 2025;</li>
<li>Issuers should disclose applicable categories of Scope 3 GHG emissions from FY 2026;</li>
<li>issuers should disclose industry-based metrics and cross-industry metric categories relevant for climate-related disclosures; and</li>
<li>the sustainability report should be issued according to current timelines in FY 2025; from FY 2026, it should be issued together with the annual report.</li>

<div> Keywords: MAS, FIMA Bill, investigative powers, capital markets, regulatory regime

Summary: 
MAS plays a key role in regulating financial institutions and investigates violations. The FIMA Bill enhances investigative powers, strengthens evidence gathering capabilities, and empowers MAS to regulate capital markets more effectively. It also enhances supervisory powers, facilitates transfer of evidence, and introduces miscellaneous amendments. The goal is to strengthen Singapore’s position as a safe and trusted international financial center.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p><span>1. Mr Speaker, on behalf of Mr Lawrence Wong,</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, and</span></li>
<li><span>Minister-in-charge of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (&ldquo;MAS&rdquo;)</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>2. I beg to move, &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a second time&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Introduction</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.&nbsp;</span>MAS plays a central role in upholding Singapore&rsquo;s status as a safe and trusted international financial centre. As our financial industry grows in size and complexity, MAS must continually review and enhance its regulatory powers, to ensure it can effectively supervise financial institutions (or &ldquo;FIs&rdquo;), as well as investigate and punish serious misconduct in our financial sector.</span></p>
<p><span>4. The Financial Institutions (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill (&ldquo;FIMA Bill&rdquo;) will harmonise and enhance MAS&rsquo; investigative powers across 6 Acts, namely,</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>the Financial Advisers Act 2001 (or &ldquo;FAA&rdquo;);</span></li>
<li><span>the Financial Services and Markets Act 2022 (or &ldquo;FSMA&rdquo;);</span></li>
<li><span>the Insurance Act 1966 (or &ldquo;IA&rdquo;);</span></li>
<li><span>the Payment Services Act 2019 (or &ldquo;PS Act&rdquo;);</span></li>
<li><span>the Securities and Futures Act 2001 (or &ldquo;SFA&rdquo;); and</span></li>
<li><span>the Trust Companies Act 2005 (or &ldquo;TCA&rdquo;),</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>(collectively, the &ldquo;MAS-administered Acts&rdquo;).</span></p>
<p><span>5. Other key amendments in the FIMA Bill pertain to the regulation of capital markets in Singapore. These amendments -</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>empower MAS to issue directions to Capital Market Services Licence holders (or &ldquo;CMSL holders&rdquo;) to manage potential risks from their conduct of unregulated businesses; and</span></li>
<li><span>enhance MAS&rsquo; supervisory powers.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span><span>Key Features of the FIMA Bill</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>(A)<span> </span>Enhancement of MAS&rsquo; investigative powers</span></span></p>
<p><span>6. Let</span><span>&nbsp;me start with the amendments to enhance MAS&rsquo; investigative powers.</span></p>
<p><span>7. MAS</span><span>&nbsp;investigates and enforces a wide range of violations using its powers under the laws and regulations it administers. Such violations range from breaches of business conduct requirements by regulated FIs, to insider trading and fraud or deception when dealing in securities.</span></p>
<p><span>8. Let me give two examples of recent cases:</span></p>
<p><span>(i) First, MAS reprimanded several FIs and individuals, including AIA Financial Advisers Pte Ltd and 2 Aviva entities, for breaching requirements under the FAA in relation to remuneration of supervisors as well as adequacy of risk management.</span></p>
<p><span><span>(ii) Second, following contraventions of the SFA and its business conduct requirements by&nbsp;</span><span>Three Arrows Capital</span><span>, MAS issued 9-year prohibition orders against&nbsp;</span><span>Three Arrows Capital&rsquo;s</span><span>&nbsp;Chairman and CEO.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>9.&nbsp;</span><span>Such enforcement actions are not possible without&nbsp;</span><span>MAS conducting rigorous investigations of suspected violations. However, some of the investigation powers available to MAS under the SFA and FAA are not available in the other MAS-administered Acts, specifically the FSMA, IA, PS Act and TCA.</span></p>
<p><span>10. For convenience, I shall refer to this latter group of legislation as the &ldquo;Other MAS-administered Acts&rdquo;. We also need to strengthen or widen some existing powers under the SFA and FAA to ensure their effectiveness. The FIMA Bill will close these gaps by enhancing and making consistent the investigation powers across&nbsp;<span>all</span>&nbsp;the MAS-administered Acts. The FIMA Bill will also facilitate the transfer of evidence between MAS and other agencies, for enforcement to be more efficient and effective.</span></p>
<p><span>11.&nbsp;</span><span>I</span><span>&nbsp;shall now explain the main categories of amendments in detail.</span></p>
<p><span><em><span>Amendments to strengthen evidence gathering capabilities</span></em></span></p>
<p><span>12. First</span><span>, MAS is proposing to introduce in the&nbsp;<em>Other MAS-administered Acts</em>, the power to require persons to appear before an MAS officer for examination and statement-recording for the purpose of investigations under the relevant Acts. Such powers already exist under the SFA and FAA, and are effective in enabling investigators to obtain information about suspected misconduct.</span></p>
<p><span>13. Second</span><span>, the FIMA Bill will remove the requirement in the SFA and FAA for MAS to first issue orders to a suspect to produce information and show that the suspect has failed to comply with such orders, before MAS can enter &ndash; without a warrant &ndash; premises believed to be occupied by the suspect. This will enable MAS to enter premises without tipping off the suspect, and hence reduce the risk of the suspect destroying evidence relevant to the investigation. A similar power to enter premises without a warrant will be extended to the&nbsp;<em>Other MAS-administered Acts</em>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>14.&nbsp;</span>MAS officers will not have powers to search the premises and seize evidence on the premises when they exercise the power of entry without warrant. They can, however, require any person on the premises to produce information, or state where such information can be found. MAS officers can also require any person on the premises to preserve evidence.</span></p>
<p><span>15.&nbsp;</span><span>The</span><span>&nbsp;FIMA Bill will also introduce provisions in the&nbsp;<em>Other MAS-administered Acts&nbsp;</em>to empower MAS to obtain a Court warrant to search premises and seize evidence. This power already exists in the SFA, FAA and TCA, and it allows MAS to obtain evidence that is in the possession of uncooperative subjects, before it is concealed, removed, tampered with, or destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span><em><span>Amendments to facilitate transfer of evidence</span></em></span></p>
<p><span>16. The</span><span>&nbsp;FIMA Bill will also amend the current transfer of evidence provisions in the SFA and FAA. This will help facilitate exchange of information between MAS and the Police, Public Prosecutor or other law enforcement agencies.</span></p>
<p><span>17.&nbsp;</span><span>In</span><span>&nbsp;cases where MAS&rsquo; investigations reveal serious misconduct that warrants a criminal prosecution, MAS&rsquo; ability to transfer evidence to the Police would be helpful. It reduces the need to duplicate investigations and enhances the efficiency of our law enforcement agencies. Conversely, there may be cases investigated by the Police or other law enforcement agencies that may be more effectively or appropriately dealt with by MAS through regulatory actions.</span></p>
<p><span>18. However, under the current SFA and FAA, MAS may only transfer evidence to the Police or Public Prosecutor for the purpose of criminal investigations or proceedings for market misconduct offences under the SFA, and offences under the FAA. The FIMA Bill will expand the existing provisions to allow evidence gathered by MAS to be transferred to the Police or the Public Prosecutor, for the purpose of criminal investigations or proceedings for any offence under the&nbsp;<em>MAS-administered Acts</em>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>19.&nbsp;</span>Presently, the Police or other law enforcement agencies may only transfer evidence to MAS for the purpose of civil penalty investigations or actions for market misconduct offences under the SFA. The FIMA Bill will replace these provisions with the power for the Police or other law enforcement agencies to transfer evidence to MAS, for the purpose of taking regulatory actions in respect of any misconduct under the&nbsp;<em>MAS-administered Acts</em>, if such transfer is in the public interest.</span></p>
<p><span><span>20.&nbsp;</span>In this regard, the specific provisions for the transfer of evidence between MAS, the Police and other law enforcement agencies are consistent with the existing general common law principle permitting enforcement agencies to share with other enforcement agencies, evidence that would ordinarily be kept confidential where it is in the public interest to do so. Expressly legislating for the transfer of evidence between MAS, the Police and other law enforcement agencies, notwithstanding this common law principle, will make clear when evidence may be transferred and facilitate operational arrangements in respect of the transfer.</span></p>
<p><span><span>(B)<span> </span>Enhancing MAS&rsquo; powers in the capital markets</span></span></p>
<p><span>21. Sir, let me now explain in more detail how the Bill will enable MAS to regulate FIs in the capital markets sector more effectively. This pertains to amendments specific to three (3) Acts, namely the SFA, FAA and TCA.</span></p>
<p><span>22. The</span><span>&nbsp;first set of amendments relates to expanding MAS&rsquo; powers to issue directions to CMSL holders and their representatives for their unregulated businesses. Currently, CMSL holders may conduct unregulated businesses such as dealing in products that are not regulated by MAS. Examples of such products include digital payment token derivatives that are traded on overseas exchanges.</span></p>
<p><span><span>23. These</span><span>&nbsp;unregulated businesses may pose contagion risks to CMSL&nbsp;</span><span>holders&rsquo;</span>&nbsp;<span>regulated businesses. For instance, losses from a CMSL holder&rsquo;s unregulated business could adversely impact its ability to meet its obligations to customers in its regulated business. Customers may also not be fully aware that regulatory protections do not apply to the CMSL holder&rsquo;s unregulated businesses.</span></span></p>
<p><span>24. While</span><span>&nbsp;MAS has issued guidance to CMSL holders on risk-mitigating measures and safeguards that they should adopt when they conduct unregulated businesses, we should put these on a clear legal footing. The FIMA Bill will empower MAS to issue legally binding directions to CMSL holders and their representatives in relation to their conduct of unregulated businesses, to mitigate risks posed to its regulated businesses.</span></p>
<p><span><em><span>Enhancement of MAS&rsquo; supervisory powers</span></em></span></p>
<p><span>25. The second set of amendments enhances&nbsp;</span><span>MAS&rsquo; supervisory powers under the SFA, FAA and TCA. They will harmonise requirements across the Acts, and where relevant, also align MAS&rsquo; powers under these Acts with the Banking Act 1970.</span></p>
<p><span>26.&nbsp;</span><span>I</span><span>&nbsp;will highlight a few key amendments:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>The first relates to<em>&nbsp;the appointment and removal of key persons.</em>&nbsp;Regulated FIs are generally required to obtain MAS&rsquo; approval before appointing their chief executive officers and directors. However, this requirement currently does not apply to locally incorporated recognised market operators and recognised clearing houses, and approved trustees. The FIMA Bill will therefore introduce approval requirements for such entities. In addition, while MAS already has powers across the SFA, FAA and TCA to remove a director or key management officer, there are some minor differences in the grounds for removal. The FIMA Bill will consolidate the grounds for removal into a single ground of not being &ldquo;fit and proper&rdquo;. Certain factors that MAS may consider in its assessment are also set out in the Bill.</span><br /><br /></span></li>
<li><span><span>The second area relates to<em>&nbsp;persons obtaining control of a capital markets FI.</em>&nbsp;In general, a person acquiring control in capital markets FIs must obtain MAS&rsquo; approval before doing so. However, this requirement does not currently apply to locally incorporated recognised market operators and recognised clearing houses, and approved trustees. The FIMA Bill will extend the approval requirement to such entities. For other capital markets FIs, the FIMA Bill will also clarify when MAS&rsquo; approval must be sought. Currently, a person must seek MAS&rsquo; approval prior to entering into an &ldquo;arrangement&rdquo; by which the person would obtain control of a CMSL holder or a licensed financial adviser. Such an arrangement may include early stages of negotiations for the acquisition. This is not MAS&rsquo; intent. The FIMA Bill will make clear that MAS&rsquo; approval need only be sought before a person obtains control of the regulated entity.</span><br /><br /></span></li>
<li><span>The last aspect relates to<em>&nbsp;the appointment of external auditors.</em>&nbsp;Presently, MAS&rsquo; powers in relation to external auditors of Approved Exchanges, Approved Clearing Houses, Approved Holding Companies, and Licensed Trade Repositories are limited to matters that the auditor must immediately report to the MAS, such as when the auditor becomes aware of any matter that constitutes a breach of the SFA, or an offence involving fraud or dishonesty.&nbsp;</span><span>It is important that the auditors appointed by such entities can satisfactorily discharge their duties, given the central role that these entities play in the capital markets. The FIMA Bill will introduce the requirement for such entities to obtain MAS&rsquo; approval for the appointment of their external auditors on an annual basis. MAS will also have powers to direct these entities to remove or replace their appointed auditors, where the appointed auditors are unable to discharge their duties satisfactorily. With these amendments, MAS will align the approach for capital markets FIs with the approach that MAS has taken for other systemically important FIs under its purview, such as banks and insurance companies.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span><span>27. Lastly</span><span>, the FIMA Bill will also introduce various miscellaneous amendments such as &ndash; (a) amendments to clarify MAS&rsquo; reprimand powers; (b) amendments consequential from the introduction of new processes &ndash; such as updating some of the Acts to remove references to physical licences; and (c) amendments to provide for definitions necessitated by amendments made by this Bill.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Conclusion</span></span></p>
<p><span>28. Mr</span><span>&nbsp;Speaker, in conclusion, the FIMA Bill will enhance MAS&rsquo; ability to enforce its regulatory regime and supervise capital markets FIs more effectively. This will further strengthen Singapore&rsquo;s position as a safe and trusted international financial centre.</span></p>
<p><span>29. Sir</span><span>, I beg to move.</span></p>

<title>ASX Complies With ASIC Infringement Notice</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asx-complies-with-asic-infringement-notice/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asx-complies-with-asic-infringement-notice/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Below is a media release regarding ASX&rsquo;s compliance with an infringement notice given by ASIC.</span></p>
<h4>ASX compliance with infringement notice related to Market Integrity Rules&nbsp;</h4>
<p>On 8 February 2024, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (<b>ASIC</b>) issued ASX with an infringement notice in relation to alleged contraventions of the <i>ASIC Market Integrity Rules (Securities Markets) 2017 </i>(<b>Rules</b>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Rules require ASX to make available pre-trade information for orders on the ASX market, unless an exception applies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The notice relates to a system configuration error with the block trade minimum threshold for a subset of exchange traded funds and warrants. The system configuration error impacted certain orders on Centre Point (ASX&rsquo;s anonymous matching system) as it incorrectly allowed those orders to be submitted into Centre Point in reliance on the block trade exception to pre-trade transparency under the Rules, when they in fact did not meet the relevant block trade minimum threshold. There were 8,417 orders and amended orders affected by the error, as set out in the infringement notice. On average, around 76 million order book changes are received per day on the ASX market.<a href="file://C:/Users/herbie%20skeete/Downloads/13-07-march-2024-asx-complies-with-asic-infringement-notice.pdf#_ftn1"><sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The error was identified in late 2022 and ASX immediately corrected it and brought it to ASIC&rsquo;s attention. ASX subsequently implemented a system fix to resolve the underlying issue. ASX has fully cooperated with ASIC throughout its investigation of this matter.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Helen Lofthouse, ASX Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer</b>, said: &ldquo;As a market operator, ASX strives towards the highest standards and this includes providing appropriate pre-trade transparency at all times. The availability of pre-trade information is fundamental to a fair and transparent market, and we take seriously any impairment to this. We are very disappointed this error happened.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the first infringement notice issued to ASX for alleged contravention of the Market Integrity Rules. ASX paid $1,050,000 to comply with the infringement notice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This matter is separate to the ongoing ASIC investigation into oversight, statements and disclosures around the CHESS replacement project, with which ASX is cooperating fully.&nbsp;</p>

<title>ASIC: ASX Pays $1,050,000 Penalty For Order Information Transparency Failure</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-asx-pays-1050000-penalty-for-order-information-transparency-failure/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-asx-pays-1050000-penalty-for-order-information-transparency-failure/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASX Limited has paid a penalty of $1,050,000 following an ASIC investigation into its compliance with the Market Integrity Rules. This is the first time ASIC has issued an infringement notice to a market operator.</p>
<p>ASIC issued the notice because ASIC has reasonable grounds to believe that ASX breached the rule requiring pre-trade transparency on 8,417 occasions between 4 April 2019 and 22 December 2022. The rule requires ASX to make certain information about orders available on its trading system. ASX failed to make that information available about orders for certain equity market products as a result of an incorrect system configuration.</p>
<p>Pre-Trade information is important because it assists with price formation, aids liquidity, enables investors to assess investment opportunities and value listed companies.</p>
<p>ASIC Chair Joe Longo said, &ldquo;Confidence in Australia&rsquo;s market operators is fundamental to fair and efficient markets. This action demonstrates that ASIC will hold market operators to the highest standards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This issue arose out of a failure by ASX to correctly configure certain order functionality on its trading system. ASIC considers ASX&rsquo;s conduct was serious. The incorrect system configuration went undetected until drawn to ASX&rsquo;s attention by a market participant.&nbsp; On at least two occasions before 22 December 2022, ASX could have, but did not, identify the issue.</p>
<p>In determining penalty, ASIC found that the consequences of the incorrect system configuration and ASX&rsquo;s failure to detect and escalate for remediation was an aggravating factor.</p>
<p>ASIC also found there was no evidence of other losses suffered as a result of the conduct, but the damage to public confidence in the operation of the market is such that the consequences of the conduct are an aggravating factor in the determination of penalty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Technology and operational resilience for market operators is a strategic enforcement priority. ASIC will continue to take action to ensure that market operators and market participants have robust systems, controls and technological infrastructure in place to support Australia&rsquo;s capital markets,&rdquo; Mr Longo said.</p>
<p>ASIC found that the circumstances giving rise to the system configuration issue were indicative of carelessness rather than recklessness or intentional misconduct.&nbsp; Once aware, ASX took immediate steps to remedy the issue and notify ASIC.</p>
<p>Compliance with the infringement notice is not an admission of guilt or liability and by doing so, ASX is not taken to have contravened subsection 798H(1) of the Corporations Act.</p>
<p>This outcome is separate to ASIC&rsquo;s investigation in relation to the ASX CHESS Replacement Program. That investigation is ongoing.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Market Integrity Rule 6.1.2 requires market operators to make certain information such as the volume and price of orders available on its trading system. There are limited exemptions to this rule, including where the consideration for the transaction is $200,000 or more for Tier 3 equity market products known as a block trade.</p>
<p>ASX makes pre-trade information available for equity market products on its trading system known as TradeMatch. ASX also operates the trading system known as ASX Centre Point, which accepts anonymous orders that do not require pre-trade transparency if they meet one or more of the exceptions to the rule.</p>
<p>ASIC found that due to incorrect system configuration, the consideration for block trade exemptions was set to $0 instead of $200,000 for some Tier 3 equity products. As a result, 8,417 orders placed between 4 April 2019 and 22 December 2022 were not pre-trade transparent when they should have been. Further, 165 trades occurred in purported reliance on the exception between 11 July 2022 and 22 December 2022.</p>

<div> Concept Release; Rule 605 amendments; Market structure; Equity Market Structure Advisory Committee; Regulation NMS <br />
Summary: The Rule 605 amendments address market changes but have potential issues, such as complexity and unavailable data for analysis. <div>
<p>Thank you, Mr. Chair. On balance, the Rule 605 amendments we are voting on today are positive. Over the past quarter-century since Rule 605 first mandated the disclosure of certain order-related information, our markets have changed dramatically. Decimalization, the adoption and implementation of Regulation NMS, the increased speed at which orders are communicated and transactions are executed: All of these have combined to refashion the market in ways very different from the market of Y2K.</p>
<p>Rule 605 has not kept up with these changes. The Commission gave hints that it recognized that Rule 605 was out-of-date just a decade after it was adopted. In the 2010 Equity Market Structure Concept Release, the Commission asked whether Rule 605 was fit for purpose in a market that had changed significantly over the preceding decade.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-order-execution-quality-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;The Concept Release also identified issues&mdash;such as the granularity of time categories&mdash;that are finally being addressed in today&rsquo;s rule.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-order-execution-quality-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2">[2]</a>The Commission also noted that these disclosure requirements &ldquo;were drafted primarily with the interests of individual investors in mind&rdquo; but expressed uncertainty whether &ldquo;individual investors understand and pay attention to [these] statistics,&rdquo; whether &ldquo;market participants . . . make decisions based on this data,&rdquo; and, if so, whether &ldquo;those decisions [are] beneficial to individual investors.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-order-execution-quality-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3">[3]</a></p>
<p>The Commission and market participants continued discussing ways to address these deficiencies over the following decade, first in comments on the Concept Release<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-order-execution-quality-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4">[4]</a>and later in meetings of the Equity Market Structure Advisory Committee<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-order-execution-quality-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5">[5]</a>(EMSAC) and recommendations that committee issued in November 2016.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-order-execution-quality-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6">[6]</a>The conversation continued at a 2018 market data roundtable.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-order-execution-quality-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7">[7]</a>For much of this period, trade associations also have repeatedly called for the Commission to improve the quality of these reports.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-order-execution-quality-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8">[8]</a></p>
<p>Given this history, I am happy to see the Commission taking action on these amendments today. Although I have some reservations, the staff has carefully considered the many comments we received in response to this rule and worked to make Rule 605 reports more useful to investors and those who serve investors. I do not agree with every call made, but the final amendments are a necessary response to the evolution of the market. And, if we move forward with the other market structure rules that were proposed in December 2022, which I am not arguing we should do, getting Rule 605 amended and implemented first makes sense.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-order-execution-quality-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9">[9]</a></p>
<p>Now to my reservations. First, as the history I just related shows, the original Rule 605 quickly became outdated given rapid developments in how our markets worked in the first decade of this century. Any additional transparency produced by the changes the Commission is considering today may just as quickly become clouded by market developments. Solving this problem is not easy. The Commission is a large organization that, often out of necessity and prudence, moves slowly.A market solution is preferable, but so far has not succeeded in providing consistent data regarding execution quality across a large number of firms.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-order-execution-quality-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10">[10]</a>We should not be complacent about allowing a costly regulatory reporting regime to persist if it is not providing reliable and actionable information to investors. Not only with respect to this rule, but also more broadly, the Commission must stay informed of possible gaps between market developments and our regulatory framework and address them expeditiously. To fail to do so is to neglect our responsibility as a regulator and to risk a loss of relevance to and trust from the investing public.</p>
<p>As the number of firms subject to the reporting agreement increases and the reporting framework becomes more complex&mdash;as is happening today&mdash;this problem becomes only more acute. For example, for the first time, the final rule requires certain broker-dealers that are not market centers to produce Rule 605 reports and treats broker-dealers that internalize only fractional share orders as market centers. I am not entirely convinced that the reports produced by these broker-dealers will be useful to retail investors, or that their usefulness will be commensurate with the costs of producing them. If the evidence suggests that reports from these firms are not benefitting retail investors, or are becoming less useful over time, we should acknowledge it and take necessary steps to tailor the scope of the rule in response.</p>
<p>Second, the approach the economic analysis takes to analyzing the economic effects of overlapping compliance periods&mdash;in particular, between this rule and the yet-to-be implemented market data infrastructure reforms&mdash;suggests a higher level of confidence in our prior economic analyses than may be warranted.The economic analysis acknowledges that certain elements of the market data infrastructure rules&mdash;particularly the new round lot definition in those rules&mdash;mean that the baseline against which the changes to Rule 605 are being assessed incorporates certain assumptions as to the costs and benefits of the market data infrastructure changes that will occur at some future date.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-order-execution-quality-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11">[11]</a>The analysis concludes, however, that given that the new round lot definition affects only a limited number of stocks, the market data infrastructure rules are &ldquo;not expected&rdquo; to have significant effects on the costs and benefits of the amendments to Rule 605.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-order-execution-quality-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12">[12]</a></p>
<p>Although not ideal, this conclusion in this specific context seems reasonable, but, if taken more broadly, it may raise questions about the reliability of our economic analyses. The relevant changes in the market data infrastructure rule are fairly discrete, as are their interactions with Rule 605. Going forward, however, we need to consider carefully whether there is a point at which it is imprudent to engage in further rulemaking when doing so requires us to perform an economic analysis that depends on multiple layers of assumptions about the expected (but empirically unverified) costs and benefits of closely related rules that we have already adopted but not yet implemented. Although this is a difficult line to draw, at some point, market participants may reasonably raise doubts about the accuracy and usefulness of an economic analysis that incorporates expected-but-unverified costs and benefits of prior rules, whose expected costs and benefits themselves incorporate assumptions about the costs and benefits of yet-to-be-implemented rules.</p>
<p>This concern is heightened with a rule like 605. This rule not only seems likely to affect the baseline of other proposed rules, but itself will produce the data that will help us understand whether these other rules, if adopted, will generate the hoped for benefits.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-order-execution-quality-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13">[13]</a>A regulator has a responsibility to confirm that rules it has promulgated produce the intended effects without imposing disproportionate burdens. If the Commission proceeds to adoption of related rules before this rule is implemented and before we have a clearer picture of execution quality under our current rule set, I will be looking closely at how the Commission intends to measure those effects both in any adopting releases and retrospectively, having changed the measuring stick midstream.</p>
<p>I would like to express my thanks to the staff in TM,DERA, and OGC who worked hard on a very technical set of changes to this rule, and for engaging closely with market participants to address their concerns about ensuring that the amended rule generates data that will be useful to the investing public. I do have a few questions.</p>
<ol>
<li>One of the criticisms of Rule 605 has been that it is not terribly useful to retail investors. I understand the argument that Rule 605 reports generated by market centers are used by broker-dealers and others who route retail investor orders and thus indirectly benefit retail investors even if they do not view the reports themselves. The reports under the amended rule will be, in some ways, considerably more complex, and it seems unlikely that retail investors will pay much attention even to the summary reports. How are retail investors likely to benefit from the Rule 605 reports generated by the broker-dealers who now will have to produce these reports?</li>
<li>What is the case for requiring broker-dealers who are captured by the rule as market centers only because they internalize fractional share orders to produce Rule 605 reports? How many such brokers do you anticipate there are?</li>
<li>Presumably many of the broker-dealers newly captured by this rule will look to third-party vendors to help them get their reporting systems in place.<ol>
<li>Do vendors already provide such services, for example, to broker-dealers that are market-centers because they operate ATSs or because they internalize orders?</li>
<li>Do we have any data regarding how much they charge for these services?</li>
<li>Did we use these data in developing our estimates of the costs of compliance that broker-dealers captured under the amended rule are likely to incur?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>My understanding is that implementing this rule will be a major undertaking for broker-dealers that are not market centers.<ol>
<li>How did we think about implementation difficulties in setting what appears to be too aggressive of a compliance deadline?</li>
<li>What are we planning to do to assist them during implementation?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Commenters have expressed frustration with their inability to examine the CAT data informing our analysis and policy choices in the December 2022 market structure proposals, including the Rule 605 proposal. Why is it appropriate for the Commission to engage in policymaking on the basis of data unavailable to market participants affected by our rules?</li>
<li>In the proposing release, the Commission also relied on analysis of Rule 605 and 606 reports from a select group of broker-dealers.Notwithstanding the fact that these reports are public, the release dismisses a request from some commenters that we provide them with the identity of the broker-dealers whose reports were used in this analysis, given that, as one commenter noted, not providing this information &ldquo;prevent[s] replication and analysis of the Commission&rsquo;s use of such data.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-order-execution-quality-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14">[14]</a>&nbsp;The response is quite cavalier: The release notes that&ldquo;[t]he reports themselves are publicly available and interested parties can analyze these reports using their own selection of broker-dealers,&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-order-execution-quality-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15">[15]</a>&nbsp;which makes it look as though we are hiding the ball. Why not just tell them? Are we trying to make it more difficult for the public to check our work?</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> amending, disclosure requirements, rule 605, NMS stocks, order execution
Summary:<br />Rule 605 amendments to enhance competition among service providers. Previous rules improved execution quality and regulatory patience is needed. <div>
<p>Thank you, Chair Gensler. Today, the Commission considers amending the disclosure requirements for order executions in national market system (NMS) stocks.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-order-execution-quality-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;These amendments to Rule 605 will expand the scope of reporting entities to include &ldquo;larger&rdquo; broker-dealers and modify the definition of a &ldquo;covered&rdquo; order. The Commission&rsquo;s work reflects a careful consideration of the constructive comments received. These updates can enhance competition among service providers by giving investors better information regarding order execution.</p>
<p>NMS stocks are traded simultaneously at different venues, including securities exchanges, alternative trading systems, single-dealer platforms and market-makers.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-order-execution-quality-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;The Rule 605 amendments under consideration today should enhance that multi-venue competition intended by Congress.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-order-execution-quality-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;When Rules 605 and 606 were first adopted in 2000,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-order-execution-quality-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;publicly available information to compare and evaluate execution quality among market centers was sparse. Rule 605 would require standardized monthly reports of statistical information concerning covered orders for NMS stocks regarding execution.</p>
<p>The existing rules have provided an improved awareness about &ldquo;how broker-dealers responded to trade-offs between price and other factors, such as speed or reliability, and establish a baseline level of disclosure in order to facilitate cross-market comparisons of execution quality.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-order-execution-quality-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;The intent was to promote &ldquo;competitive forces&rdquo; that &ldquo;could then be brought to bear on broker-dealers both with respect to the explicit trading costs associated with brokerage commissions and the implicit trading costs associated with execution quality.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-order-execution-quality-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;As Commissioners Cynthia Glassman and Paul Atkins observed during the adoption of Regulation NMS in 2005, the disclosure framework that &ldquo;required market centers to publish execution quality statistics&rdquo; had an effect where &ldquo;[c]ompetition among market makers increased significantly.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-order-execution-quality-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;Furthermore, &ldquo;overall execution quality for retail customers improved as competition among executing broker-dealers on the basis of execution quality became a means of attracting order flow.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-order-execution-quality-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p>Twenty-five years ago, Commissioner Laura Unger oversaw a report recommending that the Commission consider requiring market centers to disclose information on best execution factors.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-order-execution-quality-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;The report also recommended requiring broker-dealers to disclose information about the execution quality available at different market centers, order handling practices, and receipt of inducements for order flow.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-order-execution-quality-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;Those recommendations remain valid. However, the Adopting Release recognizes that &ldquo;equity market conditions have changed due in part to many technological advancements that have altered the speed and nature of trading,&rdquo; including the increased participation of individual investors in the equity markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-order-execution-quality-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;Today&rsquo;s action amends Rule 605 to address these developments.</p>
<p>These amendments were proposed along with three other rules impacting equity market structure, but with little regard as to their interaction with each other. The other proposals were: (1) the Order Competition Rule;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-order-execution-quality-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;(2) Regulation Best Execution;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-order-execution-quality-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>&nbsp;and (3) amendments to Regulation NMS on minimum pricing increments, access fees, and transparency of better priced orders.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-order-execution-quality-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></p>
<p>It makes logical sense to approve the Rule 605 amendments first. Given the significant information on execution quality that the Commission will receive from the updated disclosure requirements, I would have significant concerns moving forward with the Order Competition Rule and Regulation Best Execution without analysis of the new data. The Commission cannot properly assess the balance of benefits and costs for those two proposals without observing the baseline impact on execution quality and cost implied by the improved disclosure mandated by today&rsquo;s rule adoption. Perhaps if we were in a DeLorean with a 1.21 gigawatt flux capacitor, we could travel to the future<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-order-execution-quality-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>&nbsp;and observe the impacts on execution quality and cost attributable to the Commission&rsquo;s actions taken today, but neither the Commission nor its staff have access to such a vehicle. But if we did, I hope the use of plutonium as fuel would minimize our scope 1 and 2 emissions. In the absence of such technology, a prudent regulator should exercise patience so that the effects of these amendments can properly be analyzed before further turning any further regulatory dials.</p>
<p>The Commission&rsquo;s regulatory regime has historically best served investors by creating a competitive environment, including for the use of execution services. Today&rsquo;s rule adoption&mdash;updating order execution quality and cost statistics&mdash;stands firmly within that tradition and should benefit investors and their trading needs.</p>
<p>I thank the staff in the Divisions of Trading and Markets and Economic and Risk Analysis as well as the Office of General Counsel for their efforts.</p>

<title>Statement On Final Rules Regarding Order Execution Quality, SEC Chair Gary Gensler, March 6, 2024</title>

<div> disclosure, execution quality, rule 605, broker-dealers, transparency<br />
Summary:<br />
The Commission is considering final rules to enhance disclosure requirements for execution quality, requiring large broker-dealers to disclose data and produce readable reports. <div>
<p>Today, the Commission is considering whether to adopt final rules to enhance disclosure requirements for order execution quality. I am pleased to support this adoption because it will improve transparency for execution quality and facilitate investors&rsquo; ability to compare brokers, thereby enhancing competition in our markets.</p>
<p>Every day, investors turn to broker-dealers in the markets&mdash;often through brokerage apps&mdash;to build a better financial future.</p>
<p>How do you know, however, the quality of the broker&rsquo;s execution of your order? You can turn to measures that compare the price you received with what&rsquo;s called the National Best Bid and Offer at a particular time.</p>
<p>This information is measurable, but currently, the brokers whose apps you&rsquo;re using are not required to disclose execution quality in that way.</p>
<p>Rule 605, which the Commission first adopted in 2000, requires monthly disclosures on execution quality from market participants known as market centers. In the 24 years since Rule 605 was adopted, however, our equity markets have been transformed by ever-evolving technologies and business models.</p>
<p>Therefore, current Rule 605 disclosures provide investors with a picture of execution quality that could be improved.</p>
<p>Thus, I am pleased that these final rules will modernize Rule 605 in a number of ways.</p>
<p>First, the final rules will require that large broker-dealers&mdash;those with more than 100,000 customers&mdash;disclose execution quality to the public.</p>
<p>Right now, only the so-called market centers, including the wholesalers in the dark markets, must make this disclosure. The Rule 605 requirements will apply to larger broker-dealers that combined handle more than 98 percent of customer accounts and three out of five orders from broker-dealer customers.</p>
<p>By requiring large broker-dealers&mdash;like those operating the brokerage apps&mdash;to disclose execution quality as well, investors will be better able to factor execution quality into their decisions, and you will be able to compare the brokers when you select them. I think that this disclosure also will foster greater competition among brokers, creating additional incentives for brokers to improve execution quality to earn investors&rsquo; business and trust.</p>
<p>Second, we&rsquo;re proposing to require more types of data to go into these execution quality reports.</p>
<p>For example, institutional investors often use percentage-based metrics such as the effective over quoted (E/Q) spread to evaluate execution quality. I think everyday investors would also benefit from easy access to these same metrics. These percentage-based metrics will help investors make apples-to-apples comparisons when evaluating brokers&rsquo; execution quality.</p>
<p>Further, the disclosure of execution quality will apply to a range of order sizes based on notional dollar value&mdash;from $250 to $200,000 or more&mdash;with indications that the order is for an odd-lot, a round lot, or a fractional share. The final rules also refine the order type categories to be reported.</p>
<p>These amendments will improve execution quality disclosures through capturing a larger range of relevant data.</p>
<p>Third, today&rsquo;s amendments will require market centers and broker-dealers to produce summary reports on execution quality that everyday investors can read.</p>
<p>The reports for the 24-year-old Rule 605 look like a series of dashes, numbers, and symbols. I kid you not: It&rsquo;s kind of like the opening credits in &ldquo;The Matrix.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By coincidence, the Matrix was released in 1999, just one year before the Commission last updated Rule 605. In the years since, the studios have released not one, not two, but three sequels to the Matrix. I think, three Matrix sequels after, it&rsquo;s about time we developed a &ldquo;sequel&rdquo; to current Rule 605 reporting as well, &ldquo;welcoming&rdquo; execution quality reports &ldquo;to the real world&rdquo; where everyday investors can actually use them.</p>
<p>The final rules will increase transparency for investors and facilitate their ability to compare brokers. That helps make our markets more efficient, competitive, and fair.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank members of the SEC staff for their work on these final rules, including:</p>

<title>A Risk By Any Other Name: Statement On The Enhancement And Standardization Of Climate-Related Disclosures, SEC Commissioner Caroline A. Crenshaw, March 6, 2024</title>

<div> GHG Emissions, Climate Risk Disclosures, Financial Estimates, Regulation, Securities Act <br />
Summary:<br />Today's Commission rule focuses on climate risk disclosures, emphasizing GHG emissions, financial estimates, and the Commission's statutory authority. It lacks some aspects and missed opportunities. <div>
<p><span>I. Introduction</span></p>
<p>Good morning and welcome. I want to start by thanking the hard-working staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Your professionalism, expertise, and dedication are surpassed by none, and it is a privilege to work with you in service of the public. You are all making your way through our regulatory agenda with poise, thoughtfulness, and creative problem-solving. Thank you.</p>
<p>I also want to thank former Acting Chair Lee for beginning this project in 2021 with a request for information, which was instrumental in initiating this process.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/cresnshaw-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>There has been an intense media glare on our proposal and robust public dialogue. Conversations have been myriad; discourse has been at times heated; opinions have been diverse. And, speculation on the substance of the rule &ndash; what is in and what is out &ndash; has reached a fever pitch.</p>
<p>I have observed a tendency in these discussions to let the dialogue steer away from the true purpose of our proposal: we proposed this rule to benefit investors who, at the end of the day, are people. That includes people who have put in a lifetime&rsquo;s worth of labor, and who invest their savings with the promise of a better future for themselves and their families. With luck, some are able to build stability, and create incremental progress toward their financial goals. Investors are at the heart of today&rsquo;s rulemaking, and it is critical that we give them the information they need to properly assess the risks that underlie the value of their hard-earned savings. They are entitled to consistent, comparable, and reliable climate risk disclosures &ndash; and many investors have been calling for such disclosures for years.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/cresnshaw-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Notwithstanding that strong and consistent demand, investors continue to face costly, inconsistent, disparate, and, at times, unreliable data without clearly disclosed methodologies for how these data are calculated.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/cresnshaw-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;Today&rsquo;s rule finally begins to change that. As you have heard from the staff, it establishes a floor for a disclosure framework that will provide investors with climate risk information, help inform investors&rsquo; investment decisions, and be subject to the rigor of Commission filings.</p>
<p>That floor includes:</p>
<p>First, a requirement for larger companies to disclose material Scope 1 and Scope 2 Greenhouse Gas (&ldquo;GHG&rdquo;) emissions as a quantitative metric to gauge transition risk or a company&rsquo;s publicly stated target or goal.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/cresnshaw-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;Investors have made clear that GHG emissions disclosures are necessary to understand the current and future risks to the financial condition of companies. These data may be classified by some as non-financial, but commenters emphasized that emissions disclosure is an invaluable proxy for financial risk. These disclosures serve such an important role because, among other things, they are quantitative and comparable across companies.</p>
<p>Second, a level of third-party review subject to attestation standards of those emissions data to increase their veracity and reliability.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/cresnshaw-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;In short, companies will have to disclose a quantitative dataset of GHG emissions subject to a gatekeepers&rsquo; review. These gatekeepers must follow certain widely-accepted attestation standards, which includes a requirement that the gatekeepers be independent from the company. Moreover, companies will have to disclose if they dismissed or fired a gatekeeper over disagreements related to GHG emissions disclosures, making it harder to hide deceptive or irregular practices.</p>
<p>Third, a quantitative disclosure about certain expenditures associated with activities to mitigate or adapt to climate-related risks, transition plans, targets, and goals so that investors can assess any progress or cash allocated for those purposes.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/cresnshaw-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;Disclosure of these expenditures provides fundamentally important insight into how a company is managing risk and whether and how expenditures align with qualitative disclosures and stated plans, targets, and goals. Investors will have a new avenue to ensure that companies are doing what they say they&rsquo;re doing and consider what the impacts of those activities.</p>
<p>Fourth, a disclosure of material impacts on financial estimates and assumptions.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/cresnshaw-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;This will enable investors to assess the reasonableness of the estimates and assumptions being made by companies.</p>
<p>These requirements, among others laid out in the rule, move a haphazard potpourri of public company disclosures into the Commission&rsquo;s well-developed and standardized filing ecosystem. Commission filings come with a greater disclosure review process, heightened liabilities for material misstatements and omissions from both our enforcement program and private lawsuits, a level of reliability and year-over-year reporting that is conspicuously absent from climate risk information today, and being able to access those disclosures in one location. Investors made clear to my colleagues and me that these provisions are of key importance. Investors need insight into a company&rsquo;s business, its results, and its financial condition, including material risks it faces.</p>
<p>To be crystal clear, though, this is not the rule I would have written. While these are important steps forward, they are the bare minimum. Ultimately today&rsquo;s rule is better for investors than no rule at all, and that is why it has my vote. But, while it has my vote, it does not have my unencumbered support. And, although I am loath to leave for future Commissions those obligations that I see as our responsibilities today, I&rsquo;m afraid that is precisely what we are doing.</p>
<p><span>II. GHG Emissions and Expenditures</span></p>
<p>Important disclosures remain absent from this final rule. On March 21, 2022, we proposed a rule that, among other things, included: 1) a more robust GHG emissions reporting requirement and 2) transition-related expenditure disclosure in the financial statements. There is clear legal authority to update our disclosure regime to require reporting of these metrics, and robust public demand (as demonstrated by the public comments) showing that investors actively use those metrics for their investment and voting decisions. Further, reporting companies themselves voiced support for these disclosures.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/cresnshaw-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;The final rule leaves this out.</p>
<p>GHG Emissions &ndash; Materiality Qualifiers. Today we require certain companies to report Scopes 1 and 2 GHG emissions&mdash;emissions directly produced by the company or that come from the energy the company purchases and uses&mdash;only if the company determines that such emissions would be material to a reasonable investor. However, users of the disclosures expressed clear support for mandatory reporting for all public issuers with no materiality qualifier.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/cresnshaw-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<p>GHG Emissions &ndash; Scope 3. Moreover, today&rsquo;s final rule excludes requirements to disclose Scope 3 GHG emissions, despite comments making it abundantly clear that they represent a key metric for investors in understanding climate risk, particularly transition risk.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/cresnshaw-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;Today we remove any Scope 3 requirement&mdash;even one with a safe harbor that would have shielded issuers from liability for good faith estimates in reporting.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/cresnshaw-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;Indeed, comments from investment advisers, pension funds, and the SEC&rsquo;s Investor Advisory Committee, among many others, highlight that Scope 3 remains an invaluable metric for investors. It is a comparable, quantitative metric that allows investors to measure that risk across companies, sectors, and their portfolios.</p>
<p>Overall, investor commenters described how they use GHG emissions data to inform their financial decisions to buy, sell, or hold securities. For example, one large pension fund expressed clear support for mandatory reporting of Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 (subject to a materiality qualifier) and described how climate-risk information permeates their investment analysis and decision-making across their $450 billion portfolio of state employee retirement funds. They noted that assessing the climate-related risks of their portfolio is conducted across active, passive, fundamental, quantitative, and factor-based strategies and within each of these strategies climate risk is assessed at the individual security level as well as at the aggregated portfolio level.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/cresnshaw-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;In other words, the use of these data mirrors the use of other key risk metrics and are fundamentally important to investors.</p>
<p>Expenditures. Also absent from the rule is expenditure reporting. The initial proposal contained requirements to provide line item disclosures in the financial statements related to, and financial estimates and assumptions impacted by, transition activities.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/cresnshaw-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>&nbsp;These proposed provisions were met with overwhelming investor support as they would provide better transparency and disclosure in the financial statement reporting.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/cresnshaw-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>&nbsp;These disclosures would provide: insight into publicly stated targets, goals, or plans that hundreds of US public companies have made;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/cresnshaw-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>&nbsp;a reference for investors to gauge whether qualitative discussions on climate risks are reflected in expenditures, estimates, and assumptions;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/cresnshaw-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>&nbsp;and, generally, they provide a degree of visibility into financial reporting for which investors have been advocating in this context, and in others, for years.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/cresnshaw-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a>&nbsp;Today&rsquo;s recommendation adopts an unnecessarily limited version of these disclosures.</p>
<p><span>III. Statutory Authority</span></p>
<p>And why? One posited critique of the proposed rule was that the Commission lacks the authority to enact a rule requiring the disclosure by public issuers of climate risk. I disagree.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/cresnshaw-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a></p>
<p>The Commission has clear authority under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act to require disclosures that are in the public interest and for the protection of investors, as today&rsquo;s rule is. This well-established authority has been consistently relied upon, and affirmed and reaffirmed across dozens of disclosure rulemakings over multiple decades.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/cresnshaw-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a>&nbsp;And, this authority would have supported a more robust rule. The adopting release (as well as the comment file) details our numerous statutory authorities and the many disclosures we have promulgated based upon those authorities. I will not re-hash in great detail the work the staff has already done, but there are two noteworthy points I would like to highlight.</p>
<p>First, our public company disclosure regime is meant to be updated as markets innovate and investor demand changes.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/cresnshaw-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a>&nbsp;For example, in response to calls from investors, the Commission has updated disclosure requirements through rulemaking to include information about executive compensation,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/cresnshaw-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a>&nbsp;environmental protection law compliance and related litigation risk,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/cresnshaw-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a>&nbsp;legal proceedings,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/cresnshaw-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a>&nbsp;the background and qualifications of directors and how the board monitors and oversees risks,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/cresnshaw-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a>&nbsp;more detailed plans of operations for companies issuing securities for the first time,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/cresnshaw-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a>&nbsp;and a description of the registrant&rsquo;s human capital resources which was enacted in 2020,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/cresnshaw-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a>&nbsp;among other disclosures.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/cresnshaw-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a>&nbsp;It is our obligation to respond to investors as the information needed to better assess the fundamental value of the securities they research, buy, sell and hold evolves or changes. The Commission today is moving forward with a disclosure rule in response to well-demonstrated need for consistent, comparable, and reliable information. This rule responds to demands presented by investors and the market, in a manner consistent with our practices in the past.</p>
<p>Second, SEC rules have consistently required disclosure of risks, even when the metrics related to those risks are labeled by some as not strictly financial, such as the GHG emissions discussed above.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/cresnshaw-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[28]</a>&nbsp;Yet here too we have heard the argument that this agency does not have authority to require disclosure of information related to greenhouse gases because such data are not financial metrics. Once again, our actions are entirely consistent with existing precedent. Executive compensation, environmental protection law compliance, governance disclosures risk, and other disclosures mentioned above, are prime examples of this. Cumulatively, these non-financial metrics provide investors with information that they can use to assess the overall state of an issuer.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/cresnshaw-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29">[29]</a>&nbsp;Likewise, disclosure of GHG emissions provides information that helps investors understand the current and potential financial risks a company faces.</p>
<p>Given our clear authority, rolling back the proposal is a missed opportunity. It remains my great hope that a future Commission will rise to the occasion and enact more fulsome disclosure requirements, in furtherance of our mandate and investor demand.</p>
<p><span>IV. Looking Ahead</span></p>
<p>Looking ahead, the Commission should also issue an order to recognize alternative regimes that would satisfy compliance with the rule we finalize today. Commenters noted that standard setters for other regulatory bodies, such as the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB),<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/cresnshaw-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30">[30]</a>&nbsp;are implementing their own climate-risk reporting regimes. An order recognizing such a regime would not only respond to investors, but also to the many corporate commenters who favored such an approach. Although we leave it to the future, it would be an easy and meaningful step for the Commission to take in order to avoid a patchwork of reporting obligations and potentially conflicting demands.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/cresnshaw-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31">[31]</a>&nbsp;This idea was overwhelmingly popular in the comment file and mirrors other areas of the securities laws where there are comparable cross-border regimes.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/cresnshaw-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32">[32]</a><a name="_Hlk160191863"></a></p>
<p>Once implemented, the Commission should also carefully review the effectiveness of this disclosure regime. Should we find that requiring materiality qualifiers in Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions reporting, or other changes from the proposal, result in insufficient information to adequately assess climate-related risk, we could consider guidance, 21A reports, FAQs, or other Commission actions to ensure that investors have the tools necessary to make informed investment decisions and allocate their hard-earned money as they see fit.</p>
<p><span>V. Conclusion</span></p>
<p>I have sat on this virtual dais before and cited Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/cresnshaw-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33">[33]</a>&nbsp;And perhaps I need a new well from which to draw literary references. But at the risk of sounding repetitive, I think it bears relevance today. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s in a name?&rdquo; Juliet asks Romeo. &ldquo;That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet; so Romeo would, were he not Romeo call&rsquo;d.&rdquo; Ultimately, the last names of Romeo and Juliet dictated their outcomes.</p>
<p>The critiques that I have heard about our rulemaking attempt to disguise our authority as something that it is not. It is said that we are not an environmental agency and that we should not be in the business of supporting green agendas or setting pollution standards. Those statements are true. But, we are in the business of requiring public company disclosure about risk. We have done it myriad times without having our authority questioned. We require of our public company registrants disclosures of risks related to interest rates,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/cresnshaw-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34">[34]</a>&nbsp;commodity prices,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/cresnshaw-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35">[35]</a>&nbsp;how a board is informed of risks,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/cresnshaw-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36">[36]</a>&nbsp;changes of ownership,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/cresnshaw-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37">[37]</a>&nbsp;merger transactions,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/cresnshaw-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38">[38]</a>&ndash; the list goes on. That the term &ldquo;climate&rdquo; has become a buzz word should be of no moment to a clear-eyed Commission. It should not compel us to shy away from our duties and obligations to investors. Indeed, a risk by any other name of such import to public company investors would be worthy of Commission rulemaking, and so too is this.</p>
<p>Our disclosures cannot remain stagnant; we must provide investors the information they need to understand the risks associated with their public company investments in today&rsquo;s world. A different outcome would harm the markets and investors. It would harm the safe-keeping of hard-earned retirement funds, college funds, and savings of individual people and their families. Dollars that represent a lifetime of savings, financial stability, quality of life, and comfort. We owe it to investors to ensure that they can adequately assess financial risk. Today we take a step in that direction. And while important, this rule could have been more.</p>
<p>Thank you to all the commenters who took the time to give us your thoughts, data, and views.</p>
<p>I also want to thank the expert staff at the Commission one more time, including those in the Division of Corporation Finance, Office of the Chief Accountant, Office of the General Counsel, Division of Economic Risk and Analysis and all those who worked on this rule.</p>

See Disclosures Pertaining to Matters Involving the Environment and Civil Rights, Release Nos. 33-5170, 34-9252 (July 19,1971) [36 FR 13989 (July 29, 1971)]. Then in 1973, we adopted amendments to several of our registration forms under the rationale that it is not just the fact of potential litigation or litigation that is material, but that information about a company&rsquo;s potential compliance or non-compliance with existing laws and regulations is informative about wider financial risks to a company. See Disclosure With Respect to Compliance With Environmental Requirements and Other Matters, Release Nos. 33-5386, 34-10116 (Apr. 10, 1973) [38 FR 12100 (May 9, 1973)]. (Depending on the substance of the laws, these would now be categorized as transition risks, though the term did not yet exist when these amendments were adopted 51 years ago.) In 1976, we adopted further amendments that required registrants to disclose material estimated capital expenditures for environmental control facilities. See Conclusions and Final Action on Rulemaking Proposals Relating to Environmental Disclosure, Release Nos. 33-5704, 34-12414 (May 5,1976) [41 FR 21632 (May 27, 1976)]. (As the title indicates, these amendments were adopted in response to a rulemaking petition and 15,000 pages of comments, testimony, memoranda and data. That is, not only does the Commission have a long history of requiring disclosure of these issues, but its activity in this space has also been in response to consistent investor demands for such disclosures.) In 1979, we published an interpretive release to assist registrants in complying with the requirements we had adopted and noted our &ldquo;longstanding concern about the adequacy of disclosure with respect to environmental protection requirements.&rdquo; See Environmental Disclosure, Release Nos. 33-6130; 34-16224 (Sept. 27, 1979) [44 FR 56924 (Oct. 3, 1979)]. (This guidance identified areas where the disclosures produced by the above referenced disclosure rulemakings were being under-disclosed by companies and sought to provide interpretative guidance to specify where more disclosure would be appropriate); Proposing Release at n.30 &amp; accompanying text. Far from being unprecedented, the recommendation we consider today is completely consistent with the Commission&rsquo;s history, with its place in the statutory scheme, and with previous interpretations of the relevant statutory language.</p>

<title>Enhancing And Standardizing Climate-Related Disclosures For Investors, SEC Commissioner Jaime Lizárraga, March 6, 2024</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Commission, disclosure, climate-related, investors, rule
<br />
The final rule from the Commission requires standardized climate risk disclosures to protect investors and provide reliable, consistent, and comparable information.
<br /><br />Summary: The Commission's final rule requires standardized climate risk disclosures to protect investors and provide reliable, consistent, and comparable information. <div>
<p>Over the last nine decades, the Commission, pursuant to authority granted by Congress, has amended its disclosure requirements on dozens of occasions. Commissions from both political parties have modernized existing rules, or adopted new ones, to adapt to changing market conditions and to meet investor demand for improved disclosure of material information. In the process, the Commission has done what it does best: protect investors by empowering them to make informed investment and voting decisions.</p>
<p>The climate-related disclosures we are advancing today are no different from many of the Commission&rsquo;s existing disclosure requirements, including those related to: material litigation proceedings, risk factors, management&rsquo;s discussion and analysis (MD&amp;A) of its financial condition and results of operations, mining resources and reserves, market risks for derivatives and other market-sensitive instruments, human capital resources, cyber governance and incident disclosures, and many others.</p>
<p>Our securities laws are dynamic and adaptable. Our capital markets, the most resilient in the world, have benefited from the Commission&rsquo;s efforts to respond to investor needs and to market change.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s reforms respond to investor demand for standardized and comparable information on climate-related risks and impacts. Investors view this information as relevant to a company&rsquo;s bottom line and as material to their investment and voting decisions. It can also assist with investors&rsquo; analysis as to whether hedging or diversifying of their portfolio is warranted.</p>
<p>The connection between climate-related risks and a company&rsquo;s fundamental value is well-established, as highlighted by studies cited in the Commission&rsquo;s release. These risks play out through differences in revenues, operating income and expenses, cash flows, capital structures, asset prices, debt performance, and investment policies.</p>
<p>Investor demand for climate risk disclosures has already had an impact on the market. For example, in the past few years we&rsquo;ve seen roughly:</p>
<ul>
<li>60 percent of Russell 3000 companies and 90 percent of Russell 1000 companies provide some form of climate-related information; and</li>
<li>Nearly 60 percent of Russell 1000 companies disclose Scopes 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But under the status quo, investors would continue to face a patchwork of disclosures, with a limited ability to conduct apples-to-apples comparisons.</p>
<p>In the extensive comment process that preceded the proposal and the adoption of this final rule, commenters expressed concerns with the wide variability of voluntary climate-related disclosures, and with the lack of reliable, consistent, and comparable information.</p>
<p>By requiring registrants to provide standardized climate risk-related disclosures in Commission filings, market participants will benefit from being able to more efficiently analyze information that will be integrated with other important disclosures, such as a full description of the company, other disclosed risks, and the company&rsquo;s financial statements.</p>
<p>The final rule will also provide investors with more liability protections than they receive today. In contrast to voluntary disclosures, the Commission will treat climate risk information in registrants&rsquo; annual reports and registration statements as &ldquo;filed.&rdquo; This means that registrants can be liable under Section 18 of the Exchange Act, or Section 11 of the Securities Act, for any materially false or misleading statements. Such treatment will prevent greenwashing and place climate risk disclosures on the same footing as other information that registrants disclose under Regulations S-X and S-K.</p>
<p>As is customary in the rulemaking process, and consistent with the law, the Commission considered a wide range of commenters&rsquo; feedback in its deliberations. Commission staff undertook a thorough analysis of this feedback and crafted a final rule that appropriately balances all of the input with the rule&rsquo;s policy goals.</p>
<p>Some commenters argued that the Commission&rsquo;s proposed rule is unnecessary because climate risks are already subject to current disclosure rules if registrants deem those risks to be material.</p>
<p>The Commission&rsquo;s 2010 guidance indeed emphasized that Regulations S-K and S-X may require disclosures related to climate-related risks, including in the description of business, legal proceedings, risk factors, and MD&amp;A.</p>
<p>But many commenters indicated that the 2010 Guidance is insufficient for the current state of the market. These commenters advocated for standardized disclosures that facilitate comparability across registrants. That is what today&rsquo;s final rule attempts to do.</p>
<p>Several changes to the rule between proposal and adoption also demonstrate the Commission&rsquo;s careful analysis of stakeholder input.</p>
<p>Mindful of concerns expressed around data collection, as well as possible indirect burdens on entities outside of the Commission&rsquo;s purview, the final rule does not require disclosure of Scope 3 GHG emissions.</p>
<p>Large accelerated and accelerated filers, however, are required to disclose Scopes 1 and 2 GHG emissions, if material. The final rule requires attestation for these disclosures at the limited assurance level, and after a phase-in period, at a higher standard of reasonable assurance for large accelerated filers.</p>
<p>Attestation must be provided by an expert in GHG emissions that is independent of the registrant and subject to the anti-fraud provisions of our securities laws. As a result, investors will have greater confidence about the accuracy and reliability of these disclosures than they do under the current voluntary framework.</p>
<p>Smaller reporting companies and emerging growth companies will not be required to disclose Scopes 1 and 2 GHG emissions and will have a longer compliance phase-in period for other required disclosures.</p>
<p>With respect to financial statement disclosures, the final rule streamlines the requirements to focus on discrete costs and expenditures incurred from severe weather events and natural conditions, which are already captured in a registrant&rsquo;s financial statements. At the same time, the final rule requires material expenditures to be disclosed in Reg S-K if incurred as a direct result of a registrant&rsquo;s mitigation or adaptation activities.</p>
<p>Even though some registrants have voluntarily chosen to adopt a transition plan, or climate-related targets and goals, or to conduct scenario analysis, or come up with an internal carbon price, the Commission is not, and does not intend to be, a climate or merit regulator. However, for companies that take such actions to manage a material risk or impact, investors should have access to meaningful information to evaluate whether greenwashing is occurring. That said, to ensure such requirements are not unduly burdensome the final rule provides a safe harbor for such forward-looking statements.</p>
<p>Overall, the final rule is a product of the Commission&rsquo;s standard exercise of its basic authority to require full and fair disclosure by public companies to investors.</p>
<p>It embodies a time-tested approach based on traditional notions of materiality familiar to the Commission&rsquo;s registrants and to market participants.</p>
<p>The Commission&rsquo;s actions reflect investors&rsquo; views that climate risks can be material to their investment and voting decisions, and that these risks can have a material impact on a company&rsquo;s bottom line.</p>
<p>In short, the Commission is doing what it was designed to do: protect investors and foster transparent capital markets by improving the reliability, consistency, and comparability of material climate risk disclosures for investors.</p>
<p>Chair Gensler and Commissioner Crenshaw: thank you for engaging so constructively with me in finalizing this rule.</p>
<p>Commissioners Peirce and Uyeda: you may end up having a different view than my own, but I respect your perspectives and appreciate your contributions to our deliberations.</p>
<p>With the broad interest this rulemaking has received, inevitably, some will view it as having gone too far, while others will see it as not having gone far enough.</p>
<p>An old, familiar saying comes to mind: we must not let the perfect be the enemy of the good. In my judgment, this final rule, while not perfect, strikes the appropriate balance and is sufficiently robust to warrant the Commission&rsquo;s approval. I am pleased to support it.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<div> Rule 605, execution quality, market participants, transparency, competition <br />
Summary:<br />
Reforms to Rule 605 will enhance execution quality information, promote transparency, and provide user-friendly reports for all market participants. <div>
<p>Since the Commission&rsquo;s original adoption of Rule 605 nearly a quarter century ago, the size, structure, and trading speed of our markets have all changed significantly. Although the rule has worked well since then, the information on execution quality included in current Rule 605 reports is less useful in meeting the modern needs of market participants and investors. The current scope and content of Rule 605 reports have fallen behind technological and market developments, such as increased retail participation, trading of fractional shares, and off-exchange trading.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s reforms will enhance the decision-useful information included in the monthly Rule 605 reports on order execution, including improved statistical measures of execution quality.</p>
<p>The final rules will promote greater transparency, increase the information available to market participants, and promote healthy competition among market centers and broker-dealers on execution quality. Summary reports provided for under the rule will allow investors of all sizes, independent analysts, the financial press, and all other market participants to review user-friendly information on execution quality.</p>
<p>I am pleased to support these long overdue reforms to this important disclosure framework.</p>

<title>Statement On Adoption Of Amendments To Rule 605: Disclosure Of Order Execution Information, SEC Commissioner Caroline A. Crenshaw, March 6, 2024</title>

<div> Adopting Release, Rule 605, market centers, execution quality, broker-dealers
<br />
Summary: Rule 605 increased disclosure to compare execution quality, but has not been updated since 2000. Amendments aim to modernize content and provide more relevant and accessible information. <div>
<p>Before Rule 605 was adopted,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/crenshaw-statement-order-execution-quality-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;there was little publicly available information that investors could use to compare and evaluate execution quality among different market centers.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/crenshaw-statement-order-execution-quality-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;Retail investors were not in a position to make informed decisions based on important measures of execution quality such as effective spreads and price improvements. Instead, these investors were left to choose among broker-dealers that ostensibly offered the lowest commission and &ldquo;fast&rdquo; executions. However, there was no straightforward way for investors to compare execution quality across broker-dealers or market centers when evaluating these claims. As a result, neither market centers<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/crenshaw-statement-order-execution-quality-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;such as exchanges and certain market makers, nor broker-dealers had a strong incentive to compete on their ability to obtain the best prices for investor orders.</p>
<p>Rule 605 was designed to empower market forces to achieve a more competitive and efficient national market system for investors by increasing the visibility of order execution and routing practices. The idea is that the rule&rsquo;s disclosure requirements provide investors with a clearer picture of overall routing practices of different broker-dealers, which then facilitates greater investor involvement and choice in order routing decisions, ultimately resulting in improved execution practices. Indeed, a study on the impact of Rule 605 concluded that, in fact, the rule was effective. Overall, the goal of improving execution quality through more transparent markets was achieved.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/crenshaw-statement-order-execution-quality-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p>Although the rule worked and 605 has provided significant insight into execution quality, the content of the required disclosures has not been substantively updated since the year 2000, despite changes in the speed and nature of trading.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/crenshaw-statement-order-execution-quality-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;As a result, Rule 605 reports have become less informative than they were when the rule was adopted. Today&rsquo;s amendments will increase the relevance and use of information contained in the rule&rsquo;s reports by expanding the scope of reporting entities, modernizing the content of the reports, and broadening the reports&rsquo; accessibility.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/crenshaw-statement-order-execution-quality-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;For the first time, the amendments would allow customers of larger broker-dealers, as well as other market participants, to have access to direct information about the aggregate execution quality achieved by their broker-dealers.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/crenshaw-statement-order-execution-quality-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;Just like the disclosure regime for public companies, our disclosure regime for this information should be updated as markets innovate and change.</p>
<p>Customers can use this information to compare execution quality across broker-dealers and select broker-dealers offering better execution quality. This increase in market participants&rsquo; ability to compare such information should increase the degree to which broker-dealers compete on the basis of execution quality when making their order routing decisions, for example by adjusting their routing practices to increase the extent to which they route orders to the market centers offering better execution quality, and limiting the extent to which they route orders for other potential reasons.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/crenshaw-statement-order-execution-quality-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;The amendments will also enable investors to make better apples-to-apples comparisons across reporting entities with potentially different order flow by expanding and modernizing order size and order type categories. In addition, the amendments will improve market participants&rsquo; ability to compare time-to-execution across reporting entities by increasing the relevance of time-to-execution information in Rule 605 reports. This is expected to lead to improved execution times, benefiting investors that value fast executions by helping them to identify and route orders to reporting entities offering faster execution speeds.</p>
<p>Finally, execution quality is also expected to increase as a result of the amendments requiring reporting entities to prepare human-readable summary reports, in addition to the more detailed machine-readable reports required under pre-existing Rule 605. The summary report will provide an abbreviated overview of the more detailed Rule 605 report for interested parties to assess, and is expected to help independent analysts, consultants, broker-dealers, the financial press, and market centers in analyzing the disclosures and producing even more digestible information using data from the summary report. This is important so that the broader public, including those that may not read the summary report, can benefit.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/crenshaw-statement-order-execution-quality-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the staff of the Division of Trading and Markets, the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, and the Office of the General Counsel for all their hard work on this release. I&rsquo;m pleased to support today&rsquo;s rule. Thank you.</p>

<div> Proposal, Climate-related disclosures, Compliance costs, Materiality, Enforcement challenges
Summary:
The final rule emphasizes climate-related disclosures, raises concerns about compliance costs, and questions the enforcement challenges and materiality. <div>
<p>Thank you, Mr. Chair. The final rule is different from the proposal, but it still promises to spam investors with details about the Commission&rsquo;s pet topic of the day&mdash;climate. As we have heard already, the recommendation before us eliminates the Scope 3 reporting requirements, reworks the financial statement disclosures, and removes some of the other overly granular disclosures. But these changes do not alter the rule&rsquo;s fundamental flaw&mdash;its insistence that climate issues deserve special treatment and disproportionate space in Commission disclosures and managers&rsquo; and directors&rsquo; brain space. Because the Commission fails to justify that disparate treatment, I dissent.</p>
<p>The Commission does not point to a persuasive reason to reject the existing principles-based, materiality focused approach to climate risk. While the Commission insinuates that companies focus too little on climate risks, it offers scant concrete evidence of inappropriate reserve, and even highlights that 36% of annual Commission filings include climate information.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;Our existing disclosure regime already requires companies to inform investors about material risks and trends&mdash;including those related to climate&mdash;by empowering companies to tell their unique story to investors. The Commission&rsquo;s 2010 climate guidance explains how climate-related issues, particularly pertaining to a company&rsquo;s financial condition, could be required in disclosures under the Commission&rsquo;s existing regime.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;Under current rules, companies may have to disclose, among other things, information relating to the &ldquo;[i]mpact of legislation and regulation,&rdquo; &ldquo;international accords,&rdquo; &ldquo;[i]ndirect consequences of regulation and business trends,&rdquo; and &ldquo;[p]hysical impacts of climate change.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;And, although the responsibility for disclosing lies with the company, the Commission&rsquo;s Division of Corporation Finance reviews company filings and sends comment letters to companies to ensure that they are fulfilling this responsibility. Companies that do not make accurate or complete disclosures could face enforcement actions or private lawsuits.</p>
<p>The Commission does not persuasively explain why principles-based rules, staff disclosure review, and enforcement actions are not effective in eliciting the climate disclosure the objectively reasonable investor needs. To the contrary, the Commission has a strong view of the power of existing rules to elicit climate disclosure. For example, the Commission today, in deciding not to adopt the proposed financial statement metrics, warned that companies might have to make those disclosures anyway under existing rules.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p>The Commission, in adopting today&rsquo;s climate prescriptions, dismisses the role that materiality ought to play in balancing the costs and benefits of disclosure. Information is material if there is a substantial likelihood that an objectively reasonable investor would consider the information important to an investment or voting decision.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;All reasonable investors value financial returns, but they may diverge on which non-economic considerations are important.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;A regime rooted in materiality helps companies inform investors without spamming them with information that is irrelevant to the company&rsquo;s financial picture.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p>This rule replaces our current principles-based regime with dozens of pages of prescriptive climate-related regulations. While the Commission has decorated the final rule with materiality ribbons, the rule embraces materiality in name only.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;The resulting flood of climate-related disclosures will overwhelm investors, not inform them. The rule mandates specific granular disclosures. These include, to list a few, the process of how a company&rsquo;s board oversees and is informed of climate risk,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;how a company&rsquo;s management assesses and manages material climate risk,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;which management positions manage climate risk and the associated expertise,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;the geographic location of physical climate risk,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>&nbsp;and how climate risks affect items like a company&rsquo;s &ldquo;[p]roducts or services,&rdquo; &ldquo;suppliers,&rdquo; climate mitigation activities, and &ldquo;expenditures for research and development.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>&nbsp;Protestations of materiality also trip over the absurdly low de minimis thresholds for disclosing how severe weather events and other natural conditions affect a company&rsquo;s financial statements. The threshold is only $100,000 for expenditures expensed as incurred and losses in the income statement<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>&nbsp;and $500,000 for capitalized costs and charges recognized on the balance sheet.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a></p>
<p>By rejecting a principles-based regime grounded in materiality for climate, the Commission could trigger a hodgepodge of requirements tailored to meet the demands of a vast and ever-expanding panoply of special interests.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a>&nbsp;A pro-life investor, an anti-cannabis investor, or an anti-war investor might want idiosyncratic information to assess a company&rsquo;s performance on those respective issues. Employees, customers, suppliers, social activists, local communities, and other interested non-investors will now line up to get the information they want to know included in disclosures for which shareholders have to pay. Even asset managers &ndash; whom the Release wrongly classifies as investors &ndash; and institutional investors may be driven by something other than financial returns when they seek information.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a>&nbsp;An asset manager, for example, may need data &ndash; not to serve its clients &ndash; but to satisfy a climate pledge the adviser made when it voluntarily joined a climate action organization.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a></p>
<p>However well-intentioned, these particularized interests do not justify forcing investors who do not share them to foot the bill. Congress did not create this agency to satisfy the wants of every investor, but to serve the interests of the objectively reasonable investor seeking a return on her capital. We lack the expertise to oversee these special interest disclosures, and only a mandate from Congress should put us in the business of facilitating the disclosure of information not clearly related to financial returns.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a>&nbsp;As Commissioner Roberta Karmel concluded in 1978, when debates about the role of Commission disclosure were raging as they are today: &ldquo;[D]espite the legitimate concerns of ethical investors, I believe we should exercise caution in applying a non-economic standard of materiality to disclosure requirements . . . .&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a>&nbsp;Wading into non-economic issues involves tradeoffs that only our nation&rsquo;s elected representatives have the authority and expertise to make.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a>&nbsp;If we lose our focus on objectively reasonable investors, special interest groups will turn to us to achieve what they cannot accomplish through normal political channels.</p>
<p>Despite cost-saving changes from the proposed rule, the final rule will prove expensive for public companies and their shareholders who will be paying for climate disclosure spam. The Commission performs impressive math-crobatics to slash the anticipated cost of the rule by almost 90 percent,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a>&nbsp;but even with these potentially understated estimates, the Commission still must concede that this rule will increase the typical external costs of being a public company by around 21%.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a>&nbsp;The rule is particularly likely to overwhelm small public companies, many of which are already struggling under the costs of being public.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a>&nbsp;At a time when few companies are choosing to go public,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a>&nbsp;why would we add so substantially to the price tag?</p>
<p>To comply with the new rule, public companies will need elaborate internal control systems and disclosure control procedures to capture and distill information related to physical and transition risks, severe weather events, severe natural conditions, and greenhouse gas emissions.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a>&nbsp;They will hire third-party climate consultants, assurance providers,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[28]</a>&nbsp;internal and external counsel, and information technology professionals; face legal liability through Commission actions and the inevitable flood of class actions for their mandated filed disclosures;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29">[29]</a>&nbsp;and bear the indirect costs of lost management time, board distraction,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30">[30]</a>&nbsp;and disruptive changes in company operations. The new financial statement disclosures could force smaller companies to overhaul their existing accounting software.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31">[31]</a>&nbsp;Even companies that do not end up reporting material climate risks or expenditures will be forced to invest in systems to reach a determination that they do not have material items to disclose.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32">[32]</a>&nbsp;The Commission does not take full account of the costs to make such a non-materiality determination.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33">[33]</a>&nbsp;Requiring public disclosure of such extensive climate information, including on governance processes, will reduce companies&rsquo; flexibility in responding to all kinds of risks, including climate risks, and deter them from engaging in substantive improvements to business processes.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34">[34]</a></p>
<p>The rule&rsquo;s anticipated benefits do not outweigh the costs. Proponents of a Commission climate rule hope that it will yield more accurate, comparable, and complete climate disclosures. If we do not look at it too closely, the final rule might appear to fulfill those hopes. But a closer inspection brings us crashing back to the reality that many climate disclosures are high-priced guesses about the present and future. Measurement and reporting are not standardized within companies, let alone across companies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Attempts to treat climate data on par with financial data are strained. Despite ongoing efforts to improve climate data collection and analysis, they are still imprecise.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35">[35]</a>&nbsp;For example, commenters highlighted the difficulty of accurately predicting potential physical climate risks<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36">[36]</a>&nbsp;and transition risks.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37">[37]</a>&nbsp;Technical compliance with this rule will produce authoritative-looking results, but underlying them will be layers of assumptions and extrapolations. Different companies will take different approaches to resolving these uncertainties, which will undermine comparability.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38">[38]</a>&nbsp;More bespoke disclosures, such as the current rules allow, better inform investors, and, over time, companies likely would coalesce around approaches that generated reliable and comparable disclosures. Letting that process play out organically would be superior to the top-down approach we are embracing today.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39">[39]</a>&nbsp;The final rule attempts to short-cut this admittedly protracted market-driven process, but the result will be unreliable disclosures that mask real differences across companies. Also concerning is the possibility that the back-of-the-envelope guesswork underlying climate disclosures will bleed into the financial statements and other disclosures, thus undermining the effectiveness of our disclosure and financial reporting regime. As efforts to integrate financial and climate reporting proceed, the lower standards accepted by necessity for climate reporting and assurance could bring down the quality of financial reporting.</p>
<p>While the Commission feigns agnosticism about how public companies should think about climate risks, the prescriptive nature of this new climate regime will affect corporate behavior. Through an extensive set of leading disclosure items, the Commission steps into the shoes of the corporate board, nudges corporate decision-making, and distorts corporate supply chains.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40">[40]</a>&nbsp;These new disclosure requirements are rooted in what &ldquo;the Commission believes should matter to investors.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41">[41]</a>&nbsp;The Commission is forcing individual public companies to operate in a conduct-altering disclosure regime that may have no direct relevance to their situation. The Commission argues that it is well within its authority in adopting this rule, but the argument we make for our authority here has no limiting principle.</p>
<p>The Commission could have simply required companies to disclose material climate risks that they already recognize and explain how they manage them.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42">[42]</a>&nbsp;Such an approach would not have conveyed an expectation that companies devote vast new resources to assessing, managing, and disclosing climate risks that the Commission has identified for them. It also would have been consistent with the current required disclosure of &ldquo;material events and uncertainties known to management that are reasonably likely to cause reported financial information.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43">[43]</a></p>
<p>We should be re-proposing this rule not adopting it. The final rule differs quite dramatically from the proposal, both by excluding major provisions and including new rule elements. A re-proposal would have helped us better assess these changes. It also would have helped us to understand recent legal developments in California and Europe that raise complex cost and mutual recognition issues.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44">[44]</a>&nbsp;Rather than grappling with these issues in the cost-benefit analysis, the Commission confesses to lacking the data to accurately assess them.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45">[45]</a>&nbsp;This approach does not give fair notice to the public or allow commenters the opportunity to address anything that closely resembles today&rsquo;s final rule.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46">[46]</a><a name="_Hlk159962866"></a></p>
<p>Although I do not support the recommendation before us, I do want to acknowledge the multi-year effort underlying it. Analyzing these difficult issues and the voluminous comment letters was a monumental challenge. I appreciate all the long and late hours you devoted to producing today&rsquo;s rule. I also appreciate the many hours you spent with me and my staff discussing the rule. Thank you to Mika Morse, Erik Gerding, Luna Bloom, Valian Afshar, Elliot Staffin, and other staff in the Division of Corporation Finance, Shaz Niazi, Erin Nelson, Mamta Soni, and Meagan Van Orden in the Office of Chief Accountant, the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, and the Office of General Counsel, as well as others throughout the Commission who worked on this rule.</p>
<p>I have several questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Although the cost estimates for this rule are dramatically lower than the cost estimates for the proposed rule, my understanding is that, based on our estimates, 15 percent of a company&rsquo;s annual SEC disclosure costs would be attributable to climate disclosures.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47">[47]</a><ol>
<li>Do we plan to go back in several years to assess the accuracy of these estimates and whether the benefits of the rule outweigh the costs? If so, what metrics do we plan to use for assessing whether the rule has succeeded in meeting its objectives?</li>
<li>Our cost estimates omit the cost for large accelerated filers and accelerated filers to make a materiality determination on their Scopes 1 and 2 emissions if such companies ultimately omit this data from their disclosures. Do you have any sense of what it could cost companies to make a materiality assessment?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The Release promises investors &ldquo;more detailed, consistent, reliable, and comparable information about climate-related effects on a registrant&rsquo;s business and financial condition.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48">[48]</a>&nbsp;Does any company&rsquo;s climate reporting today reflect the same level of consistency, reliability, and comparability that financial reporting does? If not, how long do you think it will take for climate reporting to be as consistent, reliable, and comparable as financial reporting?</li>
<li>Even with Scope 3 off the table, the greenhouse gas emissions disclosures seem to be something new. One commenter explained it this way: &ldquo;The SEC&rsquo;s justification for the disclosure is that governments, regulators, or consumers might take action against GHG emissions that might cause a negative financial effect at the company that might be significant to a reasonable investor. The reliance on this series of possibilities is on top of the reliance on the uncertain and imprecise methods for calculating GHG emissions. The chain connecting an undependable disclosure of GHG emissions to a material financial effect on the disclosing company is long and speculative. The outward look and the speculative nature of requiring disclosure of GHG emissions make that disclosure obligation different from nearly all other mandatory SEC disclosures.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49">[49]</a><ol>
<li>Why isn&rsquo;t this commenter right that we are dealing with a new kind of rule here, and perhaps one for which we have no statutory authority?</li>
<li>What unique enforcement challenges does such a rule pose?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Given that we take the position that we have broad authority to mandate climate disclosures, do we have the authority to preempt California&rsquo;s recently passed disclosure law, which appears to be intended to serve as a national standard?</li>
<li>The term &ldquo;natural condition&rdquo; is undefined.<ol>
<li>What is a severe natural condition?</li>
<li>Is a global health pandemic a severe natural condition?<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50">[50]</a></li>
<li>If so, is it covered by the rule? If not, what in the rule text tells me that it is not covered?</li>
<li>Why don&rsquo;t investors need disaggregated disclosure of capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and losses incurred as a result of severe global pandemics to better understand the effect such events have on the financial statements?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Applying the final rule, even though it is easier than what was proposed, presents challenges.<ol>
<li>Consider a company that is building a new asset. It considers flood risk because the company, in its two-hundred year history, has experienced a flood every ten years. Would the company&rsquo;s decisions relating to managing flood risk for an asset qualify either as an activity to mitigate climate risk or a transition plan?</li>
<li>If a company creates a low-carbon product or expands its supply of a low-carbon product because of increased customer demand, without considering whether the increase is due to climate change, where does that activity fall under the rules?<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51">[51]</a></li>
<li>How should a public company disclose transition risk if electoral outcomes could drastically alter the risk it faces?</li>
<li>Does &ldquo;climate-related risk&rdquo; include a situation in which there is reduced demand for electric vehicles, as a result of consumer demand, political, legal, or other factors?</li>
<li>Would an automobile manufacturer&rsquo;s decision to shift away from EVs to accommodate consumer preferences be considered a &ldquo;transition plan&rdquo;?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>I expect that companies will spend a substantial amount of time, money, and stress on putting controls in place to comply with various aspects of the rule and then obtaining assurance where that is required.<ol>
<li>What similarities and differences do you anticipate seeing as compared with issuers&rsquo; experience with developing and obtaining auditor attestation for internal controls under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act?</li>
<li>Are there lessons we learned from that experience that we can apply here?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The rule permits issuers to hire non-auditor assurance providers.<ol>
<li>Will a non-accountant assurance provider be able to come to the Office of Chief Accountant for advice on complying with, and no-action relief from, the independence requirements and no-action relief?</li>
<li>If so, how will the Commission be apprised of advice and relief given?</li>
</ol></li>

<p>Thank you, Chair Gensler, and thank you to the staff for your presentations.</p>
<p><span>A Roadmap for Abuse</span></p>
<p>Today, much emphasis will be placed on how this rule has been dialed-back from the proposal, is focused on providing material information to investors, and that the Commission is not a climate regulator. To that, I emphasize the advice that I give to would-be investors: do not rely on the marketing materials and read the prospectus instead. By the time you finish reading all 886 pages of today&rsquo;s release, you will conclude that this rule is climate regulation promulgated under the Commission&rsquo;s seal.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s rule is the culmination of efforts by various interests to hijack and use the federal securities laws for their climate-related goals. In doing so, they have created a roadmap for others to abuse the Commission&rsquo;s disclosure regime to achieve their own political and social goals. First, they purchase shares in public companies under the guise of becoming &ldquo;investors,&rdquo; but not with the primary intention of seeking financial return. Rather, they use their holdings as a means to force companies to disclose information related to political and social issues important to them but that may not be relevant to those companies&rsquo; business or shareholders generally. After some companies capitulate to their demands, they ask the Commission to adopt rules requiring the disclosure from all companies. Citing such &ldquo;investor demand&rdquo; for the information and the need to have &ldquo;consistent and comparable&rdquo; disclosure, a politically-oriented Commission might pursue such a rulemaking. If it does, then the result is using disclosure not as a tool to aid investors, but to bypass Congress to achieve political and social change without the corresponding accountability to the electorate.</p>
<p>The Commission is a securities regulator without statutory authority or expertise to address political and social issues. In adopting new disclosure rules, the Commission should understand the informational needs of a &ldquo;reasonable investor.&rdquo; This is precisely what the Supreme Court called for in TSC Industries v. Northway, when it stated that &ldquo;the question of materiality, it is universally agreed, is an objective one, involving the significance of an omitted or misrepresented fact to a reasonable investor.&rdquo;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;The Court further noted that disclosure policy embodied in regulation is &ldquo;not without limit.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;Thus, before requiring disclosure, the Commission should assess whether the benefits of the information to the reasonable investor outweigh the costs of producing the disclosure. Unfortunately, this analysis did not occur for today&rsquo;s rulemaking. Instead, the Commission ventured outside of its lane and set a precedent for using its disclosure regime as a means for driving social change. If left unchecked, we may see further misuse of the Commission&rsquo;s rules for political and social issues and an erosion of the agency&rsquo;s reputation as an independent financial regulator.</p>
<p><span>A Major Question Implicated</span></p>
<p>The Commission asserts that the federal securities laws allow it to require information &ldquo;necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors&rdquo; and explains how it has relied on these provisions over the past 90 years to adopt various disclosure rules.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;But the Supreme Court has made clear that a &ldquo;colorable textual basis&rdquo; may be insufficient to support an assertion of regulatory authority, especially if Congress was unlikely &ldquo;to delegate a policy decision of such economic and political magnitude to [the] administrative agency.&rdquo;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;In explaining the major questions doctrine, the Court stated that &ldquo;[e]traordinary grants of regulatory authority are rarely accomplished through &lsquo;modest word,&rsquo; &lsquo;vague terms,&rsquo; or &lsquo;subtle device[s].&rsquo;&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s rulemaking is an extraordinary exercise of regulatory authority by the Commission that involves an economically and politically significant policy decision. The Commission adopts an entirely new subpart of Regulation S-K and an entirely new article of Regulation S-X for one topic &ndash; climate change &ndash; applicable to all public companies. In doing so, the rulemaking elevates climate above nearly all other issues facing public companies.</p>
<p>In no other context is a company required to provide an explanation of expenses that exceed one percent of income before taxes and analyze the significant contributing factor to the expense. For no other risk does the Commission require prescriptive, forward-looking disclosure of the risk&rsquo;s impacts on the company&rsquo;s strategy, business model, outlook, financial planning, and capital allocation. Today&rsquo;s rule also requires disclosure of climate-related targets and goals, even though the Commission has no similar requirements for a company&rsquo;s targets and goals related to other, more important matters affecting the company, such as financial performance, product development, customer acquisition, or market expansion. Finally, the requirement to disclose GHG emissions and obtain an attestation report on such disclosure is in a class of its own without comparison in the Commission&rsquo;s disclosure regime.</p>
<p>The Commission does not articulate any limiting principle for its claimed authority and why today&rsquo;s rule is within that limiting principle. Perhaps the Commission does not believe that there are limitations. The Supreme Court has stated that, in extraordinary cases &ndash; which I believe includes today&rsquo;s rule &ndash; an agency must cite to &ldquo;something more than a merely plausible textual basis for [its] action. The agency instead must point to &lsquo;clear congressional authorization&rsquo; for the power it claims.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;The Commission has not done so for this rulemaking.</p>
<p><span>A Flawed Process</span></p>
<p>Even without the major questions doctrine and concerns about statutory authority, the Commission conducted a flawed process by not re-proposing the rule, raising the question of whether appropriate notice was provided under the Administrative Procedure Act.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p>The Commission proposed this rulemaking nearly two years ago and received thousands of comment letters. Many commenters focused on the controversial part to require companies to disclose their scope 3 emissions. Given the proposal&rsquo;s expansive nature and its hundreds of requests for feedback, most commenters did not focus on, or address, every single issue or alternative raised. By removing the requirement to disclose scope 3 emissions and making numerous other substantive changes, the final rule differs significantly from the proposal. One only need to run a comparison of the proposed rule text and the final rule text to visualize page after page of extensive red ink reflecting strikethroughs and additions.</p>
<p>The Commission has essentially admitted that the proposal did not get it right. Accordingly, the Commission should have re-proposed this rule with an updated economic analysis and solicited additional public feedback. Doing so would have provided the public with an opportunity to focus on aspects of the proposal that they did not initially consider and submit comments on any revised requirements. At the minimum, a re-proposal could have resulted in a better estimate of the costs and benefits associated with this rulemaking. As the release notes, &ldquo;[m]any commenters provided aggregate cost estimates that did not include certain elements required by the final rules, or included other elements that are not required in the final rules [and it was] difficult to use these cost estimates to quantify the direct costs of the final rules.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p><span>An Intrusion into the Boardroom</span></p>
<p>The practical effect of today&rsquo;s rule is that companies&rsquo; boards and management will need to spend more time and resources to think about, assess, and discuss climate change, even if no disclosure is ultimately made. Audit committees will be required to determine what it means to have had a &ldquo;severe weather event and other natural condition.&rdquo; Lawyers and accountants will need to become well versed in hurricane categories and the Enhanced Fujita Scale.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;But there is an opportunity cost to all of this. By forcing companies to spend more time and resources on climate discussions, the Commission creates the risk that companies may ignore, or not pay sufficient attention to, other matters that could have greater and more immediate impacts.</p>
<p>After the rule goes into effect, companies will have a duty to provide prescriptive, climate-related disclosure knowing that any non-disclosure, including assessments of materiality, will be judged in hindsight. To avoid potential liability, companies may voluntarily disclose climate-related information despite concluding that the information is immaterial. Even when a company does not ultimately make any disclosure, it will have spent considerable resources to gather and assess climate-related information, including potentially measuring its GHG emissions, in order to have effective disclosure controls and procedures and, where applicable, internal controls over financial reporting.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;The takeaway is that climate will be nearly everything, everywhere, all at once for public companies.</p>
<p>The primary financial beneficiaries of today&rsquo;s rulemaking will be the ESG consultants, auditors, attestation providers, and attorneys who will advise on compliance with the new provisions. Keep in mind that not one dime of money spent on compliance will be used for actual reductions in GHG emissions, and that shareholders will be footing this bill.</p>
<p><span>A Lack of Exemptions</span></p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s rule will eventually be felt by all public companies. While the Commission could have exempted smaller reporting companies and emerging growth companies (&ldquo;EGCs&rdquo;) from all aspects of today&rsquo;s rule, it limited the relief only to disclosure of GHG emissions. EGCs did not receive an &ldquo;on-ramp&rdquo; for the disclosure requirements, which was the impetus for more companies to go public as part of the JOBS Act.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;Accordingly, after the compliance date for EGCs begins, they will need to provide climate-related disclosure on day one. Also, do not be fooled into thinking that limiting GHG emission disclosure to large accelerated filers and accelerated filers provides meaningful relief because a company with a public float as low as $250 million may still be required to report its GHG emissions.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></p>
<p>Finally, the Commission continues to diverge from its historic practice of largely deferring to the disclosures made by foreign private issuers (&ldquo;FPIs&rdquo;) pursuant to their home country reporting requirements. For climate-related disclosure, many foreign jurisdictions have adopted, or announced plans to adopt, their own disclosure requirements.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>&nbsp;The Commission could have eased the reporting burdens of FPIs and made the U.S. capital markets more attractive to them by allowing these foreign companies to report climate-related information pursuant to their home country requirements. Such an approach may also encourage foreign regulators to allow mutual recognition of the Commission&rsquo;s rules with respect to U.S. companies with foreign operations. Unfortunately, the Commission&rsquo;s decision today may subject U.S. companies to multiple regulations on climate disclosure and make the U.S. capital markets less attractive to foreign companies.</p>
<p><span>A Thank You to the Staff</span></p>
<p>Because of the concerns that I have with today&rsquo;s rule, I am unable to support it. There are many important political and social issues facing the country, but the place to resolve those concerns is in the halls of Congress, not the Commission.</p>
<p>I thank the staff of the Division of Corporation Finance (&ldquo;CorpFin&rdquo;), the Office of the Chief Accountant (&ldquo;OCA&rdquo;), the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, and the Office of the General Counsel for their work. Many staff members have been working on this rulemaking for more than two years. During this time, they have reviewed thousands of comment letters, met with the public, and worked through different iterations of the rule. While I disagree with the procedural and policy aspects of today&rsquo;s rulemaking, the staff&rsquo;s efforts to complete the rulemaking should be recognized. I would especially like to thank Luna Bloom and Valian Afshar from CorpFin and Shaz Niazi, Erin Nelson, and Meagan Van Orden from OCA for their engagement with me and my office.</p>

<title>Statement On Final Rules Regarding Mandatory Climate Risk Disclosures, SEC Chair Gary Gensler, March 6, 2024</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/statement-on-final-rules-regarding-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-sec-chair/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/statement-on-final-rules-regarding-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-sec-chair/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today, the Commission is considering whether to adopt final rules to mandate climate risk disclosures by public companies and in public offerings. I am pleased to support this adoption because it benefits investors and issuers alike. It would provide investors with consistent, comparable, decision-useful information, and issuers with clear reporting requirements.</p>
<p>Our federal securities laws lay out a basic bargain. Investors get to decide which risks they want to take so long as companies raising money from the public make what President Franklin Roosevelt called &ldquo;complete and truthful disclosure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC has an important role overseeing the disclosures at the core of that basic bargain. Our agency, though, was set up to be merit neutral. Thus, the SEC has no role as to climate risk itself.</p>
<p>Over the last 90 years, we have updated, from time to time, the disclosure requirements underlying the basic bargain and, when necessary, provided guidance with respect to those disclosure requirements. We did it in the 1960s when we first offered guidance on disclosure related to risk factors.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gensler-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;We did so in the 1970s regarding disclosure related to environmental risks.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gensler-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;We did so in 1980 when the agency adopted Management&rsquo;s Discussion and Analysis (MD&amp;A) sections in Form 10-K.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gensler-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;We did it again in the 1990s when we required disclosure about executive stock compensation.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gensler-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;And we did it as well when the Commission issued 2010 Climate Guidance about climate-related risks faced by public companies.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gensler-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p>Of course, there was lively debate about each of these disclosure requirements. Today, though, they have become integral to our disclosure regime, and it&rsquo;s hard to imagine investors not having access to them. There also has been lively debate about today&rsquo;s climate rule.</p>
<p>Consistent with this agency&rsquo;s disclosure rules over the decades, today&rsquo;s final rules are grounded in materiality. Materiality represents a fundamental building block of the disclosure requirements under the federal securities laws. The Supreme Court articulated the meaning of materiality in cases in the 1970s and 1980s.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gensler-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;It is this standard of materiality that is reflected in Commission rules.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gensler-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;It is this same materiality standard that appears in numerous disclosure rules governing registration statements and public company annual reports.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gensler-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;It is this same materiality standard that is used throughout the final rules we&rsquo;re considering today.</p>
<p>A lot has changed in the last 14 years since that 2010 climate guidance. Far more investors are making investment decisions that are informed by climate risk, and far more companies are making disclosures about climate risk.</p>
<p>Already 90 percent of the Russell 1000 issuers are publicly providing climate-related information, though that&rsquo;s generally in sustainability reports outside of their SEC filings.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gensler-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;Further, nearly 60 percent of those top 1,000 companies are publicly providing information about their greenhouse gas emissions.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gensler-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;Investors ranging from individual investors to large asset managers have indicated that they are making decisions in reliance on that information.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gensler-statement-mandatory-climate-risk-disclosures-030624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in this context that we have a role to play with regard to climate-related disclosures.</p>
<p>Our vote today is on rules, not just guidance, and ones that require disclosures be filed, not just posted online. Today&rsquo;s rules enhance the consistency, comparability, and reliability of disclosures.</p>
<p>The final rules provide specificity on what must be disclosed, which will produce more useful information than what investors see today.</p>
<p>Further, the final rules require that climate risk disclosures be included in a company&rsquo;s SEC filings, such as annual reports and registration statements. Bringing them into the filings will help make them more reliable. There are standard controls and procedures for filings unlike for sustainability reports.</p>
<p>Consistent with our mission and Congressional mandate, today&rsquo;s adopting release addresses climate risk disclosures in three important ways.</p>
<p>First, the final rules update Regulation S-K to require disclosure of material climate-related risks faced by a company as well as any governance and processes used by the company to manage climate-related risks. In addition, if a company uses transition plans, scenario analysis, or internal carbon prices to manage a material climate-related risk, the final rules require disclosures about such use. Further, a company will be required to disclose material climate-related targets or goals (if a company has them), plans for achieving those targets or goals, and annual progress. As part of these disclosures, the final rules will require disclosures in Regulation S-K of material expenditures directly resulting from activities to mitigate climate-related risks as well as transition plans and targets or goals.</p>
<p>Second, the final rules will require larger registrants, specifically large accelerated filers and accelerated filers, to disclose direct emissions (Scope 1) and emissions associated with energy purchases (Scope 2) when those emissions are material.</p>
<p>Registrants also will be required to file an attestation report with their Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Such attestation reports will improve accuracy and reliability of those metrics as well as the key assumptions, methodologies, and data sources.</p>
<p>In the proposal, we took a layered approach to disclosure of Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions. While many investors today are using Scope 3 information in their investment decision making, based upon public feedback, we are not requiring Scope 3 emissions disclosure at this time.</p>
<p>Also, to address concerns raised by commenters, the rules will allow registrants more time to file emissions disclosures. Registrants will be allowed to file those disclosures with their second quarter report the next fiscal year.</p>
<p>Third, the final rules require important financial statement footnote disclosures on expenditures resulting from severe weather events. Companies will be required to disclose capitalized costs, expenses, charges, and losses as a result of such events. These disclosures will give investors insight into the financial impact on companies today and provide important context for understanding companies&rsquo; forward-looking disclosures in Regulation S-K.</p>
<p>As the release notes, many U.S. issuers that have overseas operations may have to comply with other jurisdictions&rsquo; climate disclosure rules. I think today&rsquo;s action is an important step for our U.S. capital markets. I think it&rsquo;s important to have U.S. standards to which U.S. issuers can point.</p>
<p>These rules will enhance the disclosures that investors have been relying on to make their investment decisions. Issuers and investors will benefit from the consistency, comparability, and reliability of these disclosures.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank members of the SEC staff for their work on these final rules, including:</p>

<title>SEC Adopts Amendments to Enhance Disclosure Of Order Execution Information</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-adopts-amendments-to-enhance-disclosure-of-order-execution-information/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-adopts-amendments-to-enhance-disclosure-of-order-execution-information/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today adopted rule amendments that update the disclosure required under Rule 605 of Regulation NMS for order executions in national market system stocks (NMS stocks), which are stocks listed on a national securities exchange. Rule 605 was adopted in 2000 to help the public compare and evaluate execution quality at different market centers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the 24 years since Rule 605 was adopted, our equity markets have been transformed by ever-evolving technologies and business models,&rdquo; said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. &ldquo;I am pleased to support this adoption because it will improve transparency for execution quality and facilitate investors&rsquo; ability to compare brokers, thereby enhancing competition in our markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The final amendments expand the scope of entities subject to Rule 605, modify the categorization and content of order information required to be reported under the rule, and require reporting entities to produce a summary report of execution quality. The amendments expand the scope of entities that must produce monthly execution quality reports to include broker-dealers with a larger number of customer accounts and single dealer platforms. In addition, the amendments expand the definition of "covered order" to include certain orders submitted outside of regular trading hours, certain orders submitted with stop prices, and certain short sale orders. The amendments will capture more relevant execution quality information for certain order types by requiring statistics to be reported from the time such orders become &ldquo;executable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Further, the amendments change how orders are categorized by order size as well as how they are categorized by order type. As part of the changes to the order size categories, the amendments modify Rule 605 to capture execution quality information for fractional share orders, odd-lot orders, and larger-sized orders. The amendments also modify the time-to-execution categories and require average time to execution to be measured in increments of a millisecond or finer and to be calculated for all orders. In addition, the amendments modify the information required to be reported under the rule, including adding realized spread time horizons and requiring new statistical measures of execution quality, such as average effective divided by quoted spread (a percentage-based metric that represents how much price improvement orders received) and size improvement statistics. Finally, the amendments require all entities subject to Rule 605 to make a summary report publicly available.</p>
<p>The adopting release&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/final/2024/34-99679.pdf">is published on SEC.gov</a>&nbsp;and will be published in the Federal Register. The amendments will become effective 60 days after the date of publication of the adopting release in the Federal Register. The amendments have a compliance date of 18 months after the effective date.</p>

<title>SEC Adopts Rules To Enhance And Standardize Climate-Related Disclosures For Investors</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-adopts-rules-to-enhance-and-standardize-climate-related-disclosures-for-inve/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-adopts-rules-to-enhance-and-standardize-climate-related-disclosures-for-inve/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today adopted rules to enhance and standardize climate-related disclosures by public companies and in public offerings. The final rules reflect the Commission&rsquo;s efforts to respond to investors&rsquo; demand for more consistent, comparable, and reliable information about the financial effects of climate-related risks on a registrant&rsquo;s operations and how it manages those risks while balancing concerns about mitigating the associated costs of the rules.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our federal securities laws lay out a basic bargain. Investors get to decide which risks they want to take so long as companies raising money from the public make what President Franklin Roosevelt called &lsquo;complete and truthful disclosure,&rsquo;&rdquo; said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. &ldquo;Over the last 90 years, the SEC has updated, from time to time, the disclosure requirements underlying that basic bargain and, when necessary, provided guidance with respect to those disclosure requirements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chair Gensler added, &ldquo;These final rules build on past requirements by mandating material climate risk disclosures by public companies and in public offerings. The rules will provide investors with consistent, comparable, and decision-useful information, and issuers with clear reporting requirements. Further, they will provide specificity on what companies must disclose, which will produce more useful information than what investors see today. They will also require that climate risk disclosures be included in a company&rsquo;s SEC filings, such as annual reports and registration statements rather than on company websites, which will help make them more reliable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Specifically, the final rules will require a registrant to disclose:</p>
<ul>
<li>Climate-related risks that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the registrant&rsquo;s business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition;</li>
<li>The actual and potential material impacts of any identified climate-related risks on the registrant&rsquo;s strategy, business model, and outlook;</li>
<li>If, as part of its strategy, a registrant has undertaken activities to mitigate or adapt to a material climate-related risk, a quantitative and qualitative description of material expenditures incurred and material impacts on financial estimates and assumptions that directly result from such mitigation or adaptation activities;</li>
<li>Specified disclosures regarding a registrant&rsquo;s activities, if any, to mitigate or adapt to a material climate-related risk including the use, if any, of transition plans, scenario analysis, or internal carbon prices;</li>
<li>Any oversight by the board of directors of climate-related risks and any role by management in assessing and managing the registrant&rsquo;s material climate-related risks;</li>
<li>Any processes the registrant has for identifying, assessing, and managing material climate-related risks and, if the registrant is managing those risks, whether and how any such processes are integrated into the registrant&rsquo;s overall risk management system or processes;</li>
<li>Information about a registrant&rsquo;s climate-related targets or goals, if any, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the registrant&rsquo;s business, results of operations, or financial condition. Disclosures would include material expenditures and material impacts on financial estimates and assumptions as a direct result of the target or goal or actions taken to make progress toward meeting such target or goal;</li>
<li>For large accelerated filers (LAFs) and accelerated filers (AFs) that are not otherwise exempted, information about material Scope 1 emissions and/or Scope 2 emissions;</li>
<li>For those required to disclose Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions, an assurance report at the limited assurance level, which, for an LAF, following an additional transition period, will be at the reasonable assurance level;</li>
<li>The capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, charges, and losses incurred as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, flooding, drought, wildfires, extreme temperatures, and sea level rise, subject to applicable one percent and de minimis disclosure thresholds, disclosed in a note to the financial statements;</li>
<li>The capitalized costs, expenditures expensed, and losses related to carbon offsets and renewable energy credits or certificates (RECs) if used as a material component of a registrant&rsquo;s plans to achieve its disclosed climate-related targets or goals, disclosed in a note to the financial statements; and</li>
<li>If the estimates and assumptions a registrant uses to produce the financial statements were materially impacted by risks and uncertainties associated with severe weather events and other natural conditions or any disclosed climate-related targets or transition plans, a qualitative description of how the development of such estimates and assumptions was impacted, disclosed in a note to the financial statements.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before adopting the final rules, the Commission considered more than 24,000 comment letters, including more than 4,500 unique letters, submitted in response to the rules&rsquo; proposing release issued in March 2022.</p>
<p>The adopting release&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/final/2024/33-11275.pdf">is published on SEC.gov</a>&nbsp;and will be published in the Federal Register. The final rules will become effective 60 days following publication of the adopting release in the Federal Register, and compliance dates for the rules will be phased in for all registrants, with the compliance date dependent on the registrant&rsquo;s filer status.</p>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BodyText1">Euronext, the leading pan-European market infrastructure, welcomes the second group of Portuguese companies into ELITE, Euronext&rsquo;s ecosystem dedicated to nurturing small and medium private enterprises in their path for sustainable long-term growth by connecting them to financial capital, knowledge capital and relational capital.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">This newly inducted group comprises six companies from varied sectors including Health Care Equipment &amp; Services, Technology, Food and Drug Retail, and Industrial Goods &amp; Services generating over 200 million Euros in combined revenues and accounting for approximately 1.312 employees.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">This step in expanding ELITE into Portugal marks a significant milestone, supported by Deloitte and VdA, leveraging a proven methodology tested across more than 2,200 companies worldwide. The collaboration extends to content and expertise provided by the NOVA Business School as academic partner.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">These Portuguese companies embarking on their ELITE journey will undergo a meticulously structured program designed to aid businesses prepare structuring for their next phase of growth. Combining education, business support and mentoring, ELITE also connects business owners to vital sources of funding, be that through venture capital, private equity, an IPO or innovative Basket Bonds. These six Portuguese companies add to the eleven businesses from the country that joined ELITE in 2023, making Portugal home for our growing and vibrant ecosystem.</p>
<p class="BodyText1">Marta Testi, CEO of ELITE, said: &ldquo;<em>We celebrate a pivotal milestone today as we welcome six new Portuguese companies into ELITE. This achievement reflects our commitment to empowering European small and medium-sized enterprises for sustainable growth. ELITE serves as a bridge, connecting companies with the knowledge, relationships, and funding necessary for their expansion. With the support of our partners, Deloitte and VdA, we continue to demonstrate the power of collective action in driving the growth of our real economy and supporting the success of our companies.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p class="BodyText1">Carlos Caetano, Partner Deloitte, said:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Deloitte has had the privilege of standing alongside Elite, a company within the Euronext group, since the beginning of its operations in Portugal. Driven by our purpose to create an impact that matters within the business community, we share the ambition to support SMEs in their growth journey and acquisition of new and distinctive competencies. This ecosystem has demonstrated unparalleled dynamism and ambition, showcased by both the leaders of the companies and partners involved, as well as by the leaders of Elite.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p class="paragraph">Pedro Cassiano, Partner Responsible for the Banking &amp; Financial area at VdA, said:<em>&nbsp;&ldquo;The Elite Program enlarges horizons, forcing participating companies on how they may prepare themselves to grow, become International and institutionalize, making available contact and tools that prove rather helpful in such processes. This program is inspired in a program developed by the Milan Stock Exchange, having celebrated its 10th&nbsp;anniversary, and counting, corresponding certainly to a very useful support in the development and growth of many Italian companies. Do not be mistaken in think that it corresponds to an induction program for new Euronext Issuers, as it corresponds rather to a program to support the financial management of SMEs, aiming at helping participating companies to increase efficiency of their financial management, not necessarily through issuing and listing securities in organized markets. It is as well a great opportunity to meet and get to know other financial managers and to share experience with other SMEs engaging in many economic sectors and who face so many times similar problems</em>.&rdquo;<em>&nbsp;</em></p>

<div> Basel III, capital ratios, liquidity coverage ratio, profit after tax, Tableau dashboard
Summary: Basel III capital ratios stable, liquidity coverage ratios increased. Profit after tax at record €279 billion. Tableau dashboards explain latest results. <div>
<ul>
<li>Initial Basel III capital ratios were largely stable and above pre-pandemic levels in the first half of 2023 while liquidity coverage ratios increased.</li>
<li>Profit after tax of large internationally active banks increased to a record &euro;279 billion.</li>
<li>New features in the Tableau interactive dashboards explain the latest results for the Liquidity Coverage Ratio.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Initial</em>&nbsp;Basel III capital ratios for a sample of the largest global banks were largely stable and above pre-pandemic levels in the first half of 2023, according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d570.htm"><span class="firstword">latest</span>&nbsp;Basel III monitoring exercise</a>, published today. The leverage ratio rose further in Europe after declining in all regions during the pandemic.</p>
<p>In the same period, the profit after tax of large internationally active banks increased to a record &euro;279 billion.</p>
<p>The report, based on data as of 30 June 2023, sets out the impact of the Basel III framework, including the December 2017&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d424.htm"><span>finalisation of the Basel III reforms</span></a>&nbsp;and the January 2019&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d457.htm"><span>finalisation of the market risk framework</span></a>. It covers both Group 1 and Group 2 banks (see note to editors for definitions).</p>
<p>The implementation of the final Basel III minimum requirements began on 1 January 2023. In the first half of 2023, the average impact of the fully phased-in final Basel III framework on the Tier 1 minimum required capital (MRC) of Group 1 banks was +4.9%, compared with +3.1% at end-December 2022. Group 1 banks report total regulatory capital shortfalls amounting to &euro;4.0 billion, compared with a shortfall of &euro;3.0 billion at end-December 2022.</p>
<p>The monitoring exercise also collected bank data on Basel III liquidity requirements. The weighted average Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) rose from the previous reporting period to 138.6% for Group 1 banks, surpassing pre-pandemic levels. Three Group 1 banks reported an LCR below the minimum requirement of 100%.</p>
<p>The weighted average Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) decreased to 124.1% for Group 1 banks. All banks reported an NSFR above the minimum requirement of 100%.</p>

<h4></h4>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>Through a rigorous reporting process, the Basel Committee regularly reviews the implications of the Basel III standards for banks and has been publishing the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/qis/"><span class="firstword">results</span>&nbsp;of such exercises</a>&nbsp;since 2012.</p>
<p>The results of the monitoring exercise assume that the positions as of 30 June 2023 were subject to the fully phased-in initial or final Basel III standards. That is, they do not account for transitional arrangements set out in the Basel III framework. No assumptions were made about bank profitability or behavioural responses, such as changes in bank capital or balance sheet composition. For that reason, the results of the study may not be comparable with industry estimates.</p>
<p>Data are provided for 177 banks, including 112 large internationally active banks. These "Group 1" banks are defined as internationally active banks that have Tier 1 capital of more than &euro;3 billion and include 29 institutions that have been designated as global systemically important banks (G SIBs). The Basel Committee's sample also includes 65 "Group 2" banks (ie banks that have Tier 1 capital of less than &euro;3 billion or are not internationally active).</p>

<title>Testimony Of CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam: U.S. House Committee On Agriculture</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Agriculture Commodity Futures Conference, Dodd-Frank Act, digital commodity assets, whistleblowers, cyber risk <br />
Summary:<br />
CFTC Chairman Behnam addressed the Committee on the agency's priorities, including derivatives market growth, technological impacts, enforcement actions, and workforce diversity. <div>
<p>Chairman Thompson, Ranking Member Scott and members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today to provide an update on the work of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), our priorities, and some emerging trends in our jurisdictional space.</p>
<p>For over a century, derivatives markets have played a key role in the U.S. economy, contributing to financial stability and predictability of prices that impact the daily lives of all Americans, especially our nation&rsquo;s farmers and ranchers. Recognizing the historical roots of our agency and the continued importance of derivatives to agricultural stakeholders, I am pleased to announce that the&nbsp;CFTC and the Center for Risk Management Education and Research (CRMER) at Kansas State University will be hosting the third&nbsp;Agriculture Commodity Futures Conference on April 11th&nbsp;and 12th&nbsp;in&nbsp;Overland Park, Kansas.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam42?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1">[1]</a></p>
<p>I know I speak for all the Commissioners when I thank CFTC staff for their commitment to the agency and its mission.&nbsp; My team and I are working closely with staff and their union representatives in order to find a suitable work posture, post-pandemic, that honors the importance of being present and together in the office with appropriate flexibility, and ensures our accountability as good stewards of taxpayer money.&nbsp; The agency&rsquo;s long-term health and success depend on it.</p>
<p>It has been over 13 years since the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam42?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2">[2]</a>&nbsp;expanded the CFTC&rsquo;s authority. &nbsp;In that time, derivatives markets have experienced massive growth: trading volumes in exchange-traded futures and options have more than doubled; and the swaps market brought within our jurisdiction pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act is now over $350 trillion,<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam42?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3">[3]</a>&nbsp;which is approximately half of the estimated $715 trillion global market.</p>
<p>Today, technology is having a larger impact on CFTC jurisdictional markets than ever before. &nbsp;Innovators eager to meet demand for products and services are proposing traditional and nontraditional models that leverage technology in synergistic ways.&nbsp; At the same time, a growing number of less traditional retail participants are entering our markets, enabled by mobile phone application technology and an endless stream of information to pursue investment opportunities.</p>
<p>Surveying the current landscape, the CFTC&rsquo;s regulations have developed over decades to oversee markets made of individual, discrete entities, each typically performing one function in a multi-step trade cycle.&nbsp; However, we are seeing a shift to structures, driven by technology, that combine or compress what have historically been unique and separate activities into a single or fewer entities.&nbsp; This compression raises many important questions including those regarding conflicts of interest within vertically integrated structures, the strength of capital, margin, and segregation requirements, the role and responsibilities of self-regulatory organizations, affiliate risk management, and most importantly, customer protections.</p>
<p>As this Committee continues to consider reauthorization of the CFTC, I believe there are several important policy questions that will benefit from broader Congressional consideration and debate regarding market structure, permissible products, and retail participation.&nbsp; While our current regulatory agenda demonstrates significant agility within our jurisdictional space, we periodically bump up against the limits of what may be contemplated under existing law given the relatively rapid evolution of markets, market structure, and technology.</p>
<p>To provide a glaring example from the past decade, the recent technology driven increase in direct retail participation in the derivatives markets and underlying commodity markets in areas such as digital commodity assets has tested the limits of the existing regulatory framework.&nbsp; The CFTC&rsquo;s mission and duties, while providing room for some adaptation to new products and structures, are not endlessly flexible: &nbsp;we must be able to ensure that the products offered and available are suitable for all participants, that only appropriate persons or entities may solicit or handle customer funds, and that the disclosure information provided is material for main street customers.</p>
<p>As Chairman, I have stressed that new market structures and participants eager to deploy all manner of financial technology must comply with the agency&rsquo;s rules and regulations.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam42?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4">[4]</a>&nbsp; This is especially true when it comes to protecting customers, consumers, and the larger financial markets from fraud, money laundering, and other financial crimes.&nbsp; For example, when the use of digital assets and related enabling technologies for illicit financial purposes threatens national security and may fund acts of war and terrorism, our laws must continue to aggressively demand that all market entrants implement and comply with know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) procedures, and Customer Information Programs (CIPs).</p>
<p>Enforcement matters like the CFTC&rsquo;s globally significant BitMex<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam42?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5">[5]</a>&nbsp;and Binance<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam42?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6">[6]</a>&nbsp;cases amplify the urgency. I believe we could do even more to protect customers and markets if given additional authority in the KYC, AML, and CIP space and welcome the opportunity to work with Congress on solutions.</p>
<p>The Commission&rsquo;s exercise of its enforcement authorities to address misconduct that has a direct impact on CFTC jurisdictional markets, affects the larger economy, causes public harm, or interferes with market integrity is one facet of our approach to innovation and the evolution of financial markets.</p>
<p>Nowhere have we been more active than in the digital asset space.&nbsp; In FY 2023, we&nbsp;brought 47 actions involving conduct related to digital commodities, representing more than 49% of all CFTC actions filed during that period.&nbsp; A staggering statistic given the fact that no federal agency retains any direct regulatory authority over the underlying (or cash) digital commodity asset market.&nbsp; To date, FY 2024 is demonstrating a similar cadence.</p>
<p>The lack of legislation addressing the regulatory gap over the digital commodity asset spot market has not hindered the public&rsquo;s enthusiasm for digital assets, and I continue to believe Congress must act, as the 2022 FSOC report highlighted<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam42?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7">[7]</a>, and as I have mentioned publicly on multiple occasions.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam42?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8">[8]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am grateful to members of this Committee for your continued leadership in recognizing these gaps, and for leading legislative efforts to provide the CFTC with the necessary authority to properly regulate digital commodity assets and protect the U.S. financial system.</p>
<p>A key to the effectiveness of our enforcement division is the CFTC&rsquo;s whistleblower program.&nbsp; The Dodd-Frank Act established the Customer Protection Fund<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam42?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9">[9]</a>&nbsp;that supports our Whistleblower Program<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam42?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10">[10]</a>&nbsp;and the Office of Customer Education and Outreach (OCEO).&nbsp;&nbsp;As of FY 2023, the Whistleblower program has issued 41 orders granting awards totaling almost $350 million since its inception in FY 2010.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam42?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11">[11]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;In fiscal year 2024, the program has, thus far, awarded $18 million to whistleblowers. &nbsp;The total sanctions ordered in all whistleblower-related enforcement actions has surpassed the $3 billion milestone.&nbsp;&nbsp;Without this important program, the CFTC would not be as successful in bringing actions against misconduct in the digital commodity asset spot market.</p>
<p>As this Committee knows, the overwhelming success of the Whistleblower Program has unintentionally led to the potential for disruptions in these two vital offices due to their funding mechanisms.&nbsp; In addition to the importance of a long-term fix to avoid depletions greater than the total balance of the fund, I&nbsp;believe Congress should amend the statutory provisions to clarify the permitted uses of the Customer Protection Fund by the OCEO.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam42?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12">[12]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;This change would allow the Commission to implement a host of new investor protection programs and provide information aimed at ensuring American families have the knowledge and tools to not only protect themselves from fraud and manipulation, but to more fully engage with the Commission and the markets we oversee.</p>
<p>One very important topic that continues to challenge the derivatives industry and the CFTC is cyber risk.&nbsp; Last year at this time, we were addressing the impacts of a cyber-related incident on ION Cleared Derivatives, a third-party service provider.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam42?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13">[13]</a>&nbsp; The severity of the impact on each futures commission merchant&rsquo;s (FCM&rsquo;s) operations, as well as each FCM&rsquo;s ability to work-around impacted applications, varied based on the ION application used.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam42?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14">[14]</a>&nbsp; Notably, the incident impacted the timely and accurate submission of positions data to the CFTC, and therefore delayed the timely release of the Commitments of Traders (CoT) report.</p>
<p>Under my direction, the Commission voted unanimously in December to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking to require FCMs, swap dealers (SDs), and major swap participants (MSPs) to establish an operational resilience framework and adopt non-binding Commission guidance related to the management of risks stemming from third-party relationships.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam42?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15">[15]</a>&nbsp; The proposed rule would require the covered entities to establish, document, implement, and maintain an Operational Resilience Framework (ORF).&nbsp; This proposal would require a process to identify, monitor, manage, and assess risks relating to IT security, third-party relationships, and emergencies or other significant disruptions to their operations as a CFTC registrant.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam42?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16">[16]</a>&nbsp; The ORF would need to include three components: an IT security program, a third-party relationship program, and a business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) plan.</p>
<p>As I have often said, we recognize that our rules apply to covered entities that represent many different business models, and may be a part of a larger corporate family subject to the concurrent supervision of multiple domestic and perhaps international regulators.&nbsp; CFTC staff have strong working relationships with our fellow market and prudential regulators.&nbsp; Whether we are working on joint rulemakings or engaging in discussions regarding policy that impacts the derivatives markets directly or indirectly, our approach is always aimed at harmonizing where we can and avoiding duplicative and unnecessarily burdensome outcomes.&nbsp; We are actively working with our fellow regulators on a number of matters that impact CFTC regulated markets.</p>
<p>Another topic presenting challenges and opportunities for the agency is artificial intelligence (AI).&nbsp; I am proud to say that recently the CFTC&rsquo;s new AI Task Force issued a request for comment (RFC) on the use of AI in CFTC-regulated markets.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam42?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17">[17]</a>&nbsp; The AI RFC is part of a greater vision I have had since my first days as Chairman: advancing analytical capabilities through building talent, leveraging the cloud, and developing a forward-looking AI culture.&nbsp; We have a process in place for exploring AI use cases to&nbsp;help the agency better monitor, regulate, surveil, identify pockets of stress, and enforce compliance.&nbsp; Further, our OCEO recently issued a Customer Advisory warning the public about AI-driven fraud and scams.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam42?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn18">[18]</a></p>
<p>In December, the Commission proposed guidance regarding the listing of voluntary carbon credit (VCC) derivative contracts.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam42?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn19">[19]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Identified as one of the most important developments for the carbon industry,<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam42?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn20">[20]</a>&nbsp;this is the first proposed guidance on standards applicable to exchanges listing products aimed at providing tools to manage risk, promote price discovery, and help encourage integrity in these markets.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam42?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn21">[21]</a>&nbsp; All landowners, including America&rsquo;s farmers and ranchers, can benefit from high integrity voluntary carbon markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under my direction as Chairman, the CFTC hired its first ever Chief Diversity Officer (CDO) who oversees the agency&rsquo;s Office of Minority and Women Inclusion (OMWI).&nbsp; In the near future, I plan to release the CFTC&rsquo;s first DEIA Strategic Plan.&nbsp; Among other things, the Plan will aim to further develop our workforce.&nbsp;&nbsp;Current efforts through our OMWI include establishing partnerships and recruiting at minority serving institutions and rural colleges and universities, engaging urban and rural communities and related professional associations, and planning a robust mass media campaign to enhance our outreach efforts.&nbsp; I am eager to see the CFTC&rsquo;s OMWI statutorily authorized, similar to other federal financial regulators.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam42?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn22">[22]</a></p>
<p>Under my direction, the agency also is embarking on developing its first centralized workforce succession planning program.&nbsp; The lack of adequate succession planning poses several risks to the agency, including disruption to processes, workflows, and protocols that can threaten core functions; the loss of mission critical knowledge and expertise; and the increased expense of retaining critical talent in urgent situations.&nbsp; Looking at our workforce demographics and trajectory, the inescapable conclusion is that roughly a decade of budget uncertainty is degrading our ability to effectively and consistently hire and maintain the skilled workforce necessary to keep pace with our jurisdictional markets.</p>
<p>As we near the 50th&nbsp;anniversary of President Ford signing of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Act of 1974, we should reflect on the past 50 years of market development, evolution, and growth, while also looking forward to the next 50 years, and to the role the CFTC will play in the continued health and dominance of the U.S. financial markets and economy.&nbsp; We cannot simply sit back and hope that the next 50 years will replicate the success of the past 50.&nbsp; Technology is driving change faster than it ever has, and we collectively must keep up, both to set the guardrails that will serve as foundations for customer protections and market resiliency, and to allow for growth and innovation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CFTC has consistently been at the forefront of identifying and addressing risks with a balanced, thoughtful, and measured approach.&nbsp; I strongly believe our collective goal is to keep the U.S. derivatives markets the safest, strongest, the most effective, and the most desirable in the world.&nbsp; These goals are necessary to maintain America&rsquo;s position as the preeminent economy in the world.&nbsp; These goals are also necessary to maintain national security for all Americans.&nbsp; As this Committee knows, our nation&rsquo;s agricultural, energy, and precious metals resources are some of our most critical assets.&nbsp; I believe that without a robust derivatives market, these assets cannot be optimally utilized.&nbsp; An investment in the CFTC is an investment in America.&nbsp; As Chairman of the agency, you have my commitment to work with this committee on achieving these goals.&nbsp; I look forward to your questions.</p>

<title>On Today’s Episode Of As The Crypto World Turns: Statement On ShapeShift AG, SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce, SEC Commissioner Mark T. Uyeda, March 5, 2024</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Order Instituting Proceedings, Securities Exchange Act, ShapeShift, crypto assets, SEC <br />
Summary:<br /> 
- ShapeShift violated securities regulations
- Lack of clarity in crypto asset regulation
- Enforcement actions hinder innovation and entrepreneurship <div>
<p>The Commission&rsquo;s enforcement action against ShapeShift is the latest installment in the serial drama of the Commission&rsquo;s poorly conceived crypto policy.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-uyeda-statement-a-crypto-world-turns-03-06-24?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;The current episode recounts the tale of an early innovator in the market for crypto assets. &nbsp;In August 2014, ShapeShift AG started an online platform that facilitated trading in crypto assets.&nbsp; ShapeShift sold from its own inventory, thus acting as a counterparty to both the buyer and seller, and generated revenue on the spread&mdash;the difference between its cost to acquire the crypto asset and the price at which it sold the acquired asset.&nbsp; ShapeShift operated this way for more than six years before announcing in January 2021 that it would be changing its business model. &nbsp;Customers would no longer be able to exchange crypto assets directly through the platform and ShapeShift would no longer act as the counterparty to any customer transactions. &nbsp;Before this change, the platform, trading in at least 79 crypto assets, facilitated as many as 20,000 daily transactions.</p>
<p>The Commission&rsquo;s Order Instituting Proceedings finds that ShapeShift violated Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 because it should have registered as a securities dealer.&nbsp; The Securities Exchange Act defines a dealer as &ldquo;any person engaged in the business of buying and selling securities . . . for such person&rsquo;s own account through a broker or otherwise.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-uyeda-statement-a-crypto-world-turns-03-06-24?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2">[2]</a>&nbsp; ShapeShift meets this definition, according to the Commission, because &ldquo;[t]he crypto assets offered by ShapeShift included those that were offered and sold as investment contracts and, therefore, securities, under&nbsp;<i>SEC v. W.J. Howey Co</i>., 328 U.S. 293 (1946).&rdquo;&nbsp; The Commission&rsquo;s Order, however, fails to identify which crypto assets were investment contracts and provides no explanation for its conclusion. &nbsp;In sum, ShapeShift is in trouble because the Commission, nearly ten years after ShapeShift&rsquo;s platform started trading and more than three years after it changed its business model, now contends that some unidentified number of the 79 crypto assets it traded between 2014 and 2021 were investment contracts without explaining why.&nbsp; Notably, the Commission does not allege any harm&mdash;ShapeShift and its customers voluntarily transacted and the Order nowhere alleges that ShapeShift defrauded its customers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This enforcement action underscores the adverse consequences of the Commission&rsquo;s approach to regulation in the crypto space and adds to the ambiguity that hangs over the crypto world. &nbsp;It is entirely unclear how ShapeShift was to discern that the Commission would consider crypto assets generally&mdash;and any crypto asset in particular&mdash;a security in the form of an investment contract.&nbsp; Even now, ten years on, it is hardly more discernable.&nbsp; But perhaps that ambiguity is exactly the result the Commission wants. &nbsp;Now the next person who comes up with an idea for building something to help other people buy or sell crypto will think twice. &nbsp;Why spend time and effort creating something only to face an enforcement action ten years later?&nbsp; The Commission&rsquo;s mantra in such situations&mdash;&ldquo;Just come in and register&rdquo;&mdash;is manifestly unsatisfying. One can imagine the dialogue for that scene in a future episode:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Future ShapeShift (&ldquo;FSS&rdquo;): Hello, I would like to register as a dealer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SEC: &nbsp;Why?&nbsp;</p>
<p>FSS: &nbsp;Because I think some of the assets that I plan to deal might be deemed at some point by the SEC to be securities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SEC: &nbsp;Which ones?&nbsp;</p>
<p>FSS: &nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m not sure because I can&rsquo;t really understand what criteria you use to decide whether a token offering is a securities transaction and, if it is, whether the token that was the subject of the investment contract remains a security in secondary market transactions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SEC: &nbsp;Well, if you don&rsquo;t know whether you&rsquo;re dealing in securities, you can&rsquo;t register. &nbsp;And by the way, if some of the assets you&rsquo;re dealing in are not securities, you also can&rsquo;t register.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FSS: &nbsp;So can you help us think through which assets are securities?&nbsp;</p>
<p>SEC: &nbsp;No.&nbsp; We suggest that you read the 2017 DAO report,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-uyeda-statement-a-crypto-world-turns-03-06-24?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3">[3]</a>&nbsp;and it will all be clear to you.&nbsp; You can also look at our enforcement actions if you want.</p>
<p>FSS: &nbsp;I read it, and I&rsquo;ve read about your enforcement actions. &nbsp;I still have questions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SEC: Hire a lawyer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FSS: &nbsp;I did, and the lawyer has even more questions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SEC: Sorry, we cannot help any more than we already have.&nbsp;We don&rsquo;t give legal advice.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">END SCENE</p>
<p>This scene is by no means hypothetical. &nbsp;Industry participants have consistently expressed concern that they need clarity on which crypto assets are securities. The calls for clarity will only increase in response to last month&rsquo;s expansion of the definition of dealer to reach active liquidity providers.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-uyeda-statement-a-crypto-world-turns-03-06-24?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4">[4]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;In adopting the rule, the Commission acknowledged that the new category of dealers might include certain crypto market participants.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-uyeda-statement-a-crypto-world-turns-03-06-24?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5">[5]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;People are right now trying to figure out whether they have to register as dealers and, if so, which assets they can handle in the registered entity. &nbsp;To do so, they need to understand whether the assets for which they provide liquidity are securities.&nbsp; The fiction that this has been done is undermined by the Commission&rsquo;s failure to state which specific assets in the case before us are securities. &nbsp;The standards are so opaque and arbitrary that the Commission itself is unwilling to stand by its own analysis. &nbsp;If case-by-case determination is possible, we respectfully request that the Commission show its work.</p>
<p>The environment we have created for the crypto asset markets, especially as it relates to secondary trading, is untenable. &nbsp;It exposes well-meaning entrepreneurs to a regulatory sword of Damocles. &nbsp;Cases like this do not protect investors; they intimidate innovators and entrepreneurs.&nbsp; We respectfully dissent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<title>Semiannual Monetary Policy Report To The Congress, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell, Before The Committee On Financial Services, U.S. House Of Representatives</title>

<div> Labor market, demographic groups, employment, earnings, differences

Summary:
The article examines disparities in labor market outcomes among different demographic groups, focusing on employment and earnings differences. <div>
<p>Chairman McHenry, Ranking Member Waters, and other members of the Committee, I appreciate the opportunity to present the Federal Reserve's semiannual&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/publications/mpr_default.htm">Monetary Policy Report</a><em>.</em></p>
<p>The Federal Reserve remains squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. The economy has made considerable progress toward these objectives over the past year.</p>
<p>While inflation remains above the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) objective of 2 percent, it has eased substantially, and the slowing in inflation has occurred without a significant increase in unemployment. As labor market tightness has eased and progress on inflation has continued, the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goals have been moving into better balance.</p>
<p>Even so, the Committee remains highly attentive to inflation risks and is acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials, like food, housing, and transportation. The FOMC is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. Restoring price stability is essential to achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.</p>
<p>I will review the current economic situation before turning to monetary policy.</p>
<p><strong>Current Economic Situation and Outlook</strong><br />Economic activity expanded at a strong pace over the past year. For 2023 as a whole, gross domestic product increased 3.1 percent, bolstered by solid consumer demand and improving supply conditions. Activity in the housing sector was subdued over the past year, largely reflecting high mortgage rates. High interest rates also appear to have been weighing on business fixed investment.</p>
<p>The labor market remains relatively tight, but supply and demand conditions have continued to come into better balance. Since the middle of last year, payroll job gains have averaged 239,000 jobs per month, and the unemployment rate has remained near historical lows, at 3.7 percent. Strong job creation has been accompanied by an increase in the supply of workers, particularly among individuals aged 25 to 54, and a continued strong pace of immigration. Job vacancies have declined, and nominal wage growth has been easing. Although the jobs-to-workers gap has narrowed, labor demand still exceeds the supply of available workers. The strong labor market over the past two years has also helped narrow long-standing disparities in employment and earnings across demographic groups.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/powell20240306a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a></p>
<p>Inflation has eased notably over the past year but remains above the FOMC's longer-run goal of 2 percent. Total personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices rose 2.4 percent over the 12 months ending in January. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.8 percent, a notable slowing from 2022 that was widespread across both goods and services prices. Longer-term inflation expectations appear to have remained well anchored, as reflected by a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets.</p>
<p><strong>Monetary Policy</strong><br />After significantly tightening the stance of monetary policy since early 2022, the FOMC has maintained the target range for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent since its meeting last July. We have also continued to shrink our balance sheet at a brisk pace and in a predictable manner. Our restrictive stance of monetary policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation.</p>
<p>We believe that our policy rate is likely at its peak for this tightening cycle. If the economy evolves broadly as expected, it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint at some point this year. But the economic outlook is uncertain, and ongoing progress toward our 2 percent inflation objective is not assured. Reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal of progress we have seen in inflation and ultimately require even tighter policy to get inflation back to 2 percent. At the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment. In considering any adjustments to the target range for the policy rate, we will carefully assess the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee does not expect that it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.</p>
<p>We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent goal and to keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run.</p>
<p>To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Federal Reserve will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals.</p>
<p>Thank you. I am happy to take your questions.</p>

<title>DTCC Advances Pilot To Further Automate Corporate Actions Announcement Process And Deliver New Efficiencies - The Pilot Is Expected To Run Through The End Of 2024 And Will Introduce Greater Levels Of Automation In Sourcing Corporate Actions Announcement Data</title>

<div> pilot, automate, corporate actions, DTCC, efficiency
Summary:<br /><br />DTCC announced a pilot to automate the corporate actions process, streamlining interactions, standardized messaging, modernized GUI portal, and collaboration with S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. <div>
<p>DTCC, the premier post-trade market infrastructure for the global financial services industry, today announced a pilot to further automate the corporate actions (CA) process, delivering new efficiencies and capabilities that address decades-long asset services challenges around the sourcing of corporate actions announcements.</p>
<p>The pilot, which includes two phases, aims to streamline interactions across the Agent and Issuer community by standardizing and automating the sourcing of corporate actions announcements, eliminating manual processes, providing cost savings, reducing processing lead time and mitigating risks.</p>
<p>Phase 1 of the pilot, which was completed in December 2023, tested new inbound automated messaging for Issuers and Agents. As part of this successful test, DTCC provided messaging capabilities modeled on the ISO 20022 standard that enabled an Agent to submit an automated announcement to DTCC. DTCC was then able to automate the processing of that announcement through its system and generate an ISO 20022 corporate actions announcement to its client in a test environment. The messaging solution removes current manual processes and caters to Agents with large event volumes or those looking to send events with large numbers of assets or event notifications.</p>
<p>DTCC plans to launch Phase 2 of the pilot with a scheduled test release in Q3 2024. In this phase, firms will test a modernized Corporate Actions GUI portal. The new portal will provide an easy-to-use interface for Redemption event types, such as Partial/Full Calls and Maturities, which Agents and Issuers can use to transmit accurate and complete announcement event information. The aim is to provide Agents and Issuers with the ability to transmit standardized event information via a modernized interface, increasing accuracy, removing manual validation processes, and eliminating delays to the industry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the global financial industry becomes increasingly more complex, we see tremendous opportunity for increased automation and modernization within the corporate actions space. We are pleased to deliver this pilot, in direct response to client and industry feedback, to bring long-needed automation and standardization to the critical event notification process &ndash; increasing efficiency and accuracy,&rdquo; said Ann Marie Bria, DTCC&rsquo;s Managing Director, General Manager, Asset Services.</p>
<p>The pilot follows DTCC&rsquo;s recent paper, &ldquo;<em><a href="https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/WhitePapers/Agent-Interaction-WP-2023-Final.pdf">Automating the Sourcing of Corporate Actions Announcements from Agents and Issuers</a></em>,&rdquo; which highlighted that almost half (46%) of corporate action global event data is still published and received manually, according to data from SIFMA&rsquo;s Operations &amp; Technology Committee and Ernst &amp; Young LLP. Because the validation of the information between Issuers, Agents and DTCC is currently manual in nature, it can delay the dissemination of important data to clients and, ultimately, the beneficial owner. In its work to further automate the Corporate Actions process, DTCC worked with S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence and other large firms in the financial services industry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the successful completion of phase 1 with DTCC, we welcome their continued collaboration with the industry to proactively initiate phase 2 of the pilot. Leveraging our proven experience from diverse markets, we are thrilled to contribute to advancing efficiency and innovation in the dynamic US markets by automating issuer and agent interaction for CA announcements,&rdquo; said Bidhu Rusia, Director of Corporate Actions, S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ultimately, our goal is to revamp the end-to-end corporate actions event structure to more efficiently capture source data and provide a more reliable, sustainable, and secure foundation for the future processing landscape,&rdquo; Bria said. &ldquo;We look forward to working closely with our key stakeholders to drive improvements to this important area, and we welcome additional firms to join our pilot.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span>The integration of these two identifiers means stakeholders of both parties can access metadata for 7,000+ digital assets and respective ISO identifiers via CCData&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fdevelopers.cryptocompare.com%2Fdocumentation%2Fdata-api%2Fasset_v1_metadata/1/0102018e13344daa-80c8f1b6-cc87-482e-a76f-df7519caff76-000000/ZSPt-9qd__76F6BChQcUjwZXwEA=364" target="_blank"><span>REST API</span></a><span>.</span>&nbsp;This will enhance transparency in the digital asset market by distinguishing between the ISIN-identified asset itself and its blockchain-based implementation, identified by DTI.</span></p>
<p><span>As the digital asset sector grows, it is crucial that standardised identification data is available that seamlessly blends digital asset standards with conventional financial systems. In 2023, a joint ANNA-DTIF Task Force was established to ensure a complementary relationship between the ISIN and DTI standards.&nbsp;The Task Force has progressed to introduce ISINs assigned by ANNA which are recognised by a new XT ISIN prefix.&nbsp;These are based on DTIs for digital assets that are not themselves financial instruments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The ISO DTI standard for digital token identification continues to be adopted by crypto and digital asset market infrastructure and service providers and regulators. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) is anticipated to embed DTIs as the crypto-asset identifier under MiCA transparency reporting, order book, offering and record-keeping requirements. The ISO ISIN standard is already required by ESMA for reporting for MiFID II regulated financial instruments which would include tokenized securities.</span></p>
<p><span>The addition of ISINs and DTIs into CCData&rsquo;s Asset Metadata product gives stakeholders enhanced access to digital asset identification standards that are consistent across fragmented markets, while simultaneously providing users with access to underlying blockchain and asset data. Through a single endpoint, users can access comprehensive asset information, including historical supply, contract addresses, and network indicators for 7000+ major digital assets.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Charles Hayter, CEO and Co-Founder of CCData, stated, "The integration of XT ISINs and DTIs marks a vital step toward enhancing CCData&rsquo;s interoperable capabilities while significantly increasing transparency for our user base. Market participants can now seamlessly access identification standards and asset metadata via a single API endpoint, enhancing data availability and universal identification standards across exchanges.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>Stephan Dreyer, Managing Director for ANNA, said &ldquo;We are very excited about this collaboration as it aligns with our mission to foster standardisation within the financial industry. Our aim is to bring greater transparency to the spectrum of new innovative assets through the use of global interoperable standards. This partnership provides a step forward for applying consistent identification standards to the growing universe of digital assets.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>Rowan Varrall, Associate Director at DTIF, said " We are thrilled to announce this strategic partnership with CCData, which is a testament to the strength of our products and is a clear indication that ISO DTI will become the industry standard for digital token identification. Our work with ANNA has helped foster transparency and efficiency in the digital asset ecosystem, something that is a positive for all industry stakeholders.&rdquo;</span></p>

<title>Arf's Onchain Liquidity Volume Surpasses $1 Billion - Onchain Liquidity Backed By Real World Asset Tokenization Helps Global Financial Institutions Accelerate Cross-Border Payments</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Arf, a global transaction services platform at the intersection of Web3 and traditional finance, announced that it has surpassed $1 billion in onchain liquidity volume to support global payments. This milestone underscores Arf's category-defining leadership with its unique blend of blockchain-powered solutions for global financial institutions.</p>
<div dir="ltr" id="dvprnejpgea1fleft"><img align="middle" alt="Arf Logo" id="prnejpgea1fleft" src="https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1915574/Arf_Logo.jpg" title="Arf Logo" /></div>
<p>"Arf was established with the objective to transcend the limitations of existing financial frameworks through the application of innovative technologies. Our vision emphasizes catalyzing innovation and regulatory development by tackling real-world issues, with the ultimate goal of laying the foundation for a financial system that is universally more accessible and used by billions over the next decade." said Ali Erhat Nalbant, Co-founder and CEO of Arf.</p>
<p><b>Embracing the Challenges of Global Payments with Groundbreaking Solutions</b></p>
<p>To ensure adequate liquidity for global transactions, financial institutions rely on their own equity or credit from lenders. However, these practices limit their capital structures and present opportunity costs for growing transaction volumes. Likewise, lenders such as banks encounter challenges in funding financial institutions due to a lack of operational transparency and robust risk management.</p>
<p>In response to these challenges in the global payments industry, Arf introduced the world's first RWA-based working capital solution for global transactions. Arf Liquidity brings internet speed to international payments, and addresses a $4 trillion liquidity gap through blockchain technology. Supported by Stellar, Arf is at the forefront of providing enhanced access to the global financial system, proving the practical value of blockchain in solving real-world financial challenges.</p>
<p>"As a steadfast supporter of Arf's innovative journey, we are thrilled to witness their remarkable achievement of reaching $1 billion in onchain liquidity volume on Stellar," said Phil Meng, Head of Treasury and Capital Markets at Stellar Development Foundation. "This milestone is proof of utility realized, using a Stellar asset and rails for cross-border settlements to solve a real pain point for payment companies and advance global payments. Arf's success is a testament to the power of blockchain technology in creating equitable access to financial services, and we are proud to be part of this transformative journey. We're excited to see the next phases, especially with the recent enablement of smart contracts on Stellar."</p>
<p><b>Innovation Beyond Financing: Arf's Transparency Protocol</b></p>
<p>Arf's commitment to innovation extends to its onchain transparency protocol, a testament to leveraging blockchain's core attribute: transparency. This protocol ensures that all financial activities, including liquidity provision, repayments, and overdue payments, are accurately represented onchain. It eliminates the need for intermediaries, offering risk mitigation for liquidity providers and enabling them to make informed strategic fund allocations. For financial institutions, it means access to traceable transactions and scalable liquidity solutions.</p>
<p><b>Expanding Horizons in Global Transaction Services</b></p>
<p>Arf is expanding its horizons into global transaction services, targeting $100 billion in transactions by 2025. This strategic move aims to eliminate traditional obstacles that have limited liquidity access in the global payments industry, supported by Arf's transparency protocol and scalable liquidity. This initiative ensures a more inclusive and efficient financial industry.</p>

<title>BNP Paribas Asset Management Study Shows Steady Growth In Female Board Membership Despite Regional Disparities</title>

<div> Directive, Board Membership, Diversity, Gender Parity, Voting Policy
Summary: 
BNP Paribas Asset Management reports an increase in female board membership globally, with disparities across regions. They have a voting policy to promote diversity. <div>
<p>Two years after the implementation of the European Directive to promote board director equality 1, BNP Paribas Asset Management ("BNPP AM") publishes the results of its global study on female board membership, highlighting a positive increase compared to the previous year in all regions. However, national disparities persist, and the results vary from country to country.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ahead of the 2024 annual general meeting season, BNPP AM reiterates its commitment to diversity, one of the pillars of its&nbsp;<a href="https://tracking.wiztopic.com/lnk/BAAABUY89KgAAAAAAAAAAAJgnfMAAAAAdwUAAAAAABF6qgBl6CKm-o0qeabzQGKbGTSCnYSHcAAGw1U/1/7THByTNfHIoOXR8Szp_Wfw/aHR0cDovL2RvY2ZpbmRlci5ibnBwYXJpYmFzLWFtLmNvbS9hcGkvZmlsZXMvMjgxOEVBQUUtRDNDRi00NDgyLUEzQkEtQTJFQTg5OEFGRDBE" target="_blank">Global Sustainability Strategy</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Findings&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Women hold, an average, 29% of the board seats at companies in which BNPP AM invests, an increase of 2 points compared to 2022 (27%).&nbsp; </li>
<li> This compares with an average of 22% for companies in the ISS database also two percentage points higher than in 2022 (20%).&nbsp; </li>
<li> In all regions, BNPP AM invests in companies with higher gender diversity compared to the ISS data base.&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
<li> Despite global progress, geographical disparities persist: Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand remain the most advanced in terms of board parity in both the BNPP AM portfolios and the ISS universe.&nbsp; </li>
<li> From 2025, BNPP AM will raise its requirements and increase its minimum threshold to 40% of women on boards in Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand and South Africa.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Michael Herskovich, Global Head of Stewardship at BNP Paribas Asset Managemen</strong>t, comments:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"<em>Gender diversity is increasing globally in all regions. As an asset manager, we have a crucial role to play in advancing the gender balance of decision-making bodies through voting and constructive dialogue. However, disparities remain, and we will continue our efforts to keep promoting gender and broader diversity within the companies we invest in, around the world</em>."&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Encouraging results despite disparities between countries&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>Between 2021 and 2023, the representation of women on boards of directors increased in all regions, both within BNPP AM's portfolios (29% in 2023 vs 25% in 2021) and in the ISS universe (22% in 2023 vs 18% in 2021).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Across the globe, France holds the leading position in terms of women's representation in BNPP AM portfolios (45% in 2023) and in the ISS universe (40% in 2023).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Within BNPP AM's portfolios, the most significant changes were in Asia (14% in 2022 vs. 18% in 2023), Latin America (14% in 2022 vs. 19% in 2023), Australia and New Zealand (35% to 40% respectively). Europe grew by 1% compared to 2022 (37% in 2023 vs. 36% in 2022) and 3% compared to 2021 but is already one of the most advanced regions in terms of female board membership.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, parity is far from being achieved in Asia, particularly Japan, which has 17% of women across the boards of BNPP AM and 11% in the ISS universe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it is important to point out the efforts of some countries to close the gap. India, Malaysia and Singapore respectively include 20%, 33% and 23% of women on the boards of local BNPP AM entities, a higher diversity rate than their neighbours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In North America, the United States has 33% women directors in the BNPP AM portfolio and 24% in the ISS universe, a slightly lower percentage than required by BNPP AM policy but still way higher than the industry trend.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Johanna Lasker, CEO of BNP Paribas Asset Management, USA, explains:</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Gender diversity on US boards has steadily improved in recent years, although it does not yet meet our standard. Just over half the US population is female. Low director refreshment rates, outdated recruitment methods and an US aversion to setting quotas &ndash; or even targets - contributes to the situation. This is not just about setting the right tone and advancing equity in the workplace, it is also about effective risk management. If boards are truly seeking the best and brightest, they should be gender balanced</em>&rdquo;.</p>
<p><span>On BNPP AM ambitious voting policy&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Since 2019, BNPP AM has applied specific voting criteria on gender diversity regarding the election of directors at AGMs. The requirements have gradually been strengthened, using a regional approach, depending on the degree of maturity of the different countries on diversity issues.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2023, BNPP AM strengthened its voting policy by increasing the minimum thresholds required for women on boards of directors: 35% in Europe, North America, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand and 20% in Latin America, Asia and the Middle East.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2023, BNPP AM rejected 48% of&nbsp;board of directors elections&nbsp;on grounds of gender parity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to voting at AGMs, BNPP AM also conducts ongoing engagement with investee companies. In 2023, out of the 38 companies targeted by BNPP AM on these issues (13 in Europe, 11 in North America and 14 in APAC), 11 of them (29%) adopted changes and increased their female to male directors ratio and reached our gender diversity threshold, and 8 companies (21%) while not yet reaching our gender diversity threshold made important improvement or commitment to reach our 40% in 2025 demonstrating the effectiveness of BNPP AM&rsquo;s voting policy and engagement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For 2025, BNPP AM set a threshold of 40% women board membership in Europe, North America, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand.<span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Methodology&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The study compares the 3,250 companies in which BNPP AM invests with around 21,000 listed companies included in the Institutional Shareholder Services ("ISS") database. Data is at the end of December 2023.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>BNPP AM&rsquo;s voting policy requires it to oppose the election of all male directors at AGMs in all markets in 2023 if these requirements are not met.  Exceptions may apply if the percentage of female directors is slightly lower than required (respectively 20-35% and 10-20%) and the company has made significant recent efforts to improve diversity, or has a small board, has had a recent IPO or has a satisfactory ethnic diversity of the board, is committed to reaching the required threshold in a short period of time, or has a female Chief Executive Officer or President.</p>

<div> eBill, digital invoice, Switzerland, online banking, growth
Summary:<br /><br />More Swiss are using eBill for digital invoices, with over 3 million users and 70 million transactions in 2023. It's convenient for all ages and promoted by financial institutions.<br /> <div>
<p><span>More and more people in Switzerland are opting for the eBill digital invoice. At the end of February, SIX recorded more than three million registered users for the first time. This is also reflected in the number of transactions: In 2023, the number of eBill transactions reached around 70 million, a growth of more than 20% compared to the previous year.</span></p>
<p>eBill is becoming more and more popular and widely used. The largest user group is between 30 and 39 years old, with the most significant growth of 15% among persons over 65. This means that senior citizens are increasingly involved in digital payments. Overall, more than 40% of the 15- to 89-year-olds in Switzerland use eBill. Therefore, it now reaches more than half of Swiss households.</p>
<p>With eBill, invoices arrive where they are paid: in online banking. To stop receiving invoices by mail or e-mail, consumers can log into their bank&rsquo;s online banking system, activate eBill, and then check and pay invoices with just a few clicks. This offers advantages for both consumers and businesses.</p>
<p>Up to 95% of all Swiss financial institutions offer eBill and actively promote it. Many invoice issuers already use eBill, for example, leading telecom providers, health insurance companies, utilities, government agencies, and credit card companies. An increasing number of small and medium-sized businesses also use eBill.</p>

<div> Keywords: inflation, central banks, monetary policy, Singapore economy, exchange rate policy
Summary: Global inflation surge; central banks slow to tighten policy; MAS tightening early with success; exchange rate policy crucial for Singapore's economy; focus on long-term fundamentals. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p><span><span>Global Economic Developments: Restoring price stability&nbsp;</span></span><br /><br /><span>Today I would like to discuss the global surge in inflation since 2021 and how central banks, including MAS, have handled it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>The story is not over, and there will be a lot more forensic analysis of the period.&nbsp;</li>
<li>But some tentative observations can be made.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The global inflation surge comprised three distinct phases:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>The first phase from 2020-2021. There was an unusual combination of supply- and demand-side shocks. On the supply side, labour markets tightened as renewed demand for labour outstripped the availability of workers. On the demand side, there was a strong resurgence in consumer spending after COVID-19 restrictions were lifted. The interaction of strong demand and weak supply started driving up inflation almost everywhere in 2021.</li>
<li>The second phase from early 2022. Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine led to sharp increases in food, energy, and fertiliser prices. Importantly, these price hikes had a diffused impact on consumer and producer prices.&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
<li>The third phase from 2023 onwards. Supply-side pressures receded, helped by commodity price corrections, and by the resolution of many supply chain bottlenecks. As a result, goods price inflation started to fall quickly. However, services price inflation stayed relatively sticky, reflecting higher wage costs, together with a marked shift in post-COVID-19 consumer spending towards services.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Let us consider the seemingly sluggish response of the major central banks to rising inflation pressures.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>It was difficult to anticipate the pickup in headline CPI inflation rates between late-2020 to mid-2021, well before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which substantially reflected three factors:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>First, supply chain bottlenecks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Restoring supply chains after the pandemic proved much more difficult than anticipated, exposing the vulnerability of entire industries to delays in reactivating plants and shipping. Central banks did not expect these disruptions to be so extensive or to last as long as they did.</li>
<li>Second, structural changes in labour markets. The COVID-19 pandemic severely disrupted labour markets around the world. As a result, traditional indicators of labour market tightness or looseness became less reliable. A few commentators, notably Olivier Blanchard, argued that labour markets, at least in the US, were much tighter than the unemployment rate suggested, but most missed this.&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/inflation-and-monetary-policy#1">[1]</a></span></li>
<li>Third, the strength of consumer demand, in response to their improved financial positions, including from fiscal transfers. When pandemic restrictions were in place, demand for goods was strong, but swung towards services as restrictions were lifted. In both cases, government stimulus measures supported consumption. For instance, while Larry Summers&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/inflation-and-monetary-policy#2">[2]</a></span>&nbsp;argued that the Biden stimulus package would fuel inflation pressures, almost all forecasters, including at central banks, failed to anticipate the strength and resilience of consumer spending.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Consequently, most central banks missed the whites of the eyes of inflation and were slow to react even as price increases picked up pace.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>&nbsp;</span><span>MAS&rsquo; studies using standard Taylor rules suggest that most advanced economies (AEs) should have started tightening from about mid-2021.</span></li>
<li><span>&nbsp;</span>Perhaps, the notion of looking past transitory supply shocks had become entrenched, but it was more probable that the complexity of simultaneous demand and supply shifts had confounded central banks and other observers.</li>
<li>Most central banks adopted a &ldquo;wait-and-see&rdquo; approach for almost a year, and even those that began to move, did so slowly.</li>
<li>To be fair, some central banks, including MAS, tightened policy stances in H2 2021, but in most other cases tightening was too slow to have much impact.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Now let me turn to four factors I believe central banks got right.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>We are now in a situation where headline and core inflation are returning to low levels. We&rsquo;re not all the way back to inflation targets, but closer than many expected us to be at this point, and without having endured a protracted recession. Is this just good luck or have central banks done a good job? In my view it is a combination.</li>
<li>First, central banks have built up policy credibility. Many central banks, with or without explicit inflation targets, have spent twenty years or more keeping inflation low and stable. Many have had legislative overhauls giving them greater policy autonomy, and all have worked to improve their public communications and policy accountability. All these helped to enhance policy credibility and anchor long-term inflation expectations. In the past three years, we have witnessed that very commitment by central banks and government pay off. Households and markets believed central banks would do what was necessary to restore price stability.</li>
<li>Second, central banks stood by their inflation targets. There has been no shortage of suggestions that central banks should settle for inflation at around 3-4% indefinitely.&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/inflation-and-monetary-policy#3">[3]</a></span>&nbsp;While such an approach would certainly allow central banks to declare victory over inflation somewhat earlier than otherwise, it would be a Pyrrhic victory indeed. Far from sparing economic pain, a shift in targets like this would greatly damage policy credibility and blind-side those who have believed in central bank policy commitments, including bond holders and pension funds. That all the major central banks have re-iterated their commitment to inflation targets played a key role in keeping inflation expectations well anchored.</li>
<li>Third, nimble or flexible policy. Once central banks realised they had an inflation problem, they were primed to move quickly. By early-2022, Taylor rules showed major central bank policy stances were already much too loose. The Russian invasion of Ukraine and the spike in commodity prices shook central banks out of their complacency. In the months that followed, central banks tightened policy stances at an unprecedented rate, much faster than the standard Taylor rule would have indicated. By end-2022, real policy rates, adjusted for inflation expectations, in the major economies were clearly in positive territory.</li>
<li>This brings me to the fourth point for which central banks deserve credit: some good judgement calls in managing risks. I might note in particular:   
<ul>
<li>The rapid adjustment of interest rates in H2 2022 and into 2023 did run risks, both of financial instability and of a sharp contraction of economic activity. But too gradual an adjustment ran the risk of allowing price and wage pressures to build and allowing a ratcheting up of inflation expectations. This would have made the disinflation process much more difficult.</li>
<li>Numerous observers and pundits had also cautioned the major central banks against tightening too little and others against tightening too much. On one side, some pundits argued taming inflation would require inducing a prolonged recession.&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/inflation-and-monetary-policy#4">[4]</a></span>&nbsp;This school of thought tended to see inflation as being very persistent and inflation expectations as liable to an upward drift. In this case, a sustained period of economic slack would be needed to bring inflation down.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Another line of argument cautioned against being too aggressive. A concern has been that the adoption of a &ldquo;data dependent&rdquo; approach makes policy too backward-looking, and runs the risk of tightening for too long, or not easing soon enough, given the lags between policy actions and their effects on activity and inflation.&nbsp;</li>
<li>A difficulty with these arguments is that they imply a rather mechanistic approach to policy making. Data rarely tell a clearcut story, and there are many uncertainties about the precise tightness of the labour market, the size of the output gap, the likelihood of new supply chain disruptions, the current value of r-star, whether inflation expectations will remain stable, and so on. Policy makers must weigh all these up in reaching decisions. So far, I would say that the major central banks have done a pretty good job of ensuring that there is sufficient, ongoing restraint on inflation, but not so much as to cause a hard landing. However, monetary policy is just not that precise, and we should not pretend that we can fine tune the exact pace of disinflation.</li>
<li>And there are still risks. Many commentators are already declaring victory over inflation. The so-called &ldquo;last mile&rdquo; may be harder than is generally expected. Markets seem to be more sanguine than central banks. And there are downside risks for economic activity. Weakness in commercial real estate markets in many countries, for example, could pose problems for banks and for credit conditions. And there are some renewed supply chain issues relating to the Middle East conflict.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I might note a few pertinent takeaways from the global monetary policy experience.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>First, inflation is &lsquo;always and everywhere&rsquo; a latent vulnerability. Central banks must keep an anxious vigilance over it in accord with their key mandate. This will help anchor price expectations, so critical to maintaining policy credibility and effectiveness.   
<ul>
<li>If Phillips Curves are relatively flat as some have argued, the primary determinant of actual inflation is expected inflation.&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/inflation-and-monetary-policy#5">[5]</a></span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Second, there are times, especially amid lots of uncertainty, when it pays for the central bank to move cautiously, as in the traditional Brainard Principle.&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/inflation-and-monetary-policy#6">[6]</a></span>&nbsp;But there are other times when the right thing is to act nimbly.</li>
<li>Third, inflation is much more than a monetary phenomenon in the short-term. Many factors conspired to ignite and stoke price pressures three years ago; conversely, several factors fortuitously transpired to bring down inflation. Central banks need to hone their understanding of these sorts of developments and how to respond to them.</li>
<li>Fourth, the pandemic again underscored the point that shocks are typically accompanied by acute stresses on financial stability. Central banks must be prepared to deal with them as guarantor of liquidity.&nbsp; But such actions need to be appropriately circumscribed, and the scope for macroprudential policies should be explored in specific areas of vulnerabilities</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Singapore Economy: Pro-equilibrating developments&nbsp;</span></span><br /><br /><span>I will now briefly cover developments in Singapore.&nbsp;<br /><br />Singapore&rsquo;s macro developments over 2021&ndash;2023 need to be seen in the context of the myriad of shocks to global demand, supply, and international financial conditions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>From 2019 until the Fed began its tightening cycle in 2022, the 3-month MAS bill yield did not diverge by more than around 50 basis points from the corresponding US rate.&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/inflation-and-monetary-policy#7">[7]</a></span>&nbsp;A 100-basis-point gap opened up in 2023, and has remained fairly stable since then, broadly consistent with expectations for some nominal appreciation of the Singapore dollar against the US dollar.&nbsp;</li>
<li>This interest rate convergence may seem to attest to the often-cited thesis of H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Rey that there is one global financial cycle driven by developments in the &ldquo;centre&rdquo; country.&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/inflation-and-monetary-policy#8">[8]</a></span>&nbsp;But the recent actions by central banks &ndash; either in tightening before the Fed as in Latin America or in declining to follow the Fed as in some Asian countries &ndash; show the Rey thesis may not necessarily hold, at least in its strong form.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>The benefit of Singapore&rsquo;s policy regime is that we still retain the ability to alter exchange rate expectations, and thus domestic monetary conditions, independently of the Fed, and we have in fact taken advantage of this aspect of our policy regime for price stability.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>MAS sought to adjust its monetary policy stance in a timely manner as the conjuncture and outlook evolved.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>MAS began tightening monetary policy relatively early in the inflation cycle.   
<ul>
<li>We withdrew some policy accommodation in October 2021 and again in January 2022 amid the steady post-pandemic economic recovery, as well as the early uptick in inflation.&nbsp;</li>
<li>It was clear to us that the policy settings that had been in place during the worst of the COVID-19 crisis were no longer appropriate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We then followed up with further tightening moves over H1 2022, motivated by the quicker-than-expected acceleration in inflation in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine war.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The key advantage of acting early and aggressively was that it allowed us to exploit the exchange rate&rsquo;s role in filtering imported inflation.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Our econometric simulations show that imported inflation would have been almost 6% on average each year over the past two years, compared to about 2.5% under the actual policy path.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The global and domestic growth outlook deteriorated and become more uncertain over H2 2022. Nonetheless, we stayed the course in tightening the monetary policy stance amid continued rising import prices and the build-up of domestic cost pressures.</li>
<li>Overall, MAS tightened monetary policy in five consecutive moves from October 2021 to October 2022, including two off-cycle moves in January and July 2022 as well as three consecutive upward re-centrings of the policy band.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Our progressive tightening of monetary conditions has helped to arrest the momentum of price increases and facilitated a gradual decline in inflation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Core inflation has peaked and is expected to continue moderating over the course of this year.</li>
<li>At our most recent policy review in January, MAS kept the S$ nominal effective exchange rate (S$NEER) on its current appreciating path.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Even without further changes to monetary policy settings, the S$NEER will likely continue to appreciate gradually within the unchanged policy band.&nbsp;   
<ul>
<li>In other economies, the monetary policy instrument is the interest rate, which must be set at a specific value rather than on a directional path.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The current policy setting keeps the S$NEER policy band on an appropriately restrictive posture to ensure that core inflation declines to 2% by early 2025.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>This forecast is naturally predicated on no significant exogenous shocks.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>My assessment is that the cyclical neutral path of the S$NEER (e-star&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/inflation-and-monetary-policy#9">[9]</a></span>&nbsp;) is associated with a non-zero (positive) rate of appreciation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>In Singapore&rsquo;s case, such a perspective also allows the exchange rate in levels to follow a trend-stationary path in line with changing relative resource costs and relative productivity differentials, as it converges to its natural steady-state level (e-bar).</li>
<li>This is different from the interest rate policy regime in the AEs, where attainment of inflation targets in the next 12-month period, is likely to induce a reduction in policy rates, notwithstanding some uncertainty over r-star.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The substantial appreciation of the S$ over the past two years played an important role in bringing Singapore&rsquo;s demand and supply back into better balance, through expenditure reduction and switching effects.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></span></p>
<p><span>At the same time, the associated increase in the real effective exchange rate, or the S$REER&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/inflation-and-monetary-policy#10">[10]</a></span>&nbsp;, has raised some concerns about the impact on Singapore&rsquo;s export competitiveness.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>While the Singapore economy registered a string of weak export readings from late-2022 into 2023, our empirical work suggests that these were driven mainly by lacklustre external demand, rather than by a loss of external competitiveness.   
<ul>
<li>The global electronics industry entered a cyclical downturn last year, on the back of a boom in 2022. Given tepid external demand, a weaker Singapore dollar would not have provided much of a boost to exports.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Overall, the downturn and recent nascent recovery in Singapore&rsquo;s electronics exports has been broadly in line with other major electronics producers in the region.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In fact, if MAS had not tightened monetary policy, domestic overheating and the passthrough of higher global prices would have kept inflation in Singapore higher for much longer. This would have come at a significant cost to households and firms.   
<ul>
<li>MAS&rsquo; model simulations show that without the filtering effect of a higher nominal exchange rate, import prices would have risen at a faster pace. Stronger aggregate demand, at a time when the labour market was already at its limits, would also have put upward pressures on wage costs.</li>
<li>The domestic economy would have experienced a spell of persistently high inflation, with headline CPI inflation reaching 8% y-o-y in some quarters (compared to the actual peak of 7.3% in Q3 2022).</li>
<li>Sharply higher wages and costs, as the economy is pushed well beyond its absorptive limits, would eventually have led to substantially lower real GDP growth.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The risks of a wage-price spiral arising from persistently elevated inflation would also have been higher.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The alternative to the necessary appreciation of the S$REER through the S$NEER rise, would have been to let higher domestic inflation do more of the work.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Our model simulations confirm that in a counterfactual scenario where MAS did not raise the nominal exchange rate, the S$REER would still have appreciated as much as it did from MAS&rsquo; tightening moves, albeit with a lag and driven mainly by increases in relative prices&mdash;that is, domestic consumer prices rising by more than foreign prices.</li>
<li>This alternative would have been clearly sub-optimal.</li>
<li>Accordingly, the contribution of monetary policy was to manage the S$REER appreciation in an optimal manner.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Over the longer-term, the real exchange rate will reflect the strength and prospects for Singapore&rsquo;s underlying economic fundamentals compared with those of trade partners and competitors.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Singapore&rsquo;s economic competitiveness is anchored by many other factors besides the exchange rate or absolute cost comparisons.   
<ul>
<li>The appreciation of the Singapore dollar is not necessarily a deterrent to investment nor a liability to growth.</li>
<li>The quality of our human capital, infrastructure, connectivity, and institutions, among other factors, speak for themselves.</li>
<li>Singapore&rsquo;s tradable sectors have been able to adapt to higher costs through efficiency gains, and by shifting into industries that can command a higher premium (or terms of trade) in the global markets.</li>
<li>These factors continue to place Singapore in a good position to benefit from shifts in global production and trade, as geopolitics evolve and supply chains reconfigure.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>With that, I thank you for your kind attention and wish you all a productive conference.</span></p>

<title>Tailoring, Fidelity To The Rule Of Law, And Unintended Consequences, Federal Reserve Governor Michelle W. Bowman, At The Harvard Law School Faculty Club, Cambridge, Massachusetts</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you for the invitation to join you this evening at Harvard Law School.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240305a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;It is an honor and a pleasure to speak to this distinguished group. To kick off our conversation, I would like to frame the discussion by offering my views on a key element underpinning the U.S. bank regulatory framework: the role of tailoring. While the principle itself is simple&mdash;setting regulatory priorities and allocating supervisory resources in a risk-based way&mdash;the consequences of tailoring (or not) can reverberate throughout the banking system, the broader U.S. financial system, and the economy. I see a clear nexus between tailoring and fidelity to the law, including a targeted focus within our statutorily mandated prudential responsibilities.</p>
<p><strong>Tailoring as a Grounding Principle</strong><br />I have long been a proponent of tailoring and continue to consider it a strong foundational principle upon which to apply bank regulation and supervision. This approach ensures a focus on the most critical risks over time, avoiding the over-allocation of resources or imposition of unnecessary costs on the banking system. When we approach rulemaking with a commitment to tailoring, and to our broader prudential mandates, the public can judge our actions by how well they serve these ends, and they should rightly be concerned when regulatory actions seem to serve other goals. In this sense, tailoring keeps policymakers grounded and facilitates appropriate prioritization. Tailoring also allows us to allocate limited supervisory resources to most effectively support safety and soundness of the banking system and U.S. financial stability.</p>
<p>In accordance with the law, the Federal Reserve, both in its monetary policy function and in the execution of its bank regulatory and supervisory responsibilities, is meant to operate independently and apolitically. But banking regulators have a responsibility to act in a way that proves this independence is warranted. We earn the right to operate with this independence when we consistently follow the law and achieve our prudential objectives. One of the most effective ways we accomplish this goal is through the appropriate prioritization of risks in the financial system. Regardless of the approach to bank regulation and supervision, bank regulators should be subject to oversight and accountability, to both Congress and the public.</p>
<p>The principles that guide the execution of prudential responsibilities matter, especially when they further efficiency and effectiveness. Congress has embedded the concept of tailoring within the Federal Reserve's regulatory mandates, including the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, commonly referred to as S. 2155.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240305a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;This law revised provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, amending the&nbsp;<em>threshold</em>&nbsp;for tailored application of enhanced prudential standards on certain regulated institutions.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240305a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;Notably, S. 2155 did not&nbsp;<em>introduce&nbsp;</em>tailoring to these standards; it merely modified tailoring thresholds and mandated the Board implement this approach. To be clear, tailoring is not a pretext for deregulation but rather a principle that allows regulators to pursue required statutory objectives in the most efficient and effective way.</p>
<p><strong>Does Tailoring Need a Defender?</strong><br />I suppose one could view my support for tailoring as merely setting up a straw man; surely everyone agrees with tailoring in principle? On a superficial level, it is hard to argue with the principle that regulatory tailoring&mdash;matching regulation and supervision to risk&mdash;is a prudent approach for bank regulators. And yet the rhetoric supporting tailoring and risk-based supervision often does not match regulatory reform efforts or supervisory approaches. The criticisms rarely manifest as skepticism of the principle itself. Rather, they are implicit in the approach to regulation and supervisory guidance or are disguised as a criticism of the&nbsp;<em>execution&nbsp;</em>of tailoring.</p>
<p>Both the pending capital reform proposals and the final climate guidance illustrate how regulatory actions can deviate from the principle of tailoring without any express recognition of this effect.</p>
<p>The federal banking agencies have proposed several reforms to the capital framework, among them the Basel III "endgame" and new long-term debt requirements that would apply to all banks with over $100 billion in assets. I have expressed concern with both of these proposals on the merits, in terms of striking the right balance between safety and soundness and efficiency and fairness, and out of concern for potential unintended consequences. Another concern is whether these proposals show fidelity to the law, which requires regulatory tailoring above the $100 billion asset threshold. In 2019, the Board published its regulatory tailoring rule and included a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/boardmeetings/files/tailoring-rule-visual-20191010.pdf">compelling visual (PDF)</a>&nbsp;that depicts in table form how a series of requirements&mdash;capital, single counterparty credit limits, liquidity, and the requirement to form a U.S. Intermediate Holding Company for foreign banking organizations&mdash;worked collectively to establish a tiered framework.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240305a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a></p>
<p>If you superimpose the pending capital reform proposals on the table, there is a "flattening" of requirements in the capital bucket. Of course, this simple exercise does not reflect the unknown end state of the bank regulatory framework, and the current desire among some policymakers to modify liquidity requirements. These individual efforts highlight the hazard of piecemeal reforms, especially those that are closely related in their end-state operation, like capital and long-term debt requirements. When regulators pursue reforms by creating separate rulemaking silos, we limit our capacity to not only ensure fidelity to tailoring but also fidelity to our prudential mandates. Even when proposals have concurrent comment periods, the danger is that the final regulations will be miscalibrated and not appropriately tailored.</p>
<p>Tailoring underpins not only effective regulation, but also effective bank supervision. The effectiveness of the interagency principles used by the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for the management of climate-related financial risks could be evaluated as a supervisory tool through the lens of tailoring, which requires us to consider both the regulatory threshold for applicability and the content of the guidance.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240305a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;One approach to evaluate the merit and effectiveness of these principles as a supervisory tool is through the lens of tailoring, which requires us to consider both the regulatory threshold for applicability and the content of the guidance.</p>
<p>On its face, it applies to banks with $100 billion or more in consolidated assets. What does this threshold mean in practice? Guidance serves the role of illuminating supervisory priorities and expectations. These informal communications help bridge the divide between regulators and regulated entities. When guidance notes that "all financial institutions,&nbsp;<em>regardless of size</em>, may have material exposures to climate-related financial risks&hellip;,"<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240305a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;my intuition is that banks will take little comfort from the nominal carveout in light of this language. Apart from the general concern with the "cliff effect" threshold at $100 billion, I question whether any size threshold will apply in practice.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240305a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a></p>
<p>The content of the guidance&mdash;and its expectations for larger banks&mdash;suggests that the motivation behind the principles is neither prudential considerations nor to further regulatory tailoring, as it has a somewhat tenuous connection to core safety and soundness considerations and seems destined to trickle down to smaller firms over time. Banks have long been exposed to climate- and weather-related financial risks and have long been required to manage all of their material risks, including these. But the principles seem oriented toward contributing to a policy matter that extends well beyond prudential bank regulation&mdash;namely how the U.S. and other governments around the world should address climate change. And the principles seem focused on highly uncertain risks well outside the normal temporal horizon of a bank supervisor. One could reasonably ask, do the principles result in appropriate, risk-based prioritization of supervisory concerns? It is possible that they prioritize risks that may not be the most relevant for safety and soundness and may effectively influence credit allocation decisions through regulations that are not driven primarily by prudential considerations.</p>
<p>Bank regulators can acknowledge the importance of questions around climate change while also hewing to their statutory responsibilities. Promoting safety and soundness and U.S. financial stability is a weighty enough task without taking on other causes.</p>
<p>The current regulatory agenda includes many other examples where similar arguments can be made that regulatory reform proposals lack sufficient attention to regulatory tailoring and thereby fail to further statutory directives to tailor certain requirements and, more importantly, to address the condition of the banking system.</p>
<p>Apart from substantive deviations from regulatory tailoring, there are also indirect attacks on the value of tailoring as a principle to guide bank regulatory reforms. For example, one prominent argument raised shortly after the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, and which has become a driving force in regulatory reform efforts, is that the Board's&nbsp;<em>approach&nbsp;</em>to tailoring was to blame for the bank failures and broader banking stress.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240305a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a>&nbsp;The argument is that a major factor contributing to the bank failures was the implementation of S. 2155, the statutory mandate to tailor regulation and an accompanying shift in supervisory policy.</p>
<p>As I have noted many times in the past, I find little evidence to support this claim. While couched as a critique of the&nbsp;<em>execution&nbsp;</em>of tailoring, this argument also seems to challenge the&nbsp;<em>value&nbsp;</em>of tailoring, asserting that a simple solution would be to unwind regulatory tailoring and eliminate risk-based tailoring in supervision. Taking ownership and accountability of the supervisory issues that significantly contributed to the banking system stress last spring enables us to look critically at the approach to regulation and supervision in the lead-up to these failures, and appropriately address the shortcomings.</p>
<p><strong>Why Does Tailoring Matter?</strong><br />Before thinking about tailoring for smaller, simpler firms, I think it's helpful to think about the largest, most complex firms. Additional regulation and heightened supervisory attention are warranted and necessary for larger firms, particularly global systemically important banks (GSIBs) with additional size, risk, and complexity. This principle is so well-established that it was not only a core precept of S. 2155, it was a central theme of the Dodd-Frank Act.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240305a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;We need not rely on past views about the virtue of tailoring&mdash;what was once conventional wisdom&mdash;to believe in its ongoing relevance.</p>
<p>One critique of tailoring may be with what underlying "problem" it is designed to solve, particularly as it relates to the allocation of finite resources both for banks and for regulators. Are regulatory and supervisory resources actually limited, and if so, what are the practical constraints on these resources? At a basic level, the quantum of regulatory and supervisory resources is a policy decision&mdash;as regulatory and supervisory demands grow, so too can the staffs and budgets of the federal banking agencies. The U.S. financial system is expansive and regulators have the capacity to expand supervisory resources as needed (or as perceived) to address safety and soundness concerns.</p>
<p>Of course, there are practical constraints on an ever-expanding and stricter bank regulatory framework. First, the funding of regulatory and supervisory expansion imposes costs not only on U.S. taxpayers but also on banks, and indirectly, bank customers. While the banking system has many advantages&mdash;including the use of insured deposits as a source of financing banking activities&mdash;at some point, this structural advantage will erode under the cumulative burden of the regulatory framework and will result in a shift of activities from banks to nonbanks and the broader shadow-banking system. The contours of the financial system, where products and services are offered, does not exist according to the bright line of federal regulatory authority. We would be well served to recognize the limitations of a regulatory perimeter that pushes activity outside of the banking system and beyond this authority.</p>
<p><strong>Unintended Consequences</strong><br />As we consider the merits of tailoring, we should consider the consequences of not adhering to this principle in regulation and supervision, and related reform proposals.</p>
<p>As a threshold matter, a bank regulatory approach that disregards tailoring can manifest in different ways, such as uniformity in approach&mdash;failing to differentiate among institutions based on their size, risk, and complexity&mdash;or by adopting regulatory "cliffs" clustered around thresholds that insufficiently distinguish among institutions based on these factors. In both cases, deviating from tailoring could result in fundamental changes to the structure of the U.S. banking system.</p>
<p>One risk of uniform requirements is the consolidation pressure it creates. Apart from the shortcomings I've discussed in appropriate risk-based prioritization within the bank regulatory framework, this approach encourages consolidation, as institutions seek operational economies of scale to gain competitive advantage over their peers. In this scenario, the benefits of being large, risky, and complex become a driving force in the organization of the banking industry. I think we should consider the implications not only for regulatory efficiency, but also whether this approach represents waving the white flag in fighting against the assertion that certain institutions are "too big to fail."</p>
<p>Even where standards are not uniform, a lack of sufficient tailoring can reshape the banking industry, simply through the cliff effects created around particular regulatory thresholds. For example, capital reform and climate regulation would establish $100 billion as the key regulatory threshold, lending additional gravity to the decision to cross, or even approach it, with the consequence of reducing the number of institutions around that threshold. Institutions&nbsp;<em>above&nbsp;</em>the threshold will face strong incentives to grow larger to achieve economies of scale. Institutions&nbsp;<em>below&nbsp;</em>the threshold will face strong incentives to manage their size to avoid the significant intensification of requirements that apply as they approach $100 billion in assets. This scenario also has significant implications for the too-big-to-fail issue, as well as for industry competition over the long term.</p>
<p>Regulatory costs that are disproportionate to a firm's risk create incentives for activities to migrate out of the banking system entirely, which we have seen as a consequence of past regulatory reform efforts. In my view, implicit in the statutory mandate to promote safety and soundness, and financial stability, is that we allow banks to continue serving their role in the U.S. financial system and in support of the economy. Fidelity to the law does not require regulators to create a bank regulatory framework that eliminates risk: banking is inherently about managing, not eliminating, risk.</p>
<p><strong>Closing</strong><br />Thank you, again, for the invitation to speak with you, and I look forward to our discussion.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>FTSE Russell announces that the March 2024 FTSE Equity Country Classification Announcement will be published after US market close on Wednesday 27 March 2024.</p>
<p>The classification of markets within the FTSE global equity indices is assessed on an ongoing basis. To ensure transparency, markets which are under review for a reclassification from/to Developed, Advanced Emerging, Secondary Emerging, or Frontier market status are placed on the FTSE Watch List.</p>
<p>The following markets were designated as Watch List markets as of September 2023:</p>
<ul>
<li>Egypt &ndash; possible reclassification from Secondary Emerging to Unclassified market status.</li>
<li>Pakistan &ndash; possible reclassification from Secondary Emerging to Frontier market status.</li>
<li>Vietnam &ndash; possible reclassification from Frontier to Secondary Emerging market status.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ahead of the publication of the FTSE Equity Country Classification Announcement, FTSE Russell consults with members of the FTSE Equity Country Classification Advisory Committee, the FTSE Russell regional equity advisory committees, the FTSE Russell Policy Advisory Board, and other stakeholders regarding Watch List and other markets. Feedback received is considered, and the announcement approved, at a meeting of the FTSE Russell Index Governance Board.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The schedule ahead of the March 2024 FTSE Equity Country Classification Announcement is as follows:&nbsp;</p>

<div> Vienna Stock Exchange, Austrian indices, free float factor, index calculation, review
Summary:<br />Vienna Stock Exchange reviews Austrian indices, changes free float factors, indexes based on quantitative methodology, rules for composition and calculation parameters.<br /> <div>
<p>The review of the Austrian indices by the Vienna Stock Exchange results in changes to the calculation factors, while the composition of the national index ATX remains unchanged. The free float factors of Raiffeisen Bank International AG (0.5 to 0.4), RHI Magnesita N.V. (0.7 to 0.5) and Warimpex Finanz- und Beteiligungs AG (0.6 to 0.5) will all decrease, that of AUSTRIACARD HOLDINGS AG will increase from 0.2 to 0.3. The free float factor expresses how many of a company's shares&nbsp;circulate among the public and influences how strongly a share is weighted in the index. The above changes will take effect on 18 March 2024. The next scheduled review of the composition of Austrian indices will take place on 3 September 2024; the free float factors will be reviewed again on 4 June 2024.</p>
<p>The index calculation is based on a purely quantitative methodology that is defined in a set of rules. In accordance with the "The Rules for the Austrian Indices of the Vienna Stock Exchange ", the Vienna Stock Exchange can add or remove companies after the half-yearly review (March and September). The daily average turnover and the free float capitalisation of the companies are used as the basis for the decision. The calculation parameters (number of shares, free float factors and representation factors) are reviewed on a quarterly basis (March, June, September and December). The Vienna Stock Exchange publishes the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wienerborse.at/en/indices/index-changes/atx-watchlist/?_gl=1*jgb5q*_up*MQ..*_ga*Mzg3MzYyNjMxLjE3MDk2MzM1MTE.*_ga_V1WTDN429Y*MTcwOTYzMzUxMC4xLjAuMTcwOTYzMzUxMC4wLjAuMA.." target="_blank">"ATX watchlist"</a>&nbsp;once a month. Institutional investors, trading members, issuers of financial products, academics and the Vienna Stock Exchange contribute their experience to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wienerborse.at/en/indices/index-changes/list-of-atx-committee-members/" target="_blank">Index Committee</a>, which decides on the rules and regulations for the indices.</p>

<title>Remarks To The Council Of Institutional Investors – Dangers Of The Unbounded Administrative State, SEC Commissioner Mark T. Uyeda, Washington D.C., March 5, 2024</title>

<div> Private Fund Advisers, Dealer Definition, Cryptocurrencies, Investment Contract Test, Section 211(h)<br />
In a speech, a Commissioner discusses concerns about SEC's jurisdiction over private funds, dealer definition, cryptocurrencies, and investment contracts.<br /><br />Summary: The Commissioner discusses concerns regarding SEC's jurisdiction over private funds, dealer definition, cryptocurrencies, and investment contracts. <div>
<p>Thank you for the invitation to address the Council of Institutional Investors, whose members are responsible for combined assets under management of nearly $5 trillion.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-cii-030524#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;They include pension plans obligated to act prudently when investing the savings of millions of workers and their families to provide retirement benefits. Council members include state and local government pension plans, which are important to secure the retirement promise made to individuals who have provided a lifetime of public service. It is a promise that I am quite familiar with. As a former California state securities regulator, I am a member of the California Public Employees&rsquo; Retirement System (CalPERS). I am also the son of a retired community college instructor, whose retirement has been made possible by the California State Teachers Retirement System (CalSTRS).</p>
<p>When one compares the investment holdings of CalPERS or CalSTRS to the holdings of the Federal Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) or a target date fund in a 401(k) plan, one will notice a significant difference: defined benefit plans often have an allocation to private funds while the others do not. There may be reasons for investing in private funds, such the potential for higher risk-adjusted returns, increased diversification, and the ability to better match anticipated cash outflows from the plan. However, for the average worker who invests through a 401(k) plan or an individual retirement account, it is nearly impossible to obtain exposures to a diversified portfolio comparable to CalPERS and CalSTRS even if he or she does not expect to retire for 30 years or more. As returns in the public markets become more closely correlated, regulators should be thinking about whether investors might be better served with more opportunities to diversify &ndash; such as exposures similar to those held by pension funds.</p>
<p>Private Fund Adviser Rules</p>
<p>Recently, the Commission has finalized several rules impacting private funds and their advisers, which will impact pension plans and other institutional investors.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-cii-030524#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;One significant rulemaking was an integrated package of reforms for private fund advisers (the &ldquo;Private Funds Rules&rdquo;), that included quarterly fund statements, mandatory fund audits, procedures for adviser-led secondaries, restrictions on certain activities, and prohibitions on certain preferential treatment.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-cii-030524#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;The Council supported the rules&rsquo; provisions on fee and expense disclosure as well as performance disclosure.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-cii-030524#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;More recently, the Council joined an amicus brief in support of the final rules, expressing the view that they would address harms resulting from the imbalance of power between advisers and institutional investors and the information asymmetry around the conflicts that can result.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-cii-030524#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p>While I understand that the Council might be pleased with the results of the rulemaking, some caution about the Commission&rsquo;s statutory authority to promulgate such rules may be in order. The Commission relies on an expansive view of Section 211(h)(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (&ldquo;Advisers Act&rdquo;). This provision was added by paragraph (g) of Section 913 of the Dodd-Frank Act under the heading of &ldquo;authority to establish a fiduciary duty for brokers and dealers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Section 913(g) contained parallel provisions amending both the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (&ldquo;Exchange Act&rdquo;) and the Advisers Act to authorize the Commission to impose a fiduciary standard of care for brokers, dealers, and investment advisers. Section 913(g) also included parallel provisions, codified in Section 15(l) of the Exchange Act and Section 211(h) of the Advisers Act, directing the Commission to &ldquo;examine and, where appropriate, promulgate rules prohibiting or restricting certain sales practices, conflicts of interest, and compensation schemes for brokers, dealers, and investment advisers that the Commission deems contrary to the public interest and the protection of investors.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-cii-030524#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p>By ignoring the context provided by Section 913, the Commission&rsquo;s broad reading represents a significant jurisdictional extension. Section 913 does not mention private funds, but focuses on brokers, dealers, and investment advisers. It does not make sense that Congress would use Section 913, which was part of Title IX of the Dodd-Frank Act, to regulate private fund advisers when Congress specifically addressed them in Title IV of the Dodd-Frank Act. Should we believe that Congress omitted any authorization to regulate private funds in this manner in Title IV, but included an obscure authorization in Section 913(g)?</p>
<p>Over-reaching assertions of government jurisdiction is a problem for all market participants. When contemplating the administrative state, persons should be concerned if there is no practical limiting principle on the scope of an agency&rsquo;s authority and the dangers associated with that method of governance.</p>
<p>Section 211(h) has three important components: (1) sales practices, conflicts of interest and compensation schemes; (2) investors; and (3) brokers, dealers, and investment advisers.</p>
<p>The first component is &ldquo;sales practices, conflicts of interest, and compensation schemes.&rdquo; These areas can be broadly construed. In the capital markets where every participant has its own self-interest, conflicts of interest are everywhere. Nearly any form of communication can be deemed a sales practice and any payment can be part of a compensation scheme. The Investment Company Act of 1940 &ndash; which regulates registered investment companies (RICs) &ndash; already contains provisions that address sales practices,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-cii-030524#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;conflicts of interest<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-cii-030524#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;and compensation schemes.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-cii-030524#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;Does Section 211(h) allow the Commission to superimpose the provisions of the Investment Company Act onto the Advisers Act for non-RICs? Read broadly, Section 211(h) could permit the Commission to prohibit or restrict any type of advisory activity that might fall into these categories. For example, could Section 211(h) be used to prohibit or restrict the ESG activities of a fund, because it involves a sales practice, conflict of interest, and/or compensation scheme? Could Section 211(h) be used for government mandated price caps on funds?</p>
<p>The second component is investors. The Commission argues that Section 211(h) makes no distinction between retail investors and institutional investors. What are the implications of this assertion? If it means that entities such as private funds, which are statutorily excluded from regulation under Sections 3(c)(1) and 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-cii-030524#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;can be indirectly regulated through the Advisers Act, then why wouldn&rsquo;t the same argument apply to other excluded funds? After all, the Private Funds Rules require providing investors with fund-level &ndash; not adviser-level &ndash; disclosures such as quarterly statements about private funds adviser compensation, fund fees and expenses, and performance,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-cii-030524#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;and audited financial statements.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-cii-030524#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;For instance, could the Commission use Section 211(h) to regulate church plans<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-cii-030524#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>&nbsp;excluded by Section 3(c)(14) of the Investment Company Act? What about collective investment trusts that are excluded by Section 3(c)(11) of the Investment Company Act? What about private pension plans that are also excluded by Section 3(c)(11)?</p>
<p>The third component is brokers, dealers, and investment advisers, though I will focus only on investment advisers. Section 211(h) does not differentiate among Commission-registered investment advisers, state-registered investment advisers, and investment advisers exempt from registration. The National Securities Market Improvement Act of 1996 (&ldquo;NSMIA&rdquo;) provides that the states cannot impose substantive regulations on Commission-registered investment advisers,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-cii-030524#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>&nbsp;but is silent on the Commission&rsquo;s ability to impose regulations on state-registered investment advisers. Does Section 211(h) give the Commission the authority to regulate state-registered investment advisers? Section 203(b) provides a list of &ldquo;investment advisers&rdquo; who need not register. This list includes advisers to insurance companies,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-cii-030524#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>&nbsp;advisers to charitable organizations,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-cii-030524#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>&nbsp;commodity trading advisers registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) whose business does not otherwise consist primarily of acting as an investment adviser,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-cii-030524#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a>&nbsp;and advisers to small business investment companies and rural business investment companies.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-cii-030524#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a>&nbsp;Can the Commission now regulate these advisers under Section 211(h)?</p>
<p>Thus, the purported reach of Section 211(h) under the Commission&rsquo;s approach appears to go beyond what Congress intended given the context of Section 913. For the Commission&rsquo;s jurisdictional claim to be valid, Congress must have intended Section 211(h) to be a blank check that subsumes the other federal securities laws, which I find implausible.</p>
<p>Definition of Dealer</p>
<p>The Commission&rsquo;s broad assertion of jurisdiction is not limited to private funds. The Commission&rsquo;s recent rule on dealers has many market participants asking the question &ndash; are they dealers? The heart of the rulemaking was whether liquidity providers, like proprietary trading firms without customers, were dealers because they provided a function similar to market making. The Commission answered affirmatively. Pension plans might take comfort that under the rule, they are unlikely to be dealers because they are not regularly posting bids and asks at or near the market price. But the Commission also made it clear that just because a person does not fall within the rule&rsquo;s definition as a dealer, that person still could be a dealer under the statutory definition.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-cii-030524#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a></p>
<p>The Exchange Act defines a dealer to mean any person engaged in the business of buying and selling securities for such person&rsquo;s own account through a broker or otherwise.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-cii-030524#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a>&nbsp;There is an exception for any person who conducts such activities &ldquo;not as part of a regular business.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-cii-030524#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a>&nbsp;But isn&rsquo;t it part of the regular business of a pension plan, a mutual fund, an exchange-traded fund, a collective investment trust, and a charitable endowment, to buy and sell securities? Indeed, the final dealer rule recognizes that investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act might fall within its scope and thus provided a specific exclusion for them. However, while excluding registered investment companies, the final rule did not exclude private funds, investment advisers, collective investment trusts, and pension plans.</p>
<p>What is the limiting principle on who is a statutory dealer? For the statutory definition, liquidity provision or market making are irrelevant. In fact, the Commission has launched enforcement cases against numerous entities for being statutory dealers, even though they had no customers and bought and held securities for relatively lengthy periods of time before selling.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-cii-030524#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a>&nbsp;While it is unclear how these court cases will turn out, and one court of appeal recently ruled in favor of the Commission&rsquo;s view,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-cii-030524#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a>&nbsp;what is clear is that the guidance released by Commission staff in 2008,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-cii-030524#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a>&nbsp;which lists a number of factors to consider when determining whether a person is a dealer, did not and would not have put these types of entities on notice of their requirement to register as dealers.</p>
<p>Historically, one limiting principle has been that dealers have customers. Since the adoption of the Exchange Act, the terms &ldquo;broker&rdquo; and &ldquo;dealer&rdquo; have generally referred to the method by which a securities business effectuates customer securities transactions. However, that no longer appears to be a requirement in the eyes of the Commission. The new dealer rule fails to provide a definitive test to determine dealer status. With no limiting principle, how does an institutional investor know that they are not a dealer? After all, institutional investors are in the regular business of buying and selling securities. At the very least, institutional investors may need to have policies and procedures to make regular determinations as to their status as a dealer.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies and the Definition of a Security</p>
<p>There is one more area where there appears to be no limiting principle &ndash; what constitutes a security under the investment contract test in Howey, which has arisen for cryptocurrencies and digital assets. Under Howey, an investment contract exists when there is an investment of money in a common enterprise with the expectation of profits based on the managerial efforts of others.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-cii-030524#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a>&nbsp;Council members are likely not invested in crypto or digital assets, so why should they be concerned about how the Commission defines a &ldquo;security&rdquo;? However, the Commission&rsquo;s approach to this analysis for cryptocurrencies and digital assets has been that any item sold whose value is based on the efforts of others is a security. In September 2023, the Commission found that the purchase of a digital image via a non-fungible token (NFT), the proceeds from which was used to finance the creation of an animated series was an investment contract, even though only those users who had purchased the digital image could gain access to watch the content.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-cii-030524#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a>&nbsp;This broad reading of Howey would appear to scope in many common transactions in the non-digital world, including pre-purchase commitments, collectibles, art, and land.</p>
<p>For example, based on the Commission&rsquo;s broad interpretation &ndash; could real estate be considered a security? Many real estate holdings of pension plans are not raw land. They often are projects with development rights, zoning rights, and permits, among other things. Also, let&rsquo;s not forget that the original Howey case involved orange groves. Under the broad definition of an &ldquo;investment contract&rdquo; being applied to the crypto space, could those interests in real estate be deemed as securities? If so, does your real estate broker also need to be registered with FINRA? Does your real estate appraiser have to be registered as an investment adviser? What about commodities holdings? Should they be treated as securities?</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>In conclusion, market participants need to know when their conduct implicates the securities laws and when it does not. The Commission&rsquo;s broad jurisdictional claims in Section 211(h), the definition of &ldquo;dealer,&rdquo; and the definition of &ldquo;security&rdquo; without any practical limiting principle should be concerning for all. The Commission was designed by Congress to have a degree of independence from the political process. In return, the Commission&rsquo;s jurisdiction is limited to only those areas specifically authorized by statute.</p>
<p>Our capital markets have historically thrived because, absent a statutory or regulatory restriction, market participants are able to act without government approval in advance or fear of enforcement without proper notice. The rise of the administrative state presents a challenge to this historical norm. When a regulator can, without practical limitation, promulgate, interpret, and enforce rules and guidance, including retroactively, the temptation to be arbitrary in the exercise of administrative power and enforcement can be great.</p>
<p>I look forward to having a continuing dialogue with the Council and its members in the years to come. Hopefully, you won&rsquo;t need to change the name of your organization to the &ldquo;Council of Institutional Dealers and Investors.&rdquo; Thank you and enjoy the rest of your morning.</p>

Summary: ISDA urged US agencies to implement reforms to the supplementary leverage ratio to preserve resilience of US Treasury markets and the financial system. <div>
<p>On March 5, ISDA submitted a letter to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to urge them to implement targeted reforms to the supplementary leverage ratio (SLR), the enhanced SLR framework and the risk-based surcharge for global systemically important bank holding companies that are important to preserve the resilience of the US Treasury markets, the US economy and the financial system more broadly.</p>
<p>To facilitate participation by banks in US Treasury markets &ndash; including clearing US Treasury security transactions for clients &ndash; the agencies should revise the SLR to permanently exclude on-balance-sheet US Treasuries from total leverage exposure, consistent with the scope of the temporary exclusion for US Treasuries that the agencies implemented in 2020.</p>

<title>Mercuryo Reports Rapid Fire ‘Buy Crypto’ On-Ramp Growth As Bitcoin Soars To New All-Time High</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Bitcoin, Mercuryo, partnership, digital token, payment infrastructure <br />
Summary:<br />
Bitcoin's surge drives global interest in cryptocurrency. Mercuryo's partnerships and services contribute to financial inclusion for the unbanked in developing economies. <div>
<p>Global payments infrastructure provider&nbsp;<a href="https://mercuryo.io/" target="_blank">Mercuryo</a>&nbsp;has reported substantial growth in global digital token payments and services as a stratospheric rise in the Bitcoin price only adds momentum to the fast evolution of the underlying architecture of the space.</p>
<p>Bitcoin has once again captured the imagination of the public as the world&rsquo;s biggest cryptocurrency surged past its record high of $69,000 after 846 days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While price action in the trading of Bitcoin makes the headlines, a dazzling array of payment infrastructure projects are quietly being built as the space evolves to meet the needs of a new generation that is increasingly comfortable seamlessly switching between crypto and fiat services. The provision of on and off-ramp services is the fabric that melds the legacy fiat world and the emerging digital token economy.</p>
<p align="center"><b>&lsquo;Buy Bitcoin&rsquo;</b><span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>As newcomers pour into the space, the &lsquo;buy Bitcoin&rsquo; and &lsquo;buy crypto&rsquo; features have become essential tools among leading participants such as centralised exchanges, non-custodial wallet providers and Decentralised Exchanges (DEXs). To this end, Mercuryo is leading the charge in the evolution of the space as the payment infrastructure provider over the past year secured a series of high-profile strategic partnerships.</p>
<p>Notably, Mercuryo has partnered with&nbsp;<a href="https://mercuryo.io/explore/article/metamask-launch" target="_blank">MetaMask</a>, the leading non-custodial wallet, enabling purchases of up to &euro;699 to be done immediately. The solution also enables users to make purchases directly within the MetaMask wallet using credit and debit cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay and a variety of local payment methods.</p>
<p>Mercuryo has in 2023 also partnered with Ledger, the hardware wallet maker, Jupiter, the leading DEX liquidity aggregator on Solana, Pancakeswap, the leading DEX on the BNB Chain, along with cryptocurrency exchanges, Poloniex,&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.bingx.com/important-announcements/bingx-announces-partnership-with-mercuryo-for-smarter-digital-payments/" target="_blank">BingX</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://phemex.com/announcements/phemex-launches-new-fiat-channel-mercuryo" target="_blank">Phemex</a>&nbsp;and BTSE. Mercuryo is also making waves in the nascent Web3 gaming space, and last year announced partnerships with Wemade, a South Korean Web3 game developer, and IntellaX, a Web3 gaming platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cementing partnerships across the cryptocurrency space has enabled Mercuryo to achieve a 136% boost in raw profitability in 2023. Latin America has witnessed a 27-fold growth, North America a 12-fold growth and Europe a 7-fold growth, spearheaded by a proliferation of on-ramp services across the globe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The launch of the Bitcoin ETF and subsequent rally in the cryptocurrency market that has seen Bitcoin surge to a record high has reawakened interest in crypto among the masses and captured the imagination,&rdquo; said Petr Kozyakov, CEO and Co-Founder of Mercuryo. &ldquo;Our position as a company at the very intersection of digital token services and payments enables us to see emerging trends in the use of crypto as the space evolves beneath the surface headlines. More and more people across the globe are pressing the &lsquo;buy Bitcoin&rsquo; on-ramp button.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Global adoption of cryptocurrency as a means of payment is on the rise as more&nbsp;<a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2023-global-crypto-adoption-index/" target="_blank">nations</a>&nbsp;embrace crypto and the digital financial revolution. Notably, in 2023, Mercuryo integrated with the Brazilian instant payment platform PIX as the provision of cryptocurrency services helps enhance levels of financial inclusion in Latin America.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><b>The unbanked</b></p>
<p>&ldquo;Developing markets, as often, play a crucial role in driving crypto trends, with the US and UK markets attempting to keep pace,&rdquo; added Kozyakov. &ldquo;So, we&rsquo;re up for some exciting industry developments, and Mercuryo will be at the forefront.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Today, 2 billion adults, or 38 percent of all adults worldwide, remain excluded from the financial system today, according to research by the World Bank. The vast majority of the unbanked live in developing economies, where 46 percent of adults do not have a bank account. Providing access to on and off-ramp services enables the unbanked to obtain access to financial services such as P2P payments and cross border payments.</p>

<title>B.C. Securities Commission Launches Guide To Empower Women Investors</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The B.C. Securities Commission (BCSC) is unveiling a new resource in the lead-up to International Women&rsquo;s Day on March 8 that is designed to give women the investment knowledge they need to empower them on their financial journey.</p>
<p>Taking to heart the United Nations theme,&nbsp;<em>Invest in women: Accelerate progress</em>, the BCSC has published an online&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investright.org/tools-resources/guides/women-investing/" target="_blank"><em>Women and Investing</em></a>&nbsp;guide. Founded on research, it includes unbiased information about the fundamental investing principles that can support the financial needs of women.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<em>Women and Investing</em>&nbsp;guide caters to both novice and experienced investors alike, explaining a variety of important concepts, including: &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Investing and saving&nbsp;</li>
<li>Investment goals&nbsp;and retirement</li>
<li>Diversification</li>
<li>Working with a registered investment advisor, and</li>
<li>Using a robo-advisor or doing it yourself through self-directed investing.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know that investing can seem intimidating, but it&rsquo;s one of the best pathways toward building wealth and achieving financial independence,&rdquo; said Brenda Leong, the BCSC&rsquo;s Chair and CEO.&nbsp;&ldquo;This resource will give women the information and guidance they need to feel more confident about making informed investment decisions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>BCSC research shows there are notable differences between men and women when it comes to investing confidence. Women feel less confident than men when it comes to making investment decisions (59 per cent of women say they&rsquo;re confident, while 78 per cent of men say the same). Women also feel more anxiety about losing money on investments (51 per cent say they&rsquo;re anxious, compared to 44 per cent of men) and they are less optimistic than men that they&rsquo;ll be able to achieve their investment targets (only 39 per cent say they&rsquo;re optimistic, whereas 51 per cent of men say the same).</p>
<p>On the other hand, women are also less likely to engage in speculative investing behaviour, which is correlated with higher risk. Women would benefit from greater confidence when it comes to investing, and they are starting from a good place because women already have good instincts when it comes to making smart investment decisions.</p>
<p>Research also shows that women face unique financial challenges including the gender pay gap, the need to plan for a longer retirement (since they tend to outlive men), and time away from the workforce to focus on family, which can impact wealth-building opportunities.</p>

<title>Colombia Unveils New Taxonomy Guidelines To Accelerate Green Finance</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Taxonomy, Colombia, Sustainable Finance, Policies, Climate Bonds
Summary:
Colombia introduced a pioneering green taxonomy, supported by new guidelines and tools for implementation. Climate Bonds plays a crucial role in global taxonomy initiatives. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<ul>
<li><sub>New Policies and Tools Redefine Sustainable Finance Landscape for banks and financial institutions&nbsp;&nbsp;</sub></li>
<li><strong>Colombia's Pioneering Green Taxonomy laid the foundation for sustainable investment&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In April 2022, the Colombian Government launched the first Taxonomy in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) with the aim of supporting the mobilisation of capital for sustainability objectives. This milestone not only marks the region's first-ever taxonomy but also positions Colombia as a trailblazer, with a high level of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.climatebonds.net/civicrm/mailing/url?u=6583&amp;qid=2231252" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">interoperability with the EU Taxonomy.</a>&nbsp;Aligning with international standards and in line with the Paris Agreement's 1.5&deg;C trajectory, it responds to the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) acquired on the Paris Agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.climatebonds.net/civicrm/mailing/url?u=6584&amp;qid=2231252" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Colombian Green Taxonomy</a>&nbsp;(Taxonom&iacute;a Verde de Colombia - TVC) establishes how an investment can contribute to climate mitigation and adaptation and five other environmental goals. A taxonomy works like a shopping list, signalling to investors that assets and activities can be financed for a green future. It is the starting point of sustainable finance policies. However, a taxonomy alone will not drive rapid climate action. Public policies and tools must be developed to support the taxonomy implementation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3><br /><strong>New guidelines will serve as public policies to simplify the Taxonomy usability &nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>On the 12th of February, the Taxonomy Supervisory Committee, led by the Financial Superintendency (SFC) and the Ministry of Finance (MHCP) of Colombia, introduced two game-changing usability guidelines. Crafted for both general and banking sector users, these guidelines serve as official tools, simplifying the application of TVC in the financial and non-financial sectors. The guidelines are outlined in the official document, published by the SFC, that officialised the adoption of the taxonomy, encourage the use of taxonomy for labelling green bonds, investment portfolios, and voluntary pension funds (External Circular 005 of 2022).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>These guidelines were authored by Climate Bonds Initiative, Metrix Finanzas and Ambire Global, in the framework of the project "Greening the Colombian financial system: Implementing local green definitions to enable long-term investment in priority sectors" through support of the UK PACT programme from the Government of the United Kingdom.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Navigating the TVC Landscape: A Comprehensive Overview&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>The<strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.climatebonds.net/civicrm/mailing/url?u=6585&amp;qid=2231252" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">General TVC Implementation Guideline</a>,</strong>&nbsp;targeting a diverse audience ranging from private companies to financial consumers, provides a practical roadmap for meeting TVC eligibility criteria at the sector and activity levels, complying with its general and specific requirements and social safeguards. It also provides insight on how to approach and align those activities related to energy efficiency which is not mentioned explicitly in the Colombian Taxonomy. With practical examples, visual graphs, and strategies for analysis and management, this guideline is set to be a game-changer in fostering sustainable finance policies. &nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Empowering Financial Institutions: TVC Implementation Guideline on Green Credit Management&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>Specifically designed for banks and financial institutions,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.climatebonds.net/civicrm/mailing/url?u=6586&amp;qid=2231252" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>TVC Implementation Guideline on Green Credit Management</strong></a>&nbsp;offers strategic, operational, and technical recommendations. It provides a list of recommendations to improve the assessment of social and environmental risks for green credits. This guideline aims to boost investments in green projects and assets, presenting best practices gleaned from the sustainability strategy of banks in the country. These recommendations directly addresses the challenges banks face when evaluating projects for green credits. They stem from assessments conducted on five of Colombia's largest banks through the implementation of pilot projects.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Governments can implement policies to accelerate Taxonomy-aligned investment&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>Beyond taxonomy guidance, governments and regulators can accelerate 1.5&deg;C-aligned investment through various policy options. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.climatebonds.net/civicrm/mailing/url?u=6587&amp;qid=2231252" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">101 Sustainable Finance Policies for 1.5&ordm;C</a>&nbsp;provides a comprehensive toolkit for policymakers, including subsidies and guarantees to de-risk investments.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><br /><strong>Climate Bonds at the Forefront of Global Taxonomy Initiatives&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>As taxonomies gain prominence globally, Climate Bonds continues to play a pivotal role in their development and implementation. With a robust presence in Latin America and the Caribbean, Climate Bonds has been instrumental in guiding taxonomies in countries such as Colombia, Chile, Mexico, Brazil, Peru, Costa Rica, and Panama.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are also enabling the uptake of these taxonomies, providing further policy expertise, capacity building, training, and supporting key labelled bond issuers, from sovereigns to development banks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To learn more about our work with Taxonomies, click&nbsp;<a href="https://www.climatebonds.net/civicrm/mailing/url?u=6588&amp;qid=2231252" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Climate_Bonds_Taxonomy" src="https://mondovisione.com/_assets/images/Climate_Bonds_Taxonomy.jpg" title="Climate_Bonds_Taxonomy" /></p>
<h3><strong>The Last Word&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>Taxonomies play a pivotal role in attracting increased capital for climate solutions, signalling the credibility and longevity of green finance. Climate Bonds is on a global mission to facilitate USD5 trillion in annual green bond issuance by 2025, acknowledging that addressing the impending climate challenges demands a comprehensive transformation of significant sectors of the global economy. To achieve trillions in annual issuance, robust local initiatives are essential. Taxonomies emerge as indispensable tools for nurturing local markets, and Climate Bonds is committed to providing support for these endeavours.&nbsp;</p>

<div> February 2024, MarketAxess, trading volume, credit, rates, FPM<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
MarketAxess reported record total credit ADV, with increases in U.S. high-grade, emerging markets, Eurobonds, and municipal bonds ADV. U.S. high-yield ADV decreased. The preliminary FPM for total credit for February 2024 was approximately $152, down from $168 in the prior year, driven by product mix shift and lower duration of bonds traded in U.S. high-grade. Total rates ADV decreased. <div>
<p>MarketAxess Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: MKTX), the operator of a leading electronic trading platform for fixed-income securities, today announced monthly trading volume and preliminary variable transaction fees per million (&ldquo;FPM&rdquo;) for February 2024.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><b>Chris Concannon, CEO of MarketAxess, commented:</b></p>
<p>&ldquo;We delivered record total credit ADV of&nbsp;<b>$15.2 billion</b>, driven by a&nbsp;<b>14.6%</b>&nbsp;increase in U.S. high-grade ADV, a&nbsp;<b>12.5%</b>&nbsp;increase in emerging markets ADV, a&nbsp;<b>9.1%</b>&nbsp;increase in Eurobonds ADV, and an&nbsp;<b>8.0%&nbsp;</b>increase in municipal bonds ADV. Strong credit volumes quarter-to-date across several of our growth cylinders have&nbsp;<b>more than offset</b>&nbsp;significantly lower levels of U.S. high-yield trading activity on our platform impacted by continued low levels of credit spread volatility. The roll-out of MarketAxess X-Pro is continuing and client engagement is increasing with approximately&nbsp;<b>14%</b>&nbsp;of our largest client firms active on the platform, up from&nbsp;<b>12%</b>&nbsp;in January 2024.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Select February 2024 highlights*</b></p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li><b>Record</b>&nbsp;total credit average daily volume (&ldquo;ADV&rdquo;) of&nbsp;<b>$15.2 billion</b>, up&nbsp;<b>5.1%</b>.</li>
<li><b>Record</b>&nbsp;U.S. high-grade ADV of&nbsp;<b>$7.7</b>&nbsp;<b>billion</b>, up<b>&nbsp;14.6%</b>&nbsp;on an&nbsp;<b>18.6%&nbsp;</b>increase in<b>&nbsp;</b>estimated market ADV. Estimated market share of&nbsp;<b>19.5%</b>,<b>&nbsp;</b>down from&nbsp;<b>20.1%&nbsp;</b>in the prior year on&nbsp;<b>record</b>&nbsp;February new issuance calendar.</li>
<li>U.S. high-yield ADV of&nbsp;<b>$1.4 billion</b>, down&nbsp;<b>37.1%</b>. Estimated market share of&nbsp;<b>12.9%</b>, down from&nbsp;<b>19.2%&nbsp;</b>in the prior year. U.S. high-yield estimated market ADV decreased&nbsp;<b>6.3%</b>. We believe the decrease in U.S. high-yield estimated market share year-over-year was driven, in part, by&nbsp;<b>lower levels of credit spread volatility</b>&nbsp;and a greater&nbsp;<b>focus on the new issue calendar</b>&nbsp;by our long-only client segment. Lower levels of credit spread volatility drove an estimated&nbsp;<b>73.8%</b>&nbsp;decrease in ETF market maker client activity on our platform.</li>
<li>Emerging markets ADV of&nbsp;<b>$3.6 billion</b>, up&nbsp;<b>12.5%</b>. The year-over-year increase was driven by a&nbsp;<b>6.4%&nbsp;</b>increase in<b>&nbsp;</b>hard currency trading ADV, and a&nbsp;<b>26.5%</b>&nbsp;growth in local currency markets trading ADV.<sup>2</sup></li>
<li>Eurobonds ADV<b>&nbsp;</b>of&nbsp;<b>$2.0&nbsp;</b><b>billion</b>, up<b>&nbsp;9.1%</b>.<sup>2</sup></li>
<li>Municipal bond<b>&nbsp;</b>ADV of&nbsp;<b>$434 million</b>, up&nbsp;<b>8.0%</b>&nbsp;with estimated market ADV down&nbsp;<b>17.2%</b>. Estimated market share of<b>&nbsp;6.8%</b>, up from&nbsp;<b>5.4%&nbsp;</b>in the prior year.<sup>2</sup></li>
<li><b>AxessIQ</b>, the order and execution workflow solution designed for wealth management and private banking clients, achieved ADV of<b>&nbsp;$141.4 million</b>, up<b>&nbsp;21.2%&nbsp;</b>from the prior year.</li>
<li><b>34%</b>&nbsp;Open Trading&reg; share<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;of total credit trading volume, down from&nbsp;<b>36%</b>&nbsp;in the prior year.</li>
<li>Total rates ADV of&nbsp;<b>$19.1 billion</b>, down&nbsp;<b>18.6% from prior year, but up 13.0% from January 2024.</b></li>
<li>The preliminary FPM<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;for total credit for February 2024 was approximately&nbsp;<b>$152</b>, down from&nbsp;<b>$168&nbsp;</b>in the prior year,&nbsp;<b>$156&nbsp;</b>in January 2024, and&nbsp;<b>$154</b>&nbsp;quarter-to-date. The decline in total credit FPM compared to the prior year was due principally to product mix shift. The decline in total credit FPM compared to January 2024 was driven principally by lower duration of bonds traded in U.S. high-grade. The preliminary FPM for total rates was<b>&nbsp;$4.30</b>, compared to&nbsp;<b>$4.13</b>&nbsp;in the prior year.</li>

<title>EACH Responds To ESAs’ Joint Consultation On Second Batch Of Policy Mandates Under The Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)</title>

<div> implementation, DORA, timeline, extension, incident reporting

Summary:
- EACH members call for extension of DORA timeline
- Proposals for re-organizing major incident reporting data fields
- Exclusion of ICT services supporting critical functions from subcontracting definition
- Suggestions for TLPT testers and threat intelligence providers
- Financial entities should be allowed to rely on TLPT performed by ICT third-party service providers.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>On Monday 4<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;March EACH responded to some of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esas-launch-joint-consultation-second-batch-policy-mandates-under-digital" target="_blank">ESAs&rsquo;&nbsp;joint consultation on second batch of policy mandates under the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)</a>. &nbsp;EACH Members would like to underline the following key messages:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Timeline for the implementation of DORA</b>&nbsp;&ndash; EACH Members consider that the timeline for the implementation of DORA (which will apply from 17 January 2025)&nbsp;<b>appears to be extremely challenging</b>. EACH Members are therefore calling for an&nbsp;<b>extension of such timeline</b>&nbsp;in order to ensure a smooth and efficient implementation. We would expect Authorities to provide comfort to the industry accordingly as well as some prioritisation of the aspects of DORA that should be implemented first.</li>
<li><b>Major incident reporting</b>&nbsp;&ndash; The amount of data fields to be provided in the context of the initial, intermediate and final reports seems often excessively detailed and, in some cases, potentially misleading. EACH Members have therefore put forward some proposals regarding a re-organisation of such data fields by, for instance, suggesting certain data fields to be moved from the initial reports to the intermediate one.</li>
<li><b>Subcontracting&nbsp;</b><b>ICT services supporting critical or important functions</b>&nbsp;&ndash; EACH Members suggest not to include in the definition of &lsquo;subcontracting&rsquo; those cases where ICT services supporting critical or important functions are provided from the parent company to a subsidiary or the reverse. Furthermore, we consider that monitoring subcontracting conditions through the review of contractual documentation between ICT third-party service providers and subcontractors is unrealistic.</li>
<li><b>Elements related to TLPT</b>&nbsp;&ndash; EACH overall agrees with the approach proposed in the consultation document (cross-sectoral, proportional, two-layered). We would nevertheless suggest that external testers and threat intelligence providers should prove their experience not only in TLPT, but also in TLPT&nbsp;<i>in the financial sector</i>. In addition,&nbsp;to avoid high costs and unnecessary burden to the financial entity for preparing and managing the tests and to recognize the above specific situation and requirements, financial entities should be allowed to rely on TLPT that are performed by ICT third-party service providers.</li>
</ul>

<title>Purdue University/CME Group Ag Economy Barometer: Modest Improvement In Farmer Sentiment, Yet Financial Concerns Loom</title>

<div> increase, farmer sentiment, financial performance, concerns, farmland values<br />
<br />Summary: Farmer sentiment improves slightly with concerns about financial performance, high input costs, and farmland values. Solar energy leasing interest remains strong. <div>
<p>The latest&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4106668-1&amp;h=794810970&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fageconomybarometer%2F&amp;a=Purdue+University%2FCME+Group+Ag+Economy+Barometer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Purdue University/CME Group Ag Economy Barometer</a>&nbsp;reveals a modest increase in farmer sentiment compared to the previous month, though concerns remain regarding farm financial performance in the year ahead. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The February barometer reading reached 111, marking a 5-point rise from last month. The small uptick is attributed to producers expressing increased optimism about the future, with the Future Expectations Index climbing 7 points to 115. However, the Current Conditions Index remained unchanged. Despite their improved outlook for the future, farmers' financial performance expectations did not keep pace. February's Farm Financial Performance Index registered at 85, a slight dip from January and notably lower than its recent peak in December. The February survey was conducted from&nbsp;Feb. 12-16.</p>
<p>"Weak crop prices continue to weigh heavily on financial expectations, with mid-February Eastern Corn Belt cash prices for corn and soybeans declining by 7% and 8%, respectively, compared to two months earlier," said&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4106668-1&amp;h=4200754721&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fageconomybarometer%2Fteam%2Fjim-mintert%2F&amp;a=James+Mintert" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">James Mintert</a>, the barometer's principal investigator and director of&nbsp;Purdue University's&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4106668-1&amp;h=3141738204&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fhome%2F&amp;a=Center+for+Commercial+Agriculture" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Center for Commercial Agriculture</a>.</p>
<p>When producers were asked about their primary concerns for farm operations in the upcoming year, the top concern cited by 34% of respondents was "high input costs," closely followed by "lower crop/livestock prices," chosen by 28% of respondents. Worries about rising interest rates among producers seem to have diminished somewhat, with only 18% of February respondents citing it as a top concern, down from 26% who did so in November.</p>
<p>The Farm Capital Investment Index remains weak at 34 points, 9 points lower than last year. Producers expressing reluctance toward making large investments highlighted concerns over high production costs and weak output prices. The percentage of farmers worried about farm profitability has tripled since last October. This month, 22 out of every 100 farmers pointed to farm profitability concerns, while last fall only 7 out of every 100 farmers felt the same way.</p>
<p>The Short-Term Farmland Values Expectations Index held steady in comparison to January but declined by 4 points from a year ago and by 30 points from two years ago. Although the farmland index remains positive, it is clear that overall sentiment regarding future increases in farmland values is weaker than it was a couple of years ago. Among producers who expect values to increase in the next year, the top reason cited for their optimism was demand from non-farm investors.</p>
<p>Each February, the barometer survey asks producers about growth plans for their farm operation in the upcoming five years. This year, 4 out of 10 respondents expressed no plans for growth, with 14% saying they plan to exit or retire. Alternatively, just over 3 out of 10 respondents anticipate their farm's annual growth rate to exceed 5%. Responses to this question, which have been consistent in recent years, point to further consolidation among farm operations.</p>
<p>"To put growth rates into perspective, consider that a farm operation growing at a 5% annual rate will double in size in about 14 years, whereas a farm growing at an annual rate of 10% will need just seven years to double," Mintert said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interest in leasing farmland for solar energy development remains strong, with 10% of respondents having discussed such projects in the last six months. Rates varied widely, but over half of the respondents reported being offered lease rates of&nbsp;$1,000&nbsp;per acre or more. The top end for solar lease rates appears to be rising over time. When this question was posed in&nbsp;June 2021, just 27% of respondents reported a lease rate offer of&nbsp;$1,000&nbsp;or more per acre, compared to 56% of respondents this year.</p>

<div> February 2024, Tradeweb Markets Inc., trading volume, rates, credit, equities, money markets.<br />
Summary: Record total trading volume, increased ADV across asset classes, sustained rates market volatility, ongoing institutional client activity, and strong retail engagement. <div>
<p>Tradeweb Markets Inc. (Nasdaq: TW), a leading, global operator of electronic marketplaces for rates, credit, equities and money markets, today reported total trading volume for the month of February 2024 of $37.9 trillion (tn)<a href="https://www.tradeweb.com/newsroom/media-center/news-releases/tradeweb-reports-february-2024-total-trading-volume-of-$37.9-trillion-and-average-daily-volume-of-$1.87-trillion/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span>[1]</span></a>. Average daily volume (ADV) for the month was $1.87tn, an increase of 31.1 percent (%) year-over-year (YoY).</p>
<p>In February 2024, Tradeweb records included:</p>
<ul>
<li>ADV in U.S. government bonds</li>
<li>ADV in European government bonds</li>
<li>ADV in rates futures</li>
<li>ADV in fully electronic U.S. High Grade credit</li>
<li>ADV in equity convertibles/swaps/options</li>
<li>ADV in global repurchase agreements</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">February 2024 Highlights</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;<span>Rates</span></span> &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>U.S. government bond ADV was up 44.0% YoY to $207.8 billion (bn). European government bond ADV was up 17.9% YoY to $51.0bn.  
<ul>
<li>U.S. government bond volumes were supported by growth across all client sectors, leading to record volume on the institutional platform for the second consecutive month. Increased adoption across a wide range of trading protocols, along with sustained rates market volatility, contributed to the increase in volume. The addition of r8fin also contributed positively to wholesale volumes. Higher interest rates continued to drive trading in the retail market on the short end of the curve. European government bond volumes continued to be strong, particularly in UK Gilts, where there was continued flow and growth in our dealer-to-client platform. We also saw an abundance of new issuance across Europe and the UK in the primary market, along with increased client activity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Mortgage ADV was up 12.2% YoY to $188.1bn.  
<ul>
<li>Platform trading activity remained healthy while shifting rate-cut bets led agency mortgages to underperform compared to other fixed-income asset classes. Specified pool trading volumes set a record high, up 170% YoY.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Swaps/swaptions &ge; 1-year ADV was up 65.1% YoY to $502.3bn and total rates derivatives ADV was up 32.1% YoY to $789.7bn.  
<ul>
<li>Strong volume in swaps/swaptions &ge; 1-year was driven by ongoing institutional client activity in response to current global central bank policy decisions, as well as an 88% YoY increase in compression activity, which carries a lower fee per million. Quarter-to-date compression activity is running higher than 4Q23. Clients continued to utilize the request-for-market (RFM) protocol for larger risk transfers, while inflation and emerging markets swap growth remained strong.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Credit</span> </span> &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Fully electronic U.S. credit ADV was up 49.9% YoY to $7.7bn and European credit ADV was up 4.7% YoY to $2.3bn.  
<ul>
<li>Strong U.S. credit volumes were driven by increased client adoption of Tradeweb protocols, most notably in request-for-quote (RFQ), portfolio trading and Tradeweb AllTrade&reg;. Tradeweb captured 17.5% share of fully electronic U.S. High Grade TRACE, and 6.6% share of fully electronic U.S. High Yield TRACE. Strong European credit volumes were supported by continued growth in client use of Tradeweb Automated Intelligent Execution (AiEX) and portfolio trading.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Municipal bonds ADV was down 4.4% YoY to $322 million (mm).  
<ul>
<li>Volumes slightly outperformed the broader market, which was down more than 5% YoY. Retail activity was more resilient than institutional flows, as Muni/U.S. Treasury ratios remained unattractive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Credit derivatives ADV was down 23.1% YoY to $8.1bn.&nbsp;  
<ul>
<li>Tight credit spreads and low market volatility led to subdued swap execution facility (SEF) and multilateral trading facility (MTF) credit default swaps activity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Equities</span> &nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>U.S. ETF ADV was up 20.6% YoY to $8.7bn and European ETF ADV was up 7.0% YoY to $3.0bn.  
<ul>
<li>U.S. and European ETF growth was driven by continued institutional client adoption of ETF trading via Tradeweb&rsquo;s electronic RFQ as well as an uptick in the use of our ETF portfolio trading functionality.</li>

The strategic relationship is set to transform the accessibility, consistency and analytical power of Thatcham Vehicle Risk Data (VRD)<sup>i</sup>&nbsp;which is used to assign an industry-standard ABI Code and Group Rating score to vehicles. The VRD is integral to how insurers assess and rate risk for all wheels-based insurance products.</p>
<div dir="ltr" id="dvprnejpgfbe5left"><img align="middle" alt="LexisNexis Risk Solutions" id="prnejpgfbe5left" src="https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/491370/LexisNexis_Risk_Solutions_Logo.jpg" title="LexisNexis Risk Solutions" /></div>
<p>The news comes as the Association of British Insurers, in close collaboration with Thatcham Research, has released its motor insurance affordability roadmap<sup>ii</sup>. This includes recommendations to increase visibility of the Group Rating system, which would help consumers make more informed choices on their motor insurance based on the vehicle they choose. This collaboration will help support these actions and recommendations, making it easier for insurance providers to be transparent with customers over vehicle ratings as car safety technology evolves.</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><b>The first element of the agreement focuses on streamlining and automating access to the VRD</b>. LexisNexis Risk Solutions has the widest data distribution network into the U.K. insurance sector, streamlining data directly into insurers, brokers, managing general agents (MGAs), insurtechs, software houses and third-party data providers, to support billions of insurance quotes per month. LexisNexis Risk Solutions will become the sole distributor of Thatcham VRD to the U.K. and ROI insurance market.Leveraging this unique network, insurance providers, including insurers, brokers, MGAs, insurtechs and software houses, will be able to access Thatcham VRD in real time for the first time, alongside additional public, third party and proprietary data sources, as part of a streamlined risk assessment and decisioning process, via the&nbsp;<a href="http://email.prnewswire.com/ls/click?upn=u001.v9xoTZaCB3KDvUFxTt6K9ITfJcLtx-2FOvmuVizoBK57Dc5EUnbgWie5hAam5zcOJklBug-2BOWUxscL-2BWt44nV7vEexJy-2B-2FcLOXDTCGWAFFmC9Fo3DlqiSHCwKvHggYhtEmxew6hHMWVSAoNLz0LLEMN40AaQWzPHOqroDOLvs0Kdarha8hr8HSf1cEfk1khtS4FCnzY8b-2F0FuW9uxKDzXZGPwZuEXjsTflD-2F-2B8iKkvMpqFseaQt0L5lPC9nX5-2FmV2SpvHg3a2MPBpjCaEalp3zc3vtncqhZ8yRHSf0GiOoq3-2F0taP4f3NO1p4jE64to3PSdXJcv-2Bru-2Fc8t6aU3opvI2zQ0hDvzkUWPCa-2B-2B-2FSl8yIQaCRCLz8GCZp9sucPGO1EfzccaewQh7m9GUDc4LX2IAvPEVXA-2FgwOYzD9db4BOLII-3DdNNn_pIbxPfpDI69aAybPrpOfg1n6CWmKMnb3conIyNKCYgr-2BTRqxLAwMRExIXLpGb5DJ2pZV74YdU0C7jmjuRXZQMa8aIbT-2FORgLCAPNNzi7lmwuOI3QfIb73PvTJ8dAeHbjkRZzsLdX7tIExpHkf3aiyviLeskfJMB0jyJ9TvGOaTT1f-2FB-2B7ZJtsnb4nVn-2B7v8-2FOPmT8lLJmwI1DnS5fb6ePhMkYIrZOHNOzZ-2FExlI9G5x0qi25F28Nd5W-2FXNf2-2BgaYZpOLqjHlF3NMKF42mUG6p6JiVElkXNIyLLniEtG0DMLUy3yGZz1hihBsUWYrx-2B7kqq9QxHAkuZ-2Fp4eRhLZASD5m3Yx0oDalpkWliX-2FELnpB1u-2F0AYK8uzsZFsuzKkFHQ" target="_blank">LexisNexis&reg; Informed Quotes</a>&nbsp;platform.</li>
<li><b>The second element of the agreement focuses on consistent matching of Thatcham VRD to vehicle registrations</b>. As part of the strategic relationship with Thatcham Research, LexisNexis Risk Solutions will use its extensive linking and data normalisation expertise to match vehicles to Thatcham VRD (incorporating the Group Rating, Variant Code and ABI Code datasets). This will create greater consistency for insurance providers by delivering more granular data to support the identification of risk-affecting vehicle features in the quoting process regardless of the quoting platform.</li>
<li><b>The third element of the agreement will focus on uncovering new, predictive vehicle intelligence.&nbsp;</b>Leveraging its long track record of building new and innovative vehicle data products, LexisNexis Risk Solutions will collaborate with Thatcham Research in exploring the possibility to unlock significant intelligence on vehicles that does not exist today.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>James Burton, managing director, U.K. and Ireland insurance, LexisNexis Risk Solutions, said: "We pride ourselves on being experts in insurance, and our vehicle strategy is both consistent with and complementary to the Thatcham Research vision. This strategy makes LexisNexis Risk Solutions well-placed to unlock the potential in the Thatcham VRD product, creating transformational insights for motor insurance providers. As an organisation, we are passionate, driven by the opportunity to help Thatcham Research customers, our customers and our shared customers realise the benefits of this relationship as they look to improve profitability, operational efficiency, reduce claims costs and improve the customer experience."</p>
<p>Jonathan Hewett, chief executive of Thatcham Research, said: "This exclusive relationship with LexisNexis Risk Solutions will allow Thatcham Research to focus efforts on research, testing and training, knowing that the insights we offer that are essential to how insurance providers derive premiums and assess risk will be managed by a trusted partner to the industry. We are pleased to be able to offer insurance providers greater access to vital data which may not have been accessible previously. The combination of Thatcham Research and LexisNexis Risk Solutions assets and intelligence is compelling, providing an exciting roadmap for new services and insights that will improve the overall motor insurance customer experience."</p>

<title>Securities And Futures Bureau And Taiwan Stock Exchange Shine Spotlight On Taiwan's Capital Market With Highly-Anticipated "Taiwan Day" In London</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Taiwan, TWSE, investment attraction, foreign investors, "Taiwan Day"
Summary:<br />Chang and Lin led a Taiwan team to Europe, attracting foreign investment, highlighting Taiwan's stock market strengths and reforms, and seeking feedback. <div>
<p>In early March,&nbsp;Chen-Shan Chang, Director-General of the Securities and Futures Bureau (the "SFB") and Sherman Lin, Chairman and CEO of the Taiwan Stock Exchange (the "TWSE") led a team to Europe, marking the first foreign investment attraction trip of the year. The visit included meetings with dozens of influential European institutions, ranging from exchanges, index companies, investment institutions, and large asset management firms. A much-anticipated highlight was the "Taiwan Day" event held on 5 March, which brought together over 50 prominent investors from the UK to gain insights into the latest market reform measures and the outlook for Taiwan's stock market.</p>
<p>Held in London, the "Taiwan Day" proved to be a resounding response to the recent call by Dr. Tien-Mu Huang, Chairperson of the Financial Supervisory Commission (the "FSC"), for securities-related institutions to continuously enhance international connectivity and promote the strengths and reforms of Taiwan's capital market. During the event, the prominent European institutional investors in attendance were highly impressed by a wide array of strengths of Taiwan's stock market, such as its high-tech cluster characteristics, outstanding ESG performance, and foreign investment-friendly environment.</p>
<p>Taiwan's representative for the UK, Vincent Chin-Hsiang Yao shared how the pandemic has underscored the crucial role of Taiwanese enterprises in the global supply chain. The "Taiwan Day" not only provided participants an opportunity to gain a profound understanding of the advantages offered by Taiwanese enterprises, but also aimed to foster a solid foundation for enhancing the ties between Taiwan and the UK and promoting mutual prosperity.</p>
<p>Chang, in his articulation, highlighted Taiwan's commitment to attract foreign investment in recent years, as demonstrated by the joint efforts with the TWSE to visit institutional investors in major financial centers around the world since last year, and the aspiration to establish Taiwan's capital market as a foreign investment-friendly environment through direct dialogue in the future.</p>
<p>Lin continued by illustrating the UK's role as a substantial investment source for Taiwan, and the Taiwan-UK partnership further cemented by the "Bilateral Enhanced Trade Partnership Arrangement" signed in last November. Going forward, Taiwan will continue to strengthen the development of its high-tech industry, create an ESG-friendly environment, and actively seek feedback from investors to consolidate the role of Taiwan's capital market.</p>
<p>Shin-Chung Chen, Senior Vice President of the TWSE, took the floor to present the compelling attributes of Taiwan's capital market. These include Taiwan's robust economic development with a projected GDP growth rate of over 3% in 2024 as well as the prominent rankings on a global scale. According to data of the World Federation of Exchanges, Taiwan's stock exchange ranks 7th, 12th and 16th in terms of turnover, trading value and market capitalization, respectively. In 2023, over 80% of listed companies distributed cash dividends and foreign ownership accounted for over 40%. Additionally, Taiwan listed companies and emerging technology firms play a pivotal role in the up and midstream supply chain of artificial intelligence (AI). These companies not only prioritize ESG-related development, but also maintain a steadfast commitment to continuously fostering a foreign investment-friendly environment which welcomes international investors into Taiwan's market.</p>
<p>Kuo-Jung Cheng, Deputy Director of the SFB, then provided a comprehensive introduction to a series of investor-friendly initiatives poised to attract overseas capital into Taiwan's capital market, enhancing the appeal of Taiwan's market among foreign investors through more diversified investment opportunities, flexible sources of investment funds, and convenient digital services. Cheng also gave an in-depth overview of recent key regulatory reforms and forward-looking policies related to sustainability, green finance, and net-zero emissions, underscoring Taiwan's commitment to aligning its market with international standards, all the while leading market participants in promoting the characteristics and advantages of Taiwan's market.</p>
<p>Following the meeting, the TWSE arranged one-on-one sessions with investors to delve into specific areas of interest, including ESG and trading systems. These sessions allowed the TWSE to actively respond to investor questions and gather feedback with a view of continuing to bolster investor confidence. The institutional investors attending the event responded positively to the resilience of Taiwan's economic fundamentals, its central role in the semiconductor and information and communications technology (ICT) industries, and the focus on the development of the ESG ecosystem. They also highly appreciated the authority and the TWSE for their attentive listening to investor opinions, proactive response, and thorough explanations on important issues of concern.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the TWSE will continue to encourage foreign investment opportunities and to promote the investment niche offered by Taiwan stocks, actively seeking feedback from global key institutional investors for the development of Taiwan market. Through these efforts, the TWSE aims to enhance Taiwan's international presence and deepen the investment community's understanding of the advantages and resilience of Taiwan's capital market.</p>

<ul>
<li><span><strong><span>FinTechs invited to provide solutions around Sustainable Finance Reporting, verification and disclosure requirements.</span></strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>PIMFA WealthTech, the market network and technology platform created with principal strategic partner Morningstar, a leading provider of independent investment insights, has today (5 March 2024) launched its latest&nbsp;<a href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fforms.office.com%2Fpages%2Fresponsepage.aspx%3Fid=-wLT0u8Kc0eUpXlQxvZKNSpVxXioBWJBmn47zo9GcWBUM09IMThPNlA0WkpLWVdXWkNJUkhUWjY3VS4u/1/0102018e0e89aeb4-c8ade75a-d0f4-4a5c-b9ec-608e645f77e5-000000/p04Ug3x4mmF_QZW-_nCIR6Lz0fA=364" target="_blank">&lsquo;Tech Sprint&rsquo;</a>&nbsp;this time focused on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors.</span></p>
<p><span>FinTechs active in this area are invited to participate in, and demonstrate how, their technologies and solutions can make a difference to ESG and sustainable finance reporting, verification and disclosure.</span></p>
<p><span>PIMFA WealthTech is seeking high-growth, market-innovating scale-up firms, which are typically post Seed/Series A funding. FinTechs should have a demonstrable minimum viable product and, ideally, already be engaged with the financial services sector, although this is not essential.</span></p>
<p><span>Participating FinTechs will need to demonstrate how Morningstar datasets can be incorporated within their respective solutions, with a preference for solutions that utilise APIs, Open Data and Artificial Intelligence (AI).</span></p>
<p><span>A briefing session for chosen FinTechs will be held on 20 March, and FinTechs will be invited to showcase their solutions at the&nbsp;<a href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fmorningstar.cventevents.com%2Fevent%2F1968e049-2913-4d37-8b37-a19ea7e242f3%2FregPage:4de01221-a090-41ff-afcf-7e4d7acf508a%3FRefid=WealthTech%26rp=c4d90cda-662b-4ac3-9f9d-075bb9540cd2/1/0102018e0e89aeb4-c8ade75a-d0f4-4a5c-b9ec-608e645f77e5-000000/iMXX3Zz8DVPInhROFrC1iScY3ls=364" target="_blank">Morningstar Investment Conference</a>&nbsp;on 1<sup>&nbsp;</sup>May.</span></p>
<p><span>ESG and sustainable finance are a priority area of focus not only for wealth managers and advice firms, but also the&nbsp;<a href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.fca.org.uk%2Fpublication%2Fpolicy%2Fps23-16.pdf/1/0102018e0e89aeb4-c8ade75a-d0f4-4a5c-b9ec-608e645f77e5-000000/k0p_pikmU_0Na3GEDlGgDwxU7ag=364" target="_blank">Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)</a>. PIMFA, the trade association for the wealth management, investment services and the investment and financial advice industry, is taking a leading role in supporting the development of new guidance in partnership with the FCA to ensure the information provided to consumers is clear and consistent and so as to eradicate, where possible, the detrimental impact of the phenomenon known as &lsquo;greenwashing&rsquo;.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.pimfa.co.uk%2Fpress-release%2Fwealth-managers-and-advisers-want-more-support-in-accessing-sustainable-finance-and-esg-investment-data-report-finds%2F/1/0102018e0e89aeb4-c8ade75a-d0f4-4a5c-b9ec-608e645f77e5-000000/IecWA3ztcxZuEk1nkrJmF6dZG40=364" target="_blank"><span>Research conducted by</span></a><span>&nbsp;PIMFA last year, conducted in association with Alpha FMC a specialist management consultancy for the wealth and asset management industries, indicates the ESG data market is becoming increasingly challenging for firms to navigate, that technology solutions in this area will become invaluable and that using innovative technology, such as AI could prove vital for integrating all aspects of ESG and sustainable finance into a firm's offering and operations. For example, where providers can help to aggregate, analyse and populate information needed for climate-related disclosures at an entity, product or consumer-facing level.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Morningstar and PIMFA WealthTech have over the past 12 months collaborated on a number of &lsquo;Tech Sprints&rsquo; to address common issues within the wealth management and advice sector where new technology could offer the most effective solution for all parties.</span></p>
<p><span>The first Tech Sprints in 2023 examined how customer-focused technology can be deployed to support the needs of wealth managers with the requirements of Consumer Duty. Subsequent Tech Sprints in late 2023 focused on how new technology and Fintech providers can support wealth managers and advisers with client profiling, onboarding and experience.</span></p>
<p><span>PIMFA WealthTech has been created to address digital business transformation through the development and adoption of market-leading technologies. As a digital marketplace and industry network. PIMFA WealthTech&rsquo;s objective is to drive innovation and enhance collaboration between FinTechs and wealth management and advice firms, operating an Advisory Council of leading wealth management and financial advice practitioners that cover all segments of the sector.</span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Richard Adler, Executive Director of PIMFA WealthTech, commented:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;</em>ESG and Sustainable Finance is a top priority for PIMFA members, with the recent FCA sustainability disclosure requirements and investment labels policy a key step for increasing trust in sustainable investments.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;The role technology can play in helping our members meet new requirements and serve their clients better has the potential to be enormous. We&rsquo;re delighted to be working with Morningstar on this important Tech Sprint and invite FinTechs in this space to participate and demonstrate to the wealth management industry the type of innovation and support they can offer.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Anastasia Georgiou, Director of Client Solutions, Adviser Segment, EMEA, Morningstar, commented:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;</em>We are proud to continue our longstanding strategic partnership with PIMFA WealthTech to showcase new technology solutions from FinTechs to the Wealth sector.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;Today, firms need to generate insights and ideas for sustainable investments and position new offerings in the market. This includes identifying innovative ways to address the challenge of harnessing the vast amount of data available which is needed to provide accurate reporting and disclosures. Along with PIMFA, Morningstar is proud to help promote new solutions to help firms identify ESG risks and create new opportunities for clients.&rdquo;</span></p>

<div> Keywords: Adenza integration, 2024 strategic priorities, capital allocation strategy, financial outlook, webcast<br />
Summary: Nasdaq reaffirms financial outlook, outlines 2024 priorities, focus on Adenza integration, leverage technology, accelerate revenue, and enhance shareholder value.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<ul>
<li><span>Highlights enhanced value-creation opportunity following strategic pivot to a platform business with a more scalable, recurring, and profitable revenue profile</span> </li>
<li><span>Reaffirms medium-term outlook and provides 2024 priorities, including progress made to achieve synergy and deleveraging targets associated with Adenza integration</span> </li>
<li><span>Expects to action approximately 70% of targeted&nbsp;$80 million&nbsp;in net expense synergies ahead of plan, by the end of 2024</span> </li>
<li><span>Details accelerated deleveraging plan with intent to reach a 4.0x leverage ratio nine to twelve months before &ndash; and a 3.3x leverage ratio at least six months before &ndash; previously announced targets</span> </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nasdaq (Nasdaq: NDAQ) today will host its Investor Day at&nbsp;8:00 AM ET, where&nbsp;
Adena Friedman, Chair and CEO,&nbsp;
Sarah Youngwood, Executive Vice President and CFO, and other members of the senior leadership team will detail the company&rsquo;s plans to deliver its next phase of resilient and scalable growth.</p>
<p>Nasdaq has reaffirmed its medium-term financial outlook and will outline its key 2024 priorities. Additionally, the company will discuss its financial framework and capital allocation strategy as well as highlight the benefits of its divisional structure, unified with a One Nasdaq go-to-market approach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nasdaq is the trusted fabric of the global financial system, providing market-leading platforms that enhance the liquidity, transparency, and integrity of the global economy. Over the past several years, we have continuously invested to create an integrated and durable growth platform with mission-critical capabilities to serve our clients even more holistically,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span>
Adena Friedman, Chair and CEO.</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Across our divisions, we are uniquely positioned to grow our share of a&nbsp;$31 billion&nbsp;serviceable addressable market opportunity and further reinforce our position as a trusted partner to the industry. We are confident this will unlock a new chapter of scalable, durable, and profitable growth that delivers significant value for our clients and shareholders.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Executing 2024 Strategic Priorities</span></p>
<p>Nasdaq will discuss its 2024 strategic priorities, which are designed to deliver performance in line with its medium-term outlook target ranges. The three key priorities are:</p>
<p><span>Integrate: Execute Adenza Integration</span></p>
<p>Following the completion of the acquisition, Adenza has already accelerated Nasdaq&rsquo;s growth story by expanding Nasdaq&rsquo;s total pro forma revenue, Solutions revenue, and non-GAAP operating margin. Nasdaq will continue to successfully integrate Adenza to expand its growth opportunities, unlock synergies, and drive operating leverage. The company expects to action approximately 70% of the targeted&nbsp;$80 million&nbsp;in net expense synergies ahead of plan, by the end of 2024, with a portion realized in 2024 and fully realized in 2025.</p>
<p><span>Innovate: Leverage Technology Infrastructure to Drive Innovation</span></p>
<p>Nasdaq&rsquo;s longstanding focus on embracing cloud workflows throughout its market infrastructure and software solutions, coupled with years of investment in AI, positions the company to benefit from the next wave of technology innovation. Nasdaq&rsquo;s modern, cloud-native applications and its unique, proprietary data, create a strong foundation to introduce generative AI capabilities that will enhance the value that the company can provide to its clients and can further Nasdaq&rsquo;s competitive position.</p>
<p><span>Accelerate: Unlock the Value of the Divisional Structure to Drive Incremental Revenue</span></p>
<p>The company will continue to accelerate the impact of its divisional structure and leverage its One Nasdaq strategy to create and deliver on new growth and revenue opportunities. Within its Financial Technology division, Nasdaq expects to achieve at least&nbsp;$100 million&nbsp;in incremental revenue through cross-sell opportunities by year-end 2027.</p>
<p><span>Enhancing Shareholder Value via a Disciplined Capital Allocation Strategy</span></p>
<p>Nasdaq will also provide details on its financial framework and capital allocation strategy. This strategy, which is fueled by strong free cash flow generation and capital discipline, will focus on four key actions:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Utilizing a disciplined ROIC-based framework to allocate investment capital​ to drive organic growth.</li>
<li>Accelerating its deleveraging plan, now targeting an estimated leverage ratio of 4.0x, nine to twelve months before Nasdaq&rsquo;s previously stated goal. Nasdaq expects to reach 3.3x, at least six months ahead of its previously stated goal.</li>
<li>Growing the dividend and progressing towards an annualized payout ratio of 35% to 38% by 2027. This includes raising the 2024 quarterly dividend by&nbsp;$0.02&nbsp;per share, to&nbsp;$0.24&nbsp;per share, which will be reflected in the&nbsp;June 2024&nbsp;dividend payment.</li>
<li>Offsetting dilution from employee vesting and mitigating dilution from the Adenza acquisition equity issuance over time, both through the company&rsquo;s previously announced Board authorized share repurchase program.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Reiterating Medium-Term Financial Outlook</span></p>
<p>Nasdaq will reaffirm its previously stated medium-term financial outlook:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Capital Access Platforms Revenue growth of 5% to 8%.</li>
<li>Financial Technology Revenue growth of 10% to 14%.</li>
<li>Total Solutions Revenue growth of 8% to 11%.</li>
<li>Non-GAAP Operating Expense growth of 5% to 8%.</li>
</ul>
<p>This outlook reflects a three-to-five-year period and assumes a stable market backdrop. The company will also reaffirm its 2024 non-GAAP operating expense guidance with a range of&nbsp;$2,105 million&nbsp;to&nbsp;$2,185 million&nbsp;and its 2024 non-GAAP tax rate guidance with a range of 24.5% to 26.5%.</p>
<p>Reconciliations of&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;GAAP to non-GAAP operating expense and tax rate guidance are not provided due to the inherent difficulty in quantifying certain amounts due to a variety of factors including the unpredictability in the movement in foreign currency rates, as well as future charges or reversals outside of the normal course of business.</p>
<p><span>Webcast and Materials</span></p>
<p>The agenda, slide presentation, and a live webcast are available on Nasdaq&rsquo;s investor relations website:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=oGtP8PE-lHitvvfwjh0K87pkvwxYWqn2QcTFPEDpwFAZ9HmE-O-pXHvp0xCB082-eFZ-HaPIZ8OGDqb--uHNzL1q3GipeswuxD0HNLRB7P4=" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://ir.nasdaq.com</a>.</p>

<div> Extension, Dutch National Regulatory Authority, Norwegian NRA, electricity cross-zonal risk hedging opportunities, coordinated decisions
<br />
The Dutch and Norwegian NRAs requested a six-month extension to assess and adopt coordinated decisions on electricity cross-zonal risk hedging opportunities.
<br /><br />Summary: 
ACM and NVE-RME requested a six-month extension to assess electricity cross-zonal hedging opportunities and coordinate decisions. ACER and ESA will reach a decision promptly. <div>
<p>On 18 February 2024, the Dutch National Regulatory Authority (NRA), Autoriteit Consument &amp; Markt (ACM), requested a six-month extension from ACER to adopt coordinated decisions with the Norwegian NRA, NVE-RME, on electricity cross-zonal risk hedging opportunities.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is it about?</span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>By February 2024, in accordance with the&nbsp;<a href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtSCFQJBVJdB0wMU1JVHVYKA1IdCggGVxoBBgZTUgIFBVMGAFMdAgEAAwsOB1sdAQ0EDh0GXABQGlQGAA8ZUQdRA1dXVFVZUFEERQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" target="_blank">Regulation on forward capacity allocation</a>, the Dutch and Norwegian NRAs were required to assess whether the electricity forward market in their respective bidding zone provides sufficient hedging opportunities. If these opportunities prove insufficient, the NRAs must take coordinated decisions to either introduce long-term transmission rights or task Transmission System Operators (TSOs) with implementing alternative measures to improve cross-zonal hedging opportunities.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;are the next steps?</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></p>
<p>ACER intends to act promptly on the ACM request, aiming to reach a decision in April 2024.</p>
<p>The EFTA Surveillance Authority (ESA) will decide on the extension request for NVE-RME, based on a draft from ACER, following the procedure of the Third Energy Package as outlined in the EEA Agreement. &nbsp;</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority To Investigate Use Of Personal Guarantees In Certain Small Business Lending</title>

<div> investigate, personal guarantees, small businesses, lending, FCA

Summary: The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) will investigate the use of personal guarantees by lenders for small businesses, collect data, review policies, and work with government departments. It aims to support small businesses' access to lending.<br /><br /> <div>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has today committed to investigate the use of personal guarantees by lenders to support loans to certain small businesses. The steps come in response to a super complaint from the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB).</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>The FSB has raised concerns that a growing demand for personal guarantees by lenders has a detrimental impact on small businesses, which they believe dissuades them from borrowing funds to grow. It has particular concerns about small limited companies. The FCA&rsquo;s remit, which is set by Parliament, does not include lending to limited companies. However, the work announced by the FCA today reflects its commitment to do what it can to support small businesses within its defined remit.</p>
<p>If the FCA&rsquo;s work identifies relevant information, it will share these with appropriate government departments &ndash; in particular the Treasury as it considers reforming the Consumer Credit Act.</p>
<p>The FCA will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collect data (from April-June 2024) to understand the number of personal guarantees in place for sole traders and small partnerships borrowing less than &pound;25,000.</li>
<li>Review a sample of firms&rsquo; policies and procedures to understand when personal guarantees are required for loans that come&nbsp;under the FCA&rsquo;s regulation.</li>
<li>Work with the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) to monitor the levels of complaints about this issue.</li>
<li>Consider whether lenders need further guidance&nbsp;on&nbsp;applying the FCA&rsquo;s rules and guidance within the Consumer Credit Sourcebook to situations where a personal guarantee is in place. If required, the FCA will consult on and publish guidance in the normal manner.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sheldon Mills, Executive Director of Consumers and Competition at the FCA, said:</p>
<p>'Small businesses are vital to the UK economy, and it is important that they can access lending to help them grow &ndash; so we welcome the FSB raising these issues. We will play our part to better understand whether lenders&rsquo; practices are causing unnecessary barriers to growth and, if necessary, act to remove any within our remit.</p>
<p>'That remit, set by Parliament, is limited when it comes to small businesses. If we identify issues outside our remit, we will make these public so that Parliament and policy makers can consider whether greater protection should be available to small businesses.'</p>
<p>This work might also be of value to Parliament and its relevant committees as and when they look at business banking and related issues.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Mike McCudden, CEO of JP Jenkins, commented:</span></p>

<p>This enhances market integrity and security. Crypto Finance, with its digital native capabilities in trading, settlement, and custody for crypto assets, will be a key part of the value chain.

Stijn Vander Straeten, CEO of Crypto Finance, states: &ldquo;As a well-established Swiss company with a strong commitment to regulatory compliance and delivering top-tier financial solutions, we have further strengthened our position with the introduction of Crypto Finance in Germany as the settlement agent and custodian. This marks a pivotal moment in our mission to cultivate a resilient and trusted digital asset ecosystem together with Deutsche B&ouml;rse, while also strengthening Crypto Finance's well-established and regulated custody and settlement offering in Germany.&rdquo;

<p>At the end of 2023 Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group reaffirmed within the Horizon 2026 strategy its objective to create a digital asset platform. In February, German regulator BaFin granted Crypto Finance (Deutschland) GmbH four licences which include regulated digital asset trading, settlement, and custody services in Germany. This was another precondition to start the platform, which had received a Multilateral Trading Facility (MTF) licence before already.</p>

<div> Infrastructure, fire prevention, financial resiliency, Securities and Exchange Commission, market resiliency
Summary:<br /><br />Infrastructure, fire prevention, and market resiliency are crucial in preventing financial "fires" like the Great Chicago Fire. The Securities and Exchange Commission works to enhance financial resiliency. <div>
<p><span>In 1871, a century and a half ago, as the story goes, Mrs. O'Leary's cow kicked over a lantern. That led to the Great Chicago Fire, which left over a hundred thousand people without homes and caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damages, and that's in 1871 dollars.</span></p>
<p>




</p>
<p>Now, what does Mrs. O'Leary's cow have to do with the Securities and Exchange Commission?</p>
<p>The Chicago fire was caused by so much more than bovine mischief. It was about building materials and incentives related to Chicago infrastructure. It was about fire prevention, firefighting equipment, building codes.</p>
<p>Chicagoans understood this. When they rebuilt their city, they did it with better infrastructure and standards to prevent fires from starting and then containing the spread. And such investments in resiliency were well worth it. Chicagoans have benefited ever since.</p>
<p>Well, the same is true in finance. History is full of times when fires in one corner of the financial system, or at one financial institution, spread across the broader economy.</p>
<p>And fires can come from either banks or non-banks. And when that happens, the American public, you and me alike, bystanders, just like those Chicagoans who saw their homes burn, inevitably get hurt, losing jobs, homes, businesses, mortgages, and more.</p>
<p>And that's why after a fire in the financial system, the 1929 Market Crash, the ensuing Great Depression, Franklin Roosevelt and Congress came together and established the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>And for 90 years since, Congress repeatedly has enhanced our authorities in the wake of subsequent financial fires. Promoting financial resiliency goes to the core of our three-part mission. It's the essence of fair, orderly, and efficient markets. You see, in normal times it helps promote trust in our capital markets. But in times of stress, it protects investors and issuers alike.</p>
<p>That's why we are updating our rules as technology and business models evolve.</p>
<p>In the U.S. Treasury markets, for instance, we recently adopted rules to promote central clearing in these markets.</p>
<p>We're also working on rules to register dealers, regulate trading platforms, promote greater transparency.</p>
<p>We finalized rules to enhance money market funds&rsquo; risk management.</p>
<p>We finalized rules to shorten the settlement cycle in equity markets, helping ensure that dollars and securities change hands more quickly, lowering risk.</p>
<p>We continue working on rulemaking initiatives to improve visibility into private funds, including hedge funds. It&rsquo;s through a form called &ldquo;Form PF.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We also have a number of cybersecurity projects to enhance market resiliency in the modern digital age.</p>
<p>It's a good thing when our markets can better prevent and withstand fires from cows or any other cause. It benefits investors and issuers alike when we beef up our market resiliency.</p>

Summary:<br />
The EBA launches a consultation on draft RTS for off-balance sheet items under CRR3, aiming to enhance the regulatory framework and risk control. <div>
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<ul>
<li class="body"><em>The EBA plays an important role in the implementation of the Basel III framework through the Banking Package in the EU.&nbsp;</em></li>
<li class="body"><em>These draft technical standards are part of the first phase of the EBA roadmap on the implementation of the EU Banking Package.</em></li>
<li class="body"><em>These draft technical standards will contribute to a more a robust regulatory framework, efficient supervision, and enhanced risk control by credit institutions.&nbsp;</em> </li>
</ul>
<br />
<p class="body">The European Banking Authority (EBA) today launched a public consultation on its draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) under the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR3) regarding off-balance sheet items under the standardised approach of credit risk. &nbsp;These RTS provide the criteria that institutions shall use to classify off-balance sheet items, unless explicitly specified in Annex 1 of the CRR. Further, they specify the factors that may constrain the institutions&rsquo; ability to cancel the unconditionally cancellable commitments. These RTS are part phase 1 of the&nbsp;EBA roadmap on the implementation of the EU banking package. The consultation runs until 4 June 2024.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Under the standardised approach of credit risk, the exposure values of off-balance exposure depend on the application of certain percentages, which in turn depend on a bucket classification. The CRR3 is set to introduce amendments to update the calibration of applicable percentages, which results in the introduction of an adjusted weighting scheme and an additional bucket, increasing the number of risk buckets from 4 to 5, and the conversion factor possibilities to 10%, 20%, 40%, 50% or 100%2. These RTS specifies the criteria that institutions shall use to classify off-balance sheet items, unless explicitly specified in the Level 1 text. Further, they specify factors that may constrain the institutions&rsquo; ability to cancel the unconditionally cancellable commitments.</p>
<h4>Consultation process</h4>
<p>Comments to this consultation can be sent to the EBA by clicking on the "send your comments" button on the consultation page. Please note that the deadline for the submission of comments is 4 June 2024.</p>
<p>The public hearing on these draft RTS will take place via conference call on Monday 22 April 2024 from 14.00 to 16.00 CEST. The EBA invites interested stakeholders to register using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/public-hearing-cp-regarding-crr3-article-1118-balance-sheet-exposures-under-standardised-approach" title="Public Hearing on the CP regarding CRR3 Article 111(8) on off-balance sheet exposures under the standardised approach of credit risk">this link</a>&nbsp;by 18 April 2024 at 16:00 CEST.</p>
<h4>Legal basis and background</h4>
<p>The draft RTS &nbsp;have been developed according to Article 111(8) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR), as amended by the CRR3.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><span>"Whilst installed capacity has remained same in the past few years, Transcorp Power has been able to steadily improve on its capacity utilization rate. In 2023, the Company&rsquo;s utilization rate stood at 78 per cent."</span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><span>The Group Chairman, Nigerian Exchange Group, Alhaji Dr. Umaru Kwairanga commended the listing of 7.5 billion ordinary shares of Transcorp Power on the Main Board of NGX, saying the listing was a testament to the resilience, innovation, and excellence within Nigeria's power sector.</span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><span>He added that it also underscores NGX's pivotal role in driving economic growth and development in our nation, saying "we as an Exchange are determined to ensure that all sectors of Nigeria&rsquo;s economy are fully represented on NGX and that the transparency, sustainability, ethical values, and private sector dynamism that drives the Exchange drives the economy."</span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><span>Kwairanga further said "with a market capitalization exceeding N1 trillion, Transcorp Power's entry into the public market represents a significant milestone, highlighting the increasing confidence and maturity of our capital market.</span></span><span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><span>"It is a clear signal of the transformative journey our energy sector has embarked upon, thanks to the Electric Power Sector Reform Act and subsequent market liberalization."</span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><span>The acting CEO of NGX, Jude Chiemeka stated that with Transcorp Power boasting a remarkable market capitalization of over N1 trillion, marking the first listing of the year, underscored the pivotal role NGX plays in shaping Nigeria&rsquo;s economic landscape.</span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><span>He added that NGX is not just a platform for trading stocks; &ldquo;it is a catalyst for economic growth and development, and we recognize our responsibility in supporting the government's privatization efforts, particularly within the energy sector.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><span>"The listing of Transcorp Power exemplifies our belief that NGX serves as a viable platform for the privatization of energy companies, driving efficiency, innovation, and sectoral growth," he said.</span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><span>Also, the Chief Finance Officer of Transcorp Power, Evans Okpogoro added that The Company's revenue has grown impressively over the past five years, driven by a surge in energy delivery and capacity charge, coupled with the lucrative expansion into international markets.</span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2"><span>Okpogoro explained that the Company has sustained and grown its EBITDA margins, thereby strengthening its pedigree as one of the leading power generation companies in Nigeria.</span></span></p>

<title>ISDA Publishes Whitepaper Charting The Next Phase Of India’s OTC Derivatives Market</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> whitepaper, India’s financial markets, OTC derivatives market, recommendations, ISDA <br />
Summary: <br />
- ISDA recommends market and policy initiatives to grow India's OTC derivatives market for economic development and risk management. <div>
<p>ISDA has published a new whitepaper that explores the growth of India&rsquo;s financial markets and makes a series of market and policy recommendations to encourage the further development of a safe and efficient over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market.</p>
<p>India&rsquo;s economy is expected to grow strongly in the coming years and is forecast to become the world&rsquo;s third largest by 2030. Despite this, the country&rsquo;s OTC derivatives market remains small, with average daily turnover of interest rate derivatives reported by sales desks in India accounting for just 0.1% of the overall global market in 2022, according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://data.bis.org/topics/DER/tables-and-dashboards/BIS,DER_D12_2,1.0">Bank for International Settlements</a>.</p>
<p>While Indian authorities have taken important steps to develop the country&rsquo;s derivatives market &ndash; notably, by passing legislation to ensure the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2020/09/25/netting-success-in-india/">enforceability of close-out netting</a>&nbsp;in 2020 &ndash; the whitepaper proposes several initiatives that industry participants and regulators could take to create deeper and more liquid domestic derivatives markets and enhance risk management practices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Derivatives are critical for healthy, competitive financial markets and help spur economic growth. They give companies the ability to raise financing at the best rate and manage their risks, enabling those firms to invest and grow. We commend the Indian authorities for taking important steps to develop their domestic derivatives markets, and our paper sets out additional recommendations that we hope the industry and regulators will consider,&rdquo; said Scott O&rsquo;Malia, ISDA&rsquo;s Chief Executive.</p>
<p>The recommendations are centered on five key pillars:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Broaden product development, innovation and diversification:</span>&nbsp;This includes developing standardized term benchmarks to reduce basis risk, expanding the scope of the credit derivatives market beyond the current limited universe of bonds, debentures and money market instruments, and enabling onshore OTC commodity and equity derivatives markets.</li>
<li><span>Foster adoption of similar market and risk principles across regulatory regimes:&nbsp;</span>ISDA recommends the rules governing the use of derivatives by various market participants be aligned. In particular, the rules relating to the use of OTC interest rate and credit derivatives should be harmonized.</li>
<li><span>Enhance market access and diversification of participants in the OTC derivatives market:</span>&nbsp;Regulators and industry participants should work together to develop skills and expertise across the market by holding targeted educational and awareness initiatives.</li>
<li><span>Ensure growth in a safe and efficient manner:</span>&nbsp;ISDA believes initial margin requirements for non-cleared derivatives should be aligned with global standards to ensure domestic markets are safe and efficient. This includes allowing full substituted compliance for Indian branches of foreign banks and expanding the list of eligible collateral.</li>
<li><span>Encourage greater alignment with international principles and practices:</span>&nbsp;Domestic rules should be aligned with international standards wherever possible to increase harmonization and encourage international participation and investment. For example, ISDA recommends the Reserve Bank of India adopt the standardized approach for measuring counterparty credit risk, bringing bank capital rules in India in line with standards developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The paper and full list of recommendations is available&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/03/04/charting-the-next-phase-of-indias-otc-derivatives-market/">here</a>.</p>

<title>UK Companies House Begins Phased Roll Out Of New Powers To Tackle Fraud</title>

<div> Powers, Companies House, ECCT Act, measures, offences
Summary:
Companies House gains new powers under ECCT Act to improve data quality, tackle misuse, and remove inaccurate information. New rules and penalties aim to combat economic crime. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>From today, Companies House has new and enhanced powers to improve the quality and reliability of its data and tackle misuse of the companies register.</p>
<p>The first measures under the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023 (&ldquo;ECCT Act&rdquo;) came into force on Monday 4 March, 2024.</p>
<p>Changes introduced today include:</p>
<ul>
<li>greater powers to query information and request supporting evidence</li>
<li>stronger checks on company names</li>
<li>new rules for registered office addresses. All companies must have an appropriate address at all times. They will not be able to use a PO Box as their registered office address</li>
<li>a requirement for all companies to supply a registered email address</li>
<li>a requirement for subscribers to confirm they&rsquo;re forming a company for a lawful purpose when they incorporate, and for a company to confirm its intended future activities will be lawful on its confirmation statement</li>
<li>greater powers to tackle and remove factually inaccurate information</li>
<li>the ability to share data with other government departments and law enforcement agencies.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>New criminal offences and civil penalties will complement the measures introduced today.</p>
<p>Our priority is cleansing the register to remove details of those appointed without consent.</p>
<p><strong>Companies House CEO Louise Smyth said:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;These new and enhanced powers are the most significant change for Companies House in our 180-year history.</li>
<li>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve known for some time that criminals have misused UK companies to commit fraud, money laundering and other forms of economic crime.</li>
<li>&ldquo;As we start to crack down on abuse of the register, we are prioritising cases where people&rsquo;s names and addresses have been used without their consent. It will now be much quicker and easier to report and remove personal information that has been misused.</li>
<li>&ldquo;This will make a real difference to individuals.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Business Minister Kevin Hollinrake said:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Companies House now have the tools to take a much harder line on criminals who take advantage of the UK&rsquo;s open economy and can now ensure the reputation of our businesses is not tarnished by the UK playing host to the world&rsquo;s scammers.</li>
<li>&ldquo;The new reforms, which come into effect today, provide further protection to the public from companies fraudulently using their address and will begin to remove the smoke and mirrors around companies hiding behind false information. This will enhance the UK&rsquo;s reputation as a great and safe place to do business.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The phased roll out of new powers and requirements is designed to minimise hassle for legitimate businesses. Many of the changes will be integrated into existing reporting cycles, such as the requirement to update a company&rsquo;s confirmation statement.</p>
<p>As further measures are introduced, we will let people who file information with Companies House know what they need to do to via our communications channels and campaigns.</p>

<div> Meeting, IFRS Foundation, IASB, ISSB, Monitoring Board
Summary:<br /><br />The IFRS Foundation Monitoring Board discussed IASB and ISSB activities, emphasized equal importance, support for ISSB standards, and reviewed members' compliance. <div>
<p>During last week&rsquo;s meeting of the IFRS Foundation Monitoring Board in Madrid, Spain, the Monitoring Board discussed the activities of the Trustees of the IFRS Foundation, including their oversight responsibilities of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB). The meeting was joined by the members of the Trustees of the IFRS Foundation under the leadership of Erkki Liikanen, Chair of the Trustees, and also Andreas Barckow, Chair of the IASB, and Emmanuel Faber, Chair of the ISSB.</p>
<p>The Monitoring Board was informed of the ongoing activities of the IFRS Foundation under the new &lsquo;Two Standard Setting Boards (SSBs) under One Foundation&rsquo; model. In response, the Monitoring Board continued to convey its expectations on:</p>
<ul>
<li>connectivity between the financial statements and sustainability-related disclosures, while ensuring mutual independence and balanced resource allocation for their standard setting process. In this context, the Monitoring Board welcomed the progress made by the IFRS Foundation, including the first joint meeting of the IASB and ISSB in January 2024;</li>
<li>further exploration of effective functioning of the multi-location model<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;to maximize the potentials of the two SSBs under the leadership of the Trustees of the IFRS Foundation.</li>
<li>stable and diversified funding to support the work of the two SSBs.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the activities of each SSB, the Monitoring Board reiterated the equal importance of the work of both the IASB and ISSB.</p>
<p>The Monitoring Board recognized significant efforts made by the IFRS Foundation to support the implementation of the ISSB Standards, including the publication of the Preview of the Inaugural　Adoption Guide in February 2024. The Monitoring Board members unanimously called for the IFRS Foundation to continue the constructive and close discussions with the regulators to continue progress toward the shared goal of the global framework for sustainability-related financial information by having jurisdictions adopt, apply or be informed by the ISSB standards.</p>
<p>The Monitoring Board also appreciated that the strategic directions of both the IASB and ISSB are under consideration: the IASB is reviewing its strategy for the next decade, while the ISSB is discussing the next priorities following a Request for Information which was issued to stakeholders. The Monitoring Board will continue to engage with the Trustees on these matters.</p>
<p>The Monitoring Board reconfirmed that ensuring robust due process is the core function of the IFRS Foundation and encouraged continued efforts in this area.</p>
<p>Finally, the Monitoring Board completed its periodic review of existing members against the agreed membership criteria in its Charter<sup>2</sup>. The Monitoring Board concluded that no member had been found non-compliant with the criteria. The Monitoring Board will conduct a further review in five years&rsquo; time.</p>
<p>Takashi Nagaoka, Chairman of the IFRS Monitoring Board and Deputy Commissioner for International Affairs of Japan Financial Services Agency said:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;As Monitoring Board Chair, I am proud to host a joint meeting together with the Chair of the IFRS Foundation Trustees, providing an opportunity for the Monitoring Board members to have a dialogue with the Foundation at this critical moment for the consideration of the ways forward to implement the ISSB Standards as well as the strategic directions of the IASB and ISSB.</em></p>
<p><em>On behalf of my fellow Monitoring Board members, I would like to express my gratitude to Lee White, outgoing Managing Director of the IFRS Foundation, who has served for six years as a critical hub connecting the activities of the Foundation to the varied stakeholders including the Monitoring Board. I also thank Erkki Liikanen, the Chair of the Trustees, for his great leadership in steering the Foundation and congratulate him on his reappointment to serve a third term.&rdquo;</em></p>

<title>ICE Mortgage Monitor: First-Time Homebuyers Make Up Record 47% Of GSE Purchase Loans, 39% Of All GSE Securitizations In 2023</title>

<div> eMBS, first-time homebuyers, agency securities, refinance, mortgage market
Summary:<br />First-time homebuyers dominated 2023's mortgage market, with high DTIs and credit scores. Refinance activity surged as rates dropped, but servicers struggled to retain borrowers.<br /> <div>
<div class="bw-subheadline-wrapper">
<ul>
<li>Though originations hit a 30-year low in 2023, ICE eMBS data shows first-time homebuyers (FTHB) made up the highest share of agency purchase security issuance in at least 10 years</li>
<li>In 2023&rsquo;s 80%+ purchase-driven market, FTHBs account for an exceptionally high share (44%) of overall agency securities issuance, raising the specter of performance risk for MBS investors</li>
<li>The impact is most pronounced among GSE securities, in which FTHB purchase loans account for 39% of all 2023 issuance, a 12 pp higher share than any other vintage in the past decade</li>
<li>ICE data shows FTHBs have higher average front-end debt-to-income (DTI) ratios, but back-end DTIs similar to repeat buyers, spending more on housing but less on other forms of debt</li>
<li>While demand in the mortgage market continues to track closely with interest rate movements, recent periods of easing have highlighted the potential for a rebound in refinance lending if rates move lower</li>
<li>With the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ice.com/fixed-income-data-services/index-solutions/mortgage-rate-lock-indices" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">ICE US Conforming 30-year Fixed Mortgage Rate Lock Index</a><span>&nbsp;showing January rates averaging 6.6%, rate/term refis returned to make up 24% of the month&rsquo;s refinance activity, a nearly two year high</span></li>
<li><a href="https://www.icemortgagetechnology.com/resources/data-reports/february-2024-mortgage-monitor" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">As noted last month</a><span>, industry rate predictions would have millions of recent borrowers in the money for a refi by the end of 2024, yet servicers&rsquo; retention of such borrowers hit a 17-year low in Q4 2023</span></li>
<li>According to ICE Market Trends data, the number of days from rate lock to close matched a 4.5 year low in January, shortening secondary market hedging times</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE:ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, released its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.icemortgagetechnology.com/resources/data-reports" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">March 2024 ICE Mortgage Monitor Report</a>, based on the company&rsquo;s industry-leading mortgage, real estate and public records data sets. Drawing from ICE&rsquo;s eMBS agency securities database and ICE Market Trends originations data, the report notes just 4.3 million mortgages were originated in 2023, the fewest in the 30 years ICE has been tracking the metric.</p>
<p>Andy Walden, ICE Vice President of Enterprise Research Strategy, explains that one byproduct of such low volumes is a significantly altered makeup of recent agency mortgage-backed security (MBS) issuance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since 1995, only two quarters have seen fewer than 1 million first lien mortgages originated,&rdquo; Walden said. &ldquo;The first was Q1 2023, and Q4 the second. Looking back, last year&rsquo;s market was dominated by purchase lending, with loans to buy homes making up 82% of a historically low number of originations. While it remains a tough market for prospective purchasers, our eMBS agency securities database revealed that first-time homebuyers actually made up 55% of all agency purchase mortgages last year. That&rsquo;s the highest share in the 10 years we&rsquo;ve been tracking the metric.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In fact, FTHB purchase loans accounted for an exceptionally high share of all issuance activity last year. They made up 39% of all GSE securitizations in 2023 &ndash; 12 percentage points higher than any other vintage in the past decade. The market in which these folks purchased their first home was one of record house prices, ballooning down payments, rising rates and elevated DTIs. Given record exposure to first-time homebuyer loans, it&rsquo;ll be worth watching the performance of this cohort very closely moving forward, particularly for those invested in 2023 agency MBS.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leveraging ICE Market Trends origination data sheds further light on FTHB trends. While on average, FTHBs have higher front-end DTIs than repeat buyers, their back-end DTIs are more comparable. FTHBs spend a greater share of their income on housing than repeat buyers but pay less on other forms of debt in comparison. While credit scores remain elevated among conventional purchase loans overall, the average FTHB has a 9-point lower credit score than the average repeat buyer. The delta widens among VA purchase loans, with the average FTHB credit score (709) in January 23 points below that of the average repeat buyer (732). Interestingly, FHA loans, the choice for many lower credit score buyers, have broadly the same average credit scores among both first time and repeat buyers.</p>
<p>Demand in the mortgage market continues to closely follow rate movements and remains largely purchase driven. With interest rates averaging 6.6% for the month according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ice.com/fixed-income-data-services/index-solutions/mortgage-rate-lock-indices" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">ICE US Conforming 30-year Fixed Mortgage Rate Lock Index</a>, rate/term refinances &ndash; which have been effectively nonexistent for some time &ndash; made up 24% of January refinance activity, the highest such share in nearly two years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We noted last month that if industry rate projections hold firm, we could see a mini surge of refi activity around the 2023 vintage by the end of 2024,&rdquo; Walden continued. &ldquo;Even the relatively slight rate pullbacks of December and January spurred a growing number of homeowners to refinance. Demand is clearly there when rates cross certain thresholds and, if current rate forecasts hold true, we expect that demand to increase throughout the year. Unfortunately, when it comes to retaining the business of refinancing homeowners, the industry has a lot of ground to make up. Servicers retained just one of every five such borrowers in Q4 2024, a 17-year low.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Providing an exemplary servicing experience is critical to reversing this trend, as is effectively identifying and engaging with customers likely to refinance. And when they have the opportunity to serve that customer, lenders need to be sure the front-end of the process is smooth as well. To that point, we did see the number of days from rate lock to close hit a 4.5 year low in January. In addition to enhancing the consumer experience, that also reduces hedging timelines. Those dynamics are tied tightly to the rate environment and can turn on a dime. Should rates fall, and the market shifts more heavily to refis, hedging times could increase as well &ndash; raising associated hedge duration risk. Industry participants would do well to develop a deep understanding the complexities of this evolving market to capitalize on opportunity and minimize risk.&rdquo;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Nigerian Exchange Group Plc (NGX Group or the Company) is pleased to announce its full-year Audited Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2023, with a profit after tax of N5.2 billion and a declaration of a final dividend of N1.5 billion.</p>
<p>The Group experienced a surge in gross earnings, rising by 57.4% to N11.8 billion in FY 2023 from N7.5 billion in FY 2022. This growth was attributed to performances in core revenue and other income segments. Notably, transaction fees rose by 52.6%, driven by increased trading activities, while listing fees and rental income increased by 42.2% and 41.8%, respectively. Strategic investments also contributed to a 5.4% boost in treasury investment income.</p>
<p>Other income, representing 29.7% of gross earnings, witnessed an unprecedented rise of 163.6%, reaching N3.504 billion. Key contributors to this surge were market data income, which increased by 44.1%, and an exceptional 304.8% rise in other operating income.</p>
<p>In light of the robust operational performance, the Board approved a final dividend of N1.5 billion at 75 Kobo per share for the year ended 31st December 2023.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> licensed virtual asset trading platforms, suspicious websites, online investment scams, SFC, Hong Kong Police Force
Summary:<br /> SFC warns against impersonation of licensed virtual asset trading platforms, reports fund withdrawal difficulties, urges public to verify legitimacy. <br /> <div>
<p>The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) today warned the public against suspicious websites impersonating two licensed virtual asset trading platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li>HSKEX, which impersonates Hash Blockchain Limited, operates at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hskexpro.com/" target="_blank">https://www.hskexpro.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://hskex.com/" target="_blank">https://hskex.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hskexs.com/" target="_blank">https://www.hskexs.com</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://hskexit.com/" target="_blank">https://hskexit.com/</a>; and</li>
<li><a href="https://www.oslexu.com/" target="_blank">www.oslexu.com</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://oslint.com/" target="_blank">www.oslint.com</a>&nbsp;impersonate OSL Digital Securities Limited.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The above-mentioned websites were posted on the SFC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sfc.hk/en/alert-list/suspicious-virtual-asset-trading-platforms" target="_blank">Suspicious Virtual Asset Trading Platforms Alert List</a>&nbsp;on 4 March 2024 following reports on fund withdrawal difficulties.&nbsp; Victims also said they were asked to pay exorbitant &ldquo;fees and taxes&rdquo; to withdraw their funds from the websites.&nbsp; At the SFC&rsquo;s request, the Hong Kong Police Force has taken steps to block access to relevant websites (Note 1).</p>
<p>The SFC once again reminds the public that online investment scams may involve any type of assets and are perpetrated through multiple channels, including social media and instant messaging apps.&nbsp; Investors should stay vigilant and verify the legitimacy of a virtual asset trading platform before making any transactions.</p>
<p>The SFC urges the public to make use of the SFC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://apps.sfc.hk/publicregWeb/searchByName?locale=en" target="_blank">Public Register of Licensed Persons and Registered Institutions</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sfc.hk/en/Welcome-to-the-Fintech-Contact-Point/Virtual-assets/Virtual-asset-trading-platforms-operators/Lists-of-virtual-asset-trading-platforms" target="_blank">List of licensed virtual asset trading platforms</a>&nbsp;for up-to-date information on licensed entities, including their official websites. &nbsp;Investors should also refrain from sending money or making any transactions before verifying the counterparty&rsquo;s identity.</p>
<p>Note:</p>
<ol>
<li>At the time the SFC requested the Hong Kong Police Force to block access to the relevant websites, the websites impersonating OSL Digital Securities Limited were already inaccessible.&nbsp; Hence, the SFC only requested the Hong Kong Police Force to block access to the websites impersonating Hash Blockchain Limited.</li>

<ul>
<li>The total market capitalization of the Equities Market at the end of 2023 was RUB 58.1 trln (USD 647.3 bln). Fee and commission income from the Equities Market was up 113.2%, while trading volumes grew by 30.9%. The discrepancy between fee income and trading volumes dynamics is largely explained by the introduction of a new asymmetric tariff structure that came into effect in November 2022.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Fee income from the Bond Market increased by 67.6% while trading volumes (excluding placements of overnight bonds) improved by 60.1%. Primary market volumes (excluding placements of overnight bonds) were up 45.2%, mostly driven by elevated corporate borrowing activity. Secondary market trading volumes grew by 74.6%. Effective fee dynamics were supported by the tariff optimization that came into effect at the beginning of 2023 as well as the migration of volumes to value-added CCP-based trading modes.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Fee income from the FX Market increased by 30.4%. Trading volumes were up 22.5%. Spot volumes added 7.5%, while swap volumes grew by 31.4%. The effective fee dynamics is explained by two opposing&nbsp;factors: [1] the asymmetric tariff structure favoring liquidity makers on the spot market that came into effect on August&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2022, [2] a shift in the volumes&rsquo; mix towards the less profitable swap segment.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Money Market fee income was up 26.0%. Trading volumes grew by 24.5%. GCC-repo volumes surged by 68.1% to reach nearly RUB 224 trln. CCP repo trading volumes added 35.1%.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Derivatives Market fee income increased by 79.2%. The trading volume stood virtually flat, adding just 3.7%. The discrepancy between fee income and volume dynamics was the result of a shift in volumes&rsquo; mix towards value-added commodity derivatives and the new asymmetric tariff structure implemented in June 2022.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Fee income from the Depository and Settlement Services grew by 24.5%. The growth was primarily explained by a 19.9% increase in the average value of assets under custody. The discrepancy between the growth rates of F&amp;C income and assets on deposit is the result of business lines beyond safekeeping, primarily clearing and collateral management services, which are the reflection of repo operations at the NSD.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>IT Services, Listing and other fee income line was largely driven by Finuslugi revenues. Sale of software and tech. services improved by 34.0% driven by tariffs revision and the introduction of low-latency protocols for market data distribution &ndash; SIMBA ASTS and FIFO TWIME ASTS &ndash; to Equities and FX Markets. Listing and other services grew by 26.6% as primary market activity in equities and bonds recovered. Sales of information services rose by 20.7%, primarily on the back of RUB depreciation during the year. Finuslugi revenues surged by 141.7% as the business unit develops new features and keeps onboarding new clients. Other fee income shrank by 66.1% as base period revenues included additional fees on EUR balances of 0.2 p.p. above the non-positive ECB rate.</li>

<div> supply and demand, inflation, pandemic, employment, Federal Reserve<br />
Summary:<br />Supply and demand imbalances, inflation, and employment illustrate the complex relationship and tradeoffs in pursuing the Federal Reserve's dual mandate. <div>
<p>Thank you, Mark, and thank you for the opportunity to be part of the discussions today.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;For more than 40 years, the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research has assisted economic policymakers by producing sharp analysis and fostering the kind of constructive dialogue reflected in today's agenda.</p>
<p>My topic today is the Federal Reserve's dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices&mdash;and, specifically, the tradeoffs that sometimes arise when pursuing these two objectives. I say "sometimes" because there have been times and certain economic conditions in which such tradeoffs did not arise&mdash;or at least were not apparent. This distinction is an important one, especially when considering the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)'s recent progress in reducing high inflation while the labor market has remained strong. Better understanding the tradeoffs, or lack thereof, in pursuing the dual mandate will help researchers and policymakers draw lessons from these welcome recent developments.</p>
<p><strong>History of the Inflation&ndash;Unemployment Tradeoff</strong><br />In 1977, Congress legislated the Federal Reserve's "dual mandate," under which the FOMC is required to pursue both maximum employment and stable prices, with both objectives on an equal footing.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;At the outset, it is worth stressing that these goals are generally complementary, and I will return to this point shortly. But when they are not complementary, one way to think of the policy problem is in terms of tradeoffs: Maximum employment is the highest level of employment that will not cause inflation to escalate significantly above levels consistent with price stability.</p>
<p>Before going into those tradeoffs, I want to emphasize that achieving the Committee's employment goal on an ongoing basis rests on achieving price stability. Price stability enables long-lasting economic expansions, which strengthen the labor market and expand employment opportunities. This process particularly benefits families and communities that all too often have been left behind.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a></p>
<p>But it is appropriate to recognize also that tradeoffs between the goals of maximum employment and price stability can occur in the short term. Indeed, the potential shorter-term tradeoff between unemployment and inflation has long featured prominently among the economic considerations of policymakers. Government action to boost employment through fiscal or monetary stimulus has historically tended to increase aggregate spending and inflation, too. On the contrary, actions to reduce inflation by shifting to contractionary fiscal or monetary policy have tended to slow economic activity and raise unemployment, or at least slow the pace of job creation.</p>
<p>The idea of a short-run tradeoff is reflected in the original specification of the "Phillips curve," named after New Zealand economist A.W. Phillips, who plotted historical values of the United Kingdom's unemployment rate and growth in nominal wages between 1861 and 1957, showing an often inverse relationship between the two. Although the Phillips curve was initially specified in terms of wages, later versions have more typically compared unemployment with price inflation.</p>
<p>Taken at face value, a tradeoff between keeping employment high and reducing inflation would seem to present policymakers with a dilemma. It suggests that when inflation is well above levels associated with price stability, policymakers must engineer a significant increase in unemployment to bring inflation down. Disinflation can be especially challenging when expectations of future inflation are high.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;We saw this in the 1970s and 1980s. Convincing households and businesses that the FOMC was committed to reducing inflation required accepting a protracted, though ultimately temporary, period of high unemployment, as then Fed Chair Paul Volcker came to believe. Volcker is widely credited with ending the "Great Inflation" experienced at the time through his willingness to induce a punishing recession. He lowered inflation and kept it down, in substantial part by convincing the public that the Fed would keep inflation in check whatever the cost, thereby lowering expectations of future inflation.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a></p>
<p>While long experience shows that there can be a tradeoff between policy actions to pursue maximum employment and stable prices, there are times and conditions when this is not the case, or at least when there is little evidence of a tradeoff. For example, for most of the decade after the Great Recession, FOMC policy was, by some measures at least, highly accommodative, yet inflation ran consistently below the Committee's 2 percent target. So when inflation is below target and employment is below maximum sustainable levels, accommodative policy can be used to pursue both sides of the mandate.</p>
<p>Academic economists have debated for decades about the circumstances in which the tradeoff applies. One strand of the research literature proposes that a central bank can indeed achieve good economic outcomes by focusing on a single mandate, an inflation target, and that policies to promote stable prices can also secure low unemployment. In this view, stabilization of inflation ensures that the economy performs at its optimal level, with firms producing just the right amount such that no resources, including workers, are left on the sidelines. This theory fits in a world in which the economy is driven by demand&mdash;in such a case, shocks coming from the demand side of the economy can be offset by monetary policy, which works via aggregate demand.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a></p>
<p>But in the real world&mdash;which is not so simple&mdash;demand shocks are not the only forces that can drive economic fluctuations. Supply shocks not only exist, but they can also be large and persistent, as we have learned over the past several years. Adverse supply shocks, just like higher inflation expectations, make managing the tradeoff between inflation and unemployment more difficult and costly. While a sharp reduction in demand reduces both economic activity and inflation, a sharp reduction in supply, such as a sudden loss of global oil supply, increases inflation and reduces economic activity. Trying to combat inflation by raising interest rates would further reduce economic activity and employment, while reducing interest rates to boost economic activity and employment raises inflation even higher. Therefore, counteracting a persistent supply shock with monetary policy tools may help with one side of the mandate but create even larger deviations from the other side of the mandate.</p>
<p><strong>Inflation and Unemployment in the Pandemic and Its Aftermath</strong><br />Let me now turn to the pandemic experience. Inflation picked up in 2021, and by mid-2022, 12-month inflation, based on personal consumption expenditures (PCE), hit 7 percent, well above the FOMC's 2 percent target. It was the most significant surge in inflation since the 1970s, prompting fears that it could raise expectations of future inflation and make getting inflation down again require a steep tradeoff&mdash;that is, much higher unemployment.</p>
<p>One more specific concern was that a so-called wage&ndash;price spiral would emerge, as may have been the case for a time in the 1970s. In a tight labor market, expectations of continued high inflation can lead workers trying to maintain their living standards to demand higher raises. In a context of strong aggregate demand, firms will likely grant the wage increases to retain their workers&mdash;then pass through the resulting cost increase as higher prices. To avoid a continuing spiral, demand and supply in labor and product markets must be rebalanced&mdash;through lower aggregate demand, greater aggregate supply, or both.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;If achieving this balance requires a drastic reduction in aggregate demand, then sustainably taming inflation could require a high cost in terms of the employment mandate. Fortunately, we appear to have avoided a wage&ndash;price spiral this time, as I will discuss later.</p>
<p>As inflation rose and began to appear persistent, the FOMC rightly focused on restoring price stability, knowing that without price stability, the economy would not work for anyone and that high inflation would ultimately undermine the strength of the labor market. While interest rates rose rapidly, some feared that the cost of disinflation would be persistently elevated unemployment. But over the past year or so, that tradeoff has been much less evident than many feared. We have seen inflation cool significantly, falling more rapidly than at any time since the 1980s. Yet unemployment remains near the lowest levels seen only a few times since the 1960s.</p>
<p>How have we managed to avoid the familiar tradeoff during this period and see such welcome outcomes on both the inflation and employment fronts? I would propose a few possible reasons. These center on the fact that the pandemic inflation featured both supply and demand shocks. In the limited time that I have today, I don't propose to get into the debate about exactly how much of the recent inflation can be explained by supply as opposed to demand. But I will discuss how both demand and supply forces have been important in the rise and fall in the inflation rate.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a></p>
<p>The pandemic caused a significant reduction in supply in some areas of the economy. Limits on the supply of goods resulted from restricted output in many industries. Consider a key U.S. manufacturing industry, auto production. In 2019, the U.S. manufactured 10-1/2 million light vehicles. In 2020, production plunged to 8-1/2 million, with pandemic-related plant shutdowns followed by worldwide shortages of computer chips and other parts.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;It has taken the industry a long time to recover&mdash;auto production was less than 9 million in 2021 and a bit under 10 million in 2022. Constrained vehicle supply played a big role in boosting auto prices. And it wasn't just motor vehicles; for example, you might recall reports of food processing plant shutdowns, and many other goods-producing industries also suffered from "lost output." U.S. industrial production dropped at the onset of the pandemic and then remained below its pre-pandemic level until early 2022 despite strong demand for physical goods; indeed, evidence shows that output was held down by insufficient supply of materials.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a></p>
<p>But supply problems were not limited to goods; indeed, insufficient supply of labor has also been widely cited by businesses as having held down output. Labor supply was suddenly and severely limited early in the pandemic as workers voluntarily and, in some cases, involuntarily stayed out of the workplace. The labor force did not recover to pre-pandemic levels until mid-2022. Older workers, in particular, left the labor market in large numbers. But even many prime-age workers&mdash;those between the ages of 25 and 54&mdash;withdrew because of school disruptions and health concerns, and prime-age labor force participation remained below its pre-pandemic level until early 2023. A slowdown in immigration, likewise, deprived the economy of a customary source of labor supply growth, as did elevated mortality due to COVID-19.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a></p>
<p>Fortunately, these supply shortages for both goods and labor have mostly dissipated. For example, auto production in 2023 nearly regained its 2019 level, and industrial production as well as various goods supply indicators have returned closer to their pre-pandemic levels. Congestion in logistics and transportation networks eased, and firms sometimes found alternative supply chain networks.</p>
<p>In the labor market, shortages directly related to the pandemic have eased, helping restore labor force participation, likely in part because of the reopening of schools, progress with the health situation, and help from childcare subsidies and other policies. Increased capabilities for remote work, allowing for a decoupling between firm and worker location, expanded the pool of available workers and jobs. More broadly, strong labor demand has enticed more workers into the labor market to the point that labor force participation among prime-age workers is now above pre-pandemic levels. And immigration has rebounded as well.</p>
<p>Another, more subtle source of labor market supply recovery has been improvements in the quality of matches between firms and workers. At any time, a crucial factor that affects labor supply is how well the skills of available workers fulfill the needs of employers. With labor in many sectors in short supply and very high numbers of job openings, many workers quit their jobs to move to new ones. Economists generally believe that increased labor turnover improves worker&ndash;firm matches&mdash;workers find jobs that make better use of their skills, typically with higher pay, and firms find workers that are better suited for their businesses and are more productive at their jobs. Economic expansions, such as the one that has continued since April 2020, present more opportunities for workers to find a good match.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a>&nbsp;And it appears that workers and firms were pretty efficient at finding each other over the past couple of years, likely upgrading the average quality of a job match in the process.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a>&nbsp;Higher-quality job&ndash;worker matches improve the productivity of workers, serving like a boost to labor supply.</p>
<p>If reductions in supply contributed to inflation, then recovery of that supply would help lower inflation, too. Supply improvements in the goods sector have helped ease inflation starting in early 2022; for example, in January, the 12-month growth of new motor vehicle prices was less than 1 percent, far slower than its peak pace above 13 percent in the spring of 2022. More broadly, the overall price level for core PCE goods, which excludes food and energy, was fairly flat last year and has actually declined in recent months.</p>
<p>On the labor side, supply recovery has likely contributed to disinflation by helping to ease the pace of wage growth&mdash;especially in the labor-intensive services industries.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn14" title="footnote 14"><span>14</span></a><a name="f14"></a>&nbsp;For private services as a whole, 12-month nominal wage growth, as measured by average hourly earnings, was 4.5 percent in January, down from its peak of 5.9 percent in early 2022. And, sure enough, price inflation in services has also slowed: In core PCE services&mdash;which accounts for roughly three-fourths of core PCE&mdash;12-month inflation was 4.1 percent in January, down from its peak of 5.8 percent early last year.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn15" title="footnote 15"><span>15</span></a><a name="f15"></a></p>
<p>But supply is not the only factor behind the slowing of inflation. Policies affecting aggregate demand have played a role as well. On the fiscal side, measures of the impact of government spending on economic growth turned negative in 2021 after being strongly supportive in 2020.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn16" title="footnote 16"><span>16</span></a><a name="f16"></a>&nbsp;And in terms of monetary policy, the FOMC's actions in late 2021 indicated a sooner-than-previously-anticipated start to policy rate increases, with the FOMC beginning to raise the target range for the federal funds rate in March 2022. After that, the Committee tightened its stance of policy expeditiously. The result can be seen especially in areas of the economy that are sensitive to financial conditions. The housing sector saw a significant slowdown, with residential investment declining more than 15 percent in 2022 and remaining flat in 2023. Growth of investment in equipment was tepid last year, likely due in part to restrictive financial conditions, even as we have seen growth in manufacturing construction for semiconductors and electric vehicle batteries that will help address remaining supply-side bottlenecks.</p>
<p>Aside from these examples of subdued spending in policy-sensitive sectors, we can also see the imprint of monetary policy in the anchoring of inflation expectations. Even amid high inflation, households, businesses, and financial markets believed that inflation would eventually return to its target pace. These beliefs were guided by the FOMC's actions: By raising policy rates expeditiously and communicating clearly, the Committee demonstrated its resolve to lower inflation to 2 percent and its commitment to the price-stability mandate. Anchored inflation expectations are apparent, for example, in the popular University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers. Expectations of inflation for the period covering the next 5 to 10 years have remained relatively stable over the pandemic and close to levels seen before the pandemic. And shorter-term expectations rose in 2021 but have come back down recently.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn17" title="footnote 17"><span>17</span></a><a name="f17"></a>&nbsp;Anchored inflation expectations likely matter for actual price setting. That is what modern theories of the Phillips curve suggest. And the relevance of that theoretical expectation has been suggested by surveys reported by Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond staff: The data show a close relationship between firms' expectations for overall inflation and those firms' own price-setting plans.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn18" title="footnote 18"><span>18</span></a><a name="f18"></a>&nbsp;Crucially, by keeping inflation expectations anchored, the FOMC has likely forestalled the development of wage&ndash;price spiral dynamics of the kind I mentioned earlier, while also creating conditions in which inflation has been able to peak at a lower rate than would have been the case if the FOMC had not acted with credibility and clear communication. Real wage growth&mdash;that is, growth of wages after accounting for inflation&mdash;has turned positive, which means workers' income is rising faster than the cost of living.</p>
<p><strong>A Couple of Final Observations about the Pandemic and Its Aftermath</strong><br />These developments help bring us back to the inflation&ndash;unemployment tradeoff that started my discussion. The pandemic experience has shown that the nature of that tradeoff changes with economic conditions, as does the steepness of the Phillips curve. I will close by making two more general observations about the changes that we have seen during the pandemic and its aftermath, with suggestions about open questions for researchers moving forward.</p>
<p>First, supply curves are, as economists say, "convex": Their slope increases sharply after quantity supplied reaches a certain point, such that prices rise quickly. The steep part of the supply curve can come into play when demand nears the limits of an industry's capacity. That could happen either because of an unusually large increase in demand or because of a temporary reduction in industry capacity&mdash;or both. Research has shown this is the case for individual industries, even in the pre-pandemic period.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn19" title="footnote 19"><span>19</span></a><a name="f19"></a>&nbsp;During the pandemic, many industries experienced large demand shocks or supply curtailment that contributed to inflation, as I have already discussed, and those same shocks also may have exacerbated the inflationary effects by pushing many industries up the steep part of their supply curves.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn20" title="footnote 20"><span>20</span></a><a name="f20"></a></p>
<p>Early in the pandemic, the convexity or steepness of industry supply curves was quite costly in terms of our inflation mandate. But it has likely helped us more recently as we have apparently moved back down the steep part of the supply curve in many industries, which has allowed for rapid disinflation.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn21" title="footnote 21"><span>21</span></a><a name="f21"></a>&nbsp;An open question in the longer term is whether this process has helped firms learn more about supply chains and inventory management such that we might even be less likely to encounter the steep part of supply curves in the future.</p>
<p>Second, with regard to the Phillips curve specifically, I note that in a large class of economic models, the steepness of the Phillips curve is partly a function of how frequently firms adjust their prices, and that seems to be borne out by recent experience.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn22" title="footnote 22"><span>22</span></a><a name="f22"></a>&nbsp;Before the pandemic, the typical price tag lasted more than 10 months, and this figure was reasonably stable for many years. But the pandemic seems to have moved firms into a regime of more frequent price adjustment&mdash;that is, shorter price duration. By early 2022, the typical price was lasting less than five months. Price adjustment frequency has since slowed back down, with the latest data from the third quarter of last year suggesting prices were lasting nearly seven months.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn23" title="footnote 23"><span>23</span></a><a name="f23"></a>&nbsp;Continued slowing of price adjustment frequency is an indicator that firms' costs are rising less quickly and the economy is moving back down the Phillips curve.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn24" title="footnote 24"><span>24</span></a><a name="f24"></a>&nbsp;Interestingly, though, in the workhorse academic models used for studying the effects of monetary policy on the economy, the frequency of price adjustment is often assumed to be constant. Of course, economists have thought about this in the past; but a greater understanding of the relationship between the price adjustment decisions of individual firms and overall inflation is an important area for further academic research.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240301a.htm#fn25" title="footnote 25"><span>25</span></a><a name="f25"></a></p>
<p>For the reasons I have been discussing, I am cautiously optimistic that we will see continued progress on disinflation without significant deterioration of the labor market. With respect to the inflation and unemployment tradeoff, we have certainly learned a lot during the pandemic&mdash;but there is still much more to learn. In particular, I look forward to further research that can enrich the economics profession's understanding of the inflation&ndash;unemployment tradeoff and the Phillips curve and continue informing policymakers as well.</p>

<p><a name="fn1"></a>1. The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn2"></a>2. Before 1977, the Federal Reserve viewed itself as having a dual mandate because it was covered by the Employment Act of 1946, which gave the whole federal government a list of objectives that included maximum employment and maximum "purchasing power." The predominant interpretation of the latter objective was that it corresponded to price stability.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn3"></a>3. L&oacute;pez-Salido, Markowitz, and Nelson (2024) provide a longer-term perspective on how the Federal Reserve has viewed price stability as necessary for achieving maximum employment on a sustained basis. See David L&oacute;pez-Salido, Emily Markowitz, and Edward Nelson (2024), "Continuity and Change in the Federal Reserve's Perspective on Price Stability," manuscript, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Division of Monetary Affairs, January.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn4"></a>4. In the context of achieving disinflation, the tradeoff between inflation and unemployment is sometimes referred to as the "sacrifice ratio." Estimates of the quantitative magnitude of this ratio vary widely, depending on the period being studied and the nature of the macroeconomic model being used. Model-based explorations do suggest that inflation expectations matter for the size of the ratio. For a helpful discussion and analysis, see Robert J. Tetlow (2022), "<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2022079pap.pdf">How Large Is the Output Cost of Disinflation? (PDF)</a>" Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2022-079 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, November).&nbsp;</p>

Rasche (2005), "<a href="https://doi.org/10.20955/r.87.187-236">The Reform of October 1979: How It Happened and Why</a>," Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis,&nbsp;<em>Review,</em>&nbsp;vol. 87 (March/April, Part 2), pp. 187-235.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn6"></a>6. For discussion of the notion that inflation-targeting monetary policy can achieve both stable prices and maximum employment, see Ben S. Bernanke, Thomas Laubach, Frederic S. Mishkin, and Adam S. Posen (1999),&nbsp;<em>Inflation Targeting: Lessons from the International Experience</em>&nbsp;(Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press). More recently, this notion has been called the "divine coincidence" (see Olivier Blanchard and Jordi Gal&iacute; (2007), "Real Wage Rigidities and the New Keynesian Model,"&nbsp;<em>Journal of Money, Credit and Banking</em>, vol. 39 (February), pp. 35&ndash;65).&nbsp;</p>

Bernanke (2006), "<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20060224a.htm">The Benefits of Price Stability</a>," speech delivered at the Center for Economic Policy Studies and on the occasion of the Seventy-Fifth Anniversary of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, Princeton University, Princeton, N.J., February 24.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn8"></a>8. Precisely quantifying the relative roles of supply and demand in the pandemic inflation will likely remain a controversial pursuit for some time. One approach is to focus on relative movements of particular prices and of specific output categories in a "bottom up" manner, as illustrated, for example, by Adam Hale Shapiro (2022), "Decomposing Supply and Demand Driven Inflation," working paper, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, February<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/">.</a>&nbsp;An alternative approach is to conduct a "top down" time-series analysis relating aggregate data on wages, prices, labor market tightness, and various measures of goods supply conditions, as illustrated by Olivier J. Blanchard and Ben S. Bernanke (2023), "<a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w31417">What Caused the U.S. Pandemic-Era Inflation?</a>" NBER Working Paper Series 31417 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, June). The two approaches can complement each other by providing alternative, but mutually consistent, perspectives on the same problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn9"></a>9. The auto industry's experience during the pandemic is a good example of how many industries' production functions are, in economists' terms, "Leontief," meaning that shortages of even one key component can restrict production even if other components are available. The prevalence of this kind of production in many industries made the broader supply chain particularly vulnerable to the extreme pandemic supply shocks. A helpful discussion&mdash;which predates the pandemic and focuses on the 2011 Japan earthquake&mdash;is Christoph E. Boehm, Aaron Flaaen, and Nitya Pandalai-Nayar (2019), "Input Linkages and the Transmission of Shocks: Firm-Level Evidence from the 2011 Tōhoku Earthquake,"&nbsp;<em>Review of Economics and Statistics,</em>&nbsp;vol. 101 (March), pp. 60&ndash;75.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn10"></a>10. Industrial production was low despite strong demand: New orders indexes from many sources were elevated throughout late 2020 and 2021. The Census Bureau's Quarterly Survey of Plant Capacity Utilization features questions on reasons for factory output being below capacity. "Insufficient supply of materials" and "insufficient supply of labor" both surged starting in late 2020 and remained near peak levels from mid-2021 through mid-2022 before starting to move back down. Separately, the Institute for Supply Management's Report on Business Manufacturing PMI (Purchasing Managers Index) features lists of items in short supply each month; the share of major manufacturing-sector input material groups reported as being in short supply surged to about 40 percent during 2021 and has since declined to below 10 percent. For a more formal approach to measuring lost output in manufacturing industries, see Charles Gilbert, Maria D. Tito, and Cynthia Doniger (2021), "<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/quantifying-bottlenecks-in-manufacturing-20211119.html">Quantifying Bottlenecks in Manufacturing</a>," FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, November 19).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn11"></a>11. Per data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Current Population Survey, the labor force level among foreign-born workers had a pre-pandemic peak about a year before the pandemic and did not fully recover to this peak until early 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn12"></a>12. Past research has found that job quality is higher in expansions; see Gadi Barlevy (2002), "The Sullying Effect of Recessions,"&nbsp;<em>Review of Economic Studies,</em>&nbsp;vol. 69 (January), pp. 65&ndash;96. In the pandemic specifically, job-to-job flows appear to have featured strong wage growth; see David Autor, Arindrajit Dube, and Annie McGrew (2023), "<a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w31010">The Unexpected Compression: Competition at Work in the Low Wage Labor Market</a>," NBER Working Paper Series 31010 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, November).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn13"></a>13. There are various ways to measure "matching efficiency." One such measure shows an initial decline in matching efficiency early in the pandemic, followed by a recovery to (roughly) pre-pandemic levels. See Simon Mongey and Jeff Horwich (2023), "<a href="https://www.minneapolisfed.org/article/2023/are-job-vacancies-still-as-plentiful-as-they-appear-implications-for-the-soft-landing">Are Job Vacancies Still as Plentiful as They Appear? Implications for the 'Soft Landing,'</a>&nbsp;" Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, December 1.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn14"></a>14. In general, the most labor-intensive sectors (measured as labor costs' share of value added) are mostly services sectors. As of 2022, the labor cost share of value added was 83 percent in education and health services, 75 percent in professional and business services, 64 percent in construction, and 59 percent in leisure and hospitality. See Bureau of Economic Analysis (2023), "<a href="https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/?reqid=150&amp;step=2&amp;isuri=1&amp;categories=gdpxind">Interactive Data</a>," tables on composition of gross output by industry," December.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn15"></a>15. The connection between wages and prices in services industries has been explored in the economics literature and been found to be a likely contributor to the higher "stickiness" or persistence of services prices relative to goods prices. See Ekaterina Peneva (2011), "Some Evidence on Factor Intensity and Price Rigidity,"&nbsp;<em>Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control,</em>&nbsp;vol. 35 (October), pp. 1652&ndash;58.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn16"></a>16. See, for example, the Hutchins Center Fiscal Impact Measure, which estimates the effect of government tax and spending policy on gross domestic product growth. The measure is available on the Brookings Institution's website at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/hutchins-center-fiscal-impact-measure/">https://www.brookings.edu/articles/hutchins-center-fiscal-impact-measure</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn17"></a>17. Expected inflation in the New York Fed's Survey of Consumer Expectations shows a similar pattern to that seen in the Michigan survey. And expectations appear well anchored in surveys of forecasters and in market-based measures.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn18"></a>18. See Felipe F. Schwartzman and Sonya Ravindranath Waddell (2024), "<a href="https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/economic_brief/2024/eb_24-03">Inflation Expectations and Price Setting among Fifth District Firms</a>," Economic Brief 24-03 (Richmond, Va.: Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, January).&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="fn20"></a>20. For an accessible discussion, see Deepa D. Datta, Laura Feiveson, Ekaterina Peneva, and Gisela Rua (2022), "<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/bottlenecks-shortages-and-soaring-prices-in-the-us-economy-20220624.html">Bottlenecks, Shortages, and Soaring Prices in the U.S. Economy</a>," FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, June 24).</p>
<p><a name="fn21"></a>21. For a formal treatment of the notion that monetary policy can be particularly effective at lowering inflation without large output losses following supply and capacity issues, see Xiwen Bai, Jes&uacute;s Fern&aacute;ndez-Villaverde, Yiliang Li, and Francesco Zanetti (2024), "The Causal Effects of Global Supply Chain Disruptions on Macroeconomic Outcomes: Evidence and Theory," working paper, January, available on the University of Pennsylvania website at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~jesusfv/Supply_Chain_Disruption.pdf">https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~jesusfv/Supply_Chain_Disruption.pdf</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn22"></a>22. In a broad set of models on inaction and action in the face of uncertainty and "non-convex" adjustment costs, firms may choose not to change prices even when faced with shocks, provided the shocks are small. But large shocks move firms out of their "inaction range" such that a series of large shocks can increase adjustment frequency. This can potentially explain reduced price "stickiness" in the pandemic. However, this outcome was not necessarily inevitable, as higher uncertainty can reduce adjustment frequency (due to raising the "real option" value of waiting), and the pandemic environment has been uncertain in many dimensions. For discussions, see Joseph Vavra (2014), "Inflation Dynamics and Time-Varying Volatility: New Evidence and an Ss Interpretation,"&nbsp;<em>Quarterly Journal of Economics,</em>&nbsp;vol. 129 (February), pp. 215&ndash;58; and Robert E. Hall (2023), "<a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w31025">A Major Shock Makes Prices More Flexible and May Result in a Burst of Inflation or Deflation</a>," NBER Working Paper Series 31025 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, March).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn23"></a>23. See updated data from Hugh Montag and Daniel Villar (2023), "<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/price-setting-during-the-covid-era-20230829.html">Price-Setting during the Covid Era</a>," FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, August 29).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn24"></a>24. The previous inflationary episode experienced by the U.S.&mdash;during the late 1970s and early 1980s&mdash;saw similar dynamics of price adjustment frequency; see Emi Nakamura, Jon Steinsson, Patrick Sun, and Daniel Villar (2018), "The Elusive Costs of Inflation: Price Dispersion during the U.S. Great Inflation,"&nbsp;<em>Quarterly Journal of Economics,&nbsp;</em>vol. 133 (November), pp. 1933&ndash;80.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn25"></a>25. I am referring here to the standard "New Keynesian" model, in which firms are allowed to adjust prices only if they receive a random signal whose probability distribution is typically constant and independent of the duration of the firm's current price level (so-called Calvo pricing). Allowing for price adjustment frequency and inflation to move together is one possible way to generate a "nonlinear" Phillips curve; for example, see Andres Blanco, Corina Boar, Callum J. Jones, and Virgiliu Midrigan (2024), "<a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w32094">Non-Linear Inflation Dynamics in Menu Cost Economies</a>," NBER Working Paper Series 32094 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, January).&nbsp;</p>

<div> Corruption, Bribery, Guilty plea, FCPA violations, Gunvor S.A.  
Summary:  
Gunvor S.A. pleads guilty to FCPA violations, pays over $661 million, bribed Ecuadorian officials, cooperates with U.S. authorities. International investigation and guilty pleas follow.  
Gunvor S.A. pays $661 million to settle FCPA violations, admitting to bribing Ecuadorean officials, and faces significant monetary penalties and forfeitures. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>Gunvor S.A. (Gunvor), an international commodities trading company based in Switzerland, has pleaded guilty and will pay over $661 million to resolve an investigation by the U.S. Justice Department into violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).</p>
<p>Gunvor&rsquo;s guilty plea stemmed from the company&rsquo;s corrupt scheme to pay substantial bribes to Ecuadorean government officials to secure business with Ecuador&rsquo;s state-owned and state-controlled oil company, Petroecuador.</p>
<p>In connection with the resolution, Gunvor entered into a plea agreement with the government and pleaded guilty to an information charging the company with conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA.&nbsp;Following the plea, the court sentenced Gunvor to pay a criminal monetary penalty of $374,560,071 and to forfeit $287,138,444 in ill-gotten gains. The sentence includes credits of up to one-quarter of the criminal fine each for amounts Gunvor pays to resolve investigations by Swiss and Ecuadorean authorities into the same misconduct so long as the payments are made within one year of today&rsquo;s date. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland announced today a parallel resolution of its investigation into Gunvor&rsquo;s misconduct that involved payment of approximately $98 million by Gunvor to Swiss authorities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over nearly a decade, Gunvor representatives bribed high-level government officials at Ecuador&rsquo;s state-owned oil company to enter into business transactions with other state-owned entities that ultimately benefited Gunvor. As a result of this complex bribery scheme, Gunvor obtained hundreds of millions of dollars in illicit profits,&rdquo; said Acting Senior Counselor Brent S. Wible of the Justice Department&rsquo;s Criminal Division. &ldquo;Foreign bribery emboldens corrupt officials and undermines the rule of law. Gunvor&rsquo;s guilty plea demonstrates that the Criminal Division remains resolute in our efforts to root out bribery and official corruption. We will continue to hold both corporations and individuals who bribe foreign officials to account, in coordination with our international partners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s guilty plea and sentencing marks yet another example of this office&rsquo;s efforts to combat widespread corruption,&rdquo; said U.S. Attorney Breon Peace for the Eastern District of New York. &ldquo;Corruption erodes the public&rsquo;s trust in their government, prevents government officials from acting in the best interests of the people they represent and harms businesses that play by the rules, driving up prices for consumers. The Justice Department, including my office, will not tolerate bribes being paid by American companies or foreign companies misusing the U.S. financial system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gunvor&rsquo;s years-long bribery scheme involving high-level Ecuadoran officials was both detrimental to the business environment and eroded the public&rsquo;s trust and confidence in their government,&rdquo; said Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey B. Veltri of the FBI Miami Field Office. &ldquo;This guilty plea and significant fine would not have been possible without significant cooperation from our international partners in the Cayman Islands, Colombia, Curacao, Ecuador, Panama, Portugal, Singapore, and Switzerland. This truly was an international effort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to the company&rsquo;s admissions and court documents, between 2012 and 2020, Gunvor and its co-conspirators paid more than $97 million to intermediaries knowing that some of the money would be and in fact was used to bribe Ecuadorean officials, including Nilsen Arias Sandoval, a then-high ranking official at Petroecuador.&nbsp;As part of the scheme, Gunvor managers and agents attended meetings in the United States and elsewhere. The bribe payments were routed through banks in the United States using shell companies in Panama and the British Virgin Islands controlled by Gunvor&rsquo;s co-conspirators.&nbsp;Among other things, a Gunvor employee also directed one of the intermediaries to use the money to purchase an 18-karat gold Patek Philippe watch for Arias.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In exchange for these bribe payments, high-level Ecuadorian officials helped various state-owned entities, which were acting as front companies for Gunvor, win the rights to a series of oil-backed loan contracts with Petroecuador. This structure allowed Gunvor and its co-conspirators to avoid a competitive bidding process and to obtain contractual terms that it could not have obtained otherwise.&nbsp;Gunvor also received confidential Petroecuador information in exchange for the bribes. In total, Gunvor earned more than $384 million in profits from the contracts it obtained corruptly from Petroecuador.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The department reached this resolution with Gunvor based on a number of factors, including, among others, the nature and seriousness of the offense. Gunvor received credit for its cooperation with the department&rsquo;s investigation, which included: (i) producing documents to the department from multiple foreign countries expeditiously while navigating foreign data privacy and criminal laws; (ii) providing information obtained through its own internal investigation to the department, which allowed the department to preserve and obtain evidence as part of the department&rsquo;s investigation; (iii) making detailed, factual presentations to the department; (iv) arranging for the interview of an employee based outside the United States; (v) promptly collecting, analyzing, and organizing voluminous information, including complex financial information, at the request of the department, and producing an analysis of trading activity conducted by multiple outside forensic accounting firms retained by Gunvor; (vi) translating foreign language documents to facilitate and expedite review by the department; and (vii) imaging the phones of relevant custodians at the beginning of Gunvor&rsquo;s internal investigation, thus preserving business communications sent on mobile messaging applications.</p>
<p>Gunvor also engaged in timely and appropriate remedial measures, including: (i)&nbsp;eliminating the use of third-party business origination agents; (ii) enhancing its third party due-diligence process; (iii) developing and implementing a control framework for internal business developers and additional layers of review and approval for counterparty payments; (iv)&nbsp;enhancing the independent compliance committee with responsibility for reviewing high-risk transactions; (v) engaging resources to review its compliance program and test the effectiveness of its overall reporting process, its reporting hotline and the effectiveness of the investigation of reports made through the hotline; (vi) evaluating and updating its compensation policy to better incentivize compliance with the law and corporate policies; (vii) hiring additional compliance personnel; (viii) testing and enhancing its compliance program, including by conducting compliance culture reviews, testing new third party due diligence process and payment controls, and evaluating controls around business development activities; and (ix) developing and implementing a risk-based business communications policy that addresses the use of ephemeral and encrypted messaging applications.</p>
<p>The department also considered Gunvor&rsquo;s history of misconduct. In October 2019, Gunvor reached a resolution with the Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland concerning a corrupt scheme to bribe officials in Congo-Brazzaville and C&ocirc;te d&rsquo;Ivoire to secure oil contracts obtained between approximately 2009 and 2012. As part of the 2019 Swiss resolution, Gunvor admitted that it lacked sufficient controls to prevent the underlying misconduct and failed to take &ldquo;all the reasonable organizational measures&rdquo; required to prevent Gunvor&rsquo;s employees and agents from engaging in bribery. The conduct that is the subject of today&rsquo;s guilty plea occurred, in part, at the same time as the prior Swiss investigation and resolution.</p>
<p>In light of these considerations, the department determined that the appropriate resolution in this case was for Gunvor to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA. The criminal fine calculated under the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines reflects a 25% reduction off the 30th&nbsp;percentile of the applicable guidelines fine range, taking into account Gunvor&rsquo;s cooperation and remediation, as well as its prior history.</p>
<p>The department previously secured convictions in the Eastern District of New York of four individuals who were implicated in Gunvor&rsquo;s bribery scheme, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Antonio Pere Ycaza, a former consultant for Gunvor, pleaded guilty on Oct. 7, 2020, to one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering.</li>
<li>Enrique Pere Ycaza, a former consultant for Gunvor, also pleaded guilty on Oct. 7, 2020, to one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering and to violate the FCPA.</li>
<li>Raymond Kohut, a former Gunvor employee and agent, pleaded guilty on April 6, 2021, to one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering.</li>
<li>Nilsen Arias Sandoval, a former senior Petroecuador official, pleaded guilty on Jan. 19, 2022, to one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FBI Miami Field Office is investigating the case, with assistance from the FBI&rsquo;s International Corruption Unit.</p>
<p>Trial Attorney Clayton P. Solomon and Assistant Chiefs Derek J. Ettinger and Jonathan P. Robell of the Criminal Division&rsquo;s Fraud Section, Trial Attorney D. Hunter Smith and Deputy Chief Adam J. Schwartz of the Criminal Division&rsquo;s Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Nick M. Axelrod, Jonathan P. Lax, and Matthew R. Galeotti for the Eastern District of New York are prosecuting the case. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Laura Mantell and Brendan King for the Eastern District of New York are handling forfeiture matters.</p>
<p>The Justice Department&rsquo;s Office of International Affairs and authorities in the Cayman Islands, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Portugal, Singapore, and Switzerland provided valuable assistance.</p>
<p>The Criminal Division&rsquo;s Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice Department&rsquo;s FCPA enforcement efforts can be found at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa">www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa</a>.</p>
<p>The Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative is led by a team of dedicated prosecutors in the Criminal Division&rsquo;s Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, in partnership with federal law enforcement agencies, and often with U.S. Attorneys&rsquo; Offices, to forfeit the proceeds of foreign official corruption and, where appropriate, to use those recovered assets to benefit the people harmed by these acts of corruption and abuse of office.</p>

<div> FTSE Russell, index provider, annual Russell US Indexes rebalancing schedule, market shifts reflected, transparent, predictable process, 40th anniversary, IPO additions.<br />
Summary:<br />FTSE Russell announces 2024 Russell Indexes rebalancing schedule, 40th anniversary, IPO additions, market shifts reflected, transparent, predictable process. <div>
<div class="tr-VerticalSpacing tr-VerticalSpacing--m">
<div class="tr-RichText   ">
<p><span>FTSE Russell, the global index provider, today confirms the schedule for the 36<span>th</span>&nbsp;annual&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lseg.com/en/ftse-russell/russell-reconstitution">Reconstitution</a>&nbsp;of its Russell US Indexes suite, set to occur at the end of June.&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="tr-VerticalSpacing tr-VerticalSpacing--l">
<div class="tr-RichText   ">
<p>This rebalancing process is designed to capture market shifts from the previous year to ensure the Russell US Indexes continue to accurately reflect the US equity market.</p>
<p>The 2024 Russell Reconstitution schedule is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Tuesday, April 30<span>th</span></span>&nbsp;&ndash; &ldquo;Rank Day&rdquo; &ndash; Index membership eligibility for 2024 Russell Reconstitution determined from constituent market capitalization at market close.</li>
<li><span>Friday, May 24<span>th</span></span>&nbsp;&ndash; Preliminary index additions &amp; deletions membership lists posted to the website after 6 PM US eastern time.</li>
<li><span>Friday, May 31<span>st</span></span>,&nbsp;<span>June 7<span>th</span>, 14<span>th</span>&nbsp;and 21<span>st</span></span>&nbsp;&ndash; Preliminary membership lists (reflecting any updates) posted to the website after 6 PM US eastern time.</li>
<li><span>Monday, June 10<span>th</span></span>&nbsp;&ndash; &ldquo;Lock-down&rdquo; period begins with the updates to reconstitution membership considered to be final.</li>

<li><span>Monday, July 1<span>st</span></span>&nbsp;&ndash; Equity markets open with the newly reconstituted Russell US Indexes.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p><span>Catherine Yoshimoto, Director, Product Management, FTSE Russell, said:&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;With a US equity market that is constantly changing, it is critical that the entire Russell US Indexes suite undergoes a complete recalibration to ensure the indexes accurately reflect company size and style shifts that have occurred since the last reconstitution. This annual event is widely followed and traditionally concludes with one of the highest trading volume days of the year, making our transparent, rules-based methodology a key element to a seamless and predictable process for investors. This year, we not only celebrate the 36<span>th</span>&nbsp;annual Russell Reconstitution but also the 40<span>th</span>&nbsp;anniversary of the launch of the Russell US Indexes.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Annual reconstitution and quarterly IPO additions provide an important foundation for FTSE Russell&rsquo;s widely used Russell US Indexes. These index governance processes are designed to ensure that the indexes remain a current and relevant measure of US equity market performance.</p>
<p>On February 16<span>th</span>, FTSE Russell announced the 1Q2024&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lseg.com/en/ftse-russell/russell-reconstitution/ipo-additions">preliminary list of IPO additions</a>, which will take effect at the market open of March 18<span>th</span>. As of 1Q2024, there are no preliminary additions to the Russell 1000 Index and seven additions to the Russell 3000 Index, all of which will be added to the small cap Russell 2000 Index. There will also be six IPOs added to the Russell Microcap Index.</p>

<title>FESE Response To The IOSCO Consultation Report On Market Outages</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/fese-response-to-the-iosco-consultation-report-on-market-outages/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/fese-response-to-the-iosco-consultation-report-on-market-outages/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>FESE agrees with the key findings in IOSCO&rsquo;s consultation report. We believe the recommended good practices around outage and communication plans, the reopening of trading, the closing auction and alternative prices, and the post-outage plan are largely appropriate.</p>
<p>We would also like to thank IOSCO for acknowledging FESE&rsquo;s frameworks for industry-wide standard protocols and highlighting that the EU enjoys a comprehensive regulatory framework on outages. Looking at the details of the IOSCO findings, it is clear that one particular approach will not work in all cases, especially given the differences between equities and derivatives venues. The report also states that, in some jurisdictions with multiple trading venues, alternative venues could be used should a market outage occur on one of the markets. However, in the fragmented European trading landscape, if the primary venue experiences an outage, it is unlikely that other venues which generally follow the prices formed on the primary would be able to continue offering trading.</p>

<div> asymmetric effects, term premium, QE and QT announcement effects, QE execution, QT execution<br />
Summary: The author discusses the asymmetric effects of quantitative easing and quantitative tightening, the term premium, QE execution, QT execution, and the implications of QT in the United States. <div>
<p>Thank you, it is great to be here. I'm pleased to participate in this panel to discuss a policy action now being implemented by central banks around the globe: quantitative tightening (QT).<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240301a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;I want to thank Kristin, Matt, and Wenxin for putting together a great paper that provides an overview of the effects of QT across seven central banks.</p>
<p>Often called "large-scale asset purchases" (LSAPs) by central bankers, the view of quantitative easing, or QE, as a tool to add monetary policy accommodation and QT to tighten policy has changed over time. When it was used during and after the Global Financial Crisis, QE was deemed an "unconventional" tool in central banks' arsenals. But QE has now been used numerous times in the past two decades for extended periods when the policy rate was at the effective lower bound, so I would say it is no longer unconventional.</p>
<p>Given the role of QE and QT in the policy toolkit, it is good to have researchers and policymakers examine how asset purchases work and talk about current issues associated with their implementation. This paper is very timely and thorough in looking across countries and their experiences with QE and QT. There is a lot packed into this work that makes it a little difficult to fully assess in the time we have today. So I will focus my comments on four points: (1) the evidence that the effects of QE are asymmetric to the effects of QT; (2) the execution of QE versus the execution of QT in the United States; (3) the role of announcement effects of QT; and, finally, (4) who has taken the Fed's place in buying assets when we withdraw from the market. I will then end with some thoughts about issues facing the Federal Reserve as we move forward with normalizing our balance sheet.</p>
<p><strong>The Asymmetry of Quantitative Easing versus Quantitative Tightening</strong><br />For me, one of the most interesting results of the paper is that the announcement effects of quantitative easing are much larger than the announcement effects of quantitative tightening. The authors find that announcements of QT have a small but statistically significant effect in increasing government bond yields&mdash;about 4 to 8 basis points. But this effect is much smaller, in absolute terms, than the prevailing estimates of the decrease in yields from announcements of QE. The conclusion is that the interest rate effects of QE and QT are asymmetric. For an economist, this result may seem puzzling&mdash;why would changing the sign on an action lead to asymmetric effects on prices and real variables?</p>
<p>Ever since central banks initiated QE in response to the Global Financial Crisis, academics have debated its effectiveness. One view is that it has a very limited effect in situations where a central bank is swapping zero interest-bearing reserves for zero interest-bearing shorter-term Treasury securities. Because the two assets would seem to be nearly perfect substitutes, there can be no price effects from altering the composition of the two assets. The central bank is simply swapping two $10 bills for a twenty. If this is true, then undoing the trade via QT has no effect either. It should be symmetrical.</p>
<p>The alternative view, based on market segmentation or preferred habitat theory, is that when a central bank uses reserves to pay for government securities, it is decreasing the supply of these securities to private investors, which will bid up the price and lower the interest rate on government securities.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240301a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;By lowering interest rates on longer-maturity assets, which pay a higher interest rate than reserves, the central bank can stimulate the economy in a manner similar to lowering the policy rate. But by this logic, when QT reverses QE, asset prices should fall and yields should rise in equal magnitude. Thus, any positive effects derived from QE would be reversed when QT occurs. This suggests that QE and QT may cancel each other out in welfare terms. But if there are no net benefits from the action, what is the point of doing it? To illustrate this point, suppose someone is given a weight-loss drug and they lose 80 pounds, but then the drug is taken away and they regain the 80 pounds. What was the point of the exercise if there was no net welfare gain?</p>
<p>To me, for QE to be beneficial on net, there&nbsp;<em>has</em>&nbsp;to be asymmetry in the effects of QE relative to QT. My thinking on this has long been guided by the conclusions of a paper I wrote with Alex Berentsen about optimal stabilization policy, which is what QE and QT ultimately should be about.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240301a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;The gist of the argument is that when shocks and frictions to trading arise suddenly, the central bank can take actions such as injecting reserves to ease trading frictions or credit constraints and improve welfare. But by waiting until the frictions and shocks dissipate before undoing the injections, the positive effects are not reversed. As an example, when a house is on fire, pouring water on the fire will put it out, which has great benefits for all. But when the fire is out, draining the water away does not reignite the fire&mdash;the initial benefits are not undone. The punchline here is that QE is conducted under different market conditions than those that occur when QT is done, so it is not surprising that the effects will be different. The authors' findings that QE has asymmetric effects compared to QT is not a puzzle but an indication that central banks timed QE and QT in the right manner such that society was better off.</p>
<p><strong>The Execution of Quantitative Easing versus Quantitative Tightening</strong><br />Turning to the impact of QE and QT on interest rates, analysis often focuses on the term premium. There are three key elements of asset purchases that change the term premium: (1) the expected path of QE, which includes the amount and timing of purchases; (2) the length of time the central bank is expected to hold the additional securities; and (3) the expected path of QT, including the amount and timing of redemptions, which importantly depends on the desired ultimate size of securities holdings (and reserve balances) of the central bank. As soon as an asset purchase program is announced, these expectations are formed, resulting in the term premium effect, or TPE, on interest rates.</p>
<p>Over time, the TPE will change, based on both the passage of time and any updates to the public's expectations for the components I just mentioned. Let me talk about three factors that affect both the expected path of asset purchases and interest rates. These factors are things to keep in mind for future policy decisions.</p>
<p>First, there are two ways that QE can be implemented, and they have different impacts on interest rates. These are what I call&nbsp;<em>closed</em>- or&nbsp;<em>open-ended</em>&nbsp;QE programs. Closed-ended QE programs involve an announcement of a fixed stock of purchases over a fixed period of time. An example of this type of asset purchase program was initiated by the Fed in March 2009.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240301a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;Open-ended QE simply gives a purchase amount per month but no calendar endpoint, so the expected size of the program is unspecified. A set of economic conditions for reducing or ending purchases may be stipulated, but when they will occur is not perfectly predictable. Here, one can think of the Fed's most recent asset purchase program.</p>
<p>At the time of an asset purchase announcement, it will be easier for markets to fully price in a closed-ended program, since its purchase amount and end date are given, whereas the open-ended program's pricing will depend on market expectations for the evolution of the economy. So if one wants a particular impact on interest rates at the announcement date, one might lean toward a closed-ended program or be aware that additional guidance on the expected path of the open-ended program will be needed.</p>
<p>As time passes and the economy evolves, the two programs work differently. One might prefer an open-ended program over time because it dynamically responds to the evolution of economic conditions. The program could be halted or extended as conditions improve or worsen, unlike a closed-ended program. But, of course, the criteria set in the open-ended program must be carefully considered. As I said in a recent FEDS Note and in several speeches, the 2020 criteria for when to begin QT may have been too restrictive and did not allow the Committee to taper as soon and as gradually as desired.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240301a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;Setting the appropriate criteria ahead of time to create the flexibility needed to respond to changing economic and financial conditions is very hard to do.</p>
<p>The second factor affecting the path of asset purchases is that it is very important that QE be credibly followed by QT. If QE is viewed as nothing more than a permanent injection of money into the economy, it would likely create inflation. This was widely predicted back in 2009, but the inflation didn't happen. Why? In my view, it didn't happen because the Fed credibly committed to withdrawing the injected reserves at a later date. Pre-committing to QT is what allows the injection of reserves into the economy without inflation or other longer-run distortions of market pricing. So when starting asset purchases or weighing how to approach asset runoff or sales, it is important that the central bank commit to normalizing its balance sheet.</p>
<p>The third factor is that it is important for a central bank to move carefully as it comes to the end of QT and the desired level of ample reserves. The endpoint should be related to the expectation of the banking system's demand for reserves. In the United States, we saw stresses in money markets in the fall of 2019, when the Fed reduced the level of reserves during balance sheet normalization through July and then there was heavy issuance of Treasury securities in September. The level of reserves likely went a bit too low.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240301a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;Learning from our experiences and trying to understand how the demand for reserves has changed over time suggests moving carefully toward the endpoint of QT.</p>
<p>For this reason, even if QE is an open-ended program, QT is more likely to resemble a closed-ended program. Central banks usually have an idea of how large they want their balance sheet to be when QT ends; therefore, once the pace of QT is announced, markets should be able to effectively price in the entire program at the announcement of the plan. After that, the actual execution of QT is simply validating the beliefs that market participants had at the announcement. This is why many refer to QT as merely draining unneeded reserves, which should be as interesting as watching paint dry.</p>
<p><strong>Quantitative Tightening in the United States</strong><br />Let me now turn more directly to the authors' paper and two of their findings. First, as I mentioned earlier, they find central banks' QT announcements have only a small effect on interest rates. To conduct this analysis, the authors do an event study around QT announcements, which requires them to identify "surprises" in the QT announcements. As the authors acknowledge, this is not a trivial exercise. My comment here is to point out why identifying a QT announcement surprise is challenging when considering examples in the United States.</p>
<p>Let me walk through the evolution of the Fed's QT communications in the spring of 2022 to consider how various communications affected the expected path of QT.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240301a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;Recall that QE ended in March 2022.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240301a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a>&nbsp;Heading into April, it was likely that markets expected a redemption path somewhat like the Fed's 2017&ndash;2019 QT plan.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240301a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;That plan phased in redemptions over 12 months and ultimately allowed, at most, $30 billion of Treasury securities and $20 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) to be redeemed each month. On April 5, 2022, then-Vice Chair Lael Brainard gave a speech that noted the balance sheet would shrink considerably more rapidly than in the previous case of QT; specifically, she said that "significantly larger caps and a much shorter period to phase in the maximum caps compared with 2017&ndash;2019."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240301a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a>&nbsp;The next day, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes provided additional information on the expected maximum monthly caps and phase-in period, saying participants generally agreed to a three-month phase-in and caps of $60 billion and $35 billion for Treasury securities and agency MBS, respectively.</p>
<p>Over those two days in April, the markets likely updated their expected QT plans to have sooner and larger redemptions. This change would be associated with a less negative term premium effect, meaning a rise in Treasury yields. The 10-year Treasury yield rose 19 basis points over the two days of the Vice Chair's speech and the FOMC minutes&mdash;that is, 12 basis points on the day of her speech and another 7 basis points on the day of the FOMC minutes&mdash;and a total of 37 basis points over that week.</p>
<p>About a month later, on May 4, 2022, the FOMC communicated its "Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet." The plan was consistent with the FOMC minutes from April, and there was little change in the 10-year Treasury yield that day and week (negative 4 basis points on the day of the announcement and 2 basis points over the five-day period). So, when doing event studies, it may be difficult to estimate the full impact of QT announcements by simply looking at the formal announcement of the QT plan.</p>
<p>Let me turn to a second point of the paper, about which types of investors have increased their securities holdings as the Fed has reduced its holdings. When a central bank steps away from asset purchases and begins to shrink its balance sheet, a common question is, who will step in and take the central bank's place in buying securities? I always respond by saying, "Why is this important?" If the government bond market is broad and deep, there will be plenty of buyers&mdash;there is no need to worry about who will buy the government debt. If the government bond market is not broad or deep, however, then the central bank's actions can have adverse and unwanted effects on prices and market functioning. This would then affect how fast the central bank can reduce its balance sheet and whether it can do so passively or actively.</p>
<p>One could also argue that it matters because knowing the buyers helps one understand the transmission of QT to asset prices and interest rates. Does it matter if it is banks or nonbank financial firms that are doing the buying? Does it matter if it is hedge funds, pension funds, or actual households doing the buying? One needs to have a better understanding of why the question is being asked before one can fully understand the answers to the question.</p>
<p>The authors focus on the reduction in aggregate securities holdings of central banks and find that households and broker-dealers are the main investors absorbing the redeemed securities. For my discussion today, I decided to dig a bit deeper into the Financial Accounts of the United States in two ways. First, I decided to look at each type of security (Treasury securities and agency MBS) individually.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240301a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a>&nbsp;For Treasury securities, I also find that since the 2022 start of QT, households have boosted their market share the most, and broker-dealers have also increased their share. For agency MBS, not only has the market shares of those two investor types increased, but so has the market shares of money market funds.</p>
<p>Second, I dug into the household category a bit more. As currently categorized, the Financial Accounts household category includes hedge funds. The Federal Reserve Board is working to segregate hedge funds in this data set. In the interim, the Board publishes separate data on the balance sheets of domestic hedge funds.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240301a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a>&nbsp;Using this supplemental data, I find that it is not the hedge funds that are responsible for the increase in household market share. This means the increase is driven by the other household investors: actual households and nonprofit organizations.</p>
<p>What do I make of this finding? My interpretation is that it reinforces the view that the demand for U.S. Treasury securities is broad and deep&mdash;the buyers are not a narrow set of deep-pocketed, sophisticated investors but rather the American public. As a result, the pace of runoff is not a problem. As we have seen with the current phase of QT, runoff up to $95 billion a month is not causing substantial strains in financial markets&mdash;something that a few years ago would have surprised a lot of people, given the worries about QT that were common prior to 2022.</p>
<p><strong>Normalization</strong><br />Let me conclude with a few comments on where I believe the Fed should be heading as it continues to normalize its balance sheet. By "normalizing" I mean reducing the size of the balance sheet but retaining enough assets to manage monetary policy using an ample-reserves regime.</p>
<p>As the Federal Reserve continues its QT program, I support further thinking about how many more securities to redeem. We have an overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility with take-up of more than $500 billion, and I view these funds as excess liquidity that financial market participants do not want, so this tells me that we can continue to reduce our holdings for some time.</p>
<p>In addition, it is important to remember that we now have a standing repurchase agreement facility (SRF). The SRF serves as a backstop in money markets, since it takes in Treasury securities as well as agency MBS and puts reserves in the banking system. This facility may allow banks to lower the level of reserves below what reserves would be without the facility, and it may provide a signal for when reserves are getting close to ample.</p>
<p>Chair Powell has noted that the FOMC will begin to discuss slowing our redemptions at our FOMC meeting this month, which will help us transition into whatever definition of "ample" we deem appropriate. Changing our pace of redemptions will occur when the Committee makes a decision to do so, and the timing will be independent of any changes to the policy rate target. Balance sheet plans are about getting liquidity levels right and approaching "ample" at the correct speed. They do not imply anything about the stance of interest rate policy, which is focused on influencing the macroeconomy and achieving our dual mandate.</p>
<p>Thinking about longer-term issues related to the Fed's portfolio, I want to mention two things. First, I would like to see the Fed's agency MBS holdings go to zero. Agency MBS holdings have been slow to run off the portfolio, at a recent monthly average of about $15 billion, because the underlying mortgages have very low interest rates and prepayments are quite small. I believe it is important to see a continued reduction in these holdings.</p>
<p>Second, I would like to see a shift in Treasury holdings toward a larger share of shorter-dated Treasury securities. Prior to the Global Financial Crisis, we held approximately one-third of our portfolio in Treasury bills.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240301a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a>&nbsp;Today, bills are less than 5 percent of our Treasury holdings and less than 3 percent of our total securities holdings. Moving toward more Treasury bills would shift the maturity structure more toward our policy rate&mdash;the overnight federal funds rate&mdash;and allow our income and expenses to rise and fall together as the FOMC increases and cuts the target range. This approach could also assist a future asset purchase program because we could let the short-term securities roll off the portfolio and not increase the balance sheet.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240301a.htm#fn14" title="footnote 14"><span>14</span></a><a name="f14"></a>&nbsp;This is an issue the FOMC will need to decide in the next couple of years.</p>
<p>In conclusion, let me be clear that this is a great paper that will serve as a major reference for researchers and central banks. The authors' analysis will surely have a much longer shelf life than my discussion of it.</p>
<hr align="left" size="1" width="33%" />
<p><a name="fn1"></a>1. The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn2"></a>2. There are several theories for how QE works. The market segmentation theory suggests that assets of different maturities are imperfect substitutes, so a lower supply of long-term assets and a higher supply of short-term assets would imply that long-term interest rates fall and short-term interest rates rise. The preferred habitat theory suggests that financial market participants prefer certain asset maturities over others and the price (or interest) rate needs to adjust to change their desired mix of holdings.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn3"></a>3. For details of the model and results, see Aleksander Berentsen and Christopher Waller (2011), "Price-Level Targeting and Stabilization Policy,"&nbsp;<em>Journal of Money, Credit and Banking,</em>&nbsp;vol. 43, Supplement 2 (October), pp. 559&ndash;80.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn4"></a>4. An example of a closed-ended program is from March 2009, when the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) noted that "to help improve conditions in private credit markets, the Committee decided to purchase up to $300 billion of longer-term Treasury securities over the next six months"; see paragraph 3 of the March 2009 FOMC statement, which is available on the Board's website at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm">https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm</a>. An example of an open-ended program is from December 2020, when the FOMC stated it would keep buying $120 billion per month in securities "until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee's maximum employment and price stability goals"; see paragraph 4 of the December 2020 FOMC statement, which is available on the Board's website at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm">https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn5"></a>5. See Jane Ihrig and Chris Waller (2024), "<a href="https://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.3455">The Federal Reserve's Responses to the Post-COVID Period of High Inflation</a>," FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, February 14).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn6"></a>6. For a discussion of the September 2019 experience, see Sriya Anbil, Alyssa Anderson, and Zeynep Senyuz (2020), "<a href="https://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.2527">What Happened in Money Markets in September 2019?</a>" FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, February 27).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn7"></a>7. Prior to the spring announcements, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) began discussions on policy normalization as reported in the December 2021 FOMC minutes. It was noted that some participants observed that the balance sheet could potentially shrink faster than the previous experience. The 10-year Treasury yield moved up several basis points around the release of the minutes.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn8"></a>8. In March 2022, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) indicated that it "expects to begin reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities at a coming meeting"; see paragraph 3 of the March 2022 FOMC statement, which is available on the Board's website at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm">https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm</a>. This language signaled the Fed would be holding the peak amount of securities on its balance sheet for just a short period of time, which turned out to be between March and the end of May.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn9"></a>9. In January 2022, the Federal Open Market Committee provided a statement on "Principles for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet," but it did not provide information about the timing or pace of redemptions; the statement is available on the Board's website at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20220126c.htm">https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20220126c.htm</a>.&nbsp;</p>

See Lael Brainard (2022), "<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20220405a.htm">Variation in the Inflation Experiences of Households</a>," speech delivered at the Spring 2022 Institute Research Conference, Opportunity and Inclusive Growth Institute, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Minneapolis, April 5.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn11"></a>11. My calculations look at how investor types' market shares change over time, as is done in Seth Carpenter, Selva Demiralp, Jane Ihrig, and Elizabeth Klee (2015), "Analyzing Federal Reserve Asset Purchases: From Whom Does the Fed Buy?"&nbsp;<em>Journal of Banking and Finance,</em>&nbsp;vol. 52 (March), pp. 230&ndash;44.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn12"></a>12. Data on the balance sheet of hedge funds is available on the Board's website at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/20231207/html/b101f.htm">https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/20231207/html/b101f.htm</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn13"></a>13. A Treasury bill is a security backed by the U.S. Treasury Department with a maturity of up to 52 weeks. A bill is sold at a discount, and at maturity the investor receives the par value of the security.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn14"></a>14. There may be other considerations for holding a sizable share of bills in the Fed's portfolio. For example, Vissing-Jorgensen (2023) argues for considering the convenience yield impact of bills; see Annette Vissing-Jorgensen (2023), "Balance Sheet Policy above the ELB," paper presented at the ECB Forum on Central Banking, held in Sintra, Portugal, June 26&ndash;28.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced settled charges against New York-based investment adviser HG Vora Capital Management LLC for its failure to make timely ownership disclosures in the lead-up to its May 2022 acquisition bid for trucking fleet company Ryder System Inc. HG Vora agreed to pay a $950,000 civil penalty to settle the SEC&rsquo;s charges.</p>
<p>Under the federal securities laws, a company that owns more than five percent of a public company&rsquo;s stock must report its position and whether it has a control purpose, which is an intention to influence or control the company. According to the SEC&rsquo;s order, on Feb. 14, 2022, HG Vora disclosed that it owned 5.6 percent of Ryder&rsquo;s common stock as of Dec. 31, 2021, and certified that it did not have a control purpose. The order states that HG Vora then built up its position to 9.9 percent of Ryder's stock and formed a control purpose no later than April 26, 2022. The federal securities laws therefore required it to report its control purpose and its current ownership position by May 6, 2022, but it did not report this information until May 13. On that same day, HG Vora sent a letter to Ryder proposing to buy all Ryder shares for $86 a share, a sizeable premium over the trading price. Before the letter to Ryder and its filing, and after forming a control purpose, HG Vora purchased swap agreements that gave it economic exposure to the equivalent of 450,000 more shares of Ryder common stock. After HG Vora&rsquo;s public announcement of its bid on May 13, 2022, Ryder&rsquo;s stock price increased significantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The federal laws and SEC rules covering ownership disclosure help keep investors fully informed about control &ndash; and potential changes in control &ndash; of publicly traded companies,&rdquo; said Mark Cave, Associate Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;But, according to today&rsquo;s order, HG Vora deprived Ryder shareholders of information about its significant stake in the company, while building a large swaps position from which it stood to profit after announcing the Ryder takeover bid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that HG Vora violated the beneficial ownership provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Without admitting or denying the findings, HG Vora agreed to cease and desist from future violations and to pay the civil penalty discussed above. On Oct. 10, 2023, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-219">SEC adopted rules</a>&nbsp;shortening the deadline for filing an initial Schedule 13D from 10 to five business days. HG Vora was found to have violated the rules in effect at the time of the conduct at issue in the SEC&rsquo;s order by filing this report more than 10 days after forming a control purpose.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Jonathan Cowen with assistance from Robert Nesbitt of the Office of Market Intelligence and Nicholas Panos from the Office of Mergers &amp; Acquisitions. The investigation was supervised by Assistant Director Jeffrey Weiss and Mr. Cave.</p>

Summary: 
ACER and ENTSO-E are organizing an online workshop to present simulation results of long-term flow-based allocation process, introducing go-live timeline. <div>
<p><span>ACER and the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) are organising an online workshop to present the simulation results of the long-term flow-based allocation of transmission capacities.</span></p>
<p><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">When?</span></span></p>
<p><span>Friday, 22 March 2024, 09:00 &ndash; 12:00 CET</span></p>
<p><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is it about?</span></span></p>
<p><span>The long-term flow-based allocation of transmission capacities process will be used to manage and allocate the electricity transmission across the European integrated market on yearly and monthly timeframe in the Core and Nordic capacity calculation regions (CCRs). The process will enhance the efficiency of the transmission capacity allocation, thus providing hedging opportunities to market participants.</span></p>
<p><span>The Nordic CCR comprises&nbsp;4 countries: Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden.</span></p>
<p><span>The Core CCR consists of 13 countries: Austria, Belgium, Czechia, Croatia, France, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia and Romania.</span></p>
<p><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the key objectives?</span></span></p>
<p><span>This 6<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;workshop aims to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Present and discuss the simulation results.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span>Introduce the expected timeline for the go-live of the single allocation platform that will support the long-term flow-based capacity allocation process.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This workshop will provide stakeholders with an in-depth understanding of the long-term flow-based allocation process, as well as the go-live preparation of yearly and monthly flow-based auctions.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The global economy is at an inflection point, as the most synchronised and most significant monetary policy tightening in recent memory nears the end. Disinflation is largely on track, and there is a good chance of a soft, or softish, landing. But inflationary pressures may re-emerge. And the current slowdown in growth may still turn out to be deeper and more protracted than expected. If such risks materialise, capital flows to emerging market economies may retrench. Some, like those in sub-Saharan Africa, may be particularly vulnerable given their high levels of debt held by foreign bondholders and commercial banks. Policymakers will need to navigate these difficult waters, including by enhancing banking supervision.</span></p>

<title>Shenzhen Stock Exchange Smoothly Implements The Quantitative Trading Reporting System</title>

<div> Circular, reporting system, quantitative trading, regulation, market order
Summary:<br /> 
- SZSE implemented reporting system for quantitative trading
- Recognizes advantages and problems of quantitative trading
- Plans to strengthen regulatory arrangements
- Will increase communication with HKEX
- Will take self-regulatory measures and report violations to CSRC<br /> <div>
<p>On September 1, 2023, SZSE issued the Circular on Matters Relating to the Reporting of Stock Program Trading and the Circular on Matters Relating to Strengthening the Management of Program Trading with official effect from October 9, 2023, establishing the special reporting&nbsp;system&nbsp;and corresponding regulatory arrangements for quantitative trading. With joint efforts of all market participants, the above&nbsp;system&nbsp;has been smoothly implemented.&nbsp;The existing&nbsp;investors have completed the reporting on schedule as required, while&nbsp;new&nbsp;investors have carried out the provisions of &ldquo;reporting before trading&rdquo; and their reporting quality has generally met the requirements, laying the foundation for further strengthening and improving the regulation of quantitative trading. SZSE will, based on the reported information, continue to intensify the monitoring and analysis of quantitative trading, especially high-frequency trading and dynamically evaluate and improve the reporting&nbsp;system.</p>
<p>With the wide application of new information technologies, quantitative trading has recently become an important way of trading. It helps provide liquidity to the market and facilitates price discovery.&nbsp;Compared with&nbsp;small and medium-sized investors, quantitative trading, especially high-frequency trading, has obvious advantages in technology, information and speed, but at some time points, also shows problems such as strategy convergence, trading resonance and increase in market volatility. From the perspective of international experience, overseas markets generally implement the stricter regulation on quantitative trading, especially high-frequency trading, to prevent negative impact on market order. In the next step, SZSE will adhere to the investor-oriented approach, take the maintenance of fairness as the starting point and goal of its work, learn from international regulatory practices, seek advantages and avoid disadvantages. SZSE will establish sound regulatory arrangements for quantitative trading, including strict implementation of the reporting&nbsp;system&nbsp;and clear access arrangements of &ldquo;reporting before trading&rdquo;; strengthen the authorization management of market&nbsp;data for&nbsp;quantitative trading and perfect the differentiated charging mechanism; improve monitoring standards for abnormal trading and reinforce the regulation on abnormal trading and abnormal order reporting and withdrawal; strengthen the monitoring and regulation of leverage-type quantitative products and the joint regulation of futures and spot goods. Meanwhile, SZSE will further clarify customer management responsibilities of securities companies, perfect the self-regulatory management cooperation mechanism with the Securities Association of China and the Asset Management Association of China and intensify the regulation on trading of quantitative&nbsp;and&nbsp;private institutions. In addition, SZSE will increase communication with HKEX and under the principle of equal treatment for domestic and foreign capital, clarify reporting arrangements for&nbsp;northbound&nbsp;investors under the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect and include quantitative trading by&nbsp;northbound&nbsp;investors in the reporting scope. SZSE will resolutely take self-regulatory measures against abnormal trading that affects the market order and report those suspected of violating laws and regulations and having serious circumstances to the CSRC for investigation and punishment.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>On February 19, during trading monitoring,&nbsp;SZSE discovered that from 9:30:00 to 9:30:42, multiple securities accounts of Ningbo Lingjun Investment Management Partnership (Limited Partnership) (&ldquo;Ningbo Lingjun&rdquo;) automatically generated trading instructions through computer programs and placed large quantities of orders in a short time. Stocks amounting to CNY 1.372 billion were sold through such accounts&nbsp;and&nbsp;the Shenzhen Component Index fell rapidly&nbsp;during&nbsp;that&nbsp;period, affecting the normal trading order. This constituted an abnormal trading activity specified in Item 6 of Article 6.2 of the Trading Rules of Shenzhen Stock Exchange. The securities accounts of Ningbo Lingjun continued abnormal trading activities though they have been repeatedly subject to regulatory measures such as written warning by SZSE for such activities since this year.</p>
<p>According to the Implementing Rules for Restricted&nbsp;Trading, the Implementing Measures for Self-disciplinary Supervision and Disciplinary Measures and other relevant provisions of SZSE, we decided to take trading restriction measures against the relevant securities accounts of Ningbo Lingjun from February 20, 2024 to February 22, 2024, during which period&nbsp;Ningbo Lingjun is restricted from trading in all stocks listed and traded on SZSE. In addition,&nbsp;we&nbsp;initiated the disciplinary sanction procedures for public censure against Ningbo Lingjun.</p>
<p>SZSE will, in accordance with the unified arrangement of the CSRC, resolutely implement the requirements of strict and tough regulation, adhere to the primary responsibility for regulation and treat regulation as its primary business and constantly strengthen trading regulation. Moreover, SZSE will always maintain a strict tone and a tough stance of &ldquo;zero tolerance&rdquo; for, quickly respond to and crack down on&nbsp;the&nbsp;illegalities and violations that affect the normal order of the market and damage the legitimate rights and interests of investors. At the same time, SZSE reminds investors to participate in trading in accordance with laws and regulations to jointly maintain the normal trading order of the market.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The National Anti-Scam Centre is warning consumers to beware of fake news articles and deepfake videos of public figures that endorse and link to online investment trading platform scams, particularly on social media.</p>
<p>Last year, Australians reported losing more than $8 million to online investment trading platform scams, with 400 reports made to Scamwatch.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are urging Australians to take their time and do their research before taking up an investment opportunity &ndash; particularly those seen on social media,&rsquo; ACCC Deputy Chair Catriona Lowe said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Scammers are creating fake news articles and deepfake videos to convince people that celebrities and well-known public figures are making huge sums of money using online investment trading platforms, when in fact it is a scam.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;These fake videos and news articles circulating on social media and video sharing platforms, often claim that the online trading platform uses artificial intelligence or other emerging technologies such as quantum computing to generate high returns for investors, but it is not true,&rsquo; Ms Lowe said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We know of an Australian man who lost $80,000 in cryptocurrency after seeing a deepfake Elon Musk video interview on social media, clicking the link and registering his details through an online form. He was provided with an account manager and an online dashboard where he could see his investment supposedly making huge returns. But when he tried to withdraw the money &ndash; he was locked out of his account.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Reports to Scamwatch indicate the most prolific online investment trading platform scam appears under the brand &lsquo;Quantum AI&rsquo;. Others include &lsquo;Immediate Edge&rsquo;, &lsquo;Immediate Connect&rsquo;, &lsquo;Immediate X3&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Quantum Trade Wave&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The National Anti-Scam Centre&rsquo;s investment scam fusion cell, co-led by the ACCC and ASIC, has been active in disrupting investment scams such as online investment trading platform scams.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In addition to referring these scam ads to social media platforms for removal, the fusion cell has developed a trial method for blocking payments to these scams,&rsquo; Ms Lowe said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It has been encouraging to see an overall downward trend in losses reported to Scamwatch to investment scams since the establishment of the fusion cell in July 2023.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The ACCC and ASIC will continue to work together as part of the National Anti-Scam Centre's efforts to stop scammers from harming Australians.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>How online investment trading platform scams work</h2>
<ul>
<li>Scammers entice victims through social media advertisements, deepfake videos on video sharing platforms and fake online news articles about celebrities and well-known public figures claiming to make substantial money from online trading platforms.</li>
<li>This fake click bait will link to a scam website where victims are prompted to enter their details. This is the gateway for communication between the scammer and victim.</li>
<li>Scammers ask for a small investment of around $250 via credit card to provide access to the trading platform.</li>
<li>Scammers will often ask the new investor to download a third-party trading platform via the relevant app store or provide the investor with login details for an online dashboard.</li>
<li>After showing profits through a dedicated online dashboard, scammers persuade their victims to invest more. Sometimes scammers will allow victims to make a small withdrawal early in the scam to build trust.</li>
<li>When the victim eventually tries to withdraw their funds, scammers will ask for withdrawal fees or cite tax implications to obtain more money. Some victims have reported being locked out of their account.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Protect yourself</h3>
<p><span>STOP</span>&nbsp;&ndash; Don&rsquo;t give personal information or act on investment advice you have come across on social media. Don&rsquo;t feel pressured to invest. If you have any doubts, stop communicating with them.</p>
<p><span>THINK</span>&nbsp;&ndash; Ask yourself if you really know what you are investing in? Scammers can create fake news to make it seem legitimate. Do an internet search to see if there are warnings about this investment trading platform scam, including if the well-known public figure has warned about being impersonated.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>PROTECT</span>&nbsp;&ndash; Act quickly if something feels wrong. If you have shared financial information or transferred money, contact your bank immediately. Help others by reporting scams to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.scamwatch.gov.au/report-a-scam">Scamwatch</a>.</p>
<h3>Investor information</h3>
<p>Before investing, Australians can make these simple practical checks to help reduce the risk of investment scams:</p>
<ul>
<li>check ASIC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://moneysmart.gov.au/check-and-report-scams/investor-alert-list">investor alert list</a>&nbsp;to help keep you informed about investments that could be fraudulent, a scam or unlicensed.</li>
<li>go to&nbsp;ASIC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://moneysmart.gov.au/check-and-report-scams/check-before-you-invest">Check before you invest</a>&nbsp;page to see how you can check if the company or person is licensed or authorised to offer the investment.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>On February 8, SZSE formulated and issued the&nbsp;<i>Self-Regulatory Guidelines No.17 for Companies Listed&nbsp;</i><i>on&nbsp;</i>Shenzhen Stock Exchange<i>&nbsp;- Sustainable Development Report (for Trial Implementation) (</i><i>E</i><i>xposure</i><i>&nbsp;</i><i>Draft)</i>&nbsp;(hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;<i>Guidelines for Sustainable Development Report</i>&rdquo;) to solicit comments from the market. This is an important measure for SZSE to implement the&nbsp;guiding principles&nbsp;of the 20th CPC National Congress, the Central Economic Work Conference and the Central Financial Work Conference and fully, accurately and comprehensively carry out the new development concept. With this measure, SZSE&nbsp;aims to&nbsp;standardize the disclosure requirements for sustainable development information of listed companies, instruct listed companies to practice the concept of sustainable development and promote the improvement of the quality of listed companies.&nbsp;This&nbsp;helps give full play to the hub function of the capital market, guides the gathering of factors in the field of sustainable development, further builds industrial clusters with sustainable investment value and facilitates the realization of the strategic goals of &ldquo;carbon peaking and carbon neutrality&rdquo;. It also drives the enhancement of governance ability, competitiveness, innovation ability, anti-risk ability, medium and long-term sustainable development ability and long-term stable return ability of listed companies, enhances listed companies&rsquo; attraction to long-term capital and further consolidates the foundation for the high-quality development of listed companies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;According to the report to the 20th CPC National Congress, driving low-carbon economic and social development is the key link in achieving high-quality development, which is the primary task for comprehensively building a modern socialist country. The Central Economic Work Conference proposed to actively yet prudently promote carbon peaking and carbon neutrality and accelerate the creation of a low-carbon supply chain. The Central Financial Work Conference pointed out the effective implementation of five major tasks including green finance. In the&nbsp;<i>Three-year Action Plan for Promoting the Improvement of Quality of Listed Companies (2022-2025)</i>, CSRC requires the establishment of a sound disclosure system for sustainable development information,&nbsp;the&nbsp;formulation of a system of disclosure rules for sustainable development information of listed companies&nbsp;that is&nbsp;based on China&rsquo;s actual situation, in line with international trends and with Chinese characteristics,&nbsp;the&nbsp;definition of the implementation path and&nbsp;the&nbsp;gradual promotion as planned in stages. The aim is to better play the role of finance in serving national strategies, supporting high-quality development and practicing social responsibilities and further optimize resource allocation.</p>
<p>Under the guidance of CSRC, SZSE has steadily advanced the drafting of the&nbsp;<i>Guidelines for Sustainable Development Report</i>&nbsp;with the overall thinking of three aspects.&nbsp;Firstly, being practical and realistic.&nbsp;After fully considering the development stage and disclosure ability of listed companies in China, SZSE achieves the matching of cost and benefit through the combination of mandatory and voluntary disclosure, combination of qualitative and quantitative disclosure, setting of transitional period and mitigation measures.&nbsp;Secondly,&nbsp;upholding&nbsp;systematic thinking.&nbsp;SZSE helps listed companies build a sound governance mechanism related to sustainable development, establishes a disclosure framework with &ldquo;governance - strategy - impact, risk and opportunity management - indicators and objectives&rdquo; as&nbsp;the&nbsp;core elements and drives high-quality information disclosure with better internal governance and concrete actions.&nbsp;Thirdly, learning from good practices and reflecting Chinese characteristics.&nbsp;SZSE summarizes the current domestic and foreign disclosure systems and excellent practices, refers to national standards and industry norms and actively absorbs international beneficial experience. Based on the actual situation of China&rsquo;s capital market, SZSE sets specific topics such as rural revitalization and innovation-driven concept to fully reflect the characteristics and advantages of China&rsquo;s listed companies in the field of sustainable development.</p>
<p>Following the above drafting ideas, the&nbsp;<i>Guidelines for Sustainable Development Report</i>&nbsp;consists&nbsp;of 58 articles in 6 chapters covering 20 specific topics, further enriching&nbsp;and improving&nbsp;the information disclosure requirements related to sustainable development on the basis of the existing rules. It specifies that listed companies shall analyze and disclose the topics to be disclosed around four core&nbsp;aspects, namely, governance, strategy, impact&nbsp;-&nbsp;risk&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;opportunity management,&nbsp;and indicators&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;objectives, so that investors and stakeholders can fully understand the actions taken by listed companies to cope with and manage impacts, risks and opportunities related to sustainable development. Meanwhile, it sets multiple topics including carbon emissions, pollutants, ecosystem and biodiversity, circular economy utilization, rural revitalization and supply chain security in such aspects as environment, society and corporate governance. In terms of implementation method, it clarifies that&nbsp;the&nbsp;constituents continuously included in the Shenzhen 100 Index and the ChiNext Index during the reporting period and&nbsp;the&nbsp;companies listed&nbsp;simultaneously&nbsp;at home and abroad shall disclose the&nbsp;<i>Sustainable Development Report</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;that&nbsp;other listed companies are encouraged to make disclosure voluntarily. It also defines that&nbsp;listed companies shall disclose the information related to some important topics through qualitative and quantitative methods, so as to facilitate horizontal and vertical comparison by investors and stakeholders. Meanwhile, it sets mitigation measures for quantitative disclosure requirements&nbsp;including that listed companies can make qualitative disclosure and explain the reasons for the indicators that are more difficult to disclose quantitatively in the first reporting period. In terms of transitional arrangements and other mitigation measures, in order to help listed companies build capacity and prepare for implementation in advance, listed companies that are required to disclose the&nbsp;<i>Sustainable Development Report</i>&nbsp;can disclose the 2025&nbsp;<i>Sustainable Development Report</i>&nbsp;for the first time before April 30, 2026 at the latest. If it is difficult to quantitatively disclose the impact of sustainable development-related risks and opportunities on the current financial position during the reporting periods of 2025 and 2026, it can be only disclosed qualitatively.</p>
<p>SZSE has always adhered to the concept of sustainable development, actively carried out practices related to sustainable development, instructed listed companies to actively fulfill their social responsibilities and&nbsp;has&nbsp;been committed to building a group of listed companies that meet the requirements of low-carbon sustainable development. SZSE has successively issued the&nbsp;<i>White Paper on Environmental Information Disclosure of SZSE-listed Companies</i>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<i>White Paper on Sustainable Development Information Disclosure of SZSE-listed Companies.</i>&nbsp;These help guide&nbsp;listed companies to strengthen their awareness of sustainable development information disclosure and actively practice the concept of sustainable development by sharing the practices and excellent cases of sustainable development information disclosure of SZSE-listed companies. In 2022, more than 2,700 SZSE-listed companies disclosed their social responsibility performance in their annual reports; more than 1,100 ones disclosed information on pollution prevention, resource conservation and ecological protection; and more than 800 ones released independent social responsibility reports or ESG reports, further improving the quality of ESG information disclosure.&nbsp;According to the statistics of the United Nations on total carbon emissions of companies listed on stock exchanges of G20 countries, SZSE-listed companies ranked first in low carbon with the lowest total carbon emissions.</p>
<p>Next, SZSE will, in accordance with the unified deployments of CSRC, continue to listen to the opinions and suggestions of market participants through multiple means, fully study and absorb reasonable opinions and suggestions and timely release them to the market for implementation. SZSE will constantly improve the system of sustainable development rules, cultivate leading companies in the field of sustainable development, enrich the system of sustainable development products, optimize the system of sustainable development services, strive to build a benchmark for sustainable exchanges and help create a low-carbon and sustainable market ecology.</p>
