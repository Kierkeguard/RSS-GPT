<div> Clearing, OTC Clear, Swap Connect, CFETS, SHCH <br />
Summary:<br />
HKEX's clearing subsidiary OTC Clear has introduced enhancements to Swap Connect with CFETS and SHCH, including IMM trades and solo compression. Fees waived. <div>
<p class="spanHeading"><span>Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) is pleased to announce today (Monday) that its clearing subsidiary OTC Clear has implemented three enhancements to Swap Connect in partnership with China Foreign Exchange Trade System (CFETS) and Shanghai Clearing House (SHCH), celebrating the first anniversary of this pioneering derivatives mutual market access programme.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>The enhancements will provide more flexibility for international investors to manage RMB interest rate risk through China&rsquo;s onshore interbank markets.</span></p>
<p class="spanHeading">The new enhancements include:</p>
<ul>
<li class="spanHeading">The introduction of International Monetary Market (IMM) trades based on IMM dates, i.e. the third Wednesday of March, June, September and December, to align with common practices on international interest rate swap markets.</li>
<li class="spanHeading">The launch of solo compression service that enables participating institutions to compress trades with equal but opposite economics. Through this service, Swap Connect participants may unwind their original cleared trades before the maturity date, reducing their capital costs and increasing transaction settlement efficiency.</li>
<li class="spanHeading">The introduction of backdated trades, which allow trades with a past effective date and can be used with solo compression for trade unwinding.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="spanHeading">To reduce transaction costs for Swap Connect participants, OTC Clear, CFETS and SHCH will continue to waive their trading and clearing fees for one year. The fee for compression service will also be waived in its initial stage.</p>
<p class="spanHeading">Swap Connect, a mutual access programme linking Hong Kong and Mainland China&rsquo;s interbank interest rate swap markets, has seen smooth operations and steady increases in trading volume since its launch on 15 May 2023, adding vibrancy into both Hong Kong and Mainland China&rsquo;s financial markets.</p>
<p class="spanHeading">In celebration of the first anniversary of Swap Connect, HKEX has launched the enhancements in partnership with CFETS and SHCH with the support of Hong Kong and Mainland China regulators. These measures are aimed at enabling more international institutional investors to manage interest rate risk on their continuously increasing RMB bond investment with RMB interest rate swaps, enhancing Hong Kong&rsquo;s competitiveness as an international financial centre and supporting the internationalisation of RMB.</p>
<p class="spanHeading"><span>A total of 26 onshore and offshore institutions have conducted IMM trades with an aggregate nominal amount of RMB 5.48 billion today. Four onshore and offshore institutions have used the solo compression service, reducing nominal amount of RMB 5.5 billion.</span></p>
<p class="spanHeading">HKEX looks forward to working closely with its Mainland partners, regulators and market participants to further enhance and develop the Swap Connect programme, facilitating the continued opening of China's financial markets and the internationalisation of the RMB.</p>
<p class="spanHeading">Further details of the enhancements can be found in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hkex.com.hk/Global/Exchange/FAQ/Featured/Swap-Connect?sc_lang=en"><span><span>FAQs&nbsp;</span></span></a>published by OTC Clear.</p>

<title>CloudMargin Achieves Substantial Growth In Revenue For Fiscal Year Ended March 31 - Company Marks 10-Year Anniversary With Above-Target Performance, Strongest Pipeline To Date As Automation In Collateral Management Takes On Increased Importance</title>

<div> Revenue growth, collateral management, automation, CloudMargin platform, liquidity preparedness
Summary:<br />CloudMargin achieved 35% revenue growth, marking its 10th anniversary. Automation in collateral management and liquidity preparedness were key drivers. <div>
<p>CloudMargin, a leading global collateral management technology company, announced today that it achieved 35% revenue growth for the fiscal year ended&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">March 31, 2024</span>, ahead of its annual target. The company saw a rise in the value of new annual contracts signed, along with increased business from existing clients, as automation in collateral management assumed a role of increasing importance in firms' risk mitigation strategies. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The strong performance comes as CloudMargin celebrates its 10<span>th</span>&nbsp;anniversary as the world's first collateral and margin management solution created specifically for the cloud. The Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) company signed its first client &ndash; a UK bank &ndash; in 2014. Today, clients range from asset managers and pension funds to banks, brokerages, insurance firms, fund administrators, outsourcers and major industry service providers across the globe. They use the CloudMargin platform to manage their collateral for cleared and uncleared over-the-counter (OTC) products, exchange-traded derivatives, repo and Stock Borrowing and Lending (SBL) products.</p>
<p>CloudMargin CEO&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Stuart Connolly</span>&nbsp;said: "We're extraordinarily pleased with the growth of our franchise over the past year and the significant opportunities we intend to leverage in this new fiscal year as we celebrate our 10<span>th</span>&nbsp;anniversary milestone. We have the strongest pipeline in our history, and while we continue to see demand from the buy-side, regional banks are now especially keen to ensure their collateral and margin management program is robust and state-of-the-art. Using the CloudMargin platform, firms can realize substantial cost efficiencies and market-leading automation, with customized reporting, dynamic dashboards to access real-time data and seamless workflow across the entire trade lifecycle."</p>
<p>Connolly said numerous macroeconomic episodes over the past few years have highlighted that in times of market stress, even some of the largest firms and financial institutions have been challenged by inadequate liquidity and preparedness for increased margin calls. These events have captured the attention of regulators and board members intent on preventing future disasters. He said automation of collateral processing is now a necessity, as evidenced by&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4169783-1&amp;h=2784328356&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fsb.org%2F2024%2F04%2Ffsb-proposes-measures-to-enhance-the-liquidity-preparedness-of-non-bank-market-participants-for-margin-and-collateral-calls-during-times-of-market-wide-stress%2F&amp;a=proposed+measures+announced+last+month" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">proposed measures announced last month</a>&nbsp;by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) to enhance the liquidity preparedness of non-bank market participants for margin and collateral calls during market-wide stress.</p>
<p>Over the course of the past year, CloudMargin's platform &ndash; accessed in 52 countries by more than 210 organizations &ndash; processed over twice the amount of margin calls exchanged in 2022. The continuously enhanced platform released more than 1,130 updates and introduced 30 new and improved features, automatically benefiting users of the SaaS service.</p>

Summary:<br />Ben reflects on MPC experience, highlighting global shocks' impact on supply and costs over demand, emphasizing the need for inflation-motivated monetary policy.<br /> <div>

<p><a class="med-block-cta " href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/about/people/ben-broadbent/biography">Deputy Governor, Monetary Policy</a></p>
</div>
</p>
<p><span>Ben surveys his time on the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). He explains how the UK economy has been subject to several large, global shocks that have affected supply and costs more than demand. In that environment it is all the more important that monetary policy be conducted by an independent authority in pursuit of a fixed inflation objective.</span></p>
<h3>Speech</h3>
<h4>Introduction and summary</h4>
<p>Good morning! Thank you for asking me here today. After thirteen years as a member of the MPC this is my thirty-eighth and last speech and I wanted to offer a few reflections from that experience. I will also say something about the current outlook for inflation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly been an eventful time. I joined the Committee in 2011, when the economy was still feeling the effects of the global financial crisis (GFC) three years earlier. That was then followed by the Euro area debt crisis, which perpetuated the credit squeeze in this country. After a period of relative calm we then went through the EU referendum and the negotiations that ensued, followed at the start of the current decade by the enormous effects of the pandemic and Russia&rsquo;s war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Mervyn King once described the years preceding the GFC as the &ldquo;NICE&rdquo; decade (standing for &ldquo;Non-Inflationary and Consistently Expansionary&rdquo;). I&rsquo;m not sure how one would characterise the period since (&ldquo;Not-AS-Tranquil Years&rdquo;?). But, if his description was designed as a warning that we couldn&rsquo;t expect such stability to last indefinitely, he&rsquo;s certainly been proved right.</p>
<p>Rather than going through these events individually I want to have a go at drawing some general conclusions from them.</p>
<p>From an economic perspective, two things strike one straightaway.</p>
<p>First, none of them involves simple shocks to aggregate demand. Arguably, macroeconomics &ndash; certainly the Keynesian macroeconomics taught to students &ndash; was born of an era (the Great Depression) characterised by a chronic shortage of spending. That may be why students are taught quite a bit about the determination of demand but less, at least to begin with, about the behaviour of supply and costs.</p>
<p>But while these events had at least some direct impact on demand &ndash; there&rsquo;s no doubt, for example, that business investment in the UK suffered from tighter financial conditions during the GFC and the Euro area debt crisis and then again from the uncertainty about the UK&rsquo;s trading relationships after the EU referendum &ndash; these were outweighed, as far as inflation is concerned, by their impact on costs and supply. The depreciations in sterling&rsquo;s exchange rate in 2009 and 2016 led to periods of above-target inflation, notwithstanding any dampening effect on confidence and spending. The pandemic &ndash; to take a more extreme example &ndash; raised the cost of globally traded goods by so much that, even after GDP fell by more than a fifth in 2020, inflation rose significantly the following year, in the UK and across the developed world. So the notion that economic fluctuations are dominated by disturbances to aggregate demand, against a backdrop of an unchanging supply schedule, simply isn&rsquo;t &ndash; or at least hasn&rsquo;t been &ndash; true. In contrast to the earlier period, the correlation between output growth and changes in inflation has if anything been negative since the early 1990s (Chart 1). This doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that supply-type shocks have become more common, as I&rsquo;ll explain in a bit. But that certainly seems to have been the case in the past decade or so.</p>

<p><span>Speaker:</span>&nbsp;Sarah Pritchard, Executive Director, Markets and Executive Director, International<br /><span>Event:</span>&nbsp;TheCityUK - City Week 2024<br /><span>Delivered:</span>&nbsp;20 May 2024<br /><span> </span></p>
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>We are committed to making sure that regulation supports the UK&rsquo;s position in global wholesale markets as well as facilitating the UK&rsquo;s economic growth and international competitiveness.</li>
<li>Our outcomes based approach will continue to support innovation, helping our markets remain efficient.</li>
<li>We welcome views and engagement on our reform agenda and the way we operate, so that we can support the continuation of effective and efficient capital markets.</li>
</ul>
<br /> 
<hr />
<p>I&rsquo;m going to let you into a secret.</p>
<p>A fact not known widely about me is my hobby of outdoor cold water swimming.</p>
<p>While getting up early sometimes to delve into icy waters is not everyone&rsquo;s idea of fun, for me there is a certain exhilaration about those first steps into the water and braving the elements.</p>
<p>This is not a risk free activity &ndash; quite the opposite in winter without a wetsuit.</p>
<p>The challenge is in preparing for the elements, being alert to the level of risk, looking at the water thermometer, listening to feedback from my fellow swimmers and my body to work out how long to stay in for &ndash; and keeping to a steady rhythm whether the water be covered with ice, or a comparatively balmy 20 degrees.</p>
<p>I have developed a rather consistent and predictable technique for maintaining stamina throughout the winter months &ndash; rounding off each swim with a nice warm drink to gently warm up.</p>
<p>I take the same approach to my job. While the economic and financial weather may not always be calm and sunny, we need to make sure that our rules work and can adapt for all types of challenges and can cope with some serious buffeting, at the worst of times.</p>
<p>I also know that regulatory certainty and predictability is important &ndash; as well as our ability to adapt and focus on outcomes &ndash; whatever the external environment.</p>
<h2>Regulation to support efficient capital markets</h2>
<p>The size and scale of the UK financial sector is worth reflecting on. It employs more than 2.5 million people and produced &pound;278bn of economic output, which is 12% of the entire UK&rsquo;s economic output, contributing &pound;100bn in tax revenue.</p>
<p>Its importance is what fires me up every day while doing my job.</p>
<p>So, an efficient and effective capital market underpins the success of the financial sector which is a mainstay of the UK economy.</p>
<p>The FCA is committed to making sure that regulation &ndash; and the way we operate as regulators &ndash; supports the UK&rsquo;s position in global wholesale markets as well as facilitating the UK&rsquo;s economic growth and international competitiveness.&nbsp;As we look to our ambitious agenda for regulatory reform &ndash; we start from a strong place.</p>
<p>London is second only to New York in the latest Z/Yen rankings of global financial centres.</p>
<p>But that does not mean there is no scope for further efficiency or indeed reform, and reform which involves a different balance of risk. You will have seen that across the capital markets agenda we are doing just that, through a package of reform which has been well signalled since various government led reviews examining the strength of the UK&rsquo;s wholesale markets in 2021 &ndash; and which are now at the implementation phase.</p>
<p>The reforms include the most significant changes to our listings regime in 40 years, with proposals that would do away with the current separate categories of premium and standard listings for commercial companies in favour of a single category, which will operate with more of a disclosure based philosophy instead of ex-ante controls.</p>
<p>The proposals aim to support investors to make their own decisions on risk and where to invest, based on appropriate disclosure and other safeguards to preserve market integrity and investors&rsquo; decision making.</p>
<p>We hope that these reforms will help to boost the UK growth and competitiveness by making our regime more attractive to a wider range of companies, so they are encouraged to list and grow here and so that our framework better aligns with international comparators.</p>
<p>But as we know that these reforms will involve a different balance of risk we have sought to engage extensively across the market, including with investors, to build as much consensus as possible before we reach our final decisions by the summer.</p>
<p>We also know that while regulation can provide the foundations for a successful capital market, it will not necessarily by itself achieve that &ndash; other factors are relevant too.</p>
<h2>Proportionate capital markets reform</h2>
<p>As we take the opportunity of the new smarter regulatory framework, we are busy working on incremental changes where change is sensible to support our objectives &ndash; albeit this is not simply change for change&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p>We are grasping the opportunities and ambition set out by the government in the Edinburgh reforms. Through reforms that establish a new consolidated tape for bonds, which should result in cheaper, higher quality and more accessible data for its users. To changes to the bond and derivative transparency regime &ndash; which aim to recalibrate the regime to drive greater transparency but at a lower cost, for trading venues and investment firms, through more proportionate and better calibrated requirements.</p>
<p>Our work seeks to support transparency through disclosure of relevant, prompt and quality information to investors. This would strengthen investors&rsquo; abilities to make decisions and support price formation, market participation and confidence in markets. But in a proportionate manner and cost.</p>
<p>We also know that one size doesn&rsquo;t always fit all &ndash; which is why we have acted quickly in response to the Government-commissioned Investment Research Review, chaired by Rachel Kent, to support greater optionality around how firms can pay for research.</p>
<p>Our proposed reforms seek to give asset managers and others greater flexibility on how they buy research. This greater choice should suit firms of varying business models and sizes, helping to promote competition. It will allow the &lsquo;bundling&rsquo; of payments for third-party research and trade execution, and would exist alongside those already available, such as payment from an asset manager's own resources or from a dedicated account.</p>
<p>The new plans are also compatible with rules governing research payments in certain other major jurisdictions, making it easier for asset managers to buy research in the same way, across borders.</p>
<h2>Predictable but future focused regulation</h2>
<p>Markets are never static and to be efficient they must be able to adapt.</p>
<p>Our shift to outcomes focused regulation is deliberate &ndash; we believe that this approach will better support innovation and changing markets, supporting the UK&rsquo;s growth and competitiveness and helping markets remain efficient.</p>
<p>To be a success, predictability and agility is important. This is not as incongruous as it sounds.</p>
<p>We want to take the opportunity of the reform that is underway, to be as future facing as possible. I do not want us to be regulating for problems of the past &ndash; rather using the lessons from the past to help us set the framework and outcomes that we want to see &ndash; balancing our objectives for the future to support markets as they develop.</p>
<p>AI is a case in point. We will not be regulating for regulation&rsquo;s sake and will be guided by our outcomes-driven approach. But we must provide certainty and encourage the safe adoption of AI in UK finance markets, so we must also look at digital infrastructure, resilience, consumer safety and data.</p>
<h2>Innovation and international engagement</h2>
<p>The FCA innovation services are world leading. Our innovation sandbox is 10 years old this year, and our sandbox model has been replicated by over 95 international regulators.</p>
<p>While the number of applications from wholesale firms, in comparison to all applications, is not as high as we would like as they may not be aware of the opportunities, wholesale firms are in the top 4 sectors that accessed our innovation services in 2023.</p>
<p>Areas where we are providing support are in Distributed Ledger Technology and blockchain technology, mobile application and web platforms, AI and machine learning and Application Programming Interface.</p>
<p>We are also working with leading industry and academic experts to understand future market developments. This year, for example, we have published a&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/quantum-security-for-the-financial-sector-informing-global-regulatory-approaches/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">paper on Quantum Security<span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;with the World Economic Forum, and a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/corporate/report-using-synthetic-data-in-financial-services.pdf" title="report-using-synthetic-data-in-financial-services.pdf">paper of Synthetic Data best practice</a>&nbsp;through our Synthetic Data Expert Group.</p>
<p>Our innovation offerings test and encourage innovation and future competitiveness and are a key offering which helps to support new market developments. Through our Early and High Growth Oversight approach we have supported more than 300 newly authorised firms to understand their obligations and meet the standards we expect, particularly innovative firms which may need more support.</p>
<p>The schemes help us understand and adapt to financial technology trends, provide expertise and insights, support agile regulation and enable global thought leadership on innovation. We support new beneficial and responsible business models and services being launched.</p>
<p>A recent&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://academic.oup.com/rof/article-abstract/28/1/203/7140150?redirectedFrom=fulltext&amp;login=false" rel="noopener" target="_blank">paper<span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;published in 'Review of Finance' Journal found that firms entering the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/innovation/regulatory-sandbox" title="Regulatory Sandbox">Regulatory Sandbox</a>&nbsp;see an increase of 15% in capital raised and are 50% more likely to raise capital than their peers, as well as the Sandbox having 'significant positive effect on survival rates and patenting'.</p>
<p>Supplementing our domestic sandboxes and innovation offerings we lead and chair the&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.thegfin.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Global Financial Innovation Network (GFIN)<span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;&ndash; a global sandbox if you like &ndash; bringing together more than 80 members globally, from member jurisdictions which represent around 44% of global GDP.</p>
<p>The GFIN looks to give a more efficient way for innovative firms to interact with regulators, helping them navigate between countries as they look to scale new ideas. This includes the ability to conduct a cross-border test &ndash; a solution for firms wishing to test innovative products, services or business models across more than one jurisdiction.</p>
<p>It also aims to create a new framework for co-operation between financial services regulators on innovation related topics, sharing different experiences and approaches.</p>
<p>We have also taken a leading role in areas like environmental, social and governance (ESG) labelling and the Sustainability Disclosure Regime where industry has welcomed our proposals and asked other jurisdictions to follow our lead.</p>
<p>Innovation is key in ensuring our capital markets are, and remain, efficient. And we are committed to continuing to support this &ndash; whether that be through regulation (if that is needed) or by a test and learn philosophy through our innovation offerings and international partnerships.</p>
<h2>Working together in a changing world</h2>
<p>While we concentrate on supporting a healthy and efficient market sector in the UK, we cannot ignore what seems to be an increasingly turbulent geo-political world. Of course, we cannot control world events or the rapid pace of change across economies. We live in sometimes staggering times of technological change, changing demographics and international marketplaces.</p>
<p>There are often differing regimes in place internationally but as the world economy and financial markets are ever more global, we are leading the way in key areas where international cohesion is most important such as digitisation and crypto. We also maintain close relationships with international partners on market risk &ndash; which often arises across border.</p>
<p>Having worked in global roles in an international bank, I understand how important it is to be able to have as straightforward an operating model as possible across international borders &ndash; and how the ability to do so depends on as consistent standards as possible.</p>
<p>Agreements internationally are never easy and defining rules at home can be challenging too as firms often have different views about what the framework should be, depending on their operating model and geographic footprint.</p>
<p>So how we set rules, test them and engage with the market is vital.</p>
<p>You will have seen us increasingly convene roundtables to discuss our consultation proposals &ndash; and sometimes seek to test various options during our consultation process. We want to test that our regulation will drive the right outcomes.</p>
<p>Input from the market as we design our future facing rules is key to avoiding unintended consequences or worse, taking a hammer to crack a nut. Confidence in the market is essential, underpinned by a clear regulatory regime.</p>
<p>On that note, I want to say that I know there have been concerns about our proposals to announce the fact of some enforcement investigations earlier on in the process where it is in the public interest to do so. We recognise that this is a sensitive and emotive issue so we will take time to consider the feedback, engage further with industry and explore thoroughly the concerns and evidence shared with us, with an aim of reaching a broad consensus.</p>
<p>Be assured that we do listen. We are evidence-led so will only act where a failure to do so would cause harm to consumers and undermine the integrity of our markets.</p>
<p>Before I wrap up, I wanted to thank you all for your time today. And for your robustness in engaging with us on our reform agenda, as well as the way we operate, so that we can support the continuation of effective and efficient capital markets.</p>
<p>I welcome that input and engagement.</p>
<p>Please keep speaking to us. It shouldn&rsquo;t be arduous work. I would like it to be more like the experience of having a warm cup of tea after a challenging outdoor swim.</p>

<div> Bursa Malaysia, investor safeguards, Trading Reminders, unusual trading activity, Unusual Market Activity (UMA)<br />
Summary:<br /> Bursa Malaysia introduces Trading Reminders to alert investors of unusual trading activity, complementing existing market regulation for investor protection. <div>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad (&ldquo;Bursa Malaysia&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Exchange&rdquo;) is bolstering its investor safeguards with the introduction of Trading Reminders with immediate effect, a new tool highlighting listed companies that exhibit unusual trading activity. The Trading Reminders issued by Bursa Malaysia, will be in addition to the Unusual Market Activity (UMA) queries by the Exchange that prompt public disclosure from public listed companies (PLCs) experiencing significant, unexplained price or volume movements.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">Bursa Malaysia has observed instances where share prices and volumes remain volatile despite PLCs responding that there were no new developments in their UMA response. Hence, the Trading Reminder flag<a href="https://www.bursamalaysia.com/about_bursa/media_centre/bursa-malaysia-introduces-additional-measures-to-encourage-informed-investing#_ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;aims to alert investors to exercise caution when encountering a stock displaying persistent unusual price and/or volume movements after the listed company's UMA response.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">This initiative complements Bursa Malaysia's existing multi-pronged approach to market regulation. Pre-emptive actions, including engagement with Participating Organisations to address irregular trading concerns, remain a cornerstone of efforts on investor protection. Bursa Malaysia also retains the option to issue Market Alerts and Designations, which caution investors on stocks susceptible to excessive speculation or manipulation. The Exchange also reiterates it will not hesitate to pursue enforcement action against recalcitrant brokers who disrupt market order.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">These enhanced investor protection measures contribute to the Exchange&rsquo;s commitment to foster an efficient and vibrant trading environment. Full details on these measures are available on the Bursa Malaysia website at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bursamalaysia.com/regulation/about_bursa_malaysia_regulatory/market_surveillance/overview" title="Link: https://www.bursamalaysia.com/regulation/about_bursa_malaysia_regulatory/market_surveillance/overview">https://www.bursamalaysia.com/regulation/about_bursa_malaysia_regulatory/market_surveillance/overview</a>&nbsp;.</p>

<div> FMA, Rangi Wyatt Stephen Savage, civil proceedings, unregulated public offer, shares
<br />
Summary:
FMA filed civil proceedings against Rangi Wyatt Stephen Savage for unregulated sale of shares, making false representations, and accepting applications without a Product Disclosure Statement. <div>
<p>The Financial Markets Authority (FMA) &ndash; Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko &ndash; has filed civil proceedings against Rangi Wyatt Stephen Savage for making an unregulated public offer for the sale of shares in The Powder Shed Tokoroa Limited (Powder Shed). Mr Savage was the sole director of Powder Shed.</p>
<p>Mr Savage is accused of breaching the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 (FMC Act) by:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Making false or misleading representations [1]&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Making a regulated offer without a Product Disclosure Statement (PDS) [2]&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Accepting an application for a transfer of financial products without a PDS [3]&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr Savage is alleged to have made false or misleading representations in April to July 2020 in online presentations and social media videos when promoting the sale of shares in Powder Shed to potential investors. At no point during the time the offers were made was a PDS for the offer lodged or provided to investors. &nbsp;</p>
<p>More than 160 individual investors applied to purchase shares in Powder Shed. Approximately 65,000 shares in the company were sold and issued to investors at USD$1.20 per share. Investors paid in USD and in cryptocurrency. The total amount obtained equates to approximately NZD$122,000.</p>
<p>The FMA is seeking a declaration that Mr Savage breached the FMC Act, that Mr Savage pay compensation to investors, Mr Savage pay a pecuniary penalty to the Crown, and a banning order preventing Mr Savage from being a director or involved in the management of a company.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Notes&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Sections of the FMC Act alleged to have been breached: &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>[1] Section 22 &nbsp;</li>
<li>[2] Section 48(1) &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
<li>[3] Section 50&nbsp;</li>

<div> Class of 2024, Law degree, Georgetown, Change, Leadership<br />
<br />Summary: Congratulations to the Class of 2024 for earning their law degrees. Embrace change, take risks, and aim for leadership. Your legal education sets you up for success on a wide variety of potential paths. Consider giving back and using your gifts to make a difference. <div>
<p>Thank you, Dean Treanor, for the invitation to speak here today. I am very sorry that circumstances prevent me from joining you in person.</p>
<p>I will start by acknowledging the parents, spouses, partners, other family members and mentors who are here. Without your support, sacrifice, and encouragement, we would not have so much to celebrate today.</p>
<p>And to the class of 2024&mdash;congratulations on earning your law degree. You are the most selective class in Georgetown history, chosen from 14,000 applicants, and the most well qualified as well. Among you are Fulbright scholars, military veterans, Peace Corps, AmeriCorps and Teach for America alumni, student athletes, accomplished musicians and even a medical doctor. An impressive group. This is also the most diverse class in the 154-year history of the school.</p>
<p>I am especially proud today to say that there is a lot of Georgetown in my family tree. My father graduated from the College in 1943 before serving in the U.S. Army in World War II. After the war, he received his law degree here and practiced law in Washington, D.C. I am fortunate to have two wonderful daughters; one graduated from the College in 2012; the other is a member of the Class of 2026 at the Law Center.</p>
<p>It seems like yesterday that I was in your shoes, receiving my degree, looking forward with optimism and excitement, and wondering what lay ahead.</p>
<p>I cannot help but think fondly of my time here. For many years, friends from law school have gathered annually for a weekend to refresh our ties and laugh about times gone by. These gatherings are referred to as "Big Chill," a reference to a 1983 movie that revolved around a mid-life reunion of college friends. I made lifelong friendships here that I keep to this day, and I hope it will be the same for you.</p>
<p>Along with all the hard work, I also remember the fun. A favorite tradition was to attend Saturday midnight showings of&nbsp;<em>The Rocky Horror Picture Show</em>&nbsp;at the Key Theater on Wisconsin Avenue in Georgetown.</p>
<p>Now, if you have led a culturally deprived life and are tragically unfamiliar with the movie, it is a raucous musical starring a young Tim Curry. Everyone in the theater would sing along, shout out the lines, and throw popcorn at the screen; many would dress up like the characters. Now, I didn't dress up&mdash;sorry to disappoint you&mdash;but no party was complete until all of us danced "The Time Warp" to the movie's famous song.</p>
<p>As it happens, I still remember the steps, and I had intended to demonstrate the Time Warp for you, but that will not be possible today.</p>
<p>Instead, I will offer a few thoughts that I might have benefited from hearing when I was sitting in your chairs a mere 45 years ago.</p>
<p><strong>Embracing Change</strong><br />The years since my graduation have brought waves of fundamental change to the workplace and to society at large, much of it driven by technology. Imagine a world with no internet, no email or texting, no personal computers or cell phones, no social media. Some of you parents are no doubt thinking: I would be fine with that world!</p>
<p>The pace of change will likely continue to be very fast. Be alert to the ways your working life may change. Think about how you can be prepared for those changes and to turn them to your advantage, and to society's advantage. The practice of law has been transformed over the years; if you do choose the path of a practicing lawyer, I would think about what practicing law could look like in 10 or 20 years.</p>
<p>In a world that will continue to evolve quickly and in unexpected ways, you will need to be agile. Embracing change and taking risks can be an important part of your development as a professional and as a person. Your formal education may end today, but you are not done learning. Many of the important things you will need to know can only be learned through experience. And experience can be a hard but irreplaceable teacher.</p>
<p>As an example, near the end of my second year here, it was time to select the next editor in chief of the&nbsp;<em>Georgetown Law Journal</em>. I thought that there were plenty of colleagues who were better qualified, but who simply did not want the job. So, with much trepidation, I put my name in. I was secretly, but utterly, terrified that I might be chosen. And amazingly enough, I was. What now?</p>
<p>It turned out that, as I feared, I was not well prepared for that responsibility. I had to keep people interested and motivated enough to work on the&nbsp;<em>Journal</em>&nbsp;when many things competed for their attention. I had to have a plan for the organization and not just for myself. I had to do this while exhibiting confidence that I did not feel. My main memory of that time is thinking, "This is harder and far different from what I had expected!"</p>
<p>What I now know is that almost no one is ready for their first leadership roles. When you step into a leadership role, it is very common to doubt yourself. If I could tell my younger self something, it would be to believe in yourself and put yourself in situations in which you will be seriously challenged to do new things. Assume that you will make mistakes. Learn from those mistakes; do not dwell excessively upon them in regret. You will fall down. Get up. Repeat cycle.</p>
<p>The more you do that, the more you will learn and the faster you will develop as a person and as a leader. Know also that, in my experience, there is no single model of a successful leader. Each of you has it in you to lead successfully.</p>
<p><strong>No One Path</strong><br />One of the great things about your legal education is it sets you up for success on a wide variety of potential paths. I left the practice of law a few years after I left this school. But my legal education has benefited me all along the way. Studying law teaches you to think clearly, analyze thoroughly, and understand all sides of an argument. The possibilities that lie ahead of you are extremely broad. You may work for a single law firm for your entire career. Or you may leave the law fairly soon, as I did, and never look back. You will always benefit from what you learned here.</p>
<p>The fact is, I do keep a copy of the Federal Reserve Act that I consult often.</p>
<p>Like many of you, I imagine, I knew that I wanted to do public service. As I left law school, I remember thinking about people like George Shultz and Cyrus Vance, prominent figures of the day who had successful private-sector careers and served periodically in government.</p>
<p>The head of the investment bank in New York where I worked as a young man was Nicholas F. Brady, who had an extraordinary career in investment banking and had served as a U.S. senator from New Jersey as well. I was the most junior of employees, but I wanted to introduce myself and tell him about my own aspirations. But approaching him was daunting. Maybe he would decline to meet with me. Maybe he would think I was not committed to the firm if I told him I was interested in public service.</p>
<p>I finally summoned the courage to present myself at his office. I told him that I grew up in Washington, had been a federal law clerk and a congressional staffer, and wanted to do public service along the way. I said that if you need someone to staff you on anything you do in Washington, I'm your guy. He said something along the lines of, "Great, thanks." I then crept back down the stairs to my broom closet of an office wondering whether that was going to matter.</p>
<p>A few months later, I got a call from his secretary. I can still hear her gravelly voice. "Can you come up and see Mr. Brady?" When I got there, he said, "I need you to help me out with this thing." This thing was defending an oil company from a hostile takeover attempt by a colorful corporate raider of that era named T. Boone Pickens. I ended up spending months going back and forth from New York to Washington with Nick. A few years later, Nick Brady became the Treasury Secretary. Nick asked me to join him at Treasury, which opened the door for me to higher levels of public service. The point is this: if I had not forced myself to get up from my desk, taken the stairs up to the 15th&nbsp;floor, and presented myself to his office that day, the rest of my life would have been very different, and I would not be standing here today.</p>
<p>Mustering that little bit of initiative changed my life. A little initiative can make all the difference in anyone's career.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />I will conclude by encouraging you to think beyond yourselves. Each of you has the capability to achieve success in any field you choose; it is important that you also consider how to give back and use your gifts to make a difference. Reflect on the motto of this school: "law is but the means; justice is the end." Many of you have served at law clinics where you stood up for underrepresented individuals and organizations. And many of you will play important roles in the military, at nonprofits, and in governments around the world.</p>
<p>Each generation has an obligation to move us closer to the ideal, as embodied by the famous image of blindfolded Lady Justice holding the scales. You should count yourselves among the luckiest in all our society to graduate from this institution, to have the support of loved ones through three grueling years, and the health and other good fortune not to get tripped up along the way. Several years ago, one of my predecessors, Ben Bernanke, said, "Those who are the luckiest . . . also have the greatest responsibility to work hard, to contribute to the betterment of the world, and to share their luck with others." I cannot improve upon that.</p>
<p>I thank you for having me. Georgetown will always hold a special place in my heart. Thank you again to Dean Treanor and all the faculty, and the hardiest of congratulations to the Class of 2024.</p>

<div> Keywords: Graduation, Public Policy, Career, Taking Risks, Service<br />
Summary: Pursue a career in public policy, take risks, and be open to new opportunities to discover one's true calling. Congratulations, Class of 2024!<br /><br />Summary: Be open to new opportunities, take career risks, pursue public policy, find strengths, and develop passions. Congratulations, Class of 2024! <div>
<p>Thank you for your generous introduction, Dean Solomon, and thank you for the invitation to be here and share this special day with all of you. Let me begin by congratulating the Class of 2024. Let's give a huge round of applause to our graduates, who are all so deserving of being recognized. And let's clap our hands together and also congratulate the families and friends who are here, too, because&mdash;believe me, I know&mdash;it takes a village! So let's thank all those who supported you along the way and who made sure you had what you needed to make it here today. I want to acknowledge that this is a real milestone. You have all accomplished so much already as you now embark on a career in public policy and leadership. And you are now joining the many Batten graduates who have made great contributions in careers in the service of others.</p>
<p>I suppose I am here, at least in part, because I represent the promise and the possibility of a career spent in large part in public-policy-related work. I work in that city that many of you possibly hope to work in&mdash;I am told that nearly half of master's degree students and more than one-fourth of bachelor's degree students graduating from the Batten School end up in Washington, D.C. In various roles, I have been fortunate enough to do some of the kind of policy work that many of you have set your sights on. I understand that a sizable share of Batten students indeed end up working in government but also in think tanks, in nonprofits, and in the private sector. Some of you have worked in Washington already or done internships there, and many of you will go forth from here and travel the well-worn path of Routes 29 and 66, avoiding rush hour if you can and finding two like-minded classmates so you can use the express lanes, too.</p>
<p>Some of you probably came to the University of Virginia (UVA) and Batten knowing exactly what you wanted to do, with a clear view of the path to get there. Some of you probably settled on that goal and that path over the course of your studies. Certainly, higher education is a big investment, and everyone needs a plan for recouping that investment&mdash;in terms of income, of course, but also in terms of opening other opportunities that education can provide. As a professor of public policy at Georgetown, I always hoped to provide tools that would be useful for graduating students in their new jobs. And I do know, given the caliber of Batten, that your studies here have helped you to not only attain the tools and knowledge you will need moving forward but also to make the contacts and build the networks that will help you in your careers. Most importantly, I hope that your time at UVA has opened your eyes to opportunities that you hadn't even imagined when you first set foot on Grounds. Importantly, I do hope that you have learned over your time here about the many ways in which public policy work can be fulfilling for you personally and can also allow you to improve the lives of others, whether pursuing work on housing affordability, budget priorities, or access to health and education; building infrastructure capacity; or tackling financial stability. Ultimately, public policy and leadership are about helping people.</p>
<p>It is with that latter point in mind that I am going to tell you about my own experience and the importance of allowing yourself to take risks and follow your own path as you pursue a career in public service. While this may contradict some of the advice you have received about managing your careers, I strongly believe that it will make you more successful and more fulfilled in the long run.</p>
<p>I tell you this because I am probably an unlikely person to have been appointed to the Federal Reserve Board, as the first Latin policymaker in the Fed's history. I was raised in Colombia and came to the United States at age 15, speaking almost no English. I attended public schools. In high school, I carried around to every class one of those thick Merriam-Webster dictionaries because, of course, back then there was no Google Translate on smartphones, and also no smartphones!</p>
<p>Another thing I carried with me, along with my dictionary, was the memory from my childhood of traveling around Colombia with my parents and witnessing great poverty and the suffering and social problems that come from poverty. At an early age, my brother and I would accompany my parents to shantytowns around Bogota to help with social projects, and we traveled the countryside to visit my maternal grandparents, who lived in one of the poorest states in the country. I would spend my summer with my grandparents since both my parents worked. My grandfather, who had to leave high school as a teenager to help his widowed mother raise his five siblings, would take us to his dairy farm at four o'clock in the morning to help milk the cows and put the milk in stainless steel tanks. Traveling the unpaved roads into town, we would then stop at various stores to sell the milk. But my grandpa's day was just getting started, because he was also the mayor of his town, and every morning, he would open his office and deal with the business of being mayor. While my grandpa never graduated from high school, he was an autodidact, and he worked hard to put all his siblings and his six children through college, and he saw serving as mayor as a way to help his neighbors. The memories of my grandfather overcoming many obstacles but also devoting his life to helping others were certainly an inspiration and remain a source of motivation for me even today. In fact, I remember going back to visit my grandparents over the years, summer after summer, and seeing the new roads that had been paved and the improved school and health clinic in the town and seeing how a life devoted to public service can improve lives.</p>
<p>So when going to college, while not totally definite about what to study, I found that the memories from my childhood and the desire to find ways to address poverty guided my decision to gravitate toward economics and political science, and I figured the best path for me was to work in public policy. In particular, I discovered that economics was a science that would allow me to better combine my interest in math with my desire to help address poverty, so I moved in that direction, pursuing a PhD.</p>
<p>I want to emphasize that my career was not linear or perfectly planned, but rather I have chosen to take detours. And, importantly, I have chosen to take risks along the way. Yet what was always a constant was my commitment to use my technical expertise to tackle poverty and social challenges. But I also could have never imagined that some of the detours I took would actually help me down the road in preparing me for my current role.</p>
<p>As an undergrad, I decided to apply out of the blue for an internship with the junior senator from Maryland at the time, Senator Barbara Mikulski, only because I read a newspaper article about her work in the Senate as the daughter of Polish immigrants, which really resonated with me. Little did I know that I was going to be back at the Hart building a few decades later, making the rounds to meet with various senators as I prepared for my Senate confirmation for the Federal Reserve. In grad school, I spent time as a visitor both at the Brookings Institution and at the San Francisco Fed&mdash;where I worked on my PhD research while surrounded by policy-focused professionals. Stepping into these institutions pushed me out of my comfort zone and into the world of policy and discussions about what it took to prepare for Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings while I was a grad student immersed in a highly technical PhD. program. Little did I know that I was going to be back at the Fed attending those FOMC meetings myself and at Brookings just a few months ago giving my first speech as a governor. I know as students, many of you have already done internships and searched for these opportunities around policymaking, and I want to tell you that this is exactly what will make you grow moving forward. Like me, you may someday be surprised to find yourself revisiting those important places where you once studied and learned, but now as a senior professional in a position to provide service in a very different way.</p>
<p>For decades, I spent much of my career in academia pursuing answers to my big questions on poverty by doing research and teaching at universities. Throughout, I always focused on those same questions that drove me to study economics in the first place&mdash;and always with my sights on the role of policy and the implications for real people, like my grandpa and others I had seen in Colombia and in the United States, who lacked opportunities. And that's when my next big detour came. Just one year after being recruited by Georgetown, I was approached by the U.S. Department of Labor to be its chief economist. While I knew I could contribute my knowledge in the middle of the Great Recession about the drivers of unemployment and effective policies to create jobs, I had never spent time working in government. This certainly pushed me out of my comfort zone again, and I am very glad it did, because I learned a great deal about how policy actually gets made while using my expertise and knowledge to conduct evidence-based policymaking. Little did I know that the data on prices and employment produced by the Labor Department would be the same data that I analyze in my current role at the Fed, looking for evidence-based insights to make policy that benefits all Americans.</p>
<p>My point with all this biography is to show how the crucial professional experiences in my life have come from keeping my options open, being open to new opportunities, and taking risks. It is reassuring, and very tempting, to set one's sights on one and only one goal and to stay strictly focused on the path to get there. Any map will show the most direct route from Charlottesville to Washington&mdash;just take a right turn at Gainesville, right? But there are other destinations, and other ways to get where you are going, that may make the journey more enriching and rewarding. Be open to those possibilities. Be ready to try new things. One of the things you may gain from this approach is discovering talents and abilities that you may not know you had. To invoke a principle of economics, trying new things and considering new possibilities may help you discover your comparative advantage. Discovering a comparative advantage in this way is really just about learning more about yourself, a more general goal for life that I would recommend to everyone. And you may be surprised at how often the winding road brings you back to old landmarks you may have previously visited, but now with a stronger set of tools for providing service.</p>
<p>As I said earlier, this approach to your career planning might contradict some very good advice from your professors and advisers, and maybe from your own parents, on how best to use the great advantage of your education at the Batten School. By encouraging you to step off the path now and then to consider other possibilities, I don't mean you shouldn't work as hard as possible to achieve your goals. Absolutely you should put your heart and soul into what you do, hopefully because you will find a job to which you are deeply committed and you love.</p>
<p>My own career so far has followed a winding road. It is certainly not what I expected when I was sitting where you are sitting today. But I'm glad I said yes, took some chances, and experienced different kinds of jobs in different types of organizations. Keep a lookout for opportunities and consider saying yes even if doing so might move you off your planned path for a time. You may discover strengths and abilities you didn't recognize before. You may develop interests and even passions that you never expected to develop. Changing the world might begin with a change of perspective that helps you better understand the realities around you and also yourself. Be open to all that. Congratulations, again, to the Class of 2024, and the best of luck wherever the road takes you. And if that is the Fed, please do make sure to pop in to say hi!</p>

ICAN and NGX Regulation held the maiden corporate reporting award recognizing top companies for financial, governance, and sustainability reporting. It signifies commitment to transparency and accountability.<br />
Keywords: ICAN, NGX Regulation, Corporate Reporting Awards, Dangote Cement, Transparency <br />
Summary: The awards recognize top companies for financial, governance, and sustainability reporting, signifying a commitment to transparency and accountability.<br /> <div>
<p>The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN) and NGX Regulation Limited (NGX RegCo) on Friday, 17th May held the maiden corporate reporting award, which recognizes the top 30 most capitalized companies listed on the Nigerian Exchange (NGX) for the 2022 financial reporting year.</p>
<p>The awards underscored both organization&rsquo;s shared commitment to fostering transparency, accountability, and international best practices within the private sector. Evaluation criteria included financial reporting, corporate governance, and sustainability reporting.</p>
<p>Dangote Cement secured the top position across all three categories, earning the Platinum award alongside the best-in-class award of excellence in corporate governance. Airtel clinched the gold award, securing the second position and the best-in-class award of excellence in financial reporting for the period under review. Seplat Energy was honored with the Silver award while also receiving the best-in-class award for excellence in sustainability reporting.</p>
<p>Speaking at the event, the president of ICAN, Dr. Innocent Okwuosa, commended NGX RegCo for ensuring better disclosures and reporting among listed companies.</p>
<p>He noted that corporate reporting had evolved over the years from the time that most of its content focuses on financial reporting to when there emerged the clamour for incorporation of social and environmental disclosures.</p>
<p>He emphasized the evolution of corporate reporting over time, highlighting the shift from a primary focus on financial reporting to the increasing request to incorporate social and environmental disclosures, noting that &ldquo;the latter has evolved and have been differently propagated including but not limited to Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) disclosure and of late sustainability disclosures&rdquo;.<span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Okwuosa added that good corporate reporting must reflect the best elements in corporate governance, financial, and sustainability reporting, highlighting that the maiden edition is limited to NGX-30 companies for ease of administration and will be extended to all the listed companies in the future.</p>
<p>In his welcome address, the CEO of NGX RegCo, Mr. Olufemi Shobanjo, highlighted that &ldquo;without a doubt, transparency is one of the key drivers of any economy. It ensures full disclosure of information by entities and that such information is easily accessible to members of the public to make informed decisions. Over the years, there has been an evolution in the type and quality of information demanded, driven by heightened expectations from investors, decision-makers, and society as a whole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He added that &ldquo;while financial reports remain at the forefront of information required by stakeholders, the concept of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) considerations has become an area of increasing interest to both public and private sector stakeholders&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Shobanjo attributed this to the interplay between ESG and key issues such as sustainable development, corporate governance, climate change, stakeholder engagement, and community relations amongst a myriad of other issues.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stakeholders are beginning to demand more accountability, and companies are required to think beyond just profitability by expanding their scope to include the ethical impacts that their operations have on society or communities within which they operate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He concluded that &ldquo;as a self-regulatory organization, NGX Regulation remains committed to ensuring that the expectations of investors and other stakeholders regarding access to quality information are met.&rdquo;</p>

<div> SEC, SIFMA, Congressional Review Act, digital assets, bipartisan vote
Summary:
SIFMA applauds Congress for passing a resolution to overturn SAB 121, benefiting investors and financial institutions. President Biden's prompt approval is urged. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>SIFMA today issued the following statement from SIFMA president and CEO Kenneth E. Bentsen, Jr. on the Senate&rsquo;s passage of the Congressional Review Act resolution of disapproval overturning the SEC&rsquo;s Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121:</p>
<p>&ldquo;SIFMA commends Senator Lummis (R-WY), Congressman Flood (R-NE), and Congressman Nickel (D-NC) for their introduction of, and continued support for, a Congressional Review Act resolution of disapproval overturning the SEC&rsquo;s Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121, which passed both Chambers of Congress and will be sent to the President. The significant bipartisan vote in both Chambers of Congress shows a stark contrast between Congress and the SEC. SAB 121 would fundamentally change the way financial institutions are expected to account for the custody of digital assets, and the SEC issued the SAB without stakeholder engagement or consultation with the prudential regulators. This CRA would benefit investors, financial markets, and the broader public by restoring the ability of well-regulated financial institutions to provide digital asset custodial services. We urge President Biden to promptly sign this resolution into law.&rdquo;</p>

<div> Macroeconomic challenges, Financial services reform, PISCES, Pension funds, Demographic & regional inequalities
Summary: British economy recovery, financial services reform, PISCES for private markets, focus on pension funds, addressing demographic and regional inequalities. 
Summary: <div>
<p><img alt="Bim Afolami" src="https://mondovisione.com/_assets/images/Bim-Afolami(1).jpg" title="Bim Afolami" /></p>
<p>Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for the introduction.</p>
<p>It is a pleasure to be here with you.</p>
<p>The last few years have not been easy for the British economy. We&rsquo;ve faced the legacy of Covid, war in Ukraine and the Middle East. These challenges have made life tough for people in Britain.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of 2023, we have been working on five priorities. Three of them are economic. To halve inflation, grow the economy and reduce debt.</p>
<p>We have made good progress. Inflation has fallen from 11.1% to 3.2%, the economy has performed better than forecast, wages are rising, mortgage rates are down significantly from their peaks. The economy has outperformed European neighbours and debt is on track to fall as a share of the economy.</p>
<p>The job is not done. But because of the progress we have made, the economy is turning a corner.</p>
<p>But today, I want to talk about the progress we have, collectively, made on financial services over the course of this Parliament. Because this Parliament has truly been a Parliament of Success.</p>
<p>Over the last 3 years, my predecessors at HM Treasury and I, alongside the Chancellor and Prime Minister, have embarked on the most comprehensive set of reforms to financial services in a generation.</p>
<p>I will be honest with you &ndash; we haven&rsquo;t been able to do everything as quickly as we would have liked to have done.</p>
<p>And there are things &ndash; important things &ndash; which we need to do more on.</p>
<p>But when you boil it down, I am confident that we are &ndash; hand in hand with industry &ndash; successfully delivering a new model for the UK&rsquo;s&nbsp;<abbr title="Financial services">FS</abbr>&nbsp;sector&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;A model that is open to the world, which embraces the opportunities of tomorrow, and which is firmly at the heart of a modern, dynamic UK economy.</p>
<p>&hellip;And it is our hopes and our plans for this new model that I would like to talk more about today.</p>
<p>Underpinning my thinking is a clear assessment of the fact that our country cannot significantly upgrade our economic growth without a growing and thriving financial services sector.</p>
<p>Of course, to understand where we are now, and where we are going, we must understand where we have come from.</p>
<p>The booms, busts and bankruptcies of the last two centuries are lessons in the capacity of individuals, governments, and institutions to change the course of history.</p>
<p>After the &ldquo;Golden Age&rdquo; of the late 19th century, the trauma of the Great War, and the decision to return to the gold standard, by 1929 the Square Mile &ndash; and the wider economy &ndash; was in serious trouble.</p>
<p>The Macmillan Committee was set up to look at the finance sector &ndash; because, as David Kynaston says in his brilliant book on the City &ndash; &ldquo;not just the City, but capitalism itself was on trial&rdquo;.</p>
<p>There was a perception that the City existed to finance imperial and global trade, and was neglecting the necessary support of British industry throughout the regions of the UK. Plus &ccedil;a change.</p>
<p>This phrase &ldquo;capitalism is on trial&rdquo; has stuck with me. Because in 2024, nearly a century on, I am struck by the way in which the health of the financial services sector remains intertwined with perceptions of the health of capitalism&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;And the reality of the health of the broader economy.</p>
<p>This is, in part, I think, why we care so much about it&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;And why we continue to examine and evaluate the relationship between finance, industry, government and regulators.</p>
<p>Back in the &lsquo;80s, it was &lsquo;adapt or die&rsquo;, because the rules of the game were being rewritten all around us&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;Now; taking account of both the post-crisis reforms, and our current set of reforms; we have rewritten the rules&hellip;</p>
<p>We are adapting successfully in the face of change and challenge&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;But we should not forget the need to continually capitalise on our uniqueness.</p>
<p>The UK is the one place in the world where everyone can transact and interact &ndash; the Far East, Middle East, America, Africa, Asia, and Europe.</p>
<p>Yes, there are other financial centres, but they don&rsquo;t have the breadth and depth that we have. To maintain our uniqueness, we must remain highly competitive&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;Taking a different approach to our EU counterparts where necessary, updating where we want to go further, better, and faster than we could when we were in the EU&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;So that, as we approach the second quarter of the 21st century, we can confidently showcase a new, world-leading model for financial services &ndash; one that is fit for the future.</p>
<p>So, what is at the heart of this new model?</p>
<p>At Mansion House nearly four years ago, the now Prime Minister &ndash; then Chancellor &ndash; set out a vision for the financial services sector. One that is technologically advanced, open, sustainable, and competitive.</p>
<p>One that builds on our history &ndash; including both the Big Bang deregulation of the &rsquo;80s, and the care we&rsquo;ve taken since &rsquo;08 to embed and protect stability &ndash; whilst also looking forward to our future.</p>
<p>We are delivering this vision: through the Edinburgh Reforms in 2022, the Mansion House Reforms last year, and the progress made at Autumn Statement and Spring Budget.</p>
<p>We are also global leaders in the regulation of new digital assets &ndash; ensuring innovation and consumer safety go hand in hand.</p>
<p>The Financial Markets and Services Act 2023 is the cornerstone of our reform programme.</p>
<p>This Act cements, in law, growth and competitiveness secondary objectives for our regulators&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;Which I hope will precipitate a cultural shift in our regulatory approach. With our country, alongside many in Europe, having the profound problem of slow economic growth, there is no point having the safest graveyard.</p>
<p>I know some have questioned whether this objective will go far enough in creating a pro-growth regulatory mindset.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to jump the gun on this, so I want to monitor how the new system beds in for now. Both the&nbsp;<abbr title="Financial Conduct Authority">FCA</abbr>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<abbr title="Prudential regulation Authority">PRA</abbr>&nbsp;will soon be reporting on how they are implementing the new objective.</p>
<p>Be assured that we will go further if needed &ndash; but also, be confident in the steps that we have taken, and the change that this will bring about.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And perhaps the reform that I am most excited about is PISCES &ndash; the Private Intermittent Securities and Capital Exchange System &ndash; which we are establishing this year.</p>
<p>This new class of market is a world-first. It will give private companies better access to UK capital markets, and create regulatory coherence between public and private markets.</p>
<p>It exemplifies how we are on the front-foot; leaning into the structural shift to private markets, rather than allowing ourselves to suffer as a result of the world changing around us.</p>
<p>Alongside this, we are taking forward Lord Hill&rsquo;s listing reform recommendations. This includes a complete rewrite of the UK&rsquo;s Prospectus regime, creating tailor-made rules that make it easier for companies to list and raise capital on UK markets.</p>
<p>These reforms will strengthen the operating environment for our capital markets by increasing the pool of investors with a stake in UK markets&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;And enable firms to raise larger sums of capital more quickly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also implementing a move to T+1 settlement by the end of 2027, in line with the recent recommendations of the Accelerated Settlement Taskforce.</p>
<p>So, there is much to celebrate in this Parliament of Success &ndash; and the Chancellor will update on our vision at Mansion House this summer.</p>
<p>But it would be remiss of me to not also mention the challenges that we need to do more to address.</p>
<p>There are three key challenges.</p>
<p><strong>Pension funds</strong></p>
<p>First, we have a challenge on pensions funds.</p>
<p>UK pension funds do not invest enough in unlisted equity in the UK, especially in comparison to international peers like Australia &ndash; where better returns for pension savers are being generated, with effective investment strategies and more investment in high quality domestic growth stocks. For defined contribution schemes specifically, comparable Australian schemes invest 10 times more in private markets as a proportion of their total assets than equivalent UK schemes.</p>
<p>Alongside this, UK pension fund holdings in UK listed equities have fallen &ndash; from 53% in 1997 to around just 6%.</p>
<p>So, we are introducing new requirements for DC and local government pension funds to publicly disclose their level of international and UK equity investments. If there is not improvement, as the Chancellor said at Spring Budget, we will then consider what further action should be taken if we are not on a positive trajectory towards international best practice.</p>
<p>Higher investment levels in these asset classes can help improve returns for savers and promote economic growth, by unlocking billions of investment for high-growth companies. And by doing so, this will help our capital markets to thrive.</p>
<p>Part of the fundamental issue is that the pension market is too fragmented. So, we are taking steps to improve consolidation of the market, particularly the LGPS, as well as ensuring that the regulatory structure rewards funds that invest for long term returns, not just for cost&hellip;.</p>
<p>&hellip;And developing vehicles that ensure pension funds have access to high-growth assets &ndash; including in the science and tech sectors via the &lsquo;LIFTS&rsquo; initiative, which we announced the winners of at Spring Budget.</p>
<p>To this end, the package the Chancellor announced last year at Mansion House, including the Mansion House Compact, will unlock up to &pound;75 billion of financing for growth by 2030.</p>
<p><strong>Demographic and regional inequalities</strong></p>
<p>Secondly and thirdly, there are the challenges that demographic and regional inequalities present. I have been thinking about these issues a lot recently, and we cannot simply shy away from them. The overall economic pie needs to be much bigger, but how that pie is sliced really matters.</p>
<p>Securing access to SME finance is particularly challenging for women, people from ethnic minorities, and people from certain social classes.</p>
<p>The statistics speak for themselves. For example, only 8% of total equity funding is being invested in teams with at least one ethnic minority founder.</p>
<p>This is compared to an ethnic minority representation of 18% in the UK population as a whole.</p>
<p>And the proportion of equity capital investment going to all-female founder teams has been stuck at around 2% in the UK for the past decade.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re working to address this. Since 2012, of the people who received a Start Up Loan from the British Business Bank, funded by the government, 40% went to women, and 20% went to people from a Black, Asian or other Ethnic Minority background.</p>
<p>And in March this year, the PM announced a new taskforce to boost private investment in women-led businesses and make the UK the best place in the world to be female founder.</p>
<p>When I delivered my first major speech as City Minister last November, and in much of my engagement since, I have wanted to keep at the front and centre of people&rsquo;s minds that reforms must deliver investment all over the UK. Financial services has &ndash; for far too long &ndash; been seen as London-centric, even though 2/3 of&nbsp;<abbr title="Financial services">FS</abbr>&nbsp;jobs are based outside of London.</p>
<p>Success does not come from trickle-down economics from the centre, which as George Bush quite rightly said is &lsquo;voodoo economics&rsquo;.</p>
<p>No, the economy of the future is bottom up.</p>
<p>I commend the individual efforts that companies have made to increase their regional presence and deliver for local communities. But I would like to extend a call to arms &ndash; to bankers, insurers, pension providers, and others &ndash; to take up the mantle on regional growth&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;To deliver ambitious investment strategies in our regions, delegating hiring decisions to local centres, which ensures that we truly develop local talent.</p>
<p>And I would also like to encourage the banking sector to roll out banking hubs much faster, to support local communities and businesses access in-person banking.</p>
<p>As a country, our&nbsp;<abbr title="Financial services">FS</abbr>&nbsp;sector will not get the public support that it needs in order to thrive without much more engagement from much more of the country.</p>
<p>Indeed, more broadly, this question of engagement is crucial. How do we get people to engage in the evolution of financial services?</p>
<p>Well, one answer is to show them how it affects them, and why it matters. Open Banking is doing just this, putting consumers at the centre of data-sharing and its benefits. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Last month I launched the Open Finance Taskforce, who are looking at, for example, how sharing data sets can help facilitate the availability of finance for SMEs. I look forward to the findings of the Taskforce this summer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We led the way internationally with Open Banking. Sharing data with consumers and businesses has the power to empower consumers and businesses across the financial services spectrum - savings, investments, insurance, pensions and beyond. So, let&rsquo;s continue to lead the way on this agenda. &nbsp;</p>
<p>To conclude, I hope you&rsquo;ll not mind me referencing a report I worked on in 2022 for the APPG on financial markets and services. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In this report, I said that financial services are not just the jewel in the crown of the British economy.</p>
<p>In fact, they are critical to the effective working of the &ldquo;real&rdquo; economy.</p>
<p>Because financial services are a part of, not apart from, the rest of the economy.</p>
<p>This is our model for the future &ndash; because capitalism, the economy, society, works better when there is genuine partnership.</p>
<p>So let us continue building this genuine partnership &ndash; and we will, collectively, reap the rewards&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;And create a new model for the financial services sector &ndash; a sector which we can all be proud.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

Summary: The Federal Reserve discusses the economic outlook, monetary policy, and bank regulatory reform, emphasizing the need for engagement and prioritization of regulatory actions. <div>
<p>I would like to thank the Pennsylvania Bankers Association for the invitation to join you today.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240517a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;I appreciate the opportunity to engage with you on matters that affect the banking industry. Before sharing my thoughts about the current bank regulatory environment, I will discuss my views on the economy and monetary policy.</p>
<p><strong>Update on the Economy and Monetary Policy Outlook</strong><br />Over the past two years, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy to address high inflation. At our meeting earlier this month, the FOMC voted to continue to hold the federal funds rate target range at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent and to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve's securities holdings, but at a slower pace beginning in June.</p>
<p>After seeing considerable progress on slowing inflation last year, we have not yet seen further progress this year. The 12-month measures of total and core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation have moved roughly sideways since December and remained elevated at 2.7 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively, in March. With average core consumer price index (CPI) inflation this year through April running at an annualized rate of 4.3 percent, well above average inflation in the second half of last year, I expect inflation to remain elevated for some time.</p>
<p>The recent pickup seems to be evident across many goods and services categories, suggesting that inflation was temporarily lower in the latter half of last year. Prices continue to be much higher than before the pandemic, which is weighing on consumer sentiment. Inflation has hit lower-income households hardest since food, energy, and housing services price increases far outpaced overall inflation throughout this episode.</p>
<p>Economic activity increased at a strong pace last year but may have moderated early this year. First-quarter gross domestic product growth was temporarily dampened by volatile categories, like inventories and net exports, and over the past few months, including recent data revisions, consumers appear to have pulled-back on goods spending through April. Still, consumer services spending has remained strong, and residential activity and business investment in equipment and intangibles strengthened.</p>
<p>So far this year, payroll employment has increased at a strong pace through April, partly reflecting increased immigrant labor supply. Although we have seen signs that the labor market is coming into better balance, progress has slowed. Recent employment reports continue to show a tight labor market, and the unemployment rate remains below 4 percent, with the number of job openings relative to unemployed workers still above its pre-pandemic level. Throughout last year, the average pace of job gains slowed, and the labor force participation rate rose, but in recent months, job growth has rebounded. Labor force participation flattened out around last year's peak, which suggests no further improvement in labor supply along this margin, as labor force participation among those aged 55 and older has been persistently low.</p>
<p>At its current setting, our monetary policy stance appears to be restrictive, and I will continue to monitor the incoming data to assess whether monetary policy is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to our target. As I've noted recently, my baseline outlook continues to be that inflation will decline further with the policy rate held steady, but I still see a number of upside inflation risks that affect my outlook.</p>
<p>First, much of the progress on inflation last year was due to supply-side improvements, including easing of supply chain constraints; increases in the number of available workers, due in part to immigration; and lower energy prices. It is unclear whether further supply-side improvements will continue to lower inflation. Geopolitical developments could also pose upside risks to inflation, including the risk that spillovers from regional conflicts could disrupt global supply chains, putting additional upward pressure on food, energy, and commodity prices. There is also the risk that the loosening in financial conditions since late last year and additional fiscal stimulus could add momentum to demand, stalling any further progress or even causing inflation to reaccelerate.</p>
<p>Finally, there is a risk that strong consumer demand for services, increased immigration, and continued labor market tightness could lead to persistently high core services inflation. Given the current low inventory of affordable housing, the inflow of new immigrants to some geographic areas could result in upward pressure on rents, as additional housing supply may take time to materialize. Wage growth has remained at an elevated rate of about 4 to 5 percent, still higher than the pace consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal given trend productivity growth.</p>
<p>In light of these risks, and the general uncertainty regarding the economic outlook, I will continue to watch the data closely as I assess the appropriate path of monetary policy. The frequency and extent of data revisions over the past few years make the task of assessing the current state of the economy and predicting how the economy will evolve even more challenging. I will remain cautious in my approach to considering future changes in the stance of policy.</p>
<p>It is important to note that monetary policy is not on a preset course. My colleagues and I will make our decisions at each FOMC meeting based on the incoming data and the implications for and risks to the outlook. While the current stance of monetary policy appears to be at a restrictive level, I remain willing to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at a future meeting should the incoming data indicate that progress on inflation has stalled or reversed. Restoring price stability is essential for achieving maximum employment over the longer run.</p>
<p><strong>Bank Regulatory Reform</strong><br />Turning to the bank regulatory reform agenda, there has been a significant volume of matters that have recently been completed, that have been proposed, and that are in the pipeline. A number of these efforts have been met with criticism and public resistance, from informal comments and ad campaigns to formal legal challenges, including litigation challenging the validity of these reforms. Reasonable minds can disagree on the appropriate path forward for bank regulatory policy, but the current period of regulatory reform feels more contentious than in the past.</p>
<p>The current regulatory agenda is notable for its broad scope, both for the institutions that would be subject to reforms, and the nature of the reforms. The proposals touch on a wide range of topics that directly or indirectly impact banks of all sizes. And they often represent significant shifts in regulatory requirements and supervisory expectations. My remarks today highlight two themes related to the significant number of regulatory changes and proposals under consideration.</p>
<p>First, the volume and scope of revisions affect a wide range of banking activities and pose significant challenges for all bankers. Reviewing, understanding, and then implementing these reforms will involve bank management, compliance, legal, audit, and even frontline staff. At the same time, banks must also balance the existing and ongoing compliance obligations to meet supervisory expectations. Compliance has always been an important bank function, and it often involves a shared responsibility and obligation across many different business lines and personnel. Simply keeping up with the thousands of pages of new regulatory reforms poses a significant challenge, especially for banks with small staffs and a single compliance officer.</p>
<p>Those same staff members, with already heavy compliance responsibilities, are also often best positioned to provide feedback on pending regulatory proposals. Banker comments shared as part of the administrative rulemaking process help inform and influence proposals that are under consideration. If there is a desire to influence change, stakeholders must engage and provide input during this process.</p>
<p>Second, the large number of finalized, proposed, and potential changes suggest a lack of prioritization&mdash;whether we have effectively identified actual risks to the banking system and devoted resources to the most pressing of these issues. Prioritization is something I have spoken about at length in the past, and it remains just as critical today.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240517a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a></p>
<p>The banking stress last spring revealed the presence of flaws and shortcomings in our bank regulatory and supervisory framework. A lack of prioritization in our approach risks losing focus on making substantively responsive adjustments and reforms.</p>
<p><strong>Opportunities for Engagement</strong><br />Reviewing and commenting on regulatory proposals should never be a distraction from a banker's core responsibility to ensure the bank continues serving its customers in a safe and sound manner, and in compliance with applicable laws. So, I do not want any of you to take my remarks today as a call to drop everything you are doing and open up the&nbsp;<em>Federal Register</em>&nbsp;and start reading. The banking system is a highly regulated environment, and as you see in your work every day, requires banks to devote significant resources to compliance. A strong culture of compliance can help keep your bank safe, and in the aggregate promotes a safe and sound banking system. Within a bank, virtually everyone has a role to play in promoting that culture of compliance with applicable law, all while serving your customers.</p>
<p>But stakeholders, including bankers, have an important role in the stewardship of the banking system that goes beyond compliance&mdash;namely, participating in the administrative rulemaking process. It is critical that you share your views with policymakers on regulatory reform proposals. All the comments, data, and analysis from commenters enable policymakers to make informed decisions throughout the rulemaking process, from the initial brainstorming stage, through the creation of a proposal, and in crafting a final rule.</p>
<p>This feedback is equally critical in understanding how the supervisory process is working as it evolves over time and incorporates new standards and expectations. Information about the intended and unintended impacts of reform initiatives is especially informative. Often, private-sector stakeholders are best positioned to understand and explain these impacts, and to identify gaps in the context, data, and analysis underpinning these initiatives.</p>
<p>I recognize that in some instances, multiple, interrelated proposals out for comment at the same time complicate or even frustrate the ability to provide meaningful feedback. For example, the federal banking regulators have proposed significant reforms to capital requirements, while also proposing new long-term debt requirements for banks with over $100 billion in assets. While these efforts are on their face distinct, the calibration of such requirements are directly linked. The calibration of capital requirements is used to set long-term debt requirements. Therefore, these proposals present challenges not only to regulators, but also to public commenters trying to understand the potential and complete impact of reforms. Even so, I strongly encourage your participation to inform the rulemaking process.</p>
<p>I will share my views on a few of these proposals, but I certainly do not mean to suggest that this list is exhaustive. All the proposals could benefit from public feedback.</p>
<p><strong>Bank Mergers and Acquisitions</strong><br />Some prudential regulators and other policymakers are currently reconsidering the approach to the review and approval of bank mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A).<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240517a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;M&amp;A transactions allow banks to evolve and thrive in our dynamic banking system and can promote the long-term health and viability of banks. M&amp;A also ensures that banks have a meaningful path to transitioning bank ownership. The absence of a viable M&amp;A framework increases the potential for additional risks, including limited opportunities for succession planning, especially in smaller or rural communities when zombie banks continue to exist but have no competitive viability or exit strategy.</p>
<p>The impact of a more restrictive M&amp;A framework affects institutions of all sizes, including larger institutions that are vying to compete with the very largest global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). They may choose to pursue M&amp;A to remain competitive with larger peers who can achieve that growth organically through their sheer scale.</p>
<p>M&amp;A is an important part of a healthy banking system. So, when considering changes to the framework, I think we need to first identify the problem that needs to be solved, and then ask whether any proposed solution is fair, transparent, and consistent with applicable statutes. And critically, whether the proposed solution has the potential to damage the long-term viability of the banking system.</p>
<p>Are there identified shortcomings in the current process or standards, and are the proposed reforms targeted and effective to address these shortcomings? One argument I have heard about the M&amp;A regulatory approval process is that the lack of application&nbsp;<em>denials&nbsp;</em>demonstrates that regulators are failing to meaningfully review and pressure test proposals and have effectively become a rubber stamp. I think this argument lacks a strong foundation. There is ample evidence that undermines this argument, including the resource demands on institutions of pursuing M&amp;A activity, and the protracted time it takes to complete the regulatory review and approval process (and the not insignificant failure rate we see represented in withdrawn applications).</p>
<p>First, we have to acknowledge that choosing the path of a merger or acquisition is not undertaken lightly. These transactions require significant upfront and ongoing investment and commitment of resources. At the outset, this includes finding an appropriate acquisition target, conducting due diligence, and negotiating the terms of the transaction. Once a target is identified, the banks must prepare appropriate regulatory filings, engage with regulators during the application process, and prepare for post-approval business processes including scheduling necessary and costly systems conversions and customer transition. This is an expensive and reputationally risky process that bankers and their boards of directors take extremely seriously.</p>
<p>Second, one would expect to see different patterns emerging if regulators were truly acting as a "rubber stamp" for banking applications. We know from data published by the Federal Reserve that filing an application does not guarantee approval, even in the absence of a regulatory denial. The Federal Reserve's most recent report on banking applications activity identifies a significant portion of bank M&amp;A transactions in which applications have been withdrawn.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240517a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a></p>
<p>The processing timelines we see also seem inconsistent with a process that is operating truly as a rubber stamp. To be clear, I think we have room to do better when it comes to timely regulatory action, while maintaining a rigorous review of applications. But extended review periods are not uncommon, particularly when you include preliminary discussions and pre-filings with regulators in the published processing timelines.</p>
<p>Some contemplated regulatory reform efforts will likely make the M&amp;A application process slower and less efficient. One of the key risks to an effective process is a lack of timely regulatory action. The consequences of delays can significantly harm both the acquiring institution and the target, causing greater operational risk (including the risk of a failed merger), increased expenses, reputational risk, and staff attrition in the face of prolonged uncertainty.</p>
<p>Reducing the efficiency of bank M&amp;A can be a deterrent to healthy bank transactions&mdash;limiting activity that preserves the presence of community banks in underserved areas, preventing institutions from pursuing prudent growth strategies, and undermining competition by preventing firms from growing to a larger scale, effectively creating a "protected class" of larger institutions.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the past year has shown that regulatory attention is increasingly focused on other issues, with the timeliness of regulatory action appearing to be lower on the list of priorities. However, I would like to highlight a change that may have significant impacts on M&amp;A transactions depending on how the requirement is implemented.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve recently proposed changes to its M&amp;A application forms, the FR Y-3 and FR Y-3F, to include a requirement that an applicant submit an integration plan at the time of the initial application.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240517a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;Many applications often include plans for integration, as this can factor into the consideration of an application's likelihood of approval. However, depending upon how this requirement is implemented, it could result in significantly increased upfront costs and burdens for banks in preparing for and submitting applications for mergers and acquisitions, particularly for smaller institutions.</p>
<p>It is important for industry participants to provide comments on changes to the bank merger process&mdash;including changes to application forms&mdash;especially since cost and timing implications could affect a bank's consideration of these transactions. Ultimately, while banks are mindful of and do plan for integration, I am concerned that increased upfront requirements may lead to additional delays in processing timelines. I would therefore encourage industry stakeholders to review and provide comment on the proposed changes to our applications forms.</p>
<p><strong>Third-Party Risk Management</strong><br />Similarly, the agencies also recently released a guide for community banks regarding third-party risk management.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240517a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;This guide took the agencies nearly a year to finalize after adopting third-party risk management guidance in June of last year. I am hopeful that this community bank guide will be helpful to community banks. But I have yet to be convinced that the guide will effectively reduce the burden on smaller banks to comply with our third-party risk management guidance. Since it is not yet clear that this guide will be effective, I encourage banks to provide feedback on the guide, including on the clarity and transparency of supervisory expectations for community banks in their management of third-party risk.</p>
<p><strong>Review of Regulations under the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act</strong><br />Finally, I'd like to highlight another opportunity for stakeholders to provide feedback on the agencies' regulations. In February, the Board announced the initiation of its review of its regulations to identify those regulations that are outdated, unnecessary, or overly burdensome in accordance with the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act (EGRPRA). It is my expectation that this review, and eventually the accompanying report to Congress, will provide a meaningful process for stakeholders and the public to engage with the banking agencies in identifying regulations that are no longer necessary or are overly burdensome.</p>
<p>As a part of the comment process, I would encourage the public, particularly community banks, to comment on the aggregate burden imposed on banks since the prior EGRPRA report 10 years ago. While there are many competing priorities on your time, these are valuable opportunities for you to shape the outcome of our regulations. I welcome the opportunity to learn from all stakeholders how the Board and the other banking agencies could reduce burden, especially for regional and community banks.</p>
<p><strong>Prioritization within Bank Regulation and Supervision</strong><br />I would also like to spend a few minutes on prioritization of regulatory actions. In my view, it is essential that regulators appropriately calibrate and prioritize supervisory and regulatory actions. Failing to do so could distract banks, bank management, supervisors, and regulators from focusing on key risks.</p>
<p>The frenzy of regulatory reform activity we have seen over the past year raises a question as to whether the banking regulators are pursuing reforms in a prioritized way. Many reform proposals do not appear targeted to identified shortcomings or deficiencies in the existing regulatory framework.</p>
<p>While regulators often identify evolving conditions and emerging risks before they materialize as pronounced stress in the banking system, too often regulators fail to take appropriately decisive measures to address them. In addition, regulators can also fall into the trap of getting distracted from core financial risks, and instead focus on issues that are tangential to statutory mandates and critical areas of responsibility. Focusing on risks that pose fewer safety and soundness concerns increases the risk that regulators miss other more foundational and pressing areas that require more immediate attention. Our recent actions suggest this could be the case, and that we have taken steps that could distract bank management from focusing on important and key risks.</p>
<p>The Board's focus on climate guidance is one example, but it is not the only example. While climate change is an important issue, climate change is not a core risk to the safety and soundness of financial institutions. The lessons learned from supervisory failures during the bank stress last spring clearly illustrate that bank examiners and bank management should focus on core issues, like credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk.</p>
<p>I am concerned that focusing our regulatory reform and guidance efforts on issues like climate change that do not represent core banking risks will only serve to further distract bank management and supervisors.</p>
<p>In addition to issuing interagency supervisory guidance to banks on managing climate-related financial risks, the Board recently issued the results of a pilot climate scenario analysis, which was designed to learn about large banks' climate risk-management practices.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240517a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;This report goes into significant detail on the technical aspects of the scenario analysis and underlying results.</p>
<p>While exploring even remote risks can help build resiliency for the future, I think the report itself included some acknowledgment that these exercises may have limited utility in the short-term for managing risk. For example, the report acknowledges that participants "suggested that climate-related risks are highly uncertain and challenging to measure," and that "[t]he uncertainty around the timing and magnitude of climate-related risks made it difficult . . . to determine how best to incorporate these risks into [banks'] risk-management frameworks on a business-as-usual basis."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240517a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a>&nbsp;Participants also noted that scenario design choices, assumptions, data challenges, and modelling challenges all played a material role in the analysis.</p>
<p>Banks already have ongoing obligations to manage all material risks, and while scenario analysis generally is not intended to be predictive, I think the uncertainty and unreliability of the results from this exercise suggest that resources may be better devoted to dealing with more tangible and immediate financial risks.</p>
<p>We should rightly be concerned about regulatory pressure on a single issue that could lead to the misallocation of risk-management resources away from risks that may be more material, such as interest rate, liquidity, and cyber risks.</p>
<p><strong>Closing Thoughts</strong><br />We continue to be at an inflection point in the bank regulatory reform agenda. The pending proposals, including the Basel III capital proposal, the G-SIB surcharge, new long-term debt requirements, amended resolution plan guidance, contemplated changes to the regulatory approval of merger and acquisition activity, and revisions to the interchange fee cap will have a lasting impact on banks of all sizes and their current and future customers.</p>
<p>My hope is that you and other interested stakeholders play an active role in this process by sharing your views and concerns with regulators. This input provides valuable insights into the specific impacts&mdash;intended and unintended&mdash;of changes to the bank regulatory framework. Voicing your concerns enables us to identify, and where needed, address, the real-world consequences of regulatory and supervisory reforms. Without your participation, we cannot fully appreciate the impacts of our regulatory and supervisory changes.</p>
<p>Thank you, and I look forward to our discussion.</p>

<div> Subsidiaries, Disclosures, IFRS 19, SEC, Financial statements
Summary:
The IASB issued IFRS 19 for subsidiaries without public accountability, affecting SEC filings, and the need for additional material disclosures. <div>
<p>In May 2024, the International Accounting Standards Board (&ldquo;IASB&rdquo;) issued International Financial Reporting Standard (&ldquo;IFRS&rdquo;) 19,&nbsp;<i>Subsidiaries without Public Accountability: Disclosures&nbsp;</i>(&ldquo;IFRS 19&rdquo;), which permits certain subsidiaries of reporting companies to provide reduced disclosures when applying recognition, measurement, and presentation requirements of IFRS Accounting Standards<i>.</i><a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/munter-gerding-statement-ifrs19-051724#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;IFRS 19 also specifies that eligible subsidiaries that elect to apply the standard must provide additional material disclosures when it determines that information is necessary to enable financial statement users to understand the impact of transactions, events, and conditions on the subsidiary&rsquo;s financial position and financial performance.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/munter-gerding-statement-ifrs19-051724#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;Although the scope of IFRS 19 is limited to entities that do not have public accountability<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/munter-gerding-statement-ifrs19-051724#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;at the end of their financial statement reporting period, there may be situations when financial statements that apply IFRS 19 are included in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &ldquo;SEC&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Commission&rdquo;). In these situations, we believe that the requirements of IFRS 19 are likely to necessitate additional disclosures in financial statements filed with the SEC because such financial statements are intended for use by investors in our public capital markets for making investment and voting decisions.</p>
<p>Under SEC rules, registrants are generally required to file certain financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/munter-gerding-statement-ifrs19-051724#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;Foreign private issuers,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/munter-gerding-statement-ifrs19-051724#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;however, are permitted to file financial statements that are prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB, or, alternatively, in accordance with their home country GAAP with reconciliation to U.S. GAAP.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/munter-gerding-statement-ifrs19-051724#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;High quality financial information provided to investors is foundational to the integrity of our capital markets system. SEC rules specify that financial statements prepared in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework (i.e., U.S. GAAP or IFRS as issued by the IASB) is the minimum requirement and registrants are required to consider whether additional material information is needed so that the required financial statements are not misleading.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/munter-gerding-statement-ifrs19-051724#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;This principle guides our interpretation of the application of IFRS 19 to the U.S. public securities markets.</p>
<p>In establishing the rules governing disclosure by foreign private issuers with securities trading in U.S. public securities markets, the Commission has recognized the importance of balancing the information needs of investors with the public interest served by opportunities to invest in a variety of securities. Historically, the Commission has supported initiatives to reduce regulatory burdens on foreign private issuers that are consistent with the Commission&rsquo;s investor protection mandate.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/munter-gerding-statement-ifrs19-051724#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;We acknowledge the IASB&rsquo;s efforts in promulgating IFRS 19 to promote efficiency for subsidiaries that do not have public accountability, whose parent company issues consolidated financial statements, inclusive of all disclosure requirements, in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/munter-gerding-statement-ifrs19-051724#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;while maintaining decision-useful information for users of financial statements in certain contexts. We also believe the requirement in IFRS 19 for entities to consider whether additional disclosures are necessary to provide an understanding of particular events or circumstances is critical for investor protection purposes in U.S. public securities markets. Disclosures that are fit for other purposes for entities without public accountability may not be sufficient to satisfy the needs of investors in the U.S. public securities markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/munter-gerding-statement-ifrs19-051724#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></p>
<p>As just one example, if a foreign private issuer files documents with the SEC related to a merger with a foreign business that qualifies for and elects to apply IFRS 19, and the registrant is required to provide financial statements of the foreign business, the foreign business is required by IFRS 19 to consider whether additional material disclosures need to be included in its financial statements to enable investors to understand the impact of transactions, other events, and conditions on the foreign business&rsquo;s financial position and financial performance. The purpose of including the foreign business&rsquo;s financial statements in the SEC filing at the time of the transaction is to help investors better understand the nature and extent of the business being acquired and the resulting combined entity when making their voting or investment decisions. Given the purpose of inclusion of the foreign business&rsquo;s financial statements in the registration statement, the needs of investors would likely be similar to the needs of investors in an entity with public accountability.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/munter-gerding-statement-ifrs19-051724#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;In such a scenario, even though the foreign business may be eligible to and has elected to apply IFRS 19 in order to benefit from reduced disclosures, it should carefully consider whether it is nevertheless required to include additional material disclosures from other IFRS Accounting Standards to achieve the objectives of financial reporting given the use of those financial statements in a filing with the SEC.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/munter-gerding-statement-ifrs19-051724#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></p>
<p>We are committed to assisting registrants in fulfilling their responsibilities related to providing high-quality financial information to investors and other users of financial statements, and we remain available for consultation on issues related to the form and content of financial statements<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/munter-gerding-statement-ifrs19-051724#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>&nbsp;and technical accounting matters,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/munter-gerding-statement-ifrs19-051724#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>&nbsp;including application of IFRS 19 in Commission filings.</p>

Summary:
FINRA's Board of Governors met, discussed financial transparency, welcomed new Advisory Committee members, received updates on risk management and cybersecurity, and hosted SEC Commissioner Uyeda. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>FINRA&rsquo;s Board of Governors met on May 8-9 for the second time in 2024. The Board<a>&nbsp;approved FINRA&rsquo;s 2023 Annual Financial Report, appointed new members to Advisory Committees, was briefed on FINRA&rsquo;s Advanced Analytics Strategic Initiative, received operational updates and continued discussions around FINRA&rsquo;s long-term financial planning.</a></p>
<p>FINRA&rsquo;s 2023 Annual Financial Report will be publicly available in the coming weeks. Each year, FINRA publishes an Annual Financial Report in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles that describes how FINRA manages its finances to support its mission of protecting investors and promoting market integrity. The report is one aspect of FINRA&rsquo;s financial transparency, which includes the posting of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/about/annual-reports#financial-policies">FINRA&rsquo;s Financial Guiding Principles</a>, the release of FINRA&rsquo;s Annual Budget Summary and the publication of the annual Report on the Use of FINRA&rsquo;s Fine Monies, which was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/about/governance/finra-board-governors/meetings/update-finra-board-governors-meeting-march-2024">approved in March</a>.</p>
<p>The new members of FINRA&rsquo;s Advisory Committees begin their term on June 1. Advisory Committee members serve on rolling three-year terms to increase opportunities for those who are interested in serving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are delighted to welcome the new members of the Advisory Committees. Participation and engagement in the Advisory Committees lead to meaningful feedback on a variety of regulatory matters, and the exchange of ideas from a diverse membership base is a great benefit to the industry,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/about/governance/finra-board-governors/eric-noll">FINRA Board Chair Eric Noll</a>.</p>
<p>The Board received several updates, including on FINRA&rsquo;s enterprise risk management and cybersecurity programs. In addition, the Board heard the latest update on FINRA&rsquo;s Advanced Analytics Strategic Initiative, which the&nbsp;Board&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/media-center/newsreleases/2021/report-finra-board-governors-meeting-march-2021">approved in 2021</a>&nbsp;to enhance the tools and techniques FINRA utilizes to process data from regulatory and public sources, allowing FINRA to identify potential misconduct more quickly and strengthening the ability to mitigate customer harm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;FINRA leverages innovative technology and deep market expertise to support our mission of investor protection and market integrity,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/about/governance/executives">FINRA CEO Robert Cook</a>.</p>
<p>The Board also hosted Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner Mark Uyeda, who discussed with the Board his priorities and perspectives regarding issues impacting the broker-dealer industry.</p>

<div> contradictions, US capital rules, central clearing, derivatives, impact

US capital rules propose increased capital for central clearing, contradicting its praised risk reduction benefits, causing capacity constraints and rising costs for G-SIBs and end users. <br /><br />Summary: People praise central clearing for reducing risk, but US capital rules proposing increased capital contradict its benefits, causing capacity constraints and rising costs. <div>
<p>People are full of contradictions, but the impact of proposed US capital rules on central clearing is a particularly blatant example. On the one hand, central clearing of derivatives is widely acclaimed by policymakers for reducing risk and increasing the resilience of financial markets. On the other, US prudential regulators apparently see it as so risky that the provision of client clearing by banks warrants an 80% increase in capital, a move that would reduce capacity and increase costs.</p>
<p>This contradiction was a frequent point of discussion at the ISDA Annual General Meeting (AGM) in Tokyo in April, including by US Commodity Futures Trading Commission chair Rostin Behnam, who raised concerns about the impact of the proposed capital rules on clearing during his keynote interview. &nbsp;&ldquo;We want to incentivise clearing &ndash; we want folks to understand the benefits of it and not create unnecessary costs that would disincentivise clearing,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>According to an industry impact study conducted by ISDA and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, the US Basel III proposals would increase market risk capital for US global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) by between 73% and 101%, depending on the extent to which banks use internal models. However, an ISDA survey suggests the use of internal models is likely to radically shrink due to the complexity of the new trading book requirements &ndash; a move described by Jacques Vigner, chief strategic oversight officer for global markets at BNP Paribas, as a return to the &ldquo;stone age of risk management&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This means the capital impact will likely be closer to a 101% increase, creating capacity constraints for US G-SIBs and raising financing and hedging costs for end users. &ldquo;We should recognise that impeding banks&rsquo; ability to make markets and particularly to make markets in stress can come with certain negative consequences,&rdquo; said Brad Tully, managing director and global head of corporate derivatives and private side sales at JP Morgan.</p>
<p>This issue of&nbsp;<span>IQ</span>&nbsp;looks back at some of the talking points that dominated the AGM. We&rsquo;d like to take this opportunity to thank our sponsors, speakers and all those who made the trip to Tokyo &ndash; we hope you enjoyed it as much as we did.</p>

<li><em>The EBA plays an important role in the implementation of the EU Banking Package.</em></li>
<li><em>These draft Guidelines are part of the first phase of the EBA roadmap&nbsp;for implementing the EU Banking Package.</em></li>
<li><em>These draft guidelines will contribute to a more a robust regulatory framework, efficient supervision, and enhanced risk control by credit institutions.</em></li>
</ul>
<br />
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today launched a public consultation on its draft Guidelines (GLs) under the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR3) regarding acquisition, development and construction (ADC) exposures to residential property. These Guidelines specify the credit risk-mitigating conditions that allow institutions to assign a risk weight of 100% instead of 150% for ADC exposures to residential property. Furthermore, the Guidelines also address the specificities of institutions&rsquo; lending to public housing or not-for profit entities. The consultation runs until 19 August 2024.</span></p>
<p>The Guidelines specify further the two conditions introduced in the CRR3 for ADC exposures to residential property to benefit from a risk weight of 100% instead of 150%:</p>
<ul>
<li>50% of pre-sale and pre-lease contracts with respectively a cash deposit equal to or higher than 10% of the sale price and equal to or higher than 3 times the monthly lease rate, or sale and lease contracts.</li>
<li>The obligor has substantial equity at risk, represented as an appropriate amount of obligor-contributed equity representing 35% of the residential property value upon completion.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>Against this background, the draft Guidelines will define the metrics and thresholds associated with the two conditions mentioned above. The EBA will leverage further on an ad hoc data collection conducted as part of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-02/8e137775-a1f5-427e-893f-0d4af145cbe3/eu_specific_basel_iii_monitoring_reporting_template.xlsx">Basel 3 monitoring QIS to calibrate the threshold</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Guidelines establish a specific framework for ADC projects related to public housing or not-for-profit entities across the European Union, which in any case is optional compared to the general framework at the discretion of credit-granting institutions.</p>
<h4>Consultation process</h4>
<p>Comments to this consultation can be sent to the EBA by clicking on the "send your comments" button on the consultation page. Please note that the deadline for the submission of comments is 19 August 2024.</p>

<div> Federal Reserve, payments, technical standards, innovation, collaboration 
Summary: The article discusses the importance of technical standards in the evolving payments system and the Federal Reserve's role in fostering collaboration and innovation. <div>
<p>Thank you, President Kashkari, for the introduction, and thank you to the conference participants for the opportunity to speak with you.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240517a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;As you all know, the payment system relies on the kind of cooperation and collaboration that this body represents. So, let's begin by acknowledging that ongoing effort.</p>
<p>From its founding, the Federal Reserve has played a central role in payments. We seek to foster a payment and settlement system that is safe and efficient. Such a system promotes a vibrant economy, since it allows for participation from a broad range of individuals and businesses without requiring them to invest heavily in bilateral arrangements. Technical standards are the common language used by payment system participants like businesses, financial institutions, payment system operators, and payment service providers. Technical standards can help contribute to payment system safety and efficiency, benefitting the full range of participants. Technical standards for payments are in no way new&mdash;we have had them in place for decades, and those standards make it more efficient to process a check, access cash at an ATM, and carry out other functions less visible to consumers but essential to the payment system. As payments technology advances at a rapid pace, technical standards must also evolve. And they must do so in a way that supports innovation while promoting safety, efficiency, and interoperability among a growing number of payments products and technologies. Today I will share some perspectives on technical standards, particularly in the context of evolving payments technology.</p>
<p><strong>Everything Old Is New Again</strong><br />But before getting to that, I would like to provide some historical context since the benefits of standardization within an evolving payment system predate this current wave of innovation.</p>
<p>Let's start with some early examples from U.S. payments history. The free-banking era from 1837 to 1863 experienced significant fragmentation and corresponding frictions in the payment system as competing banknotes circulated across different geographical regions, requiring costly and inefficient trading of various forms of currency and featuring high levels of fraud and counterfeiting.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240517a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;Later, during the national banking era from 1863 to 1913, checks were becoming a predominant form of payment at the same time that the population of the United States was moving westward, requiring a nationwide method to clear checks. The check clearing infrastructure at the time, however, was regional, creating a patchwork network reliant on correspondent banks to move and clear checks across regions, often at high cost and with long delays. Congress created the Federal Reserve in 1913 and assigned the Fed a number of key roles including issuance of Federal Reserve Notes and, in short order, establishment of a national check-clearing network. These are examples that predate electronic payments where standardization improved the efficiency of payments.</p>
<p>We can also call on examples where we have seen rapid changes in the technology of payments, and technical standards supported innovation by providing a common language for systems to communicate with each other. Immediately after 9/11, planes were grounded, and check payments, which were still largely paper-based, could not be processed.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240517a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;This highlighted inefficiency in the clearing of paper checks. In response, Congress passed the Check 21 Act, which enabled banks to process check information electronically using digital images of an original check. The Check 21 Act created a framework for the substitute check to be provided under generally applicable industry standards and also served as a bridge until industry acceptance of fully electronic checks became ubiquitous.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240517a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;Electronic check processing at such scale necessitated common check image exchange standards, which were developed and adopted through industry and Fed collaboration.</p>
<p>And, as I mentioned earlier, the payment system once again is experiencing a technology-driven revolution.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240517a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;Shifting consumer preferences and new technologies have led to new financial products and services. This includes the introduction of instant payments, advances in digital wallets and mobile payment apps, and the emergence and growth of digital assets. Innovators see an opportunity for enhancements in payments, whether through the introduction of new capabilities or finding ways to alleviate frictions such as speed, cost, and accessibility.</p>
<p>While the potential benefits of these advances are significant, disjointed or incompatible innovations could increase fragmentation in the payment system or exacerbate frictions at different points of the payment chain. Will platforms that use newer technologies, for example, be able to talk with one another and traditional payment rails, or will they lead to siloed, parallel networks&mdash;so-called "walled gardens"?</p>
<p>Supporting compatibility or interoperability is important because payment systems are similar to other networks in that greater participation in the network usually means greater value for its users. The network effects in turn can drive a more vibrant economy, since a well-functioning payment system can promote commerce across a broader range of consumers and businesses. While achieving goals like network scale and interoperability is a complex problem, technical standards are one part of the solution to support consistent communication among existing and emerging technologies.</p>
<p><strong>Perspectives on Technical Standards</strong><br />A technical standard is simply a common specification or guideline. For example: when I drive across the country, I do not need to worry about whether pumps at different gas stations will fit my gas tank. That is because there is an agreed-upon standard. Or, in the example of payments, financial institutions adopt messaging standards to allow systems and networks to communicate with one another.</p>
<p>If done well, the development and adoption of technical standards can help increase efficiency across payment chains and promote consistency in how disparate systems communicate. This requires standards that are technically sound, implemented consistently, and timed correctly to meet a market need.</p>
<p>Technical standards&mdash;such as those developed within the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)&mdash;are voluntary, open, and consensus-based. The collective market can identify frictions where standards would be beneficial, and then individual firms can choose whether and when to adopt them based on perceived benefit. The process to develop the standards is open and transparent, and it requires consensus at every step. This process establishes standards that are seen as credible and legitimate.</p>
<p><em>Considerations and Lessons Learned</em><br />It is important to note that simply having a standard in place will not automatically translate to economic benefits. To achieve network effects, standards must be widely adopted. Developing&nbsp;<em>consensus-based</em>&nbsp;standards implies that all relevant participants are at the table and advocating for their interests, which is not a given, but is critical if standards are to be widely adopted. Timing is also important. In the early stages of technological advances, standards should not be overly prescriptive to stifle innovation and should be flexible and adaptable as the market changes. Conversely, waiting too long to adopt a technical standard could lead to inefficiencies and high costs to comply after the fact.</p>
<p>Standards also need to be implemented consistently, which requires industry coordination to align on common practices. Building on previous lessons learned, the ISO 20022 messaging standard was developed to be a common standard for multiple payment rails, with a structured data format, and aims to align messages across payment systems. Nonetheless, there has been variation in ISO 20022 implementation, and further industry coordination over time will be necessary to align on common practices.</p>
<p>All of this&mdash;identifying the need and timing for standards, incorporating a breadth of industry perspectives, and aligning on implementation approaches&mdash;requires an immense amount of coordination. And much of this coordination must take place among competitors. So often a neutral convener is needed to achieve better outcomes. That is why we have standard development organizations like ISO to provide a forum where participants from the private sector, academia, and the public sector can contribute expertise and collectively shape standards in a way that meets business and public sector objectives, providing some comfort that the needs of all market participants and consumers will be considered.</p>
<p><strong>The Federal Reserve and Payments Technical Standards</strong><br />That brings me to the Federal Reserve's roles in this process&mdash;not role but&nbsp;<em>roles</em>. One such role is to serve as a convenor, with this week's conference being a typical example. Among standards development organizations, like the Accredited Standards Committee X9 domestically and ISO internationally, the Fed is known for impartial facilitation of efforts to work toward a common goal.</p>
<p>In another role, the Federal Reserve leverages its expertise as a payment system operator to inform future standards and broader improvements in the payment system. For example, in 2015, the Fed issued a call to action in its paper, "Strategies for Improving the U.S. Payment System," asking stakeholders to come together in pursuit of a better payment system for the future. The paper, and subsequent work, highlighted the role of standards to enhance payments security and efficiency at various points in the payment and ancillary processing flows, noting the importance of supporting industry efforts to develop and adopt standards, as well as common approaches to implementation.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240517a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a></p>
<p>The Federal Reserve itself adopts standards in its role as a payment system operator. For example, the FedNow Service, which went live in July 2023, was built using the ISO 20022 messaging standard. Incorporating this standard enables a number of operational efficiencies, including improved information exchange between financial institutions, support for straight-through processing, and reduction in errors and the need for manual processing steps. We have also committed to adopting the ISO 20022 messaging standard for the Federal Reserve's wholesale payments service, the Fedwire Funds Service, by March 2025. We expect this adoption will improve the speed of wholesale cross-border payments by reducing operational costs and promoting consistent communication across global platforms. The richer data in ISO 20022 could also improve anti-money laundering and sanctions screening and support broader adoption of extended remittance information.</p>
<p>In serving as a neutral convenor, providing payments expertise, and improving payments in our role as a payment system operator, the Fed extends its long history of engaging in the development of payments technical standards.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />As we navigate the latest wave of technological innovation in payments, the fundamental payment system dynamics and role of technical standards are not new. However, the pace of change is a lot faster now than in the 1910s, when paper checks were used. Collaboration among a broad range of private and public stakeholders can help to establish standards for integrating the new technologies into the payment system.</p>
<p>Advocating for an open and transparent standards development process, where participants adopt standards that are technically sound and supportive of business and public objectives, is one way the Federal Reserve can help to foster payment system safety and efficiency, as well as support responsible innovation at its present rapid clip.</p>

<div> fraud, Guy Flintham, FCA, investment scheme, Ponzi scheme
Summary:
Guy Flintham sentenced to 6 years for defrauding 240 investors of £19m. Misled them with false representations, spent money on an extravagant lifestyle. FCA commences confiscation proceedings. Devastating impact on victims' lives. <div>
<p><span>Following a hearing at Southwark Crown Court, Guy Flintham, 46, was today sentenced to 6 years for fraud.</span></p>
<p><span>On 19 February 2024, Mr Flintham pleaded guilty to fraud by false representation, following a prosecution brought by the FCA.</span></p>
<p><span>Between January 2016 and November 2021, Mr Flintham, based in Blackburn, Lancashire, defrauded more than 240 investors by making false representations to persuade them to invest approximately &pound;19m in an investment scheme operated by him.</span></p>
<p><span>Among these representations was the claim that he was a successful trader: in reality he was not.</span></p>
<p><span>He lied about how the scheme was operated and the profits that he was making for his investors. He sent them falsified trading statements which showed healthy returns. Any money that was paid out to them as returns was money received from other investors - or their own investment paid back to them.</span></p>
<p><span>Only &pound;1.14m was ever placed into trading accounts by Mr Flintham, with a further &pound;10m paid back to investors as &lsquo;profits&rsquo; or withdrawals of capital. Mr Flintham spent substantial sums on an extravagant lifestyle, including more than &pound;1m on vehicles, personalised number plates, jewellery and designer goods.</span></p>
<p><span><span>In sentencing, His Honour Judge Milne, remarked:</span></span></p>
<p>'The fraud [in this case] relates to money being taken from friends, from family. It relates to people you know, who you met&hellip; you took money from them having looked them in the eye and no doubt shaken their hand.</p>
<p>'I read the victim impact statements: they are heartbreaking... over and over again I read of the devastation left in the wake of [the fraud you perpetrated].</p>
<p>'People were devastated by what has happened; people&rsquo;s lives have been irrevocably damaged.'&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Steve Smart, Joint Executive Director of Enforcement &amp; Market Oversight at the FCA, said:</span></span></p>
<p><span>'Over a 5-year period, Mr Flintham deliberately lied and misled people to persuade them to invest in what amounted to little more than a Ponzi scheme.</span></p>
<p><span>'The sentence imposed today demonstrates the seriousness of Mr Flintham&rsquo;s offending and is a warning to others who choose to engage in fraud.'</span></p>
<p><span>The FCA has commenced confiscation proceedings against Mr Flintham, with a hearing listed for 18 July.</span></p>
<p><span>The FCA took proactive steps using their powers under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 to secure available assets at an early stage in the investigation to make them available for confiscation.</span></p>
<p><span>A further count of carrying on regulated activity without authorisation or exemption, contrary to the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, was ordered to lie on file.</span></p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<ol>
<li>Guy Flintham&rsquo;s date of birth is 7 July 1977.</li>
<li>Fraud by false representation is contrary to section 1 of the Fraud Act 2006. It is punishable by a fine and/or up to 10 years&rsquo; imprisonment.</li>
<li>Mr Flintham pleaded not guilty in respect of the offence of carrying on regulated activity without being authorised or exempt at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 22 January 2024.</li>
<li>Mr Flintham did not indicate a plea&nbsp;in respect of the fraud offence and the case was sent to Southwark Crown Court for a Plea and Trial Preparation Hearing which took place on 19 February 2024.</li>

<p>Network codes are binding rules governing connection requirements to the electricity networks in an effective and transparent manner. There are three electricity grid connection network codes:</p>
<ul>
<li>requirements for grid connection of generators (RfG Regulation);</li>

<title>ICE Midland WTI (HOU) Futures Reach All-Time Daily Volume Record</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ice-midland-wti-hou-futures-reach-all-time-daily-volume-record/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE: ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today announced that its ICE Midland WTI (ICE:HOU) crude futures contract hit its highest volume day on May 13, 2024, with over 100,000 contracts traded.</p>
<p>The volume activity follows records set in the HOU futures contract in 2024, including record average daily volume of 16,700 contracts during April, rising to over 29,000 contracts during May 2024, based on month-to-date trading activity. Alongside this, HOU open interest (OI) is up over 190% year-over-year (y/y).</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s great to see the market utilize HOU as the only exchange-guaranteed source of ratably delivered Midland WTI barrels,&rdquo; said Jeff Barbuto, Global Head of Oil Markets at ICE. &ldquo;HOU is where U.S. production meets global demand, and the quality spec of ICE HOU matches the globally accepted Midland-WTI quality. Physical cargoes load at the U.S. Gulf Coast for export to Asia and Europe, where HOU-quality barrels are accepted in the Platts Dated Brent assessment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right now, the U.S. Gulf Coast market is focused on the scheduled maintenance of the Wink to Webster pipeline due in June 2024, with Argus announcing that all trades originating from this pipeline will be excluded from their MEH assessment,&rdquo; continued Barbuto. &ldquo;The ICE HOU contract rules state that HOU must be on-spec and be delivered ratably. These are the times when exchange-guaranteed quality and deliveries show their value.&rdquo;</p>
<p>ICE&rsquo;s rules state, &ldquo;It is the Seller&rsquo;s obligation to ensure that the Product receipts are available to begin flowing ratably at the Specified Terminal by the first day of the delivery month." Full contract rules can be found here:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ice.com/publicdocs/contractregs/179_SECTION_7A1.pdf" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">https://www.ice.com/publicdocs/contractregs/179_SECTION_7A1.pdf</a></p>
<p>ICE offers HOU time spreads, as well as inter-commodity spreads with Brent and WTI Cushing (Domestic Light Sweet) to help customers mitigate price risk between locations and grades. Meanwhile, customers can benefit from margin offsets as high as 98% when clearing HOU alongside other oil positions cleared at ICE. Offsets are available across a range of over 800 oil contracts, including ICE Brent, ICE Gasoil, ICE WTI, ICE Dubai (Platts), ICE Murban, as well as RBOB Gasoline. OI across ICE&rsquo;s total oil complex is up over 20% y/y at 14 million contracts.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">When?</span></p>
<p>Thursday 6 June 2024, from 14:00 to 16:00 CET.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is it about?</span></p>
<p>Significant investments in electricity grids are needed to realise Europe&rsquo;s decarbonisation objectives and ensure a high level of security of supply. With the digitalisation of the electricity sector and the progress made in several technologies giving rise to smarter and more affordable solutions, it is now possible to reduce costs and lead times associated with electricity grid expansion. Despite their advantages, these innovative solutions are not yet spearheading investment choices.</p>
<p>In the context of the European Commission&rsquo;s EU Action Plan for Grids, ACER has been tasked to recommend best practices to promote smart grids and network efficiency technologies through tariff design.</p>
<p>ACER has thus commissioned the FSR to conduct a study on existing regulatory frameworks and building a new scheme that regulators can use when it comes to incentivising a more efficient use of existing and future electricity grids.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why should you join the event?</span></p>
<p>The event provides an opportunity to receive first access to the FSR report, as well as to discuss all aspects of the proposed scheme with representatives from industry, system operations, research, and regulation.</p>

<div> SET, BMA, TTAT, table tennis court, Benchakitti Sports Center
<br />
The collaboration among SET, BMA, and TTAT created a standard table tennis court at Benchakitti Sports Center to promote sports and healthy living.
<br /><br />Summary:
The collaboration aims to promote sports and healthy living by providing a standard table tennis court at the Benchakitti Sports Center for public use. <div>
<p>The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET), in collaboration with the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) and the Table Tennis Association of Thailand (TTAT), has developed a standard table tennis court at the Benchakitti Sports Center, Bangkok. This pioneering project, one of the initiatives to commemorate SET's 50th anniversary, is the result of a visionary collaboration outlined in the MOU titled "National Table Tennis Sports Center, Bangkok City Project. The development of this facility aims to promote sports and healthy living, increase the availability of exercise venues, and provide facilities for athletes, youth, and the general public regardless of gender and age, to enjoy table tennis. The court is now open to the public.</p>
<p><b>Deputy Governor of Bangkok, Sanon Wangsrangboon</b> said that in line with its commitment to enhance sport facilities, the BMA has continuously refined and developed sports fields across the Thai capital, covering physical infrastructure, management, event organization, and the promotion of cooperation across sectors. The goal is to ensure these facilities meet the standard for playing sports, exercising, and recreation while catering to the diverse needs of the community," aligning with the BMA's commitment to creating "Sports Arenas for Everyone." The partnership with SET and TTAT to enhance the table tennis facilities at the Benchakitti Sports Center is a prime example of area development in Bangkok for the benefits of the public, particularly by leveraging sports and recreation to promote health and quality of life for the city's residents. He also highlighted the significance of Benchakitti Park, a vast green space in the heart of Bangkok, as a key location for such initiative.</p>
<p><b>SET Senior Executive Vice President Rongrak Phanapavudhikul</b> said that the collaboration between SET, BMA, and TTAT to facilitate standard table tennis courts is part of the activities to mark SET's 50th year anniversary. The initiative also fosters the growth of young table tennis players and promotes table tennis as a sport for all ages and genders.</p>
<p>SET has been supporting the Table Tennis Association of Thailand for 11 years through the "SET Star Table Tennis" project, which focuses on developing the table tennis community and youth table tennis athletes. This initiative has brought fame to Thailand through success in regional and international table tennis competitions, supporting the government's goal of promoting the Thai sports industry as a soft power asset for the country.</p>
<p><b>TTAT President Nattavuth Ruengves </b>highlighted the positive impact of the sport on youth development, stating that Table tennis is suitable for all genders and ages, particularly children and youth as it enhances their physical movement and muscle skills, promotes strategic thinking, and fosters important values such as sportsmanship, integrity, and self-discipline. The association aims to popularize this sport and is confident that with the cooperation of all parties, it will be able to produce world-class table tennis athletes who can serve as good role models for Thai youth. Furthermore, the association is preparing to organize the SET Star Table Tennis Cup 2024, scheduled on May 18-19, 2024, to inaugurate the opening of the table tennis court at the Benchakitti Sports Center. The tournament will be opened for children and youth aged 11-19 years. The event has already attracted more than 400 participants, with an additional family category added to promote family bonding through exercise.</p>
<p>The table tennis court at the Benchakitti Sports Center is a standard table tennis court which is equipped with 30 table tennis tables and facilities. The court is open daily for public from 5:00 hrs. to 21:00 hrs. and reservation can be made online at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">กีฬากรุงเทพ</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">.</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">com</span> website or directly at the court.</p>

Recently the Menteri Besar of Johor, YAB Datuk Onn Hafiz Ghazi, announced the state&rsquo;s remarkable achievement&nbsp;of attracting a total of RM113.7 billion in investments, creating 35,000 jobs, within a span of just two years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This will bring more wealth to the state and the individuals who dwell therein, and with this, making wise investment becomes important especially at an individual level,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dato&rsquo; Seri Dr. Awang Adek also cautioned the public on scammers frequently using the &ldquo;syariah-compliant&rdquo; label or names of influencers to lend credence and legitimacy to their schemes and in the former, appeal to Muslim investors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In fact, they were even bold enough to misuse the names of agencies such as the SC, Bank Negara Malaysia, licensed intermediaries, as well as local celebrities and religious leaders,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The public should be aware that just because a product is purportedly syariahcompliant or linked to a high-profile individual doesn&rsquo;t mean that the product is good and the capital or returns are guaranteed,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>The SC&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.sc.com.my/resources/publications-and-research/survey-report">Investors&rsquo; Survey</a><a href="https://www.sc.com.my/resources/publications-and-research/survey-report"> </a>published on its website showed that 30% or 384 out of the 1,302 of the respondents were more susceptible to scams.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Further, the study showed that vulnerable groups relied on family and friends to make investment decisions. They also invest in schemes without verification of the information given and are easily influenced by unlicensed and unqualified individuals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These findings imply an increased willingness to be exposed to investment opportunities and to invest without fully grasping the risks. They demonstrate a critical gap in investment literacy and concerning levels of susceptibility to scams, with investors more likely to fall victim to fraudulent schemes.</p>
<p>Recognising this, the SC earlier this year introduced the <a href="https://www.sc.com.my/investment-checker">Investment Checker</a><a href="https://www.sc.com.my/investment-checker"> </a>on its official website to help investors verify the legitimacy of investment entities and make well-informed investment decisions.</p>
<p>The Investment Checker serves as a one-stop-centre for the public to check and verify the legitimacy of entities and individuals offering investment opportunities. Since its launch, the Investment Checker has been one of the SC&rsquo;s top visited web pages, with over 25,000 visits so far.</p>
<p>Apart from Bersama InvestSmart<sup>&reg;</sup>@Johor, the SC will also host the NaviGate Capital Market Green Financing Series on 20 May 2024 in Iskandar Puteri, with the support of Iskandar Investment Berhad.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<title>Hong Kong Securities And Futures Commission Welcomes Industry-Led Public Consultation On Voluntary Code Of Conduct For ESG Ratings And Data Products Providers</title>

<div> Securities and Futures Commission, voluntary code of conduct, ESG ratings, ICMA, self-regulatory organization
Summary: The Securities and Futures Commission welcomes the launch of a voluntary code of conduct for ESG ratings by the ICMA.<br /><br /> <div>
<p>The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) welcomes the launch of a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.icmagroup.org/sustainable-finance/icma-and-other-sustainable-finance-initiatives/the-hong-kong-esg-ratings-and-data-code-of-conduct-working-group-2/" target="_blank">public consultation</a>&nbsp;today by an industry-led working group on a voluntary code of conduct (VCoC) for environmental, social and governance (ESG) ratings and data products providers providing products and services in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The initiative to develop the proposed VCoC is supported and sponsored by the SFC (Note 1). Led by the International Capital Market Association (ICMA), the Hong Kong ESG Ratings and Data Products Providers VCoC Working Group (VCWG) modelled the draft VCoC on international best practices recommended by the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) (Note 2).</p>
<p>The draft VCoC is interoperable as it is consistent with the expectations introduced in other major jurisdictions. It is available in both English and Chinese to encourage wider adoption by providers.</p>
<p>The draft VCoC also includes a self-attestation document to provide information on adherence to the code by the providers in a structured format. This will facilitate end users, such as SFC-licensed intermediaries, to compare the conduct of ESG ratings and data products providers during their due diligence and ongoing assessment processes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are deeply encouraged by the progress made by the industry-led working group under the leadership of ICMA. The code, together with the self-attestation document, will be vital in fostering greater transparency, quality and reliability of ESG information, as well as comparability of products,&rdquo; said Ms Julia Leung, the SFC&rsquo;s Chief Executive Officer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;ESG ratings and data products are essential resources for the sustainable finance market. We are pleased to coordinate this important working group sponsored by the SFC to develop and promote a voluntary code of conduct. We will continue to contribute our considerable experience in bringing about industry-led standards and our global expertise in sustainable finance,&rdquo; said Mr Bryan Pascoe, Chief Executive of ICMA.</p>
<p>The one-month public consultation will end on 17 June 2024.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>A self-regulatory organisation and trade association in the capital markets, the ICMA has been acting as the Secretariat to convene and lead the VCWG. The working group comprises representatives from local, Mainland and other international ESG ratings and data products providers as well as key users from the local financial industry. The SFC, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Insurance Authority and the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority are involved as observers to the VCWG. Please see the SFC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://apps.sfc.hk/edistributionWeb/gateway/EN/news-and-announcements/news/doc?refNo=23PR126" target="_blank">press release</a>&nbsp;dated 31 October 2023 for details.</li>
</ol><ol>
<li>The recommendations are derived from the IOSCO&nbsp;<a href="https://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD690.pdf" target="_blank">final report</a>&nbsp;titled&nbsp;<em>Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Ratings and Data Products Providers</em>&nbsp;dated November 2021. Subsequent to the report, IOSCO also published a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD717.pdf" target="_blank">document</a>&nbsp;in November 2022 which calls on financial markets voluntary standard setting bodies and industry associations to promote the adoption and implementation of the good practices stemming from the IOSCO recommendations amongst their members.</li>

<div> charged, disclosure-related, SFA, Eagle Hospitality Trust, investigation
<br />
Mr Takoushian, former CEO of Eagle Hospitality Trust, faces 4 charges for non-disclosure leading to default on a $341 million loan. Joint investigation by MAS and CAD ongoing.
<br /><br />Summary: 
Mr Takoushian faces charges for non-disclosure leading to default on a $341 million loan by Eagle Hospitality Trust. Joint investigation ongoing. <div>
<p><span>Mr Salvatore Gregory Takoushian (Mr Takoushian) was charged today for disclosure-related offences under the Securities and Futures Act (SFA).</span></p>
<p><span>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Takoushian was the former Chief Executive Officer of Eagle Hospitality Trust REIT Management Pte. Ltd. and Eagle Hospitality Business Trust Management Pte. Ltd., the managers responsible for managing Eagle Hospitality Trust (EHT), a stapled trust comprising Eagle Hospitality REIT (EH-REIT) and Eagle Hospitality Business Trust. Mr Takoushian currently faces 4 charges under section 203(1) read with section 331(1) of the SFA for consenting to EHT&rsquo;s reckless non-disclosure of information that was necessary to avoid the establishment of a false market.</span></p>
<p><span>3<span> </span></span>Under master lease agreements governing the properties in EHT&rsquo;s portfolio, the master lessees were required to provide, by 7 June 2019, standby letters of credit amounting to US$20 million, being the balance of security deposits owed to EH-REIT. The charges against Mr Takoushian concerned EHT&rsquo;s alleged reckless failure to disclose to the Singapore Exchange Limited (SGX) information pertaining to the failure by the master lessees to fund the shortfall in security deposits at various points in time between 7 June 2019 and 14 February 2020. The failure to provide the balance of security deposits led to a default under the master lease agreements and in turn, a default on a US$ 341 million loan made to EH-REIT, among other borrowers.</p>
<p>4<span> </span>The investigation was jointly conducted by the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Commercial Affairs Department of the Singapore Police Force.<a class="mas-link" href="file://C:/Users/mas_Tanth/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/3SR1PS63/Publication%20-%20Enf%20Action%20-%20Salvatore%20Takoushian%20(17%20May%202024).docx#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" target="_blank"><span class="mas-link__text"><sup>[1]</sup></span>&nbsp;<span class="mas-icon mas-glyphs-external--link">&nbsp;</span></a></p>
<p>5<span> </span>If convicted, for each charge, Mr Takoushian faces a fine of up to $250,000 or imprisonment for a term of up to 7 years, or both.</p>
<p>6<span> </span>The investigations against the other former directors of EHT&rsquo;s managers are ongoing.</p>
<p><span>***</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Additional Information</span>:</span></p>
<p><span>Securities and Futures Act (Chapter 289) (SFA)</span></p>
<p><span>Section 203(1) SFA states:&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;A person to whom this subsection applies must not intentionally, recklessly or negligently fail to notify the approved exchange of such information as is required to be disclosed by the approved exchange under the listing rules or any other requirement of the approved exchange, if the person is required by the approved exchange under the listing rules or any other requirement of the approved exchange to notify the approved exchange of information on specified events or matters as they occur or arise for the purpose of the approved exchange making that information available to an organised market operated by the approved exchange.</p>
<p>(2)&nbsp; Subsection (1) applies to the following:</p>
<p><span>(a)&nbsp; an entity, the securities or securities-based derivatives contracts of which are listed for quotation on an approved exchange;<br /></span>(b)&nbsp; a trustee-manager of a business trust, where the securities or securities-based derivatives contracts of the business trust are listed for quotation on an approved exchange;<br />(c)&nbsp; a responsible person of a collective investment scheme, where the units in the collective investment scheme are listed for quotation on an approved exchange.</p>
<p><span>(3)&nbsp; Despite section 204 or 335, a contravention of subsection (1) is not an offence unless the failure to notify is intentional or reckless.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>Section 204(1) of the SFA states: &ldquo;Any person who contravenes any of the provisions of this Division shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $250,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 7 years or to both."</p>
<p>Section 331(1) of the SFA states: &ldquo;Where an offence under this Act committed by a body corporate is proved to have been committed with the consent or connivance of, or to be attributable to any neglect on the part of an officer of the body corporate, the officer as well as the body corporate shall be guilty of that offence and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly.&rdquo;</p>

The Warsaw Stock Exchange Group reported record sales revenue, increased net profit, and strong equity turnover in Q1 2024. It also announced key strategic initiatives. <div>
<p>The Warsaw Stock Exchange Group generated record-high sales revenue of PLN 118.2 million in Q1 2024, an increase of 5.3% year on year. Net profit<span>1</span>&nbsp;increased by 2.1% year on year to PLN 27.2 million, despite an 8.8% drop in EBITDA to PLN 31.8 million. The Warsaw Stock Exchange has retained its strong position in Europe, ranking among the biggest markets by growth in EOB equity turnover value and the third by velocity, according to FESE Q1 2024 data. GPW&rsquo;s indices have delivered significant year-to-date growth and are reaching historic highs.</p>
<ul>
<li><span>PLN 118.2 million &ndash; record-high quarterly sales revenue of the GPW Group (+5.3% YoY)</span></li>
<li><span>PLN 31.8 million EBITDA in Q1 2024 (-8.8% YoY)</span></li>
<li><span>PLN 27.2 million net profit1 in Q1 2024 (+2.1% YoY)</span></li>
<li><span>30% WIG index growth since mid-October 2023</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Cash market records</span></p>
<p>A rally on the Polish capital market continued in Q1 2024. Index gains were accompanied by significant increase in turnover volumes. According to data from the Federation of European Securities Exchanges (FESE), EOB Main Market turnover reached PLN 82.7 billion in Q1 2024 and its year-on-year increase of 18.4% was among the highest in Europe. The Warsaw Stock Exchange ranked third in Europe by velocity at 39%. Investor activity remained strong in April. Main Market equity turnover reached PLN 31.1 billion, an increase of 78.5% year on year.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;These past seven months have been a very good time for the Warsaw Stock Exchange. High market turnover was coupled with historic index gains. The broad market index WIG and the large-cap index WIG20 gained more than 30% since mid-October 2023, ranking among the best performers globally,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;said Tomasz Bardziłowski, President of the GPW Management Board.</p>
<p>Revenue of the Warsaw Stock Exchange Group (GPW Group) stood at PLN 118.2 million in Q1 2024, an increase of 5.3% year on year. Revenue from the financial market increased by 11.6% year on year to PLN 74.2 million while revenue from the commodity market decreased by 4.2% year on year to PLN 39.6 million. Revenue from information services on the financial and commodity markets was the highest in the Group&rsquo;s history at PLN 15.8 million.</p>
<p>Despite the increase in revenue to a record level, the GPW Group&rsquo;s EBITDA after the first three months of 2024 amounted to PLN 31.8 million, down 8.8% year on year. Net profit attributable to owners of the parent entity amounted to PLN 27.2 million in Q1 2024 and was 2.1% higher than a year ago. Operating expenses increased by 9.5% year on year to PLN 94.4 million. As in previous years, the Group set up provisions for the annual capital market supervision fee in Q1 2024, amounting to PLN 15.65 million, PLN 0.2 million more than a year earlier.</p>
<p>The cash market saw another quarter of expansion in ETF offerings, reflecting growing investor interest in these products. ETF turnover on GPW reached a record high of PLN 370 million, increasing by 21.4% year on year. Turnover volume of the most popular derivative instrument on GPW, the WIG20 futures, increased by 1.7% year on year to 2.32 million contracts despite a much lower volatility of the underlying index.</p>
<p>The Warsaw Stock Exchange is consistently expanding the range of financial instruments for investors. New futures on the shares of four companies were added to the derivatives offer in Q1 2024: AmRest, PKP Cargo, Asbis, and Auto Partner. A new type of structured instrument, option warrants, were introduced to trading at the end of March 2024. These are warrants on the shares of nine Polish companies listed on GPW and on three indices: WIG20, mWIG40, and DAX.</p>
<p>The GPW Group has for several weeks been conducting an intensive review of its ongoing strategic initiatives to understand their economic potential and, above all, their financial and operational risks. Cost optimisation initiatives are also being analysed as part of this process.</p>
<p><span>WATS &ndash; GPW&rsquo;s key project</span></p>
<p>In April 2024, the GPW Supervisory Board appointed Sławomir Panasiuk as Vice-President for IT and Technology. Under his leadership, the Exchange plans not only to effectively implement the new trading system but also to improve cyber-security and adapt to new technological trends, which is essential to ensure the safety and efficiency of capital market operations. Sławomir Panasiuk will take up his position after receiving approval from the Polish Financial Supervision Authority (KNF).</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We are delighted with the outcome of the competition for the position of Management Board Member for IT. We are proud that we have established the GPW WATS Implementation Committee with the participation of industry representatives, which has developed a new implementation schedule. Despite significant delays, it is our top priority to ensure the safety of trading and to thoroughly test the new system,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;said Tomasz Bardziłowski.</p>
<p><span>TGE&rsquo;s new Management Board</span></p>
<p>In May 2024, TGE&rsquo;s Extraordinary General Meeting appointed Piotr Listwoń, former Vice-President for Operations, as President of the Management Board for the next term. TGE&rsquo;s Supervisory Board decided that Jarosław Ziębiec would remain on the Management Board as Vice-President for Business Development in the new term. Mariusz Buraczyński was appointed Vice-President for Operations, and he will take up the position subject to approval by the Polish Financial Supervision Authority. The appointment of the President and Members of the TGE Management Board was preceded by a competition procedure.</p>
<p>From January to March 2024, the Towarowa Giełda Energii Group (TGE Group) recorded a decline in electricity turnover by 7.4% to 32.1 TWh and in natural gas turnover by 16.5% to 34.0 TWh. The volume of property rights for electricity generated from renewable energy sources decreased by 21.5% year on year to 4.1 TWh.</p>
<p><span>EU regulatory changes</span></p>
<p>As a key capital market institution in Poland, the Warsaw Stock Exchange is closely following the upcoming regulatory changes at the European Union level. In April 2024, the European Parliament adopted a draft regulation which introduces important changes to the regulations designed to prevent capital market abuse and to the rules governing the issuance of shares in public offerings. The Listing Act aims to make public capital markets more attractive to companies and to facilitate access to capital for small and medium-sized enterprises. The key changes raise the threshold for exemption from the requirement to prepare a prospectus for the listing of securities from the current 20% to 30% within 12 months and exempt issuers whose shares of the same type have been listed on a regulated market for at least 18 months.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We welcome the key changes introduced by the Listing Act, most importantly the expansion of the prospectus exemption for issues. We hope that the liberalisation of prospectus requirements will significantly bolster the scale of capital raised by companies listed on GPW,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;said Tomasz Bardziłowski, President of the GPW Management Board.</p>
<p>GPW plans to actively participate in consultations on the concept of the Capital Markets Union. Although the idea enjoys growing interest among EU decision-makers and has been acknowledged for its importance in mobilising Europeans&rsquo; savings, including for the purpose of energy transition, the process has been facing many challenges for years. With its significantly lower capitalisation of listed companies compared to larger markets, Poland copes with additional difficulties in the context of the single capital market. Further discussions on the shape of the Capital Markets Union require participants to strike a balance between pan-European integration and preserving the capacity of local exchanges to raise capital efficiently, especially for smaller and medium-sized companies.</p>

<div> Regulation S-P, Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, safeguard rule, disposal rule, incident response program <br />
Summary: The Commission adopted amendments to Regulation S-P to protect customer information, including incident response program and breach notification requirements. <br /> <div>
<p>Today, the Commission adopted amendments to Regulation S-P, which were proposed last year.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-reg-s-p-051624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;Regulation S-P was initially adopted in 2000 pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, or the GLBA.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-reg-s-p-051624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;Congress subsequently amended the applicable privacy provisions of the GLBA in 2015.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-reg-s-p-051624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Regulation S-P is intended to provide customers and consumers with protections against threat actors who commit identity theft and other harms using personally identifiable information such as social security numbers, names, phone numbers, and addresses. In the years since Regulation S-P&rsquo;s initial adoption, the world has changed in how customers and financial institutions interact &ndash; from a paper-based world to a digital one. For some context, consider that in 2000, the country had just survived Y2K, pagers were still in vogue, and smartphones in their current incarnation did not yet exist. Even the idea of conducting financial transactions on the Internet &mdash; much less on mobile devices &mdash; was novel. Perhaps the closest forerunner to the modern smartphone was the Blackberry, where rather than looking at social media, a person could whittle away idle time with Brickbreaker.</p>
<p>Regulation S-P has two main components: a safeguard rule and a disposal rule. The safeguard rule generally requires financial institutions &ndash; including broker-dealers, funding portals, investment advisers, registered investment companies, and employee securities companies (collectively, &ldquo;covered institutions&rdquo;) &mdash; to adopt written policies and procedures to protect customer information against unauthorized access and use, including anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of customer information. Regulation S-P also requires these covered institutions to provide initial and annual privacy notices to customers describing information sharing policies and informing customers of their rights. Regulation S-P&rsquo;s second component is the disposal rule, which generally requires financial institutions and, after the final amendments, all transfer agents to properly dispose of consumer report information.</p>
<p>Considering the statutory mandate of GLBA and the importance of a retrospective review of a rule that was adopted nearly 25 years ago, I supported issuing the Commission&rsquo;s proposed amendments to Regulation S-P for public comment, although I had significant concerns about the potential for unnecessary and duplicative overlap with other proposed cybersecurity requirements for registered investment companies, registered investment advisers, broker-dealers, and other entities.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-reg-s-p-051624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;None of the proposals appeared to effectively consider how they would operate in conjunction with each other. Since the proposals, I have been encouraged by the internal discussions and coordination among Commission staff to address potential overlap and duplication as they consider finalizing those rules. The adoption of Regulation S-P is the first step of updating our privacy and cyber-security rule book.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s amendments to Regulation S-P will require covered institutions to adopt written policies and procedures that provide for an incident response program to protect customer information from unauthorized access, including to (1) assess the nature and scope of any incident, (2) take appropriate steps to contain and control the incident, and (3) notify affected individuals whose sensitive customer information was, or is reasonable likely to have been, accessed or used without authorization unless after a reasonable investigation, the covered institution determines that the sensitive customer information has not been, and is not reasonably likely to be, used in a manner that would result in substantial harm or inconvenience. The notice must be provided as soon as practicable, but generally not later than 30 days after the financial institution becomes aware that there has been an unauthorized breach of customer information.</p>
<p>I would like to highlight two changes from the proposal: first, the final amendments remove the proposed definition of &ldquo;substantial harm or inconvenience.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-reg-s-p-051624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;The proposed definition was a grab bag of assorted examples, including theft, fraud, harassment, physical harm, impersonation, intimidation, damaged reputation, impaired eligibility for credit, or the misuse of information identified with an individual to obtain a financial product or service, which may or may not cause &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; harm or inconvenience. The proposed definition included a new standard, &ldquo;more than trivial,&rdquo; which appeared to capture situations that were not substantial. Consistent with other agencies, the final rule relies on GLBA&rsquo;s use of &ldquo;substantial harm or inconvenience&rdquo; and is not defined, which is an improvement over the proposal&rsquo;s overly complex definition that appeared to be at odds in certain respects with GLBA.</p>
<p>Second, the final amendments do not require a financial institution to enter into a contract with its service providers to deliver data breach notices. However, the financial institution will remain responsible for ensuring that such notices are sent, regardless of which entity sends the notice. This is a good change: the Commission should not be mandating or micro-managing contracts between private parties in such instances. Moreover, it recognizes the practical difficulty for smaller covered institutions to negotiate with large service providers, due to unequal bargaining power.</p>
<p>I also appreciate the efforts made to ensure that the Commission is creating a federal minimum standard for covered institutions to notify individuals in writing within 30 days following the covered institution&rsquo;s activation of its response program for unauthorized access to or use of customer information. At the proposal stage, I was concerned that covered institutions would be burdened and customers would be confused by multiple notices about breaches of their sensitive customer information. While there is still a potential for such a result, the final amendments are designed so that customers &ndash; regardless of where they live &ndash; will have notice of a covered institution&rsquo;s potential data breach and can take steps to protect themselves if they choose.</p>
<p>Many Americans, including myself, have had their sensitive customer information breached by threat actors hacking into financial institutions&rsquo; databases. In this increasingly digital world, there are more opportunities for breaches to occur with potentially devasting damage to investors through identify theft and other substantial harms. I support today&rsquo;s amendments and am hopeful that they will reduce the potential for breaches and assist customers in taking appropriate action to protect themselves.</p>
<p>I thank the staff in the Divisions of Trading and Markets, Investment Management, and Economic and Risk Analysis, as well as the Office of the General Counsel, for their considerable efforts.</p>

<div> Regulation S-P, customer information, notification, cybercriminals, over-notification
Summary:
Regulation S-P amendments aim to protect customer information and ensure prompt notification of breaches, but concerns about over-notification and the need for streamlined requirements remain. <div>
<p>I write in support of today&rsquo;s amendments to Regulation S-P, albeit with some reservations. Protecting customers&rsquo; information and notifying them when it is compromised are important&mdash;even more important than when the Commission adopted the original version of Regulation S-P in 2000. All of us have given our personal information to a business with a tinge of fear that our information is at risk because even companies that work hard to protect this information are under constant attack by cybercriminals.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-reg-s-p-051624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;And many of us have received a letter notifying us of a breach involving our information.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-reg-s-p-051624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;Today&rsquo;s Regulation S-P modernization will help covered institutions appropriately prioritize safeguarding customer information. Customers will be notified promptly when their information has been compromised so they can take steps to protect themselves, like changing passwords or keeping a closer eye on credit scores. My reservations stem from the breadth of the rule and the likelihood that it will spawn more consumer notices than are helpful.</p>
<p>If this prediction materializes, rather than singing of longing for mail, the modern-day Marvelettes might revise their 1961 classic &ldquo;Please Mr. Postman&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-reg-s-p-051624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;to complain about too much mail:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So many days you stop by,<br />See the tears standin&rsquo; in my eye,<br />This week you already brought me four,<br />and now you&rsquo;re droppin&rsquo; another consumer notice at my door.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As these lyrics illustrate, my greatest concern about the rule is that its breadth could undermine the value of the customer notifications by making them so commonplace that people ignore them. At some point, the notifications will stop having the intended effect. If covered institutions fear being second-guessed after making a reasonable judgment not to send a notice, they will err on the side of sending a notice, even if one might not be necessary. How does your behavior change if you start getting a notice every few months? Or every month? Or every week? What if you get notifications from multiple entities related to the same breach?</p>
<p>These questions highlight a key challenge for a rulemaking like this one: providing a framework for adequate notification while avoiding an environment in which covered institutions default to over-notification. During the implementation period, the staff should work with industry to facilitate the development of sound policies and procedures that achieve the right balance. The Commission needs to show that it will not use Regulation S-P to set up well-intentioned firms for enforcement actions. We should work with firms as they try to mitigate the damage wrought by cyber-criminals.</p>
<p>We also can help to address the problem of over-notification by participating in efforts to streamline notification requirements. Today&rsquo;s amendments set a needed notification baseline for the financial services industry, which will benefit investors. However, the industry still will contend with an array of different and sometimes conflicting state and federal requirements. Further consolidation and harmonization of these requirements is a worthy goal on which federal and state regulators should continue to work.</p>
<p>Despite my reservations, I support this rule. At a time when our identities are increasingly online and information travels at lightening speeds around the world, I particularly appreciate the work of the Commission staff to help protect customer information. Thank you to staff in the Divisions of Investment Management, Trading and Markets, and Economic and Risk Analysis, and the Office of General Counsel on this rule. This project has not been easy, and I am grateful for your hard work to get us to today&rsquo;s final rule.</p>

<title>BIS: Basel Committee Publishes Report On The Digitalisation Of Finance</title>

<div> digitalisation, finance, banks, supervision, risks
Summary:
The Basel Committee report examines the impact of digital finance on banks and supervision, highlighting both benefits and risks. It emphasizes the importance of monitoring evolving risks, safeguarding data, and securing resources for effective risk management. The Committee will continue to monitor developments and provide additional standards or guidance as needed. <div>
<ul>
<li>The Basel Committee has published&nbsp;a report on the implications of the digitalisation of finance for banks and supervision.</li>
<li>The report considers both the benefits and risks of new technologies and the emergence of new technologically enabled suppliers&nbsp;for the provision of banking services.</li>
<li>It identifies eight implications for banks and supervisors relating to macro-structural elements, specific digitalisation themes, and capacity building and coordination.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision today published a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d575.htm"><span class="firstword">report</span></a>&nbsp;that considers the implications of the ongoing digitalisation of finance on banks and supervision. The report builds on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d431.htm"><em>Sound Practices: implications of fintech developments for banks and bank supervisors</em></a>&nbsp;published in 2018, and takes stock of recent developments in the digitalisation of finance.</p>
<p>The report reviews the use of key innovative technologies across various aspects of the banking value chain, including application programming interfaces, artificial intelligence and machine learning, distributed ledger technology and cloud computing. It also considers the role of new technologically enabled suppliers (eg big techs, fintechs and third-party service providers) and business models.</p>
<p>While digitalisation can benefit both banks and their customers, it can also create new vulnerabilities and amplify existing risks. These can include greater strategic and reputational risks, a larger scope of factors that could test banks' operational risk and resilience, and potential system-wide risks due to increased interconnections. Banks are implementing various strategies and practices to mitigate these risks, but effective governance and risk management processes remain fundamental.</p>
<p>Digitalisation raises regulatory and supervisory implications for both banks and supervisors. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>monitoring evolving risks and adopting a responsible approach to innovation;</li>
<li>safeguarding data and implementing robust risk management processes; and</li>
<li>securing the necessary resources, staff and capabilities to assess and mitigate risks from new technologies and business models.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Committee will continue to monitor developments related to the digitalisation of finance. Where necessary, it will consider whether additional standards or guidance are needed to mitigate risks and vulnerabilities.</p>

<div> Division of Investment Management, SEC, Asset Management, Trends, Conference
Summary:<br /><br />Natasha Vij Greiner welcomes attendees to the SEC’s annual Conference on Emerging Trends in Asset Management. She discusses the Division of Investment Management’s responsibilities, the industry’s growth, the importance of protecting investors, and the role of technology. <div>
<p>Good morning.&nbsp; I am Natasha Vij Greiner, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Investment Management.&nbsp; It is my honor to welcome all of you to the second annual Conference on Emerging Trends in Asset Management hosted by the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Investment Management.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether you are attending in-person or watching us on-line through the live webcast&mdash;welcome.&nbsp; We appreciate your interest in the work that we do, and in this Conference&rsquo;s consideration of emerging trends in asset management.</p>
<p>Before we go further, I need to remind you that my remarks today are in my official capacity as Director of the Division of Investment Management and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Commission, the Commissioners, or other members of the staff.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On a personal note, today&rsquo;s conference convenes at a consequential time for me as I just marked my two-month anniversary as the Director of the Division of Investment Management. I have spent 22 years at the Commission in roles spanning the Divisions of Trading and Markets, Enforcement, and most recently Examinations. I am committed to the mission of this agency to serve investors and am eager to continue that work serving in the role as IM Director.</p>
<p>As many of you may know, the Division of Investment Management is responsible for developing regulatory policy affecting investment companies and investment advisers and for administering the&nbsp;<a name="_Hlk166655289">Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940</a>.&nbsp; The Division comprises over 200 public servants across five offices: the Rulemaking Office; the Chief Counsel&rsquo;s Office; the Disclosure Review and Accounting Office; the Analytics Office; and the Managing Executive&rsquo;s Office&mdash;many of whom have assisted or are participating in today&rsquo;s conference. Staff within each office play a critical role in fulfilling the Division&rsquo;s responsibility for making and administering policy that impacts so many stakeholders in the asset management industry. &nbsp;I can&rsquo;t say enough about how impressed I am with the staff since joining the Division. Their expertise, professionalism, and collegiality have been a daily inspiration and vital to me hitting the ground running.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>This year marks the SEC&rsquo;s 90<span>th</span>&nbsp;Anniversary.&nbsp; Over the years we have witnessed rapid growth across a thriving asset management industry.&nbsp; We regulate an industry of more than 15,000 investment advisers collectively reporting approximately $129 trillion in assets under management.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/greiner-etam-05162024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the investment advisers we oversee are advisers to private funds, which have tripled in number (from 30,000 to 90,000) over the past decade.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/greiner-etam-05162024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>This year also marks the 100<span>th</span>&nbsp;anniversary of the formation of the first mutual fund. It&rsquo;s a milestone in the development of American capital markets that bears reflection:&nbsp; Pooled investment vehicles have enabled everyday investors to access markets that were otherwise largely inaccessible. At the end of 1940, mutual funds had aggregate assets of $448 million, while commercial banks had $70.7 billion.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/greiner-etam-05162024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp; Today, registered funds, which include mutual funds, hold more than $32 trillion, and commercial bank total assets are $23 trillion.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/greiner-etam-05162024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;These investors have a choice of over 12,000 registered funds, of which approximately 9,000 are mutual funds and 3,000 are exchange traded funds.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/greiner-etam-05162024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p>That is why our work is so critical to the average investor&mdash;both today and looking forward.</p>
<p>Millions of people invest in the nation&rsquo;s securities markets so that they can&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>enjoy a secure retirement,</li>
<li>pay for educational expenses,</li>
<li>create a nest egg that can serve as a down payment on a home, or</li>
<li>seek to achieve their family&rsquo;s individual financial goals.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that brings me to the benefit of hosting a conference like today&rsquo;s event. The wide spectrum of individuals interested in this conference underscores the broad impact that the work of the SEC in general&mdash;and the Division of Investment Management in particular&mdash;has on the lives of millions of Americans.&nbsp; Based on pre-conference registrations, we have received interest from investors; academics; auditing, accounting, and compliance professionals; legal practitioners; asset management executives; and financial market commentators, among others. Their participation is evidence of how the topics we are considering today resonate with a diverse set of stakeholders.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s conference provides the SEC staff the opportunity to hear ideas and insights from outside of our four walls.&nbsp; As a longtime member of the SEC staff, I can assure you that we value dialogue.&nbsp; We appreciate different perspectives.&nbsp; And we are open to diverse points of view.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>While we know that participants want to hear when the SEC speaks, we also recognize how important it is that the SEC listens. We hope to do much of that today. Discussions like today&rsquo;s conference help inform the staff of how others view the asset management landscape and our work as its regulator.&nbsp; And importantly, it facilitates discourse among interested stakeholders.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s conference will feature discussions on (1) trends in asset management products and strategies; (2) past, present and future trends &ndash; reminding us that we often can contemplate the future by examining the past; and (3) technology-driven trends. We will also hear directly from Andrea Seidt, the Ohio Securities Commissioner; Erica Williams, the Chair of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board; and Camille Blackburn, the Director of Wholesale Buyside in the Asset Management Division of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, who will share their domestic and international regulatory perspectives on emerging trends. These topics reflect many opportunities and challenges facing the asset management industry.</p>
<p>Investments in alternative asset classes are growing. Indeed, over the last several years, private market securities and loans have outpaced registered securities. For example, in 2022, exempt offerings raised $3.7 trillion of new capital, compared to more than the $1.0 trillion raised in registered offerings.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/greiner-etam-05162024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp; This growth means that investors are increasingly allocating assets to unregistered funds by investing directly through products offered to Accredited Investors or qualified purchasers, or indirectly through investments in pension funds.</p>
<p>This trend is also seen in the growth of our unregistered products and investment vehicles.&nbsp; For example, the growth in institutional and retail separately managed accounts (SMAs), collective investment trusts (CITs), and other non-registered investment vehicles are rising in popularity, but lack some of the protections of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the attendant regulatory oversight and associated protections.</p>
<p>In addition, we are eager to further discussions of technology-driven trends. Complex issues surround the use of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other developing technologies and their potential for greater financial inclusion and efficiency.&nbsp; The potential for conflicts of interest in this space has led to the Commission&rsquo;s recent rule proposal,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/greiner-etam-05162024?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;and we are eager to continue the conversation on how to best harness the power of new and developing technologies while effectively navigating their complexities. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s conversations will also bring a spotlight to the work that is performed by regulators on a daily basis and place each of our individual regulatory efforts into a broader context. By encouraging a dialog amongst regulators, as well as other stakeholders, including industry professionals and academics, these conversations will aid our navigation of difficult and complex regulatory initiatives.</p>
<p>While the investment management industry continues to grow and innovate, one thing remains constant&mdash;the importance of protecting the access to capital markets for investors. As we look ahead at the advancements in artificial intelligence, blockchain, and automation&mdash;and focus on facilitating innovation within the asset management industry&mdash;it is important to keep in mind the importance of the resilience and adaptability of the existing structural and regulatory protections contained in the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Speaking on behalf of the entire Division of Investment Management, we look forward to your contributions to today&rsquo;s discussion. We have assembled an impressive and experienced array of academics, fellow regulators, practitioners, commentators, and authors who will share their perspectives and expertise. I would like to thank them for their willingness to volunteer their time and share their insights. Their input will contribute to a substantive and productive consideration of the emerging trends expected to impact the asset management industry and&mdash;importantly&mdash;investors.</p>
<p>I want to thank, William Birdthistle, my predecessor, for establishing the inaugural IM emerging trends conference last year, which I was happy to support doing again this year.&nbsp; I would also like to express my appreciation to the staff that made today&rsquo;s event possible.&nbsp; In particular, the conference could not have been made possible without the tireless work of Jennifer McHugh.</p>
<p>I would also like to thank all of you in the audience, participating either in person or virtually through the live webcast. We appreciate that you care about the work that we do on behalf of the nation&rsquo;s investors and that you want to learn more about asset management issues and trends. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope that today&rsquo;s conference provokes thoughts, spurs discussion, and focuses our minds on consequential trends both large and small.&nbsp; As regulators, it is critical that we have a strong sense of what is coming so that we can prepare and position ourselves as regulators to effectively protect the interests of the investing public.</p>

<title>Tina Diamantopoulos Named Regional Director Of Chicago Office</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/tina-diamantopoulos-named-regional-director-of-chicago-office/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/tina-diamantopoulos-named-regional-director-of-chicago-office/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Tina Diamantopoulos has been named Director of the Chicago Regional Office, the Commission&rsquo;s second-largest regional office.</p>
<p>Ms. Diamantopoulos is a 30-year veteran of the SEC and has held leadership roles in both the Division of Enforcement and the Division of Examinations. Since April 2022, she has served as the Associate Director for the regional broker-dealer examination program supervising teams that examine broker-dealers, exchanges, transfer agents, municipal advisors, funding portals and security-based swap dealers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am pleased that Tina will continue her longstanding service at the Commission in her new role as Chicago Regional Director,&rdquo; said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. &ldquo;Tina&rsquo;s wide-ranging experience in the Chicago office will be an asset to the agency&rsquo;s work. I also would like to thank Kay Pyszka and Vanessa Horton for agreeing in December to serve as Acting Co-Directors of the office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Director of the Chicago Regional Office, Ms. Diamantopoulos will lead a staff of more than 275 attorneys, accountants, investigators, securities compliance examiners, and other personnel involved in the performance of compliance examinations and the investigation and litigation of enforcement actions.</p>
<p>"Tina brings invaluable knowledge and perspective to this position from her deep experience across the SEC,&rdquo; said Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;We look forward to working with her to advance the Enforcement program in the Chicago Regional Office and across the Enforcement Division.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Protecting Investors With More Timely Disclosure Of Cyber Breaches, SEC Commissioner Jaime Lizárraga, May 16, 2024</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/protecting-investors-with-more-timely-disclosure-of-cyber-breaches-sec-commissi/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/protecting-investors-with-more-timely-disclosure-of-cyber-breaches-sec-commissi/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I am pleased to support the adoption of reforms to Regulation S-P, an existing Commission rule requiring firms to adopt policies and procedures that include safeguards to protect customer records and information.</p>
<p>These reforms will strengthen privacy protections for hundreds of millions of retail investors in our country.</p>
<p>More than two decades ago, Congress enacted legislation, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, that made it possible for financial firms to offer a range of financial services under one roof. One of the main public interest dimensions of the congressional debate centered on the protection of customer privacy, a matter of direct relevance to millions of retail investors. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a staffer on the House Financial Services Committee in the late-1990s, I had a front-row seat during the extensive deliberations that shaped the Act&rsquo;s privacy provisions. Mindful of the implications for millions of consumers, and the opportunities and risks of technological change for our financial system and for the future of our country, privacy proponents in Congress made a compelling case for meaningful customer privacy protections.</p>
<p>The strong public support for these protections was reflected in the overwhelming, bipartisan 427-1 vote in the U.S. House of Representatives in favor of a stand-alone privacy amendment, sponsored by Chairman Mike Oxley (R-OH). The Conference Committee adopted a modified version of this amendment, which was then enacted into law &ndash; the source of the Commission&rsquo;s authority for the reforms being advanced today.</p>
<p>Sec. 501(a) of the Act reads: &ldquo;It is the policy of the Congress that each financial institution has an affirmative and continuing obligation to respect the privacy of its customers and to protect the security and confidentiality of those customers&rsquo; non-public personal information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Congress directed the Commission, and other financial regulators, to establish comprehensive standards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information.</p>
<p>The enhanced protections in the Commission&rsquo;s reforms will have broad reach: 233 million customer accounts at carrying broker dealers; 51 million clients of registered investment advisers; and 250 million individual accounts at transfer agents.</p>
<p>Rapid technological change is now the norm and more frequent cybersecurity incidents and data breaches add additional risks that warrant Commission action to ensure that the hundreds of millions of affected customers benefit from robust customer privacy protections.</p>
<p>The consequences of cyberattacks and other data breaches, especially when customer personal information is compromised, are real and can result in significant harms.</p>
<p>These risks and consequences make it all the more essential for investors to receive timely notice of breaches. The more time that elapses between a breach and customer notice, the greater the potential damage to affected investors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s reforms create a federal minimum standard requiring firms to provide notice to customers as soon as practicable, but no later than 30 days, after firms become aware that unauthorized access to or use of customer information has occurred or is reasonably likely to have occurred. Though not perfect, preserving the standard in the Commission&rsquo;s original proposal for firms to notify customers when they become aware of a qualifying breach helps protect customers victimized by a breach.</p>
<p>In modernizing the Commission&rsquo;s rules to adapt to modern realities, and to fulfill&nbsp;Congress&rsquo; mandate in a way that serves the public most effectively, we must also ensure that our actions do no harm to applicable state laws that are stronger and more protective of customers. To that end, customers in states with greater protections than those provided for under the federal minimum standard the Commission is advancing today will continue to benefit from those greater protections.</p>
<p>My thanks to Chair Gary Gensler for advancing these important and balanced reforms that will benefit millions of investors in our country.</p>

<li>Event:&nbsp;BIBA Conference 2024</li>
<li>Date:&nbsp;16 May 2024</li>
</ul>
<br />
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul>
<li>Brokers have the opportunity to wield power responsibly and play a role as engineers of the financial ecosystem</li>
<li>The industry must show more leadership in evidencing the value that brokers play when designing commissions and on policing non-financial misconduct and promoting healthy work cultures</li>
<li>We are considering where we can reduce the regulatory burden on brokers, particularly when insurance is placed through overseas brokers&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<br /> 
<hr />
<p>I want you to ask yourself one question: do you want to be seen as a wolf or a deer?</p>
<p>Perhaps you have more affinity with a wolf? And perhaps &ndash; rightly&ndash; some sympathy because wolves have had a raw deal, always cast as the villains in folklore and culture from Little Red Riding Hood to the Wolf of Wall Street.</p>
<p>Deer, on the other hand, have had an enviably easy ride. Deer symbolise virtues such as piety, intuition, happiness, innocence &hellip; the fate of Bambi only served to entrench that sense of wide-eyed victimhood.</p>
<p>But be in no doubt, deer can cause devastation across habitats &ndash; as rangers at Yellowstone National Park found out.</p>
<p>You see they had killed off the &lsquo;evil&rsquo; wolves at Yellowstone in the 1930s. But conservationists were forced to&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.yellowstonepark.com/things-to-do/wildlife/wolf-reintroduction-changes-ecosystem/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Wolf Reintroduction Changes Ecosystem in Yellowstone | Yellowstone Park">reintroduce them in 1995<span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;after the deer population grew rampant and started destroying vegetation.</p>
<p>What happened next astonished observers: The wolves predictably killed some of the deer, helping to control numbers. But more significantly, they also transformed the behaviour of deer, forcing them to split into smaller herds and forage for food.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sparse valleys and gorges stripped bare by unimpeded deer started to regenerate, with trees growing five-fold in height in just 6 years.</p>
<p>Beavers, otters, amphibians, songbirds, bald eagles, mice, rabbits, foxes and even grizzly bears surged in number.</p>
<p>Wolves &ndash; previously condemned as the evil predators &ndash; were hailed as the unexpected engineers and rejuvenators of the ecosystem.</p>
<p>The phenomenon is known as a&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/trophic-cascades-across-diverse-plant-ecosystems-80060347/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Trophic Cascades Across Diverse Plant Ecosystems | nature.com">trophic cascade<span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>. It occurs when predators moderate the behaviour of their prey and enhance the survival of the next level down. Trophic cascades are indirect interactions that have a powerful effect and can control entire ecosystems.</p>
<h2>Brokers have the power to be engineers</h2>
<p>As brokers, you have a powerful effect on our financial services ecosystem.</p>
<p>The numbers don&rsquo;t lie; you brought about &pound;105.5 billion in gross written premiums last year. When my colleague Sheldon Mills addressed this conference 2 years ago, the number was &pound;74 billion.</p>
<p>Last year, the insurance brokerage and agent market was worth&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.ibisworld.com/united-kingdom/market-size/insurance-agents-brokers/#:~:text=The%20market%20size%2C%20measured%20by,industry%20increased%2010.8%25%20in%202023." rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Insurance Agents &amp; Brokers - Market Size (2012&ndash;2030) | IBISWorld">&pound;17.4 billion<span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;&ndash; a growth of 10% on the previous year.</p>
<p>That growth of your market and the premiums you wrote is staggering and shows that at a time when much human-driven expertise is facing an existential threat from automation, there is a healthy demand for the services of brokers.</p>
<p>The key to your long-term survival will be maintaining and enhancing that value to your customers and the wider financial ecosystem.</p>
<p>Remember, the wolves were banished from Yellowstone for the perception that they were cavalier predators.</p>
<p>They were reintroduced once other species had a chance to get nearer the top of the food chain.</p>
<p>And the wolves are now cherished: their power is respected but it is also kept in balance.</p>
<p>Crucially, their contribution ensures better stability in the ecosystem.</p>
<h2>Pre-empting problems&nbsp;</h2>
<p>When I was invited to speak here today, I was encouraged to talk about any new regulations on the horizon that could affect the industry.</p>
<p>As someone who hails from an industry background &ndash; my most recent role before joining the FCA was at a major insurer &ndash; I am a believer in &lsquo;if it ain&rsquo;t broke, don&rsquo;t fix it&rsquo;.</p>
<p>However, if a change is required because not to embark on it would harm customers, then to me it is a way of protecting the business.</p>
<p>By the way, you can all relax, I am not about to announce a raft of new rules or regulations.</p>
<p>I am however going to point out why we have the rules we do and why we wrote to many insurance CEOs in September over 2 areas of concern.</p>
<p>When we examined&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/multi-firm-reviews/multi-occupancy-buildings-insurance-broker-remuneration" title="Multi-occupancy buildings insurance &ndash; broker remuneration">multi-occupancy building insurance</a>&nbsp;&ndash; known as MOBI &ndash; and guaranteed asset protection (GAP) insurance, there were signs that some aspects of the broker commission model were potentially &hellip; well &hellip; broken.</p>
<p>We made clear that for MOBI insurance, leaseholders needed more transparency. Intermediaries should show the value they bring.</p>
<p>And in the sale of GAP insurance, our data showed that only 6p in every pound of premium is used to pay claims &ndash; and 70p goes on commission.</p>
<p>That raises a question about whether this amounts to fair value, and it is one we have written to firms about.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Anticipating risk and mitigating harm</h2>
<p>We understand that you too are operating in a volatile market and although selling risk is part of your bread and butter, it also poses a threat to you too.</p>
<p>As an aside, I was pleased to see that regulatory changes were only counted as the&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.biba.org.uk/press-releases/bibas-2024-manifesto-managing-risk-for-growth-and-economic-security-will-resonate-with-all-political-parties/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="2024 Manifesto, Managing risk for growth &amp; economic security will resonate with all political parties | BIBA">seventh biggest risk<span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;facing the insurance sector!</p>
<p>The risks of cyber harm and climate change pose bigger risks for the sector, and it is right that you focus on building your operational resilience in response to these.</p>
<p>Indeed, one of the areas where we found the insurance sector falling short when we looked at the imbedding of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/consumer-duty" title="Consumer Duty">Consumer Duty</a>&nbsp;was in management information systems.</p>
<p>But I have confidence that this is something the sector can overcome. Your livelihood is based on data. Systems that don&rsquo;t just serve customers but demonstrate HOW you serve customers are worth investing in.</p>
<p>The challenges that were once the future are now clearly in the present, from climate change to driverless cars and AI.</p>
<p>These pose not just risks but also opportunities for innovation and for brokers who will be able to point their clients to a greater range of new products that should be fit for the future.</p>
<p>We are working with&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/the-digital-regulation-cooperation-forum" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="The Digital Regulation Cooperation Forum | GOV.UK">other regulators<span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;to formulate a coordinated response to AI, for example. For now, we do not envisage any stand-alone new regulations to cover AI in financial services: where the risks are with the underwriter or technology, they will be the same risks. There are existing regulations that we feel cover the challenges &ndash; for now &ndash; but as always, we keep things under review.</p>
<p>One risk that cannot be under-estimated is non-financial misconduct and company culture. Remember, non-financial conduct is misconduct.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes talking about culture can seem woolly &ndash; but be in no doubt, when culture goes wrong, it very much affects the bottom line. We see consistent evidence that poor governance and poor culture leads directly to poor customer outcomes.</p>
<p>In September, we issued our portfolio letter to the wholesale insurance market which warned that this market had a long way to go in having an inclusive culture.</p>
<p>Areas for improvement included tackling discrimination, harassment, victimisation, bullying and non-financial misconduct.</p>
<p>In February this year, we followed this up with a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/correspondence/culture-nfm-survey-letter-insurers-insurance-intermediaries.pdf" title="Letter: Notice to provide information - non-financial misconduct">survey</a>&nbsp;of around 600 insurers and intermediaries to try and understand the scale of non-financial misconduct and the controls firms had in place for detecting and handling these cases.</p>
<p>Firms should have processes and procedures to protect their staff and employees must feel safe to speak out without fear of reprisals. All reported incidents should be taken seriously.</p>
<p>Firms need to address any signs of poor behaviour and senior staff need to set good examples: tone from top is critical.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we can&rsquo;t be too prescriptive as we regulate a wide range of firms. This is important for us to recognise more widely &ndash; we are very conscious that what we do has to be proportionate to firms of all sizes.</p>
<p>That is why we look to firms&rsquo; boards and senior management to ensure that their processes support the culture and outcome they want to achieve.</p>
<p>One area we look at very closely is in how you treat customers with vulnerabilities and whether or not there is discriminatory practice.</p>
<p>Getting this right upfront will ensure there are no costly regulations or sanctions further down the line.</p>
<p>Indeed, the insurance sector was a trailblazer when it came to pre-empting some elements of the Consumer Duty. Some of the expectations around fair value were already in place for insurance in 2021 &ndash; 2 years before the Consumer Duty came into force.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have the potential to lead by example in this area. And thank you for all you have done on the Consumer Duty so far. It required heavy lifting from everyone in industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Consumer Duty will apply to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/speeches/consumer-duty-art-possible-year#:~:text=By%20now%2C%20firms%20should%20have,scope%20of%20the%20Consumer%20Duty." id="#:~:text=By%20now%2C%20firms%20should%20have,scope%20of%20the%20Consumer%20Duty." title="Consumer Duty: the art of the possible in a year">closed products from this July</a>.</p>
<p>We will, at all times, remain pragmatic in our approach to enforcing the Duty. The UK insurance industry services customers across the world. We want regulation that works for individual consumers purchasing motor insurance, for large corporations arranging complex insurance contracts, and for everything in between.</p>
<p>That is why last year &ndash; and this is particularly relevant for wholesale insurance &ndash; we made some important changes to limit the rules that apply where insurance is arranged through overseas brokers and for customers outside the UK.</p>
<p>Since then, we have been engaging with the industry to further consider how we might make changes to reflect the operation and customer base of the commercial insurance market, give greater clarity on our expectations and avoid duplication and reduce the burden of regulation where appropriate.</p>
<p>We won&rsquo;t do anything that will risk the essential protections that our rules provide for consumers and SMEs. But we do think we could simplify things for everyone.</p>
<p>We really welcome the constructive engagement we&rsquo;ve had with the industry, including discussions with BIBA members. We will have more to say in the coming months so watch this space.</p>
<h2>Scanning the horizon</h2>
<p>We have talked about what you can do better as a sector so it is only fair to focus on how we can improve.</p>
<p>We could be better at communicating our intentions or reasoning for our regulations for a start.</p>
<p>The Consumer Duty, for example, was born after parliament mandated that we consult on rules to have a duty of care to customers. This had cross-party support, so we had to find the most practical way of interpreting what is a wide-ranging piece of legislation.</p>
<p>We have also officially adopted a secondary objective to facilitate economic growth and international competitiveness. We do this by promoting pragmatic regulation that makes investors and consumers trust our markets, by boosting efficiency in our authorisations and other services, by fostering innovation and by driving productivity.</p>
<p>As well as being held to account by parliamentarians during what can only be described as grilling by committee in front of live television cameras &ndash; and rightly so &ndash; our performance is also measured by new metrics.</p>
<p>And we have recently established a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/about/how-we-operate/who-work-with/statutory-panels#section-cost-benefit-analysis-panel" title="Statutory panels">Cost Benefit Analysis Panel</a>&nbsp;that will scrutinise our every regulatory move to make sure it is proportionate. One thing we will keep an eye on is how regulation impacts smaller firms.</p>
<p>My first few years at the FCA have been focused not just on this internal transformation but on authorisations. We have sped these up significantly and have started to introduce automated forms to make the process even more efficient. Between January and March this year,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/data/fca-authorisations-operating-service-metrics-2023-24-q4" title="FCA Authorisations operating service metrics 2023/24 Q4">98.1% of authorisation applications</a>&nbsp;were determined within the statutory deadline.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We know there have been concerns about our proposals to announce enforcement investigations earlier on in the process.</p>
<p>Our approach is designed to raise transparency about what we are investigating with the aim of reassuring customers and investors, educating firms, encouraging witnesses to come forward and better ensuring we can be held to account.</p>
<p>Clean markets, with effective enforcement, support our international competitiveness.</p>
<p>We recognise that this is a sensitive and emotive issue so we will take time to consider the feedback, engage further with industry and explore thoroughly the concerns and evidence shared with us, with an aim of reaching a broad consensus.</p>
<p>Be assured that we do listen. We are evidence-led so will only act where a failure to do so would cause harm to consumers and undermine the integrity of our markets.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I wanted to end today on a positive note. Our relations with BIBA and your members have strengthened &ndash; I would say because of, rather than despite, the honest exchange of views we have had.</p>
<p>That is because healthy relationships can only be built on transparency and honesty and most importantly, engagement.</p>
<p>We do not underestimate the size of the business that you bring to the market. We do not underestimate the power you have to connect customers with the right products and services. And neither must you.</p>
<p>We want you to continue to engage, give feedback, tell us what we have got wrong and &ndash; dare I say it &ndash; what we have got right.</p>
<p>And whether you are seen as deer or wolves, what matters is that both have an important place in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<title>Changes Of The Trading Days In Israel?</title>

<div> Trading days, TASE, international standards, global investors, liquidity
<br />
The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange is considering changing its trading days to align with international standards to increase accessibility and liquidity.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p><section class="news-details">
<div class="news-container">
<p class="news-detail-des">TASE publishes a call for the public comments on the alignment of its trading days to international standards The move is prompted in collaboration with the Israel Securities Authority and the Bank of Israel, given the importance of strengthening the international profile of public companies and the Israeli capital market, especially at this time</p>
</div>
</section></p>
<div class="news-container ng-star-inserted">
<div class="rich-text">
<p>Tel Aviv, Israel, May 16, 2024 - The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) publishes today a call for public comments on two contemplated new trading day formats, in collaboration with the Israel Securities Authority (ISA) and the Bank of Israel. This joint initiative seeks to explore the benefits and implications of changing the current trading format, with the aim of removing barriers for global investors, increasing benefits for Israeli companies and local investors, and enhancing liquidity.</p>
<p>Following repeated discussions of this topic over the years and as it is now more crucial than ever to strengthen the international profile of the Israeli capital market, it has been decided to revisit the matter and thoroughly explore the possibility of aligning TASE&rsquo;s trading-day format with international standards, based on one of two proposed alternatives:</p>
<ol>
<li>Switching from the current Sunday to Thursday trading week to trading on&nbsp;<strong>Sunday (starting at 12:00) through Friday.</strong></li>
<li>Switching from the current Sunday to Thursday trading week to trading on&nbsp;<strong>Monday through Friday.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Given the complexity of the process, TASE would like to obtain information, insights, and positions concerning the proposed changes, including: theoretical considerations; the various aspects that contribute to the preference of each of the alternatives; specification of the parties that may be affected by this move; the anticipated economic ramifications in the short and long term; implications for relevant employees in terms of working days and hours; the attractivity of the Israeli public capital market to foreign market participants; and the potential effect on the TASE-listed companies, including as regarding immediate reports and capital raising.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The current situation makes it challenging for global investors to operate in the Israeli capital market</span></strong></p>
<p>The trading week on TASE currently ends on Thursday, with extended hours overlapping the European market and a few overlapping hours with the US market. Trading in the US continues on Thursday afternoon (Israel time) and global trading also resumes on Friday. This means that after trading on TASE is concluded for the week, trading on the international markets continues for two more consecutive days - Thursday afternoon and Friday. It effects on local participants and particularly on global investors, who consistently stress that the unique trading methods in Israel pose a real hindrance.</p>
<p>The fact that TASE does not trade on Friday delays global investors, making it difficult for them to transact in local securities that are critical to local companies and to the Israeli economy, since the gap in trading days complicates necessary adjustments to securities traded on TASE that are also included in global indices, requires hedging where foreign investors wish to carry out transactions on Friday in securities traded on TASE, and requires them to trade on Sunday, which is a global day of rest.</p>
<p>Aligning TASE's trading days to global standards would help improve the accessibility of the local market to active and passive international investors and international primary dealers, which is likely to enhance liquidity in the local market. The participation of global investors in the local capital market is crucial for both local companies and the Israeli economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Local investors remain exposed to fluctuations on those two consecutive trading days and can only address them on Sunday. This exposure creates information gaps, makes it difficult to respond in a timely manner global market events and requires additional collateral due to the partial overlap between trading days in Israel and abroad.</p>
<p>In addition to resolving the aforementioned issues, TASE points out that trading on Friday could facilitate Israel's inclusion in the MSCI Europe index. It would also allow the various local investors more flexibility in trading in response to material market announcements abroad on Fridays. Moreover, trading on Fridays means an additional trading day for government bonds on the MTS system.</p>
<p><strong>The potential overall benefits could increase international activity, enhance market liquidity and enable local institutional investors to increase their activity on the local capital market, encouraging other local participants to join in.</strong></p>
<p>It should be noted that changing trading days will require complex preparations by TASE, its members (banks and investment houses) and other entities, such as mutual fund managers and reporting corporations. In order to address the complexities of Friday trading, Sunday trading will start at 12:00, allowing for the completion of processes initiated on Friday that were not finalized before Shabat.</p>
<p>Written responses must be submitted by June 30, 2024. TASE pledges to "seriously consider all submissions received" and, if necessary, to contact relevant functions.</p>

<h3>Megan Greene</h3>
<p>External member of the Monetary Policy Committee</p>
<p>Megan Greene looks at two recent puzzles in the UK labour market: first that unemployment has remained relatively low despite subdued output, and second that some wage strength remains unexplained as inflation expectations ease and the labour market loosens. She evaluates whether excess labour hoarding can partly explain both puzzles and what the monetary policy implications may be going forward.</p>
<h2>Speech</h2>
<p>Many thanks for hosting me at Make UK. Given the interests of this group and the challenges I&rsquo;m told some of you have faced with recruitment, I thought I would spend some time taking a deep-dive into recent UK labour market developments. Over the last 2-3 years, we have seen a historically tight labour market, driven by recruitment difficulties as the pandemic likely caused structural shifts. I aim to focus on two puzzles that have been a feature of this period. First, unemployment has remained at historically low levels despite subdued economic growth. And second, wages have remained high amid an easing labour market and inflation expectations. Labour hoarding may partially explain both.</p>

<br />Summary: 
The FCA charges nine individuals for running an unauthorized foreign exchange trading scheme on Instagram, promoting high-risk investment products. <div>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA has brought charges against nine individuals in relation to an unauthorised foreign exchange trading scheme promoted on social media.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>Emmanuel Nwanze has been charged with running an unauthorised investment scheme and issuing unauthorised financial promotions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FCA alleges that, between 19 May 2018 and 13 April 2021, Mr Nwanze and Holly Thompson used an Instagram account (@holly_fxtrends) to provide advice on buying and selling contracts for difference (CFDs) when they were not authorised to do so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CFDs are a high-risk investment product used to bet on the price of an asset, in this case the price of foreign currencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FCA also alleges that Mr Nwanze paid Biggs Chris, Jamie Clayton, Lauren Goodger, Rebecca Gormley, Yazmin Oukhellou, Scott Timlin and Eva Zapico to promote the @holly_fxtrends Instagram account to their millions of Instagram followers.</p>
<p>Ms Thompson, Mr Chris, Mr Clayton, Ms Goodger, Ms Gormley, Ms Oukhellou, Mr Timlin and Ms Zapico each face one count of issuing unauthorised communications of financial promotions.</p>
<p>The defendants will appear before Westminster Magistrates' Court on 13 June 2024.</p>
<p>Anyone who believes they have suffered loss in relation to this matter is encouraged to contact the FCA consumer contact centre on 0800 111 6768 (freephone).</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ol>
<li>The defendants&rsquo; dates of birth are as follows:<br />a. Emmanuel Nwanze (DoB 07/01/1994)<br />b. Holly Thompson (also known as Holly Zucchero)&nbsp;(DoB 25/05/1990)<br />c. Biggs Chris (DoB 15/05/1992)<br />d. Jamie Clayton (DoB 18/11/1991)<br />e. Lauren Goodger (DoB 19/09/1986)<br />f. Rebecca Gormley (DoB 18/04/1998)<br />g. Yazmin Oukhellou (DoB 03/05/1994)<br />h. Scott Timlin (DoB 26/04/1988)<br />i. Eva Zapico (DoB 23/07/1998)</li>
<li>The combined following of the Instagram accounts of these individuals was 4.5 million.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Mr Nwanze faces one count of breaching the General Prohibition under Section 19 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, and one count of unauthorised communications of financial promotions under Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act.</li>
<li>Ms Thompson, Mr Chris, Mr Clayton, Ms Goodger, Ms Gormley, Ms Oukhellou, Mr Timlin and Ms Zapico each face one count of unauthorised communications of financial promotions under Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.</li>
<li>Breaching the General Prohibition is an offence under Sections 19 and 23 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 punishable upon conviction by a fine and/or up to 2 years&rsquo; imprisonment.</li>
<li>Communicating unauthorised financial promotions is an offence under Sections 21 and 25 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 punishable upon conviction by a fine and/or up to 2 years&rsquo; imprisonment.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Contracts For Difference (CFDs) are high-risk derivatives. The FCA has previously said that 80% of customers lose money when investing in CFDs because of the risks. They are often highly leveraged, which means they use debt to try and amplify returns, which can result in investors losing more than they invested. In the UK, the FCA has imposed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/policy-statements/ps19-18-restricting-contract-difference-products#:~:text=We%20are%20requiring%20firms%20that,positions%20on%20their%20CFD%20account.">restrictions</a>&nbsp;on how CFDs and CFD-like options can be sold and marketed to retail customers.

Summary:
io.vault, a self-custody solution for institutions, offers scalable and secure digital asset management, providing control, scalability, and security. <br /><br /> <div>
<p><a href="https://usw2.nyl.as/t1/222/3jmfc3m3rx49bfzxyn71fdwsj/2/825a4fa488f0bb48a5c0913e1cd92b4fb110ad079c8a51aeadc8044ca9419634" target="_blank">io.finnet</a>, the pioneering Tech company, is thrilled to announce the launch of io.vault, its groundbreaking digital asset self-custody solution for institutions. io.vault is already gaining traction, with io.finnet onboarding some of the most prominent institutional actors in the digital asset space including Ibanera and Evo Exchange among others.</p>
<div class="dombanner"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://usw2.nyl.as/t1/222/3jmfc3m3rx49bfzxyn71fdwsj/3/40b6388a82893b7c2aedd7726b2f828b65e2b19506141646907e31c8dd685953" target="_blank">io.vault</a>&nbsp;empowers corporate clients to securely hold and transact digital assets, offering a scalable and secure solution designed for OTCs, DeFi platforms, cryptocurrency exchanges, active trading funds, and more. io.vault can be tailored to the specific needs of any company managing digital assets.</p>
<p>This cutting-edge technology is based on io.finnet's proprietary Trustless Multi-Party-Computation (tMPC), which enhances security by distributing weighted signing authority among multiple participants. The solution, audited by Kudelski Security, provides both scalability and security for managing digital assets. Additionally, configurable signing requirements enable customization to fit specific organizational needs while maintaining user autonomy over assets.</p>
<p>"Scalability is a major hurdle for companies managing digital assets," said Gregory Pepin, CEO of io.finnet. "Traditional solutions lack the security and seamless integration needed. io.vault solves this problem by empowering companies to securely manage their assets without relinquishing control."</p>
<p>Unlike custodial services that hold private keys, io.vault ensures companies maintain direct control of their assets. It provides a fully customizable solution for transaction validation, giving companies the flexibility and security to scale their operations. This addresses the growing distrust in third-party custodians following high-profile failures like Celsius and BlockFi. Companies can now break free from the vulnerabilities and dependencies associated with outsourced custody, gaining complete control over their digital assets.</p>
<p>"io.vault is a game-changer," continued Pepin. "It provides a scalable, secure, and trustworthy alternative to traditional custodian services, positioning io.finnet as a leader in addressing the evolving needs of the digital asset management landscape."</p>
<p>With the launch of io.vault alongside existing offerings, io.finnet envisions itself as a trailblazer in paving the way to an open and decentralized financial network using revolutionary technologies. This innovative approach sets io.finnet apart in the rapidly evolving digital asset management space.</p>

<div> Accion Venture Lab, Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth, FMO, Fintech for Inclusion Global Summit, London<br />
Summary:
Fintech for Inclusion Global Summit in London to discuss using fintech to meet financial needs of vulnerable communities. Over 40 fintech companies, investors and regulators. <div>
<p>Accion Venture Lab, the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth, and the Dutch entrepreneurial development bank FMO, today announce the Fintech for Inclusion Global Summit that will take place in London on Thursday, September 12.</p>
<p>The summit will see over 40&nbsp;fintech companies&nbsp;from&nbsp;5 continents come together with investors, regulators, and other stakeholders in the global inclusive fintech community to discuss how innovations in embedded finance, AI, and other emerging technologies can be leveraged to meet the financial needs of vulnerable communities, including women and smallholder farmers. Globally, nearly 2 billion people are excluded from the financial system, lacking a safe place to save money, credit to manage and grow businesses, and insurance to protect against disasters. Micro, small and medium businesses are facing a $5 trillion credit gap.</p>
<p>Accion Venture Lab's Managing Partner Rahil Rangwala said, "By bringing this group of fintech innovators together in London &ndash; one of the world's most dynamic financial capitals &ndash; we can explore new ways of providing high-quality financial solutions to underserved clients globally. Participants will learn the latest industry insights and forge new partnerships, as they adapt to the rapidly evolving business landscape."</p>
<p>Companies present at the summit are already leveraging new uses of technology and data to provide responsible financial services to low-income groups in innovative new ways. From using transport data to provide financing to operator-owned truck drivers in Pakistan, to deploying AI so small-scale pharmacies in Kenya can improve access to quality medicines and reduce waste, they are solving pain points for small businesses and low-income groups across emerging economies.</p>
<p>Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth's Executive Vice President for Global Programs, Payal Dalal, comments that: "With their ability to connect underserved people to the digital economy, often for the first time, fintech innovators have a key role to play in tackling global challenges and making economic growth more inclusive. The Fintech for Inclusion Summit will bring together leaders and frontline practitioners to share their learnings and build new connections, which is a vital part of driving scale."</p>
<p>Speaking on the topic, Marieke Roestenberg, Manager of FMO Ventures Program, said: "We are pleased to once more co-host this important event with Accion Venture Lab &ndash; now in partnership with the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth &ndash; to bring together industry leaders focused on developing innovative fintech solutions for underserved communities. Holding the event in London this year will enable more key stakeholders to join the conversation and explore collaboration opportunities."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Accion Venture Lab organizes the Fintech for Inclusion Global Summit as part of its work with entrepreneurs to build scalable businesses that address gaps in financial services around the world. It is a leading early stage fintech investor with a 10+ year track record of delivering financial and social returns. With its global team, it provides hands on strategic and operational support that is critical to the success of early-stage companies, while quickly spotting and responding to global trends, and sharing learnings across geographies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speakers will include TS Anil, CEO of Monzo, Jorn Lambert, Chief Product Officer of Mastercard, Jonathan Whittle, Managing Partner of Quona, and Michael Schlein, CEO of Accion. Conference partners include the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth, Citi Foundation, and FMO Entrepreneurial Bank.

<p><span><span>Bose concludes: &ldquo;APAC's relatively modest decrease signifies resilience in the face of broader economic challenges. This resilience underscores the region's enduring appeal to dealmakers and highlights its potential for sustained growth in the deal landscape. Despite headwinds, opportunities abound, and strategic dealmakers would be wise to remain vigilant, identifying pockets of value amidst the shifting tides of the market.&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<div> surveillance, financial reporting, audit, ASIC, sustainable finance
Summary:<br /><br />ASIC oversees financial reporting and audit quality, targeting key areas like impairment and revenue recognition, globally collaborating for quality, and preparing for climate-related reporting. <div>
<h2>Acknowledgment of Country &amp; Introduction</h2>
<p>Good morning, everyone. Thank you for the invitation to speak here today.</p>
<p>Before I begin, I&rsquo;d like to acknowledge the Gadigal people of the Eora Nation, the Traditional Owners and Custodians of the land from which I am making this address today &ndash; Sydney.</p>
<p>I pay my respects to their Elders &ndash; past, present and emerging. I extend that respect to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people here today.</p>
<p>I am here today to provide you with an overview of ASIC&rsquo;s critical financial reporting and audit surveillance work, which supports our unwavering commitment to promote confident and informed participation in the financial system. I will prioritise topics that I think would be top of mind for you. I will touch upon ASIC&rsquo;s audit findings from the 2022 &ndash; 2023 surveillance program before giving an overview of our focus areas for the June 2024 reporting period.</p>
<p>I will also share with you some preliminary observations from our recent review of a number of audit firm&rsquo;s implementation of AQSM1.</p>
<p>Following this, I will speak briefly about one of the biggest changes to financial reporting and disclosure standards in recent times &ndash; the Government&rsquo;s proposed mandatory climate reporting reforms. I&rsquo;d like to make some observations about how ASIC is proposing to support them.</p>
<p>If time permits, I look forward to answering your questions.</p>
<h2>ASIC&rsquo;s Financial Reporting and Audit Surveillance Program</h2>
<h3>Overview of ASIC&rsquo;s financial reporting and audit surveillance program</h3>
<p>It goes without saying that ASIC is and always will be committed to strong oversight of auditors and enhancing the integrity and quality of financial reporting and auditing in Australia. We do this through our proactive surveillance of financial reports and audits, and our pursuit of enforcement action where it is appropriate. We believe this is important to upholding public trust and confidence in our financial system.</p>
<p>As you know, we take an integrated approach to our financial reporting and audit surveillances. This approach provides an end-to-end view of financial reporting and audit across the financial reporting chain which we believe results in a better overview of the financial reporting eco-system.</p>
<p>We follow a risk-based approach to target financial reports for review, taking into account a range of market data, reported financial information, relevant ASX announcements and other ASIC intelligence, such as reports of misconduct by external parties and reports received from auditors under their company law reporting obligations.</p>
<p>Our financial report targeting then informs our selection of audit files to be reviewed. We now routinely select audit files where a change has been made to financial information or the financial report or where we have concerns that a financial report may have a risk of material misstatement. In some instances, we select audit files based on other internal or externally available data.</p>
<p>Which brings me to the topic of transparency. We know that transparency is important. Our financial reporting and audit program maintains transparency in three ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Firstly</span>, by including in our public report a summary of the thematic findings from our surveillance of financial reports as well as a summary of individual findings from our audit surveillances for all firms (on a no names basis). This provides greater prominence to all audit findings.</li>
<li><span>Secondly</span>, by reporting findings from our audit surveillance to the directors of companies and the auditors to encourage constructive dialogue between the company and auditor to improve financial reporting and audit quality.</li>
<li><span>Thirdly</span>, we maintain transparency by issuing media releases naming companies where they make material changes to their financial information in subsequent financial reports or other information after an ASIC enquiry.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We published our first report under the new integrated program on 18 October 2023. We plan to publish our next report on our financial reporting and audit surveillances in October.</p>
<h3>Findings from the 2022-23 surveillance program</h3>
<h4>Financial reporting</h4>
<p>I would now like to share some of our findings from the 2022-2023 surveillance program.</p>
<p>Last year we reviewed 180 financial reports. The majority of the companies whose financial reports we reviewed were in the top 500 of the ASX by market capitalisation and mostly in the materials and software and services industries.</p>
<p>These reviews resulted in ASIC contacting 55 entities with enquiries covering 93 issues. From these 55 surveillances, 25 entities made adjustments to previously released financial information after we raised concerns with their financial report.</p>
<p>Our 2023 report details findings in a number of areas, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>insufficient disclosure of material business risks in the operating and financial review, and</li>
<li>impairment of assets and revenue recognition and other financial report disclosures.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will briefly touch upon these as these findings are important.</p>
<h4>Operating and financial review</h4>
<p>The majority of findings from our financial reporting surveillances were in relation to the Operating and Financial Review (OFR). We contacted 33 entities to communicate our concerns on the adequacy of their disclosures, particularly in relation to strategies and prospects, and material business risks. Following our surveillances, 19 of these entities made additional or improved disclosures.</p>
<p>Many entities still need to significantly improve the information they report in the OFR for the benefit of investors and other users. Entities that are of particular risk are those that are newly listed, regularly raise funds, or have more complex business models.</p>
<h4>Impairment and asset values</h4>
<p>We also had 20 surveillances where we contacted entities about their impairment testing, mainly of goodwill and other intangible assets. Three entities made impairment adjustments following our surveillances.</p>
<p>It is important that directors (including members of audit committees) question the need for, and adequacy of, asset impairment and the adequacy of related disclosures.</p>
<h4>Revenue recognition</h4>
<p>We also had 14 surveillances where we contacted entities about their recognition of revenue including disclosure of accounting policies. Following these surveillances, three of these entities made adjustments to either their revenue recognition or disclosure of their accounting policy.</p>
<h3>Auditing</h3>
<p>I will now turn to our audit surveillance findings.</p>
<p>Auditors play an important role as the principal external check on a company&rsquo;s financial report and, as key gatekeepers, are uniquely positioned to determine whether there has been a contravention of the Corporations Act. The key focus areas for last year&rsquo;s surveillance program were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Impairment of non-financial assets and asset values;</li>
<li>Revenue and receivables;</li>
<li>Inventory and cost of goods sold;</li>
<li>Provisions; and</li>
<li>Investments and financial instruments.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the surveillance period, we reviewed 15 audit files across 11 audit firms. We reported findings to directors of 11 companies and nine audit firms. In six of the 15 audit surveillances we had both audit and financial reporting findings.</p>
<p>As a result of our financial reporting and audit surveillances, adjustments totalling $215 million were made to previously released financial information.</p>
<p>We continue to have the largest number of audit findings on impairment of non-financial assets and the audit of revenue and receivables.</p>
<p>For example, we had seven findings relating to impairment of non-financial assets. Deficiencies identified included:</p>
<ul>
<li>not testing whether key assumptions in cash flow models are reasonable or supported by independent evidence;</li>
<li>accepting valuation methodologies that may not have been appropriate or reliable;</li>
<li>not properly considering indicators of impairment;</li>
<li>not confirming existence of and rights to digitals assets; and</li>
<li>not adequately testing capitalised expenditure.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, we had six findings relating to revenue and receivables testing. They included:</p>
<ul>
<li>failing to test that revenue transactions occurred and were recorded accurately;</li>
<li>failing to identify a material misstatement;</li>
<li>assessing risk of material misstatement as lower than appropriate;</li>
<li>failing to understand the nature of the revenue cycle; and</li>
<li>not sufficiently reviewing the work of an overseas auditor.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>International Forum of Independent Audit Regulators (IFIAR) survey</h3>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s audit findings are not unique. In fact, regulators of auditors internationally have made similar findings.</p>
<p>ASIC is currently a member of the International Forum of Independent Audit Regulators, where we collaborate with other audit regulators on audit quality and regulatory practice.</p>
<p>In March 2024, IFIAR released its twelfth annual survey of inspection findings arising from its member regulators&rsquo; individual inspections of audit firms affiliated with the six largest global audit firm networks. Similar to ASIC, IFIAR noted the area with the highest level of findings was accounting estimates, including fair value measurement followed by internal control testing and adequacy of financial report presentation and disclosure.</p>
<p>Both ASIC and IFIAR encourage audit firms to make continued efforts to enhance audit quality to reduce the number of audits with findings.</p>
<h4>ASIC&rsquo;s stakeholder engagement</h4>
<p>Our involvement with IFIAR is just one example of ASIC&rsquo;s stakeholder engagement in action. We have a comprehensive stakeholder engagement program that sees us undertaking both international and domestic engagement so that we can deepen our understanding of emerging issues and risks in the financial reporting and audit industry, and collaborate with other regulators and government agencies to improve the quality of financial reporting and audit.</p>
<p>On the&nbsp;<span>international</span>&nbsp;front, ASIC is also a board member of the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) and the IOSCO Sustainable Finance Taskforce, We also engage with international accounting and audit standard setters on issues such as sustainable finance and digital financial reporting.</p>
<p><span>Domestically</span>, we regularly liaise with professional accounting bodies and audit firms to discuss emerging accounting and auditing issues. Importantly, we also undertake ongoing and regular engagement with the AASB, the AUASB, the Financial Reporting Council, the Council of Financial Regulators and the Australian Institute of Company Directors on a broad range of issues related to financial reporting and audit including sustainable finance.</p>
<h3>Focus areas for financial reporting and auditors</h3>
<p>Which brings me now to what will be ASIC&rsquo;s focus areas for the June 2024 reporting period.</p>
<p>Through our proactive surveillance program, ASIC will continue to focus on asset values, adequacy of provisions, subsequent events and disclosures.</p>
<p>This year we will expand our surveillance program to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>previously grandfathered companies &ndash;large proprietary companies that were previously exempt from lodging their financial reports with ASIC are now included in ASIC&rsquo;s integrated financial reporting and audit surveillance program. These companies were first required to lodge financial statements for financial year ended 30 June 2023 and we reviewed a small number (10) for our 2023-24 surveillance program. This has resulted in one material correction so far, with Southern Steel Group Pty Ltd amending its financial statements where we identified a failure to comply with accounting standards. In 2024-25 we plan to review a larger number of financial reports of these previously grandfathered companies.</li>
<li>registrable superannuation entities (RSEs) (superannuation trustees) &ndash; for the first time, they are required to lodge their audited financial reports with ASIC. The financial reports must be lodged within three months of their 2023-24 financial year and the audited financial reports must comply with the relevant accounting standards. From 1 July 2023, RSE auditors must comply with the auditor obligations under Chapter 2M of the&nbsp;<em>Corporations Act</em>. ASIC will include RSE financial reports in its financial reporting and audit surveillance program.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To complement our financial reporting and audit surveillance program, we will also undertake a review of the compliance by auditors with ethical and independence standards.</p>
<p>Separately, ASIC encourages entities with material climate-related risks to report voluntarily in line with the recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and avoid misleading statements. We also encourage entities to prepare for the proposed introduction of mandatory climate reporting. The first tier of companies is proposed to report under the new legislation for financial years commencing from 1 January 2025.</p>
<h4>Improving financial reporting and audit quality</h4>
<p>One of the key aspects of the redesign of our surveillance program will be to look&nbsp;<span>beyond</span>&nbsp;the ongoing issues identified in our audit file reviews to consider the&nbsp;<span>root</span>&nbsp;<span>causes</span>&nbsp;of these issues&hellip; for example, looking at governance, risk, culture and compliance practices that may raise independence and ethics issues. To address this, we have brought in the team that looked closely at these very problems within Australia&rsquo;s banks following the Financial Services Royal Commission, who will be working closely with our audit surveillance team.</p>
<p>In light of this, we recently conducted a scoping exercise to determine what this review will focus on. This exercise looked at how a number of audit firms have implemented quality requirements under the ASQM1 framework, given their first ASQM1 evaluation was due for reporting by 15 December 2023.</p>
<p>Despite being a very limited review, it highlighted a number of areas for concern which span across risk, governance and compliance practices at audit firms. I will briefly share some of our observations with you now:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, we observed significant variability as to how firms chose to implement the ASQM1 framework. Some firms have adopted a &ldquo;minimum compliance&rdquo; approach by limiting the application of quality management to a single business division. We expected firms to see the framework as an opportunity to uplift quality controls across a number of business divisions &ndash; not just within audit and assurance. We encourage firms to embrace the spirit of the ASQM1 objectives by applying quality management requirements&nbsp;<em>firm-wide</em>&nbsp;instead of seeing the framework as merely a tick-box exercise in compliance.</li>
<li>Second, we saw in some cases a lack of sophistication and suitability of tools used to manage quality. For example, some firms relied on Excel spreadsheets or reverted to existing tools deployed for audits in order to record and monitor quality findings. Better practice would be to establish dedicated quality management tools that align with ASQM1 requirements, and establish one &lsquo;source of truth&rsquo; to ensure proper records are kept and reported.</li>
<li>Third, we observed that some firms have limited domestic guidance around how to measure and classify the severity of findings and deficiencies, and a lack of objectivity in assessments. While &ldquo;professional judgement&rdquo; has a part to play, the absence of clear guidance risks producing inconsistent and subjective conclusions.</li>
<li>Further, we saw examples of firms taking a hurried approach to remediation of findings and deficiencies in order to achieve a favourable conclusion before the reporting deadline. We urge firms to take the time necessary to roll out considered and comprehensive action plans that adequately address the root cause and fully rectify the issues at hand. End-to-end action plans are critical to the ongoing success of ASQM1 as they may prevent potential further deficiencies from arising.</li>
<li>Finally, from a governance and oversight perspective, ASIC urges firms to be transparent in reporting to executive management and the relevant committees around deficiencies and their associated action plans. This includes communicating the original rating of a deficiency in addition to the point-in-time rating to ensure broader design gaps are being identified and systems operate as effectively as possible. In addition, there should be ample opportunity for debate and challenge when it comes to making final determinations.</li>
</ol>
<p>ASIC is currently considering how these observations will shape our forthcoming surveillance program for FY25. In the meantime, we encourage firms to prioritise having robust systems of quality management in place given the integral roles these play in ensuring foundational trust in financial markets. While ASIC acknowledges that embedding quality management systems is an iterative process that involves continual uplift of existing systems and procedures, we consider that firms have a lot of work to do before they are considered to have achieved operational effectiveness.</p>
<h3>Sustainable finance</h3>
<h4>ASIC&rsquo;s involvement in sustainable finance</h4>
<p>As our Chair Joe Longo recently said, while the shift to sustainable finance may constitute a once-in-a-generation transformation, the fundamental underlying principles of accuracy and transparency are not new.</p>
<p>Sustainability-related claims and information, like any other, must be founded on reasonable grounds, be accurate and be able to be substantiated. It is essential that entities avoid misrepresenting their sustainability or green credentials.</p>
<p>To date, we have issued 17 greenwashing-related infringement notices totalling $230,000 and obtained 40 corrective disclosure outcomes. We won our first greenwashing civil penalty action against Vanguard Investments (regarding the misapplication of ESG investment screens) and have two other civil penalty proceedings underway in the Federal Court.</p>
<p>ASIC previously received funding in the 2023-2024 MYEFO to support enforcement of climate disclosure standards and the Government recently confirmed that ASIC will receive funding in the 2024-2025 Budget for greenwashing enforcement.</p>
<p>We will continue to monitor the market for misleading claims by entities. It is critical that we combat greenwashing to support trust in sustainable finance-related products and services.</p>
<h4>Climate-related disclosure</h4>
<p>ASIC supports the introduction of a mandatory, internationally aligned climate reporting regime.</p>
<p>If the Government&rsquo;s proposed reforms are passed, ASIC will be responsible for administering the mandatory climate reporting regime.</p>
<p>We understand that there will obviously be a period of transition as industry works to build the capability required to meet these new obligations. ASIC acknowledges the capability uplift that will be required across the financial sector and is supportive of the Government&rsquo;s phased approach to the implementation of the disclosure and assurance requirements.</p>
<p>ASIC will also develop and publish information resources on the new sustainability reporting obligations as well as a new regulatory guide outlining our approach to relief from those obligations, and interaction of the regime with existing legal and regulatory requirements.</p>
<h4>Preparation for the proposed mandatory climate reporting requirements</h4>
<p>Entities should start putting into place the systems, processes and governance practices that will be required to meet the new climate reporting requirements. We also encourage auditing and accounting firms to ensure that any systems and processes adopted are sufficiently agile to incorporate additional sustainability topics in future years (i.e. beyond climate-related financial disclosures).</p>
<p>Entities should not be waiting until the climate-related financial disclosure requirements are mandated and the Australian Accounting Standards Board finalises its Australian climate standards based on those issued by the ISSB.</p>
<p>ASIC considers that those entities reporting under the TCFD will be well placed to report under any future mandatory reporting regime. This is particularly the case since the ISSB&rsquo;s standards are founded on the four pillars of the TCFD framework.</p>
<p>While companies may continue to use the voluntary TCFD framework, it may also be useful for them to begin engaging with the ISSB standards through the report preparation process to test and/or assess capabilities, data availability and requirements against the new standard. This will help inform the company of future requirements.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In closing, I&rsquo;d like to drive home the importance of ASIC&rsquo;s financial reporting and audit surveillance program and, of course, the critical role you play in strengthening our financial ecosystem.</p>
<p>For the Australian economy to continue to flourish, it needs a strong, steady foundation from which to build public trust and confidence in the integrity of our financial system.</p>

<div> release, March 2024, TIC data, Treasury, foreign holdings<br />
Summary: The U.S. Department of the Treasury released TIC data for March 2024, showing foreign acquisitions, net purchases, and changes in banks' liabilities. <div>
<p>The U.S. Department of the Treasury today released Treasury International Capital (TIC) data for March 2024.&nbsp; The next release, which will report on data for April 2024, is scheduled for June 18, 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sum total in March of all net foreign acquisitions of long-term securities, short-term U.S. securities, and banking flows was a net TIC inflow of $102.1 billion. &nbsp;Of this, net foreign private inflows were $30.3 billion, and net foreign official inflows were $71.7 billion.</p>
<p>Foreign residents increased their holdings of long-term U.S. securities in March; their net purchases were $178.4 billion.&nbsp; Net purchases by private foreign investors were $152.2 billion, while net purchases by foreign official institutions were $26.2 billion.</p>
<p>U.S. residents increased their holdings of long-term foreign securities, with net purchases of $78.0 billion.</p>
<p>After including adjustments, such as estimated foreign portfolio acquisitions of U.S. stocks through stock swaps, overall net foreign purchases of long-term securities are estimated to have been $100.5 billion in March.</p>
<p>Foreign residents increased their holdings of U.S. Treasury bills by $0.6 billion.&nbsp; Foreign resident holdings of all dollar-denominated short-term U.S. securities and other custody liabilities decreased by $23.7 billion.</p>
<p>Banks&rsquo; own net dollar-denominated liabilities to foreign residents&nbsp;increased&nbsp;by $25.3 billion.</p>
<p>Complete data are available on the Treasury website at:</p>
<p><a href="https://home.treasury.gov/data/treasury-international-capital-tic-system">/data/treasury-international-capital-tic-system</a></p>
<h3>ABOUT TIC DATA</h3>
<p>The monthly data on holdings of long-term securities, as well as the monthly table on Major Foreign Holders of Treasury Securities, reflect foreign holdings of U.S. securities collected primarily on the basis of custodial data.&nbsp; These data help provide a window into foreign ownership of U.S. securities, but they cannot attribute holdings of U.S. securities with complete accuracy.&nbsp; For example, if a U.S. Treasury security purchased by a foreign resident is held in a custodial account in a third country, the true ownership of the security will not be reflected in the data.&nbsp; The custodial data will also not properly attribute U.S. Treasury securities managed by foreign private portfolio managers who invest on behalf of residents of other countries.&nbsp; In addition, foreign countries may hold dollars and other U.S. assets that are not captured in the TIC data.&nbsp; For these reasons, it is difficult to draw precise conclusions from TIC data about changes in the foreign holdings of U.S. financial assets by individual countries.</p>

<div> innovation, financial system, regulation, technology, banking<br />
<br />
Summary: The article discusses the importance of understanding and promoting responsible innovation in the financial system, and the roles of both public and private sectors in shaping its future. <div>
<p>I would like to thank the Digital Chamber for the invitation to share my perspectives on innovation in the financial system.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240515a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;I welcome opportunities like this to engage in discussions that include both the public and private sector on this important topic. These conversations help inform my understanding of and expectations for how technology can enhance financial services in a manner that is consistent with operating in the highly regulated banking industry. Today, I will share my views on evolving financial technology and the importance of ongoing, responsible innovation, including the roles of both the public and private sectors in shaping the future.</p>
<p>In my role at the Federal Reserve, I view financial innovation through the lens of the central bank's responsibilities&mdash;issuing U.S. currency; conducting monetary policy; fostering a safe and efficient payment system; maintaining financial stability; promoting consumer protection; and supervising and regulating financial institutions. Regulators often espouse the benefits of innovation&mdash;innovation can lead to greater efficiency, and it can promote competition in the market, which can lower the cost and expand the availability of products and services to consumers and businesses.</p>
<p>While regulators acknowledge these benefits, innovation is inevitably accompanied by risk. Innovation can exacerbate traditional financial risks or introduce new risks that must be carefully understood and managed. And on a basic level, the "newness" of innovation often leads regulators to reflexively resist these changes, whether the change takes the form of new technology, new ways of delivering products and services, new financial infrastructure that underlies how the banking system works, and new relationships within the financial system and beyond.</p>
<p>So how do regulators get comfortable with innovation? Some attending today may answer that "they don't!" And I am sure that some here in the room have experienced this friction in trying to pursue innovation in a heavily regulated environment. In fairness, sometimes "no" is the correct regulatory response when innovation either does not solve an actual problem, or simply cannot be executed in a safe and sound manner and in compliance with applicable laws. But my goal today is to propose some building blocks that could help regulators get to "yes" more often, and potentially smooth the rough path to successful innovation in the banking system.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding Innovation</strong><br />As a first principle, I would offer "understanding" as a necessary predicate to promoting innovation. Before we craft a useful public policy around innovation in banking, we need to understand the various dynamics involved with particular innovations. We must consider how innovation can impact different financial sectors, from small banks to wholesale financial markets, and how those impacts will ultimately effect end users. For example, will "tokenized" products and platforms duplicate existing bank deposits and payment rails, potentially creating parallel systems? If so, will the products and platforms that duplicate these functions provide the same legal protections for customers and the overall financial system?</p>
<p>The wide variety of technology and use cases can be a significant obstacle to getting to a place where regulators understand any one innovation. Innovation in the financial system can take many forms including new technology, new business models, and improvements to existing infrastructures. As one form of innovation, distributed ledger technology (DLT), including blockchain, has inspired new ways of thinking about the exchange of assets and data, in addition to the role of intermediaries and trusted third parties. DLT combines a number of different design elements&mdash;like distributed data storage, cryptography, and consensus mechanisms&mdash;that support the transfer process, information visibility, and transaction recordkeeping.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240515a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a></p>
<p>DLT is an interesting example because it highlights the challenges presented to regulators in understanding innovation. There are many variations in the application of DLT&mdash;and ongoing research and development creating more variability over time&mdash;which ultimately may complicate understanding how the technology can be used, and how different functionality can be incorporated into DLT solutions for different use cases.</p>
<p>In short, innovation can take many forms. It often involves new uses for existing technology that enhance core business lines, but it can also include the introduction of transformational new technology or capabilities. Customer demands for cheaper products or for new and innovative products often motivate banks to explore how technology and innovation can meet these demands and provide products and services for the future.</p>
<p>While understanding technology is an important first step, it is not the only one. Regulators also need to understand the players who operate in the fintech space. Banks of all sizes have a long history of innovation, from the introduction of checks; to the advent of ATMs that allow easy access to cash and basic banking information; to online banking platforms and electronic payments that have simplified and streamlined the way many consumers and businesses manage and access their funds, receive credit, and conduct financial transactions. Innovation helps banks upgrade their existing business lines to better meet customer needs, for example, by introducing instant payments or providing credit in innovative ways.</p>
<p>There are also many nonbank providers in this space, including core service providers that often hold the "keys" to innovation at small banks when they facilitate the add-on of new technology to core systems. And fintechs that may focus on even more transformational uses of technology within all aspects of banking. This presents another layer of complication when it comes to innovation in banking.</p>
<p>Even with an understanding of technology and of the players involved, regulators still need additional feedback to understand the "why" of innovation. What is the purpose of the innovation? What problem is it designed to solve? Are there tradeoffs policymakers would need to consider if the new technology were introduced or integrated in the existing financial system?</p>
<p>There are many examples across this spectrum of innovation. For example, take the use cases around DLT. Some banks are exploring the possibility of DLT as a way to help facilitate services like cross-border payments and financial market transactions. Other businesses may see DLT as a way to improve supply chain management by tying payments to specific activities across the supply chain. Some financial institutions see DLT as a potential solution for existing processes that require manual interventions and coordination across disparate systems. Businesses may look at a single technology&mdash;DLT&mdash;and see possible solutions to a wide range of problems. When the financial system promotes innovation, we better enable firms to serve their customers' unique needs while also advancing the capability of the financial system.</p>
<p>Regulators and industry both have an important role to play in achieving this goal of understanding. Regulators cannot hope to craft effective public policy without understanding. And while industry's focus is rightly on developing innovative solutions, part of successful innovation in the banking space is promoting education and understanding for the regulators.</p>
<p><strong>Openness to Innovation: Getting to "Yes"</strong><br />As a second principle, regulatory openness is a critical ingredient to fostering innovation in the financial system. The first reaction of regulators to proposed innovation in the banking system is often not one of openness and acceptance, but rather suspicion and concern. The use of emerging technology and innovation may require a change in policy or supervisory approach. It also very often requires regulatory feedback&mdash;sometimes before innovation is introduced, in others after it has been rolled out and is reviewed during the supervisory process.</p>
<p>As a financial policymaker and a regulator, I recognize that there are a number of questions we must answer before pursuing a change in policy, whether in the form of regulation, or in supervisory approach, to facilitate innovation in the financial system.</p>
<p>Regulators need to ask whether we have considered the intended and unintended outcomes of a new innovation, and do the benefits of the new technology outweigh the risks? Would the introduction of a new technology or innovation in the banking system require updating our regulatory framework to incorporate clear oversight? Who should have responsibility for oversight, and what roles do we see for different regulators at both the state and federal level?</p>
<p>Transformational technology requires clear, consistent, and transparent guardrails and expectations to govern the activities that are allowed into the regulated financial system. Where current regulation does not contemplate a new activity, should it be acceptable for financial agencies to regulate the activity through supervision and enforcement alone? Or should congressional action address the treatment of these activities in the financial system?</p>
<p>These are difficult questions, to be sure, but ones we must confront if we are to allow innovation to flourish in the banking system and the broader financial system. Ensuring an orderly and observable method for regulators to understand and provide a path for potentially disruptive or transformational technology could ultimately enhance the long-term stability of the financial system.</p>
<p>So, while the obligation to&nbsp;<em>promote understanding</em>&nbsp;may fall more heavily on industry, the obligation to&nbsp;<em>be receptive to innovation</em>&nbsp;falls more heavily on regulators. We must fight the temptation to say "no" and resist new technology, and instead focus on solutions&mdash;how can we mitigate the risk of new technology? What benefits will technology bring to the financial system? How can we provide clear regulatory expectations?</p>
<p>The appeal of resisting innovation&mdash;resisting change&mdash;is that it preserves the familiar and known. But the cost of resistance to change may be great, in that it promotes stagnation and inertia. Ultimately, this could lead to a banking system that may be safer and smaller, but also less effective at providing banking products and services and in supporting the U.S. economy.</p>
<p><strong>Innovation as a Priority in Banking</strong><br />Understanding and openness can go a long way to promoting innovation, but I think there are opportunities to do more. Can we shift from a reactive approach to innovation, to an active one that facilitates innovation? This leads to my final principle, which is that regulators can do more to promote innovation. Regulators can do more than simply tolerate innovation, they can promote it through transparency and open communication. Take, for example, the frictions associated with cross border payments, including the speed and cost and the ability to transfer money. At first blush, this seems like a prime opportunity for innovation to come in with a new approach.</p>
<p>The challenge in cross-border payments historically has been achieving the goal of serving new types of customers and increasing the speed of payments, without losing or watering down important compliance safeguards that deter criminal activity. Some perceived payment frictions exist for specific policy reasons and do not stem from issues with existing technology. Therefore, new technology alone cannot solve the issue unless it also addresses the required safeguards.</p>
<p>Regulators can serve a valuable role in identifying where a technology solution may have an important "gap," as in the case of cross-border payments, by identifying how a solution can meet the needs of both customers and regulators. Innovation and regulatory and legal requirements can coexist&mdash;providing both enhanced capability and regulatory compliance. Transparency can promote innovation.</p>
<p>Policymakers should strive to define a clear and sensible regulatory framework designed to meet policy objectives that also enables the private sector to innovate within the established guardrails. A clear regulatory framework supports private sector innovators by providing clarity and consistency that encourages long term business investment in pursing innovation, while continuing to support today's products and services. A regulatory framework empowers supervisors to focus on safety and soundness and ensuring a safe and efficient payment system.</p>
<p>In the past, I have described an approach to innovation that solves specific problems and enables banks and other providers to meet the needs of their customers in a safe and sound manner.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240515a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;This approach recognizes the role of the private sector and focuses policymakers on payment and financial system infrastructure while balancing the public policy objectives with the benefits provided. In this construct, the same activities that present the same risks must be subject to the same regulatory expectations&mdash;regardless of what the product is called or where it is offered.</p>
<p>The active promotion of innovation has proven to be successful in the past. One example from 2019 highlights the benefits of this approach, specifically as it relates to the use of alternative data to support small dollar consumer loans.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240515a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;Timely guidance and regulatory clarity in the interagency statement clarified that, with a customer's consent, a bank may use alternative data, like checking account balance activity to help evaluate the potential borrower's creditworthiness who might not have otherwise qualified for a loan. This example did not require a change in technology, instead it used data in a responsible and innovative way through leveraging deposit account cashflow information to show credit worthiness, enabling banks to meet their customers' credit needs.</p>
<p>I think there is more we could do on this front. For example, I think there are opportunities for regulators to provide clear, actionable, and timely feedback on innovation proposals. And the principles I have described are complementary&mdash;the more regulators understand innovation, the more comfortable they will be in accepting it and promoting its adoption in the financial system. My hope is that the Federal Reserve's ongoing research and engagement with industry will help us continue to understand and assess the potential benefits and risks presented by new innovation.</p>
<p><strong>Closing thoughts</strong><br />As I consider the ever-evolving financial landscape, I will continue think about how the regulatory framework can accommodate new technology and services, while applying the safeguards in place today that protect households and businesses, and guard against illicit activity, ensuring the safety and soundness and the stability of the financial system. My hope is that as we enhance our understanding, and we recognize the promise of new technology, we can achieve a banking system that welcomes innovation, and is stronger and more efficient as a result.</p>
<p>Thank you for the invitation to join you today to discuss these issues. I look forward to our discussion.</p>

<h2><span>Introduction<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/munter-statement-audit-firms-051524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span>[1]</span></a></span></h2>
<p>Audit firms are private businesses with the same legitimate interest in making a profit that all private businesses have. But audit firms have also been entrusted to be essential gatekeepers in maintaining the integrity of our capital markets. The leaders of audit firms, and the tone that they set, play a central role in ensuring that professionals within audit firms do not sacrifice integrity and professionalism for profit and growth.</p>
<p>Picture the following scenario: An issuer&rsquo;s audit committee solicits competitive bids from audit firms for the company&rsquo;s independent audit work. In an effort to secure the lucrative engagement, a senior partner at an audit firm secretly promises the issuer&rsquo;s CFO that if his firm is chosen as the company&rsquo;s auditor, his firm would provide tax and other permissible non-audit services to the company at reduced rates. The audit firm wins the audit engagement.</p>
<p>Following an investigation by the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement, the Commission institutes an administrative proceeding and finds that because of the mutual conflict of interest created by the audit firm&rsquo;s provision of non-audit services at reduced rates in exchange for being chosen as the company&rsquo;s auditor, the audit firm and audit partner were not independent within the meaning of Rule 2-01(b) of Regulation S-X. The Commission orders a censure, monetary penalties, and a suspension from appearing or practicing before the SEC for the audit partner.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of such an enforcement action, how might the audit firm respond?</p>
<p>The firm may opt to sweep the incident under the rug. It may treat the independence violation as an isolated incident&mdash;an efficient breach or just the &ldquo;cost of doing business&rdquo;&mdash;and wait things out by allowing the partner to focus on non-audit business development until being reinstated.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the firm may opt to address the incident head-on. Firm leadership may openly discuss among its personnel what went wrong; use the underlying violations as an opportunity to teach and instill in all staff the critical importance of professional integrity, ethics, and serving the public trust; and possibly internally sanction, terminate, or suspend the audit partner.</p>
<p>Without speaking to any specific matter, we have, unfortunately, observed situations in which audit firms chose the first option: accountants, including high-profile audit partners, remain in positions of firm leadership following an enforcement action that results in discipline against the accountant with seemingly no professional repercussions while waiting for a prescribed reinstatement period to pass.</p>
<p>But what sort of tone does that response set at the firm? What message does it send to the accounting profession and firm staff, particularly less-experienced staff and staff in service lines other than audit? Does it teach them that skirting the rules is acceptable, as long as you don&rsquo;t get caught? And if you do get caught, is it simply the cost of doing business and the firm will take care of you until your &ldquo;time out&rdquo; from appearing and practicing before the Commission as an accountant is over?</p>
<p>Given the accounting profession&rsquo;s role of enhancing the public trust in corporate financial statements for the success of our capital markets, accounting is called to be a profession that holds its members to high standards of ethics and integrity.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/munter-statement-audit-firms-051524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;As the Supreme Court emphasized more than forty years ago, our profession&rsquo;s &ldquo;public watchdog function demands that the accountant maintain total independence from the client at all times and requires complete fidelity to the public trust.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/munter-statement-audit-firms-051524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>To be an effective public watchdog, audit-firm leadership must set the right tone at the top by always placing the public-interest obligations of our profession ahead of business interests and profits. Doing so is essential for educating and instilling in our young accountants the critical importance of acting ethically, with integrity and fidelity to the public trust in all our professional activities. These are core tenets of the accounting profession.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/munter-statement-audit-firms-051524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span>Why Does Tone at the Top Matter for Public Accounting Firms?</span></h2>
<p>I have talked before about the importance of tone at the top at issuers.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/munter-statement-audit-firms-051524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;But a healthy tone at the top is of paramount importance at public accounting firms as well. Indeed, academic research has &ldquo;long stressed the crucial role that tone at the top, set by leadership, plays in influencing firm culture and how it is ultimately reflected in the actions and behaviors of [auditors].&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/munter-statement-audit-firms-051524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;The tone at the top of an audit firm determines whether the culture is focused on delivering high-quality audits or is a profit-center chasing the short-term bottom line, and whether &ldquo;top management extols the important role audits play in the capital markets&rdquo; or acts as if audits are little more than compliance &ldquo;commodities.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/munter-statement-audit-firms-051524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p>For example, setting a proper tone at the top is critical in supporting auditors&rsquo; ability to exercise professional skepticism&mdash;having an attitude that includes a questioning mind and a critical assessment of audit evidence at all times.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/munter-statement-audit-firms-051524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;We understand that skepticism can prolong an audit by requiring auditors to obtain additional audit evidence and perform additional, but necessary, procedures to have sufficient appropriate audit evidence in support of the audit opinion. Such time pressures &ldquo;can create an environment in which audit quality might be compromised if engagement team members, at any level, perceive that their individual performance is measured primarily by meeting time deadlines and budget estimates.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/munter-statement-audit-firms-051524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;So in order for a less-experienced accountant on an engagement team to be empowered to exercise such skepticism, they need the unwavering support of engagement team and firm leadership, who should shield members of the engagement team from client pressure and resist the desire to wrap up an engagement quickly so that they can move on to the next book of business.</p>
<p>Tone at the top is also critical for having an effective quality control system. Leaders who understand and are dedicated to their role in protecting the interests of investors through adherence to professional ethics, values, and attitudes&mdash;and instilling those priorities in their employees&mdash;are the foundation of a strong quality control system.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/munter-statement-audit-firms-051524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p>So when firm leadership fails to set a strong tone at the top&shy;&mdash;for example, by sweeping mistakes and bad behavior under the rug, treating violations of law as isolated incidents or the &ldquo;cost of doing business,&rdquo; not holding wrongdoers throughout the firm and across service lines accountable, or changing their firm structures in ways that could pose future independence challenges for the firm with respect to its audit engagements&mdash;they risk eroding the firm&rsquo;s culture, professional skepticism, quality control systems, and public responsibility as gatekeepers of our capital markets.</p>
<p>Indeed, we have seen how an unhealthy firm culture at audit firms can manifest itself in ways that directly undermine the public trust. For instance, we have seen accounting firm scandals involving cheating on professional ethics exams by firm partners and professional staff,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/munter-statement-audit-firms-051524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;firms using confidential information to sell tax avoidance services, and accounting firm leadership viewing accounting errors and the subsequent restatements as business opportunities&mdash;all of which are contrary to the trusted role that public accountants occupy as gatekeepers. As these examples demonstrate, violations of auditing standards may not just be the result of a few rotten apples or individual failings on one audit engagement; rather, they could reflect a systemic and deficient firm culture and failure of ethical leadership.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/munter-statement-audit-firms-051524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></p>
<p>Audit firms have also sought investments from third parties, such as private equity firms, that have not been subject to the same independence and ethical responsibilities as auditors.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/munter-statement-audit-firms-051524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>&nbsp;Depending on how those investments are structured, they could lead the firm&rsquo;s professionals to question the firm&rsquo;s commitment to both independence and high-quality audits. Firm leaders need to be sensitive to the message such arrangements could send and stand ready to correct any such misimpressions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span>Instilling a Healthy &ldquo;Tone at the Top&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>An accounting firm&rsquo;s leadership team is ultimately responsible for the culture that they create and the tone that they set. Promulgating appropriate policies is important, but establishing a strong tone at the top requires more than just words, codes of conduct, and compliance checklists. Senior partners in firm leadership across all service lines must lead by example, through their&nbsp;<i>actions</i>.</p>
<p>After all, almost all audit firms have a written &ldquo;code of ethics&rdquo; or &ldquo;code of conduct.&rdquo; And almost all audit firm leaders extoll the importance of ethics and integrity. However, all those words and policies can easily be diluted or undermined by leadership&rsquo;s &ldquo;tone,&rdquo; which is exhibited by actions.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/munter-statement-audit-firms-051524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>&nbsp;For instance, does firm leadership support their staff when tough calls need to be made in compliance with ethical and professional obligations? When mistakes are made or bad behavior is uncovered, does leadership candidly admit those mistakes, take corrective action, and share lessons learned with staff? When a top-earning partner that wins engagements has been suspended in an enforcement action for unethical behavior, does firm leadership hold that partner and themselves accountable in a transparent manner to mentor and cultivate ethics and integrity in the next generation of partners? Do the firm&rsquo;s expectations about ethics and integrity apply to all professionals in the firm, and not just to those who provide audit and attest services?</p>
<p>Less-experienced staff watch what their managers do. If they see their managers bend the rules or make exceptions for profitable partners who engage in inappropriate conduct, less-experienced staff may assume that this behavior is the path to rise through the ranks. This is why firm leadership must make ethics and character a fundamental part of the firm&rsquo;s hiring, retention, and promotion criteria for all professionals, regardless of service line within the firm&mdash;even at the expense of a more profitable bottom line in the short-term. Professionals trained to conduct themselves, and to expect others on their team to conduct themselves, with integrity in an ethical and professional manner reinforce one another with the support of firm leadership. By contrast, leadership that encourages corner cutting to save time on audit engagements, promotes individuals that do not exhibit key indicia of professional ethical conduct, and fails to support and defend professionals that make difficult decisions in favor of high audit quality will, in the end, fail in their role as public watchdogs.</p>
<p>Therefore, professional integrity and ethics should be an integral part of the promotion and compensation process. Leadership should reward individuals or engagement teams that took difficult stands and sacrificed short-term profitability in order to preserve independence and other professional responsibilities of the firm.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/munter-statement-audit-firms-051524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>&nbsp;Technical excellence and integrity should be rewarded at least as much as billing, profitability, and business development.</p>
<p>Candor and transparency are also critical for establishing a healthy tone at the top. Employees should be able to share their views confidentially on the company&rsquo;s culture and climate. Survey results should be shared throughout the organization in a way that maintains the anonymity of respondents. Staff also should be empowered&mdash;or perhaps even&nbsp;<i>required</i>&mdash;to report misconduct when they&rsquo;re aware of it. And of course, retaliating against or threatening a whistleblower should never be tolerated.</p>
<p>Finally, how firm leadership plans to structure their future business reflects the tone at the top. For example, selling a portion of the business to an external party while retaining an equity interest or other involvement in that business, or creating alternative practice structures from the infusion of capital designed to grow the non-attest practice, can send a powerful message about the firm&rsquo;s priorities. As we have previously cautioned, such alternative practice structures may pose serious challenges for the audit firm&rsquo;s future ability to comply with independence rules.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/munter-statement-audit-firms-051524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>&nbsp;As such, they risk sending a message to staff that complying with professional standards, providing high-quality audits, and fulfilling its public watchdog role are not the firm&rsquo;s highest priority. Audit firms should guard against any such inadvertent messaging and double down on their communications to staff about the firm&rsquo;s steadfast commitment to independence and high-quality audits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span>Conclusion</span></h2>
<p>Accountants serve a trusted public role in promoting the integrity of our markets and the protection of investors. The value of an audit and auditors depends on their credibility and trustworthiness. Audit professionals in particular have a difficult job&mdash;they sometimes must make difficult determinations that pit the public interest against self- or firm-interest. But that is precisely how public accountants fulfill their gatekeeping function to help protect investors: by ensuring that issues are promptly identified and addressed. To maintain that function, and in training the next generations of public accountants, it is critical that leaders of public accounting firms lead by example and foster a healthy tone at the top by prioritizing integrity and professionalism over profit and growth.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/munter-statement-audit-firms-051524?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a></p>

<title>FIA Backs International Effort To Promote "Effective Practices" For Variation Margin</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/fia-backs-international-effort-to-promote-effective-practices-for-variation-ma/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> transparency, margin calls, central counterparties, market volatility, collateral management
Summary:<br /> FIA urges transparency in intraday margin calls and collateral management, supports effective practices, and recommends binding standards for variation margin. <div>
<div>
<p>FIA&nbsp;<a href="https://email.fia.org/c/129BHMSC6yOlAJ7WRgF4CNFAzfXabp">has responded</a><span>&nbsp;</span>to a discussion paper released by international standard setters that sets out eight "effective practices" for streamlining variation margin in centrally cleared markets. The discussion paper addresses the need for greater transparency and understanding of margin practices at central counterparties, particularly in light of recent episodes of market volatility triggered by the COVID crisis and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Central counterparties generally make calls for variation margin at the end of the day, but they can make intraday VM calls and often do so when markets are volatile. The members of the clearinghouses must fund the calls immediately, and during periods of market volatility, these calls can be very large.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>For this reason, FIA has urged CCPs to provide more transparency and predictability into intraday margin calls. FIA recognizes that CCPs need the ability to call additional margin when markets become more volatile, but providing more transparency and predictability into their margin practices would allow their members to prepare more effectively for these calls, thereby reducing sudden demands for liquidity that can contribute to market instability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue drew the attention of global regulators when market volatility associated with the COVID crisis triggered a &ldquo;dash for cash&rdquo; by financial market participants that needed to close out positions to meet their liquidity needs.&nbsp;The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision,&nbsp;the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures, and the International Organization of Securities Commissions published a general review of margin practices in 2022, and in April 2024 CPMI and IOSCO published a&nbsp;<a href="https://email.fia.org/c/129BHNmgGCH2Z5RziLsKHXEC04fXYi" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">discussion paper</a>&nbsp;focused specifically on streamlining variation margin. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In its response, FIA said it generally supports the effective practices outlined by CPMI and IOSCO, with specific recommendations aimed at further refining intraday margin processes and collateral management within CCPs. The response notes, however, that the practices are not enforceable, and urges&nbsp;international standard setters to consider establishing principles and/or standards for variation margin and intraday margin practices.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"We generally support these effective practices," Jaqueline Mesa, FIA&rsquo;s chief operating officer and senior vice president of global policy, said in the response. "They promote transparency and predictability for market participants, timely consideration of sourcing liquidity, optimization of netting benefits and the eligibility of non-cash collateral. However, we believe that binding standards or principles could be established for variation margin and intraday margin practices."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Specific recommendations highlighted by FIA in the letter include:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Scheduled and Unscheduled Intraday Margin Calls: FIA supports transparent and clearly defined scheduled intraday margin calls, made consistently and at reasonable hours, to enhance predictability for market participants. Unscheduled calls should be reserved for extreme market conditions or significant exposures, with clear triggers and thresholds communicated to all participants.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Transparency Requirements: FIA stresses the importance of comprehensive transparency in CCP margin practices, including detailed breakdowns of calculations, netting arrangements, and availability of excess collateral. This transparency is crucial for participants to understand and manage their intraday margin obligations effectively.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Establishment of Binding Standards: FIA recommends establishing binding standards or principles for VM and intraday margin practices to ensure consistency and enforceability across CCPs.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Pass-through VM Model: FIA encourages the exploration of the pass-through VM model to enhance liquidity and risk management efficiency, provided that challenges related to fair valuation and liquidity sourcing are carefully considered.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Collateral Management: FIA advocates for flexibility in collateral use, allowing non-cash collateral to cover intraday margin obligations and enabling the mobility of excess collateral across CCPs to optimize liquidity management.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>FIA supports transparency in the derivatives clearing community and has published several papers over the past few years recommending CCP risk management best practices, including enhancing transparency. Most relevant are the recommendations and policy options published in a report from October 2020,&nbsp;<a href="https://email.fia.org/c/129BHOjzQKsrLPkObL46ShCERGRzy4" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Revisiting Procyclicality: The Impact of the COVID Crisis on CCP Margin Requirements</a>, which covers intraday margin among other topics.&nbsp;</div>

<div> cryptoassets, investment, risk, regulation, consumer protection
<br />
Investing in cryptoassets is risky due to lack of consumer protection, price volatility, environmental impact, and potential for money laundering. Regulations are pending.
<br /><br />Summary: Investing in cryptoassets is risky due to lack of consumer protection, price volatility, environmental impact, and potential for money laundering. Regulations are pending. <div>
<p><span>Right now, the media is filled with reporting on cryptoassets, and various investment tips are being shared on social media. Even though regulations for the cryptomarket are under development, it will continue to be very risky for consumers to invest in crypto. We have listed four reasons not to invest in them.</span></p>
<div class="editor-content">
<p>According to FI's household survey in 2023, approximately six per cent of the Swedish population had invested in cryptoassets despite these investments being very risky and there currently being no consumer protection in place. Even though new regulations, such as the MiCA Regulation, are pending and will regulate the market, trading in cryptoassets is still considered to be a high-risk activity.</p>
<p>"The market can fluctuate sharply, and it is difficult to accurately value most cryptoassets. The risk that you will lose money is high," says Charlotte Fried, Head of Payment Policy at FI.</p>
<p>Are you considering an investment in cryptoassets? Here are four facts that you should know.</p>
<h2>Consumers have little protection</h2>
<p>Cryptoassets are currently unregulated and for the most part not subject to FI's supervision. New regulations are not yet applicable, and even after the regulations have entered into force investing in cryptoassets will continue to be risky. There is, for example, a high risk of fraud, hacker attacks, and other security problems that you as a consumer are not protected against when you invest.</p>
<h2>The value can fall sharply</h2>
<p>The price of cryptoassets swings rapidly. Many cryptoassets also do not have an underlying value like, for example, shares and funds. This makes valuation difficult.</p>
<h2>Adverse environmental impact</h2>
<p>The mining of bitcoin and some other cryptoassets consumes large amounts of electricity. Despite attempts by some cryptoassets to reduce energy use, the consumption of electricity is higher today than ever before, resulting in environmentally harmful carbon emissions.</p>
<h2>Risk of money laundering and terrorist financing</h2>
<p>Cryptoassets are used to launder money and finance terrorism. The quickness of transactions, global reach, potential for pseudoanonymity, and the possibility of conducting transactions without financial intermediaries make cryptoassets attractive for criminals.</p>

<div> investments, mortgage secondary market, Encompass digital lending platform, ICE PPE, advisory group
Summary:<br />ICE invests in mortgage secondary market and Encompass platform, enhancing ICE PPE with input from advisory group for industry-specific solutions. <div>
<p><span><a href="https://www.ice.com/index" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Intercontinental Exchange</a>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.ice.com/index" rel="nofollow" shape="rect"><span>, Inc.</span>&nbsp;</a>(NYSE: ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today announced investments focused on growing its mortgage secondary market offerings and enhancing the Encompass digital lending platform&rsquo;s native product and pricing engine. ICE has dedicated resources to driving a robust roadmap of features and improvements for ICE PPE (formerly EPPS) and secondary market innovation, informed by the regular, ongoing input of the elite group of lenders making up the ICE PPE Advisory Group.</p>
<p>Encompass users already have native access to thousands of loan products and a robust network of investors, wholesale lenders, and state and local housing authorities via ICE PPE. Taking product and pricing to the next level is key to ICE&rsquo;s commitment to improve housing finance through digitization and provide the mortgage secondary market with the technology, systems, and insight needed to navigate and hedge against a turbulent interest rate environment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I talk with mortgage industry professionals every day, and one thing they&rsquo;ve made crystal clear is a pressing, growing need for a stable, accurate, well-capitalized loan product and pricing engine,&rdquo; said ICE president Ben Jackson. &ldquo;With so much uncertainty in the market, lenders need to be able to rely on comprehensive and timely product pricing and eligibility. Margins have been compressed to historic lows, and we want to help our clients be in the best position to hold on to every possible basis point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To meet that need, ICE is investing significantly to dramatically enhance ICE PPE within our Encompass lending platform, and we are actively engaging with a select group of industry leaders as we chart the best course forward. Together with ICE&rsquo;s expertise in building and operating digital, transaction-based networks, and our proven playbook of increasing efficiencies through digitization, it&rsquo;s this collaborative approach that will trigger the next great stage of evolution for PPEs and secondary market hedging platforms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>ICE PPE will provide enhanced automation and configuration capabilities with streamlined support for custom loan programs and overlays. As part of ICE&rsquo;s overall mission to streamline and simplify housing finance, the company is committed to delivering a highly performant, intuitive solution that integrates seamlessly with Encompass and the wider ICE housing finance digital ecosystem. To support this product evolution, ICE is actively expanding the associated product development, solutions engineering and support resource teams with experienced industry professionals.</p>
<p>The ICE PPE Advisory Group is composed of leading mortgage lenders &ndash; including both users of Encompass&rsquo; product pricing capabilities as well as those who employ other available pricing engines. Beginning with a kickoff at the Mortgage Bankers Association&rsquo;s Secondary Marketing conference in May, the advisory group will continue to meet regularly to identify common challenges and find solutions to pricing and other problems faced by lenders and those in the secondary and capital markets.</p>

<div> Keywords: Nasdaq, AI, market surveillance, market abuse investigations, financial system integrity<br />
Summary: Nasdaq integrates AI into market surveillance for faster, more efficient market abuse investigations, enhancing global marketplace integrity. Expanding AI capabilities across business units.<br /><br /> <div>
<ul>
<li><em>Nasdaq to integrate Gen AI feature into its leading market surveillance technology for regulators andmarketplaces globally</em> </li>
<li><em>AI functionality will improve overall quality and efficiency of market abuse investigations for our clients,enhancing integrity of the financial system</em> </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nasdaq (Nasdaq: NDAQ) today announced the new AI powered feature within its Market Surveillance technology solution that will significantly enhance the quality, speed, and efficiency of market abuse investigations performed by our clients. The solution leverages generative AI to streamline the triage and examination process involved in investigating suspected market manipulation and insider dealing, empowering regulator and marketplace clients to more effectively monitor and detect potential market abuse.</p>
<p align="left">During proof-of-concept testing, surveillance analysts estimated a 33% reduction in investigation time, with improved overall outcomes. This represents a substantial gain in investigation efficiency. Nasdaq is planning to leverage the generative AI enabled functionality for its&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">U.S.</span>&nbsp;equity market surveillance.</p>
<p align="left">&ldquo;Maintaining trust in capital markets is critical to preserving long-term growth and prosperity,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Ed Probst</span>, Senior Vice President and Head of Regulatory Technology at Nasdaq. &ldquo;Market abuse is a substantial global challenge and one that demands increasingly sophisticated solutions to address it. As a major regulatory technology provider to the world&rsquo;s financial system, with a deep culture of innovation, Nasdaq is uniquely placed to leverage the power of technology to further enhance the tools and capabilities necessary to uphold the integrity of marketplaces globally.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="left"><span>New AI Surveillance Capabilities</span></p>
<p align="left">In an effort to ensure market integrity and trustworthiness, international regulators require financial institutions to demonstrate the ongoing effectiveness of their surveillance systems and controls. Firms are expected to have comprehensive coverage across their entire portfolio and operations, spanning a broad range of asset classes and jurisdictions, with scalable systems capable of managing increased levels of risk during periods of high volume and volatility.</p>
<p align="left">Today, when analysts receive automated alerts of suspicious activity, they must conduct an initial review and form an assessment of whether the activity warrants further investigation. That typically involves manually collating all necessary evidence, including relevant trading activity and corporate filings alongside a vast array of data from external sources, before deciding whether to continue the review. The process is highly resource intensive, and even more so if the alert warrants further investigation.</p>
<p align="left">Leveraging Amazon Bedrock, an AWS service for building secure generative AI applications, Nasdaq&rsquo;s enhanced functionality will empower analysts with generative AI capabilities to distill, analyze, and interpret relevant information more quickly, enhancing their ability to form detailed initial assessments of alerts. For example, the technology can produce a consolidated table of the company&rsquo;s regulatory filings, summaries and links to company, sector, and peer company news, news sentiment analysis, and other mitigating or aggravating factors that may impact any given security.</p>
<p align="left"><span class="xn-person">Tony Sio</span>, Head of Regulatory Strategy and Innovation at Nasdaq, said: &ldquo;By drawing on the latest&nbsp;innovation in cloud technology and artificial intelligence, we can better respond to new threats and offer the global financial system advanced tools to more effectively tackle market abuse. This is a continuous cycle of investment and improvement in our capability, leveraging our unique position as both a world class market operator and best in class surveillance technology provider around the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="left"><span class="xn-person">Scott Mullins</span>, General Manager of&nbsp;<span class="xn-org">Worldwide Financial Services</span>&nbsp;at AWS, said: &ldquo;Nasdaq is continuously innovating on behalf of the global capital markets by combining its industry-leading expertise with cloud and AI technology. We are honored to work with Nasdaq as it harnesses the power of generative AI to advance the stability and security of the global financial system.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="left"><span>Nasdaq&rsquo;s Expansion of AI Across Multiple Business Units</span></p>
<p>As a global technology provider, Nasdaq has continuously advanced AI capabilities to support capital markets, enhancing the integrity, fairness, liquidity, and efficiency of the financial ecosystem. This new generative AI functionality has been introduced as part of Nasdaq's broader research and development effort, focused on transparent, reliable, and accountable AI implementation across the financial services industry.</p>
<p align="left">A major aspect of Nasdaq&rsquo;s AI strategy has been to accelerate its market modernization effort by improving the quality of its data and surrounding systems while embracing cloud-enabled infrastructure. Nasdaq&rsquo;s long-term approach to technology and investments has enabled the company to unlock the power of AI by scaling its capabilities, tools, and systems with proper governance, security, and oversight. To date, Nasdaq&rsquo;s AI initiatives span many of its business units, including North American Markets Services, Financial Crime Management Technology, and Corporate Solutions.</p>
<p align="left">Within North American Market Services, Nasdaq has launched&nbsp;<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=JzGp2KYV-0qWVPpoyt5AF5-ToVAd4X973KP7pHM5I32i7jOxcl2B_dU3ZvuVdmHpfJBHy1sbUj8OcMHkkscqfrvrDjmjXdVix_N9tszHmh6v3YUVMJ8xRHPa_gjrCKDe" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dynamic MELO</a>, the first&nbsp;<span class="xn-org">SEC</span>&nbsp;approved AI order type, and Strike Price Optimization, a purpose-built program designed to align Nasdaq&rsquo;s six options exchanges strike lists to market demand.

<div> NYSE, ICE, NYSE Tech Council, cybersecurity, AI<br />
Summary:<br />
NYSE forms Tech Council for C-suite tech leaders to address cybersecurity and AI best practices, leveraging its history of cutting-edge technology. <div>
<p>The New York Stock Exchange, part of Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE: ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today announced the formation of the NYSE Tech Council, a group of senior technology leaders within the NYSE community that will focus on thought leadership and actionable best practices.</p>
<p>The council will be comprised of Chief Technology Officers, Chief Information Officers and other C-suite technology leaders from NYSE-listed companies. With technology evolving rapidly, the NYSE Tech Council&rsquo;s initial focus will be cybersecurity matters and AI use cases. The NYSE Tech Council will operate in a similar fashion to the other NYSE thought leadership councils, which address topics of interest to the 2,400 issuer-strong NYSE community.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this digital age when virtually every company is relying on rapidly evolving technology to transform its business, the new NYSE Tech Council will play a pivotal role for our remarkable NYSE community,&rdquo; said Lynn Martin, President, New York Stock Exchange. &ldquo;Companies list their shares on the NYSE to raise money and change the world, and through its actionable insights the council will further support our issuers in pursuit of their technology driven goals.&rdquo;</p>

In October 2023, the NYSE completed a multi-year upgrade of the technology that supports trading activity on its equity and options markets. NYSE Pillar, one of the industry&rsquo;s most deterministic technology platforms, now powers every exchange the NYSE operates as well as critical U.S. equity market-data infrastructure. NYSE Pillar has set a new standard in performance, despite unparalleled growth in demand and electronic message rates.</p>

<div> survey, direct indexing, advisors, barriers, education
Summary: 79% of advisors don't use direct indexing, lacking education and facing barriers, but 48% plan to start in 1-5 years. <div>
<div class="tr-VerticalSpacing tr-VerticalSpacing--m">
<div class="tr-RichText   ">
<ul>
<li><span>79% of advisors* are not using direct indexing, but 48% plan to start in the next 1-5 years&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Educational gaps remain as less than half of respondents identified the potential client benefits of direct indexing</span></li>
<li><span>Barriers to entry proved to be operational as well as educational&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="tr-VerticalSpacing tr-VerticalSpacing--m">
<div class="tr-RichText   ">
<p>FTSE Russell, the global index provider, announced today the results from a recent survey of independent RIAs, hybrid advisors, broker dealers, registered reps and other financial advisors on their knowledge, views and use of direct indexing.</p>
<p>Advisors across most AUM segments indicated strong interest in using direct indexing in the future, but most (79%) are not current users*.&nbsp; Just 34% of advisors describe themselves as &ldquo;very familiar&rdquo; or extremely familiar&rdquo; with direct indexing, and many advisors lack a clear understanding of the benefits of direct indexing. Yet, 48% plan to start using direct indexing in the next 1-5 years*,&nbsp;and future growth may come from smaller account sizes. More than half (59%) of firms with $50-200 million AUM plan to use direct indexing in the next 1-5 years.</p>
<p><span>Ryan Sullivan, head of buy side, Americas at FTSE Russell, said:</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Direct Indexing has been touted as a sea change in the industry, but it&rsquo;s important to understand we&rsquo;re still very early in its wider adoption.&nbsp; While larger advisors with access to tax optimization tools can articulate the benefits of direct indexing, many non-users are unsure how to communicate the value proposition to clients.&nbsp; Direct indexing providers should look at these advisor segments as an opportunity and align their strategy with a focus on reducing operational friction and enhancing their educational support. Firms that can effectively engage with these advisors will be well positioned to ride the next wave of growth for direct indexing.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Advisors&rsquo; familiarity with direct indexing</span></p>
<p>Advisors&rsquo; perceptions of direct indexing and its benefits underscore the need for education. While current direct indexing users identified &ldquo;tax loss harvesting&rdquo; (64%), &ldquo;tax efficient transitions&rdquo; (56%) and &ldquo;reducing concentration risk&rdquo; (40%) as the top benefits for directing indexing, those not using direct indexing* were significantly less likely to identify these potential values.</p>
<p>In addition, 28% of total advisors* agreed with the statement, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand the benefits over other investment options,&rdquo; 27% indicated &ldquo;it&rsquo;s easier to achieve the same goals with an ETF portfolio,&rdquo; and 20% felt &ldquo;it&rsquo;s ultimately the same offering as Separately Managed Accounts.&rdquo; Among advisors who are currently using direct indexing, only 66% agreed with the statement, &ldquo;I feel confident talking to my clients about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Barriers to entry</span></p>
<p>Advisors noted several barriers reflecting a combination of educational and operational challenges. When asked about barriers to using with a client, &ldquo;lack of client demand&rdquo; was the top response (34%), followed by the advisor&rsquo;s &ldquo;understanding and knowledge of direct indexing&rdquo; (29%), &ldquo;lack of organizational focus&rdquo; (23%) and &ldquo;cost&rdquo; (21%).*</p>
<p>Conducted by RIA Channel, the survey solicited input from 631 advisors between April 1 and May 1 2024. The advisors came from independent RIAs, broker dealers, hybrids and asset managers among other firm types. Over half of respondents&rsquo; firms had an AUM of over $1 Billion (51%) and most served clients with affluence of over $250,000 (83%).</p>
<p>FTSE Russell partners with 20 direct indexing platforms, representing approximately $50B in AUM. By providing a suite of robust, rules-based and transparent indexes and a team of leading research professionals and market experts, FTSE Russell enables wealth and asset managers to add value for their clients via direct indexing solutions that are carefully tailored to their specific needs and preferences.</p>
<p>Direct Indexing is an investment approach that allows the investor to replicate the performance of an index by purchasing the underlying shares or use an index as the starting universe for a portfolio that can be customized especially for tax optimization.</p>
<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lseg.com/en/ftse-russell/direct-indexing-solutions">detailed report on all of the findings</a>&nbsp;will be published soon.</p>
<p><em>*Advisors with at least some familiarity with direct indexing</em></p>

<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p><span>The FCA has charged 3 individuals with fraud for their alleged involvement in a high-risk trading scheme, which targeted people&rsquo;s pension savings.</span></p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p><span>Kristofer McGuire, Keith Williamson and Karla Walker have been charged with multiple offences, including fraud by false representation and fraudulent trading, after they targeted victims by persuading them to invest in contracts for difference (CFDs).</span></p>
<p><span>CFDs are a high-risk investment product used to bet on the price of an asset.</span></p>
<p><span>Many victims of the alleged fraud were encouraged to use their pensions to invest which were then traded to generate large commissions for those running the scheme, with victims&rsquo; pension funds almost entirely lost.</span></p>
<p><span>The FCA alleges that Mr McGuire, Mr Williamson and Ms Walker made false statements to a trading platform that their clients were professional investors.</span></p>
<p><span>Mr Williamson and Mr McGuire are accused of fraudulent trading, and Mr McGuire faces 5 further counts of fraud by false representation.</span></p>
<p><span>The total known loss to victims is over &pound;8 million.</span></p>
<p><span>The defendants will appear before Westminster Magistrates&rsquo; Court on 7 June 2024.</span></p>
<p><span>Anyone who believes they have suffered loss in relation to this matter is encouraged to contact the FCA consumer contact centre on 0800 111 6768 (freephone).</span></p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<ul>
<li>Dates of birth: Kristofer McGuire (17/12/1976), Keith Williamson (26/11/1950) and Karla Walker (19/07/1978).</li>
<li>The FCA alleges:<br /> 
<ul class="Indent1">

<title>Spectrum Markets: Retail Investors Bullish On Japan In April As Anticipation Builds For Bank Of Japan’s Potential Interest Rate Hikes</title>

<div> Sentiment, Yen, Spectrum Markets, Nikkei 225, Trading hours
Summary: Spectrum Markets' SERIX data shows improved sentiment towards Yen, bullish trading behavior on Nikkei 225, and increase in non-traditional trading hours. <div>
<ul>
<li>Spectrum saw an improvement in sentiment towards Yen against US Dollar, Euro and Pound Sterling</li>
<li>Sentiment index on the Nikkei 225 also indicated bullish trading behaviour</li>
<li>64.4% of trading on the Nikkei 225 occurred outside of traditional European trading hours </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spectrum Markets (&ldquo;Spectrum&rdquo;), the pan-European trading venue designed for retail investors, has published its SERIX sentiment data for European retail investors for April. The sentiment index reveals a bullish trading behaviour towards the Japanese Yen, relative to the US Dollar, with sentiment on USDJPY falling to 71, marking its lowest level since November 2019.</p>
<p>This development is also noticeable in other Yen currency pairs, such as against the Euro and British Pound. The retail investor sentiment index directly correlates with the Yen price, which recovered at the end of April after a record low, equivalent to the value of 0.0063 US Dollars on April 26<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>Additionally, Spectrum&rsquo;s retail investor sentiment index saw bullish trading behaviour towards the leading Japanese index, Nikkei 225.</p>
<p>The SERIX value indicates retail investor sentiment, with a number above 100 marking bullish sentiment, and a number below 100 indicating bearish sentiment. (See below for more information on the methodology).</p>
<p><b>Market opinion</b></p>
<p>&ldquo;In recent months, the Yen experienced a notable decline against the US Dollar, but towards the end of April, it showed a brief recovery, possibly in response to early indications of upcoming interest rate hikes by the Bank of Japan,&rdquo; says Michael Hall, Head of Distribution at Spectrum Markets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the primary factors contributing to the Yen&rsquo;s decline has been Japan&rsquo;s monetary policy. While western central banks have been consistently raising key interest rates to combat inflation, the Bank of Japan has marginally increased its key interest rate from -0.1% to a range of 0%-0.1% last month. This was a decision which was anticipated since Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda took office in April last year,&rdquo; Hall adds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Interestingly, Spectrum saw 64.4% of trading on the Nikkei 225 in April occur outside of traditional European trading hours last month, underscoring the demand we are seeing among European retail investors for 24/5 trading to access international markets,&rdquo; he concludes.</p>
<p><b>Spectrum&rsquo;s April data</b></p>
<p>In April 2024, order book turnover on Spectrum was &euro;311 million, with 36.9% of trades taking place outside of traditional hours (i.e., between 17:30 and 9:00 CET).</p>
<p>75.9% of the order book turnover was on indices, 14.3% on commodities, 3.8% on equities, 3.1% on currency pairs and 2.9% on cryptocurrencies, with the top three traded underlying markets being DAX 40 (26.3%), NASDAQ 100 (21.1%), and DOW 30 (10%).</p>
<p>Looking at the SERIX data for the top three underlying markets, the DAX 40 sentiment increased slightly from a bearish 95 to a bullish 101. Similarly, the NASDAQ 100 increased slightly from a neutral 100 to 101 and the DOW 30 increased also, from a bearish 99 to a bullish 103.</p>
<p><img alt="Spectrum_15May24" src="https://mondovisione.com/_assets/images/Spectrum_15May24.jpg" title="Spectrum_15May24" /></p>
<div>
<p align="center"><b>Calculating SERIX data</b></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The Spectrum European Retail Investor Index (SERIX), uses the trading venue&rsquo;s pan-European trading data to shed light on investor sentiment towards current development in financial markets.<span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The index is calculated on a monthly basis by analysing retail investor trades placed and subtracting the proportion of bearish trades from the proportion of bullish trades, to give a single figure (rebased at 100) that indicates the strength and direction of sentiment:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;<i style="font-family: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">SERIX = (% bullish trades - % bearish trades) + 100</i></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;Trades where long instruments are bought and trades where short instruments are sold are both considered bullish trades, while trades where long instruments are sold and trades where short instruments are bought are considered bearish trades. Trades that are matched by retail clients are disregarded. (For a detailed methodology and examples, please visit this <a href="https://www.spectrum-markets.com/the-venue/spectrum-european-retail-investor-index?utm_source=Press%20Release%20-%20EN&amp;utm_medium=SERIX%20LINK&amp;utm_campaign=May%20Volumes%20Press%20Release&amp;utm_content=" style="font-size: 11px;">link</a><span style="font-size: 11px;">).</span></p>

Temenos and Microsoft Azure demonstrate a 52% efficiency improvement in handling digital transactions, reducing carbon impact, and accelerating the shift to the cloud.<br />
Keywords: efficiency, sustainability, Temenos, Microsoft Azure, carbon impact
Summary: Temenos and Microsoft Azure show 52% efficiency improvement, reduce carbon impact, and accelerate the shift to the cloud.<br /> <div>
<p>Temenos (SIX: TEMN) today announced the results of a sustainability benchmark for its cloud-native banking platform running on Microsoft Azure,&nbsp;demonstrating&nbsp;the efficiency to handle the variable demands of digital transactions while also supporting banks to meet their sustainability goals.</p>
<p>The Microsoft benchmark simulated a client using Temenos&nbsp;<a href="https://www.temenos.com/news/2024/01/11/temenos-launches-end-to-end-saas-services-for-retail-business-and-corporate-banking-for-faster-time-to-value/" target="_blank">Retail Enterprise Services</a>&nbsp;with&nbsp;25 million customers&nbsp;and 38 million accounts, processing 12 million loans&nbsp;on&nbsp;a single instance. Having previously set a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.temenos.com/news/2023/05/09/temenos-banking-cloud-reaches-record-high-transactions-and-scales-efficiently-and-sustainably-for-banking-as-a-service/" target="_blank">record highwater benchmark</a>&nbsp;for the volume of transactions per second (TPS), this latest benchmark showed the advances in Temenos&rsquo; leaner and more sustainable architecture, with up to 52 percent like-for-like efficiency improvement for the tested workloads compared to the&nbsp;previous&nbsp;release.</p>
<p>From a 2021 baseline and&nbsp;validated&nbsp;by GoCodeGreen, Temenos has reduced the carbon impact of its software by over 50 percent. Improving the performance with more efficient code and leaner architecture means less demand for infrastructure, less processing power needed and&nbsp;consequently&nbsp;less energy consumed and lower carbon emissions. Combined with Temenos sustainable operations and the sustainability of hyperscaler partners like Microsoft, this brings added environmental benefits for banks choosing to deploy Temenos solutions on public cloud or as&nbsp;SaaS.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.temenos.com/news/2024/01/11/temenos-launches-end-to-end-saas-services-for-retail-business-and-corporate-banking-for-faster-time-to-value/" target="_blank">Temenos</a>&nbsp;continuously invests in its cloud-native platform to ensure it&nbsp;leverages&nbsp;the latest advances and innovations from hyperscalers.</p>
<p>According to a recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.temenos.com/insights/white-papers-reports/global-byte-sized-banking/" target="_blank">Economist Impact study</a>&nbsp;of 300 global banking executives, more than half (51 percent) of survey respondents agree that banks will no longer own any data centers because they will have moved to public cloud in the next five years.</p>
<p><b>Tony Coleman, Chief Technology and Innovation Officer, Temenos, commented:</b>&nbsp;&ldquo;The sustainability benchmark on Microsoft Azure shows the unmatched speed and efficiency of Temenos&rsquo; cloud-native platform helping banks to decarbonize their operations and grow their businesses sustainably. Over the years&nbsp;Temenos has worked hard investing considerable R&amp;D to get the best out of the cloud with a platform and solutions that are fully&nbsp;cloud-native. With a leaner and greener architecture, Temenos is by far the most sustainable way to run core banking in the cloud.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Kalliopi Chioti, Chief Marketing and&nbsp;ESG&nbsp;Officer, Temenos, added:</b>&nbsp;&ldquo;Compliance with climate regulation and meeting environmental targets have joined the list of reasons why banks are accelerating the shift to the cloud. Temenos is committed to&nbsp;helping our clients reach their own ESG targets, particularly through our cloud-native platform, enabling our clients to significantly reduce their carbon emissions. Further, with our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.temenos.com/news/2022/10/25/temenos-launches-carbon-emissions-calculator-on-temenos-banking-cloud/" target="_blank">Carbon Emissions Calculator</a>, a free tool embedded within Temenos SaaS, we empower banks to track their direct and indirect cloud emissions from banking activities, helping measure progress towards sustainability goals and&nbsp;comply with&nbsp;growing climate regulations.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Christian Sarafidis, Chief Executive EMEA Financial Services, Microsoft, said:&nbsp;</b>&ldquo;We are thrilled to see our collaboration with Temenos continue to set new standards for core banking in the cloud. Temenos and Microsoft have a strategic relationship to meet the growing demand from banks for cloud and SaaS banking services. Together, with our combined&nbsp;expertise&nbsp;we are leading the transition to a more sustainable banking industry.&rdquo;</p>

The Regulatory Expectations are intended to support the long-term interests of the Australian market by delivering outcomes that are consistent with those that might be expected in a competitive environment, by:</p>
<ul>
<li>ensuring that ASX remains responsive to users&rsquo; evolving needs, including in relation to its governance framework; and</li>
<li>providing access to its cash equity CS services on a transparent and non-discriminatory basis with terms and conditions, including pricing, that are fair and reasonable.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ASIC intends to consult on draft CS services rules to deliver these outcomes in July this year.</p>

<title>ASIC Announces 30 June 2024 Focus Areas And Expanded Program To Support Financial Reporting And Audit Quality</title>

<div> Expanded program, financial reporting, audit surveillance, compliance, climate-related risks <br />
Summary:<br />
ASIC announced an expanded program to enhance financial reporting and audit quality, including surveillance coverage, climate-related risks, and compliance reviews.<br /> <div>
<p>ASIC today has outlined an expanded program of work to enhance the integrity and quality of financial reporting and auditing in Australia in achieving the broader goal of confident and informed investors.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s pro-active financial reporting and audit surveillance program remains a key part of our work. The program covers listed companies, other public interest entities and previously grandfathered large proprietary companies. From 30 June, it will also include superannuation funds.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s announcement includes ASIC&rsquo;s focus areas for 30 June 2024.</p>
<p>We are also today announcing a new review of auditors&rsquo; compliance with ethical and independence standards to support our financial reporting and audit surveillance program and uplift our commitment to improved financial reporting and audit quality.</p>
<p>This includes some preliminary observations about compliance with Auditing Standard ASQM 1&nbsp;<em>Quality Management for Firms that Perform Audits or Reviews of Financial Reports and Other Financial Information, or Other Assurance or Related Services Engagement.</em></p>
<p>ASIC continues to encourage voluntary climate reporting and urge directors and assurance providers to prepare for the proposed introduction of mandatory climate reporting requirements.</p>
<h2>Financial reporting and audit surveillance 30 June 2024</h2>
<h3>Enduring focus areas and particular focus areas</h3>
<p>ASIC has identified enduring focus areas that apply to all reporting periods. In certain reporting periods, these will be supplemented with particular areas of focus as new regulatory requirements or emerging issues arise.</p>
<p>Our enduring areas of focus include asset values, adequacy of provisions, subsequent events and disclosures.</p>
<p>ASIC Commissioner Kate O&rsquo;Rourke said, &lsquo;The areas announced today will be the focus of our proactive financial reporting and audit surveillance program. They will be informed by key findings in Report 774&nbsp;<em>ASIC&rsquo;s first integrated financial reporting and audit surveillance report</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-774-annual-financial-reporting-and-audit-surveillance-report-2022-23/" title="REP 774 Annual financial reporting and audit surveillance report 2022&ndash;23">REP 774</a>). We expect preparers, directors and auditors to pay particular attention to these focus areas in a collective effort to improve financial reporting and audit quality.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;ASIC will continue to focus on the financial reporting elements that require the most judgement and make the most use of estimates,&rsquo; Ms O&rsquo;Rourke said.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s focus areas for 30 June 2024 can be found on&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-reporting-and-audit/financial-reporting-and-audit-focus-areas/" title="Financial reporting and audit focus areas">ASIC&rsquo;s financial reporting and audit focus areas</a>&nbsp;page.</p>
<h3>Surveillance coverage</h3>
<p>This is the second year that large proprietary companies, which were previously exempt, are required to lodge audited financial reports with ASIC. Financial reports from these entities are now included in ASIC&rsquo;s financial reporting and audit surveillance program.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Many grandfathered companies exempted from lodging financial reports with ASIC are significant businesses and of interest to many stakeholders. We will now include this cohort in our surveillance program and follow up instances where non-compliance and non-lodgement occurs,&rsquo; Ms O&rsquo;Rourke said.</p>
<p>For the first time, superannuation trustees are required to lodge audited financial reports for most superannuation funds with ASIC. Trustees will need to lodge within three months of the end of the fund&rsquo;s 2023-24 financial year.</p>
<p>ASIC reminds trustees that these reports must be lodged by the due date and in compliance with the relevant accounting standards. Superannuation funds will be included ASIC&rsquo;s financial reporting and audit surveillance program.</p>
<p>From 1 July 2023, fund auditors must comply with the audit obligations under Chapter 2M of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/C2004A00818/2023-10-20/text"><em>Corporations Act 2001</em></a>&nbsp;(Corporations Act). More information can be found on ASIC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-reporting-and-audit/auditors/registrable-superannuation-entity-audits/" title="Registrable superannuation entity audits">Registrable superannuation entity audits</a>&nbsp;page.</p>
<h3>Climate-related risks</h3>
<p>Directors are encouraged to engage closely with the Australian Government&rsquo;s proposed mandatory climate reporting reforms, which are proposed to apply to entities that are required to prepare financial reports under Chapter 2M of the Corporations Act.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Directors need to be aware of the impending developments in climate-reporting. The first tier of companies is proposed to report for financial years commencing from 1 January 2025. Directors and entities should start preparing and putting into place the necessary governance arrangements. They should consider what capabilities and data requirements may be needed,&rsquo; Ms O&rsquo;Rourke said.</p>
<p>In the meantime, entities with material climate-related risks should look to report voluntarily in line with the recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and ensure that any voluntary statements made are not misleading. ASIC is continuing to monitor market practice in relation to voluntary climate-related financial disclosures, which will inform future compliance programs and guidance.</p>
<h3>Consolidated entity disclosure statement requirement</h3>
<p>A reminder that recent changes to the Corporations Act require all listed and unlisted public companies to include a new &ldquo;consolidated entity disclosure statement&rdquo; in their financial reports. These changes are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2023 and will apply for the first time at 30 June 2024. The new disclosure statement requires details of all consolidated entities as at the end of the financial year &ndash; names, ownership interests, place of incorporation and tax residency.</p>
<h3>Review of auditors&rsquo; compliance with ethical and independence standards</h3>
<p>In addition to continuing our focus on financial reporting and audit, ASIC will review of how auditors are complying with auditor independence requirements in the&nbsp;<em>Corporations Act</em>, and ethical and independence requirements contained in the Australian Auditing Standards.</p>
<p>Audit firms were required to carry out and report an evaluation of their implementation of quality requirements under the ASQM1 framework by 15 December 2023.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Our initial observations on the firms&rsquo; implementation highlighted several areas for concern which span across risk, governance and compliance practices at audit firms,&rsquo; Ms O&rsquo;Rourke said.</p>
<p>These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>significant variability across the board as to how firms chose to implement the framework. We encourage firms to apply quality management requirements firm-wide instead of seeing the framework as a &lsquo;tick-box&rsquo; exercise in compliance,</li>
<li>in some cases, a lack of sophistication and suitability of tools used to manage quality. Better practice would be to establish dedicated quality management tools that align with requirements.</li>
<li>limited domestic guidance around how to measure and classify the severity of findings and deficiencies, and a lack of objectivity in assessments, and</li>
<li>examples of firms taking a hurried approach to remediation of findings and deficiencies to achieve a favourable conclusion before the reporting deadline. We urge firms to take the time necessary to roll-out considered and comprehensive action plans that adequately address the root cause and fully rectify the issues at hand.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;ASIC urges firms to be transparent in reporting to executive management and relevant committees around deficiencies and their associated action plans from a governance and oversight perspective. This includes communicating the original rating of a deficiency in addition to the point-in-time rating to ensure broader design gaps are being identified and systems operate as effectively as possible,&rsquo; Ms O&rsquo;Rourke said.</p>
<p>ASIC is in the process of scoping further work around systems of quality management work and we plan to undertake the review in the 2024-25 financial year.</p>

<title>Concurring Statement Of CFTC Commissioner Caroline D. Pham On Novel U.S. Location Test And FCM Registration</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/concurring-statement-of-cftc-commissioner-caroline-d-pham-on-novel-us-locatio/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Regulations, cross-border issues, extraterritoriality, CFTC, derivatives<br />
Summary:<br />Commission's overreach in creating a novel "U.S. location" test, conflicting with existing CFTC regulations, and lacking statutory authority. <div>
<p>I respectfully concur on&nbsp;<em>In re Falcon Labs Ltd.</em><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051424?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt1" id="fntref1" name="fntref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;because the cross-border issues raised in this matter re-open decades of settled Congressional intent and well-established Commission interpretation of the Commodity Exchange Act&rsquo;s (CEA) extraterritoriality and cross-border application to foreign futures and options transactions and the futures commission merchant (FCM) registration requirement, as well as to swaps activity outside the United States. These are cross-border issues that have vast implications for the over $700 trillion notional global derivatives market and the potential to disrupt legitimate activity of multinational trading firms and the end-users that depend on derivatives markets for hedging and risk management. I believe the Commission&rsquo;s unprecedented interpretation today in an administrative order constitutes a legislative rule that requires notice-and-comment rulemaking pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) because it may impose new CFTC registration and trading requirements on scores of non-U.S. legal entities.</p>
<p>The Commission has chosen to ignore its comprehensive cross-border regulatory regime established under Part 1<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051424?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt2" id="fntref2" name="fntref2">[2]</a>, Part 3<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051424?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt3" id="fntref3" name="fntref3">[3]</a>, Part 30<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051424?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt4" id="fntref4" name="fntref4">[4]</a>, Part 4<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051424?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt5" id="fntref5" name="fntref5">[5]</a>, and Part 23<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051424?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt6" id="fntref6" name="fntref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;of CFTC regulations in favor of spinning up a brand-new test for extraterritorial application of the CEA without any cited statutory authority. The Commission creates a novel &ldquo;U.S. location&rdquo; test to &ldquo;look through&rdquo; non-U.S. legal entities in the latest of a series of ultra vires precedents that undermines the legitimacy of the CFTC and the integrity of global derivatives markets.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051424?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt7" id="fntref7" name="fntref7">[7]</a></p>
<p>If the Commission is attempting to establish a new interpretation of the extraterritorial statutory authority in CEA Section 4 and a new FCM registration regime for foreign transactions, today&rsquo;s Order shockingly conflicts with the CFTC&rsquo;s nearly 40-year-old comprehensive rules for foreign futures and foreign options transactions set forth in Part 1 and Part 30.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051424?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt8" id="fntref8" name="fntref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;Any attempt to ignore the Commission&rsquo;s decades of regulations and interpretations in an effort to rewrite history creates nothing more than a legal fantasy and is a breathtaking overreach to seize jurisdiction over the entire world. The reason why the Commission has never before found this kind of violation against an intermediary is because the legal argument in today&rsquo;s Order is wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Novel &ldquo;U.S. Location&rdquo; Test for Non-U.S. Legal Entities</strong></p>
<p>In brief, the Commission finds that the basis for Respondent&rsquo;s (a non-U.S. legal entity organized and existing under the laws of the Seychelles) alleged violation of the FCM registration requirement<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051424?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt9" id="fntref9" name="fntref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;is that Respondent had customers &ldquo;located in the United States,&rdquo; &ldquo;such as non-U.S. incorporated entities operated and controlled by U.S.-based trading firms.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051424?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt10" id="fntref10" name="fntref10">[10]</a></p>
<p>To make this finding, the Order establishes factors to &ldquo;look through&rdquo; a non-U.S. legal entity and thus determine whether it is &ldquo;located in the United States,&rdquo; including: (1) location of ultimate beneficial owners, (2) location of corporate organization, (3) principal place of business, and (4) location of personnel controlling a non-U.S. prime broker sub-account. These criteria are not set forth in the CEA&rsquo;s statutory language, and the Order provides no legal authority to support these factors.</p>
<p>This novel &ldquo;U.S. location&rdquo; test could have the resulting effect of requiring any non-U.S. legal entity that transacts in futures, options, or swaps that has a U.S. parent entity or beneficial owner, or has personnel located in the U.S. that &ldquo;control&rdquo; (another undefined term with no cited statutory authority) a non-U.S. prime broker sub-account, to be deemed &ldquo;located in the United States&rdquo; even if its location of corporate organization is outside the United States and duly complies with the legal or regulatory obligations of the non-U.S. jurisdiction. In addition, at one fell swoop this test contravenes the entire body of treatment of a &ldquo;proprietary account&rdquo; under CFTC regulations including applicable exemptions from registration or other requirements.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051424?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt11" id="fntref11" name="fntref11">[11]</a></p>
<p>Let me be clear: in the past nearly 40 years since Congress amended the CEA to permit foreign transactions, the Commission has never interpreted or applied this novel &ldquo;U.S. location&rdquo; test. The proper legal analysis to determine the extraterritorial applicability of various sections of the CEA to a non-U.S. legal entity requires a sophisticated understanding of the CFTC cross-border regulatory regimes for, at a minimum, FCMs, CPOs, and swap dealers, as well as proprietary accounts.</p>
<p><em>Part 30 and FCMs</em></p>
<p>The Commission&rsquo;s novel &ldquo;U.S. location test&rdquo; conflicts with the CFTC&rsquo;s comprehensive regulatory regime for foreign futures and foreign options transactions, including definitions and registration requirements, set forth in Part 1 and Part 30 that was first promulgated in 1987 and the associated voluminous administrative record of the Commission&rsquo;s interpretation of &ldquo;located in the United States, its territories or possessions&rdquo; in the many rulemakings amending Part 1, Part 30, and other associated regulations since then. Moreover, the Commission&rsquo;s determination of a new look-through test for a non-U.S. legal entity that may be an FCM customer is impermissible in an administrative settlement order because it may impose new CFTC FCM registration requirements on non-U.S. brokers, which can only be promulgated through APA notice-and-comment rulemaking.</p>
<p><em>Part 4 and CPOs; Part 23 and swap dealers</em></p>
<p>Similarly, this novel &ldquo;U.S. location&rdquo; test would also conflict with the Commission&rsquo;s comprehensive regulatory regime and voluminous administrative record of interpretations for cross-border application to commodity pool operators (CPO) and commodity trading advisors (CTA) set forth in Part 4 since 1981, and to swap dealers and major swap participants (MSP) set forth in Part 23 since 2012.</p>
<p>In fact, the Commission most recently established clear interpretations of the application of CFTC registration requirements to non-U.S. legal entities engaged in the activity of a CPO in its 2020 final rule, Exemption from Registration for Certain Foreign Intermediaries, including whether clearing through a registered FCM is required as a condition of the exemption.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051424?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt12" id="fntref12" name="fntref12">[12]</a></p>
<p>The Commission also recently established clear interpretations for swap activities outside the United States in its 2020 final rule, Cross-Border Application of the Registration Thresholds and Certain Requirements Applicable to Swap Dealers and Major Swap Participants, including an interpretation of CEA Section 2(i) and the CFTC&rsquo;s extraterritorial jurisdiction, and definitions and tests for &ldquo;U.S. person,&rdquo; &ldquo;non-U.S. person,&rdquo; &ldquo;United States,&rdquo; and &ldquo;U.S.,&rdquo; all solely for purposes of Regulation 23.23, and not for any other CFTC regulations including those applicable to FCMs.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051424?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt13" id="fntref13" name="fntref13">[13]</a></p>
<p>I am astounded that the Commission would simply pretend these recent cross-border rulemakings did not exist.</p>
<p><em>Principal place of business for federal diversity jurisdiction</em></p>
<p>Further, the &ldquo;principal place of business&rdquo; prong of this novel &ldquo;U.S. location&rdquo; test appears to be rooted in the conflation of diversity jurisdiction in U.S. federal courts under the Federal Code of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C. 1332(c)(1),<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051424?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt14" id="fntref14" name="fntref14">[14]</a>&nbsp;and the Commission&rsquo;s extraterritorial jurisdiction under the CEA. The case law on federal diversity jurisdiction&nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">only</span></strong>&nbsp;addresses the question of citizenship for a corporation in order to determine whether a complaint may be filed in U.S. federal court.</p>
<p>However, although the CFTC may sue a foreign party in U.S. federal court, that does not mean that the CFTC can apply a &ldquo;principal place of business&rdquo; analysis that is confined to the question of federal diversity jurisdiction, to the question whether specific provisions of the CEA apply extraterritorially to activities conducted by non-U.S. legal entities or activities conducted outside the United States. This basic conflation of foundational legal doctrines regarding federal diversity jurisdiction with the Commission&rsquo;s extraterritorial jurisdiction does not make sense.</p>
<p>In addition, the administrative record for Part 30 and FCMs does not support a &ldquo;principal place of business&rdquo; analysis based on federal diversity jurisdiction case law, and is directly on point to the cross-border issues raised in today&rsquo;s Order. In the preamble to the 1987 final rule on Foreign Futures and Foreign Options Transactions, the Commission noted that the then-new Part 30 to its regulations would &ldquo;govern the domestic offer and sale of futures and options entered into on or subject to the rules of a foreign board of trade.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051424?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt15" id="fntref15" name="fntref15">[15]</a>&nbsp;The Commission then refers to &ldquo;foreign futures and options transactions undertaken by U.S. domiciliaries&rdquo; and notes &ldquo;Congress&rsquo; intent that foreign futures and options products sold in the U.S. be subject to regulatory safeguards comparable to those applicable to domestic transactions.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051424?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt16" id="fntref16" name="fntref16">[16]</a>&nbsp;Taken together, it is clear that the dispositive fact is the physical location of the offer or sale of the futures transaction by a broker, evident from words such as &ldquo;in&rdquo; or &ldquo;outside,&rdquo; &ldquo;domestic&rdquo; or &ldquo;foreign,&rdquo; and, most tellingly, the phrase &ldquo;sold in the U.S.&rdquo; to express Congress&rsquo; legislative intent with respect to CEA Section 4&rsquo;s statutory language &ldquo;located in the United States, its territories or possessions.&rdquo; This approach is not only the Commission&rsquo;s historical and well-understood interpretation up until today&rsquo;s Order, but it is also consistent with the extraterritorial application of U.S. securities laws that many of the CEA&rsquo;s provisions are modeled on. And, the Commission&rsquo;s reference to &ldquo;U.S. domiciliaries&rdquo; indicates, if anything, that the appropriate analysis for a non-U.S. legal entity would be more akin to interpretations set forth under the Internal Revenue Code and other U.S. taxation laws and regulations.</p>
<p>For all these reasons, the Order&rsquo;s creation of a &ldquo;principal place of business&rdquo; extraterritorial standard based on divining the &ldquo;citizenship&rdquo; of a corporation [or other business organization] has no statutory authority in the CEA, and is nothing more than an attempt to re-litigate the well-settled Congressional intent and the Commission&rsquo;s interpretations of its extraterritorial jurisdiction and the cross-border applicability of the CEA. Moreover, CEA Section 4 has a &ldquo;clear statement of extraterritorial effect,&rdquo; as do various other sections of the CEA, and the Commission has accordingly established a comprehensive regulatory regime over all its categories of registrants that interprets the CEA&rsquo;s &ldquo;extraterritorial effect.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051424?utm_source=govdelivery#fnt17" id="fntref17" name="fntref17">[17]</a>&nbsp;There is no gap to be filled.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>As a final point on another threshold matter, I do not understand why the Commission unnecessarily engages in imaginative and incorrect extraterritorial application of the CEA and CFTC regulations. The Order&rsquo;s alleged charge of failure to register as an FCM is supported by allegations that Respondent&rsquo;s sales personnel were physically located in the United States and, therefore, were presumably engaged in the offer or sale of futures transactions (even if foreign futures transactions) physically&nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">in</span></strong>&nbsp;the United States. These allegations would also satisfy the domestic conduct requirement in&nbsp;<em>Morrison v. National Australia Bank</em>, if applicable. Because this is the appropriate and more direct basis for finding a violation of the FCM registration requirement against Respondent, I concur in this matter.</p>
<p>It is unwarranted to apply a novel &lsquo;&ldquo;U.S. location&rdquo; test to &ldquo;look through&rdquo; a non-U.S. legal entity to determine that it is a U.S.-located FCM customer for purposes of the Order&rsquo;s alleged charge of failure to register as an FCM. This sea change in interpretation cannot be done in an administrative settlement order, but must be carefully deliberated upon by the Commission with sufficient administrative record and rational basis to support a finding of reasoned decision-making by the Commission upon judicial review by an U.S. appellate court. The Commission must avoid establishing precedent in its administrative orders that has no cited statutory authority, conflicts with comprehensive CFTC regulations for cross-border activity, and disrupts the Commission&rsquo;s well-established interpretation of its extraterritorial jurisdiction.</p>

<div> banking system, supervision, regulatory activities, liquidity, capital<br />
Summary:<br />
The testimony discusses the soundness of the banking system, supervisory activities, and recent regulatory proposals, including liquidity, long-term debt, and capital requirements. <div>
<p>Chairman McHenry, Ranking Member Waters, and other members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify on the Federal Reserve's supervisory and regulatory activities. Accompanying my testimony is the Federal Reserve's semiannual&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/supervision-and-regulation-report.htm">Supervision and Regulation Report</a>. Today, I will discuss current conditions in the banking sector, supervisory activities, and some of our recent regulatory proposals.</p>
<p><strong>Banking Conditions</strong><br />Overall, the banking system remains sound and resilient. Banks continue to report capital and liquidity ratios above minimum regulatory levels. Overall asset quality remains generally sound. Lending continues to grow but has slowed from the rapid pace of 2022, reflecting decreased demand and tighter lending standards.</p>
<p>Capital ratios increased throughout 2023, leaving the system better positioned to weather potential losses, such as those from defaults on loans, or declines in the fair value of investment securities, which continued to accumulate at some banks this past year.</p>
<p>Liquidity conditions overall are stable. Notably, liquid assets on bank balance sheets remained above their 10-year average throughout 2023, largely the result of a significant buildup in cash positions. Aggregate deposits were generally stable in the second half of 2023 and have been steadily increasing in the first three months of 2024, reaching a level not seen since before the stress of March of last year. Additionally, there has been a decrease in the share of uninsured deposits in the system.</p>
<p>However, both supervisors and banks must remain vigilant and ready for expected and unexpected stresses, and presently there are several risks we are monitoring. For example, delinquency rates are rising among certain commercial real estate (CRE) loans, such as those backed by offices, and some consumer loan sectors. CRE delinquencies are now at a five-year high. Credit card and auto loan delinquencies have been rising. In response to rising delinquencies, banks have increased loan loss provisions. On this basis, combined with their capital positions, the banking sector as a whole should be prepared to absorb loan losses that may materialize and continue fulfilling its vital role providing credit to households and businesses. The Federal Reserve continues to monitor these conditions closely.</p>
<p>The recovery from the acute stress experienced in March of last year is in no small part due to the success of the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP). This program was established shortly after the failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) to help assure the stability of the banking system and to support the economy. The BTFP helped to alleviate liquidity pressures, particularly for banks that had experienced significant declines in the value of securities. The BTFP ceased making new loans as scheduled in March without any related liquidity stress in the banking system.</p>
<p><strong>Supervision</strong><br />It has been a little over a year since the sudden failure of SVB and ensuing stress in the banking system&mdash;events which prompted questions about how banks manage risks and how we at the Federal Reserve and other agencies supervise that risk-taking. As noted in my testimonies last year, these events highlighted the need to improve the speed, force, and agility of supervision to align better with the risks, size, and complexity of supervised banks, as appropriate.</p>
<p>As the banking system changes, supervision must adapt with it and appropriately account for banks of different sizes and levels of complexity. Risks can materialize quickly and come from various sources, and in March of last year, we saw that these risks can lead to failure more quickly than ever. Therefore, supervisors must take timely action as risks build up; deploy supervisory tools and escalation effectively; account for changes in market, economic, and financial conditions in their examination priorities and supervisory conclusions; and identify new and different patterns of risks. We have been making progress on these goals.</p>
<p>First, we are working to ensure supervision intensifies at the right pace as a bank grows in size and complexity. This involves more frequently assessing the condition, strategy, and risk management of large and complex banking organizations and engaging more frequently with these firms through the supervisory process. Additionally, supervisors are encouraging growing regional banking organizations to enhance their risk capabilities commensurately with their risk profiles so that the transition to higher standards is more of a gradual slope rather than a cliff.</p>
<p>Second, we are modifying supervisory processes so that once issues are identified, they are addressed more quickly by both banks and supervisors. For example, examiners have been conducting additional supervisory activities for firms with large unrealized losses on securities, high CRE exposures, or other material vulnerabilities. Where weaknesses in risk management have been identified, examiners are requiring firms to address these weaknesses promptly and encouraging them to bolster their capital and liquidity positions.</p>
<p>Third, we are finding ways to better incorporate forward-looking analysis into supervision. A forward-looking view supports the goal of identifying and addressing material risks before they become serious issues. Forward-looking risk analysis also may help to challenge supervisory assessments and foster meaningful action where risks are underappreciated.</p>
<p><strong>Regulation</strong><br />The lessons learned from SVB are not only applicable to our supervisory framework. Certain aspects of the failure showed that enhancements to our regulatory framework would benefit the safety and soundness of our banking system.</p>
<p><strong>Long-Term Debt</strong><br />One of these enhancements was already in process several months before SVB's failure through an advance notice of proposed rulemaking&mdash;expanding the application of long-term debt requirements to additional large banks. Subsequently, the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (collectively, the agencies) followed up with a proposed rule calibrated to reflect the lower risk profiles of such banks as compared to the largest and most complex. The proposal would increase the options available within the resolution process and enhance financial stability. Losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund related to the bank failures last year could have been mitigated in part by the proposed requirements. We are going through comments we received on this proposal carefully.</p>
<p><strong>Liquidity</strong><br />Another important area is liquidity risk management. A striking feature of last year's bank stress was that SVB, Signature Bank, and First Republic struggled to cope with unprecedented deposit outflows arising from a loss of confidence by their uninsured depositors. Other banks that experienced spillovers during this period struggled with insufficiently robust liquidity risk management. Banks found it difficult to monetize their held-to-maturity securities through repo transactions under severe stress and were not adequately prepared to utilize the Federal Reserve's discount window. Additionally, the stress revealed that some forms of deposits&mdash;such as those from venture capital firms, high-net-worth individuals, crypto firms, and others&mdash;may be more prone to faster runs than previously assumed. We are exploring targeted adjustments to our regulatory framework that would address each of these concerns: deposit outflows, held-to-maturity monetization, and discount window preparedness.</p>
<p><strong>Discount Window Operations</strong><br />Discount window preparedness is essential. The Federal Reserve's lending to banks through the discount window plays an important role in supporting the liquidity and stability of the banking system and the effective implementation of monetary policy. By providing ready access to funding, the discount window helps depository institutions manage their liquidity risks. Providing liquidity in this way is one of the original purposes of the Federal Reserve System. It is important that we continue to work to improve this tool. To that end, we are reaching out to a wide range of depository institutions of all sizes to learn from their experiences with the discount window. From this outreach, we will identify and prioritize changes to operations that can improve the efficacy of our liquidity provision.</p>
<p><strong>Capital</strong><br />A safe and sound banking system is critical to a healthy economy, and capital is foundational to safety and soundness. Well-capitalized banks have more capacity to support the economy by continuing to lend to households and businesses through stressful conditions. A well-capitalized banking system reduces the probability that stressful conditions result in financial crises, which inflict devastating economic costs and suffering for families and businesses all across the country. Strong capital also reduces the risk that the government would need to intervene in unusual and exigent circumstances.</p>
<p>This brings me to the agencies' proposal to enhance capital requirements. Since my last testimony, we have received numerous and meaningful comments on the proposal. We also received additional data from a special data collection. We are closely analyzing this information, and I expect we will have a set of broad, material changes to the proposal that allow us to have a broad consensus in moving the proposal forward. The changes will enable us to have a safer financial system that better serves American households and businesses.</p>
<p>Thank you. I am happy to take your questions.</p>

<div> SEC, charges, investment adviser, fiduciary duties, conflicts of interest
Summary:
SEC charges Hudson Valley Wealth Management and founder for failing to disclose conflicts of interest and making misleading statements to clients, violating fiduciary duties. Paid penalties and disgorgement. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced settled charges against New York-based registered investment adviser Hudson Valley Wealth Management Inc. and its founder, Christopher Conover, for breaching their fiduciary duties by failing to disclose conflicts of interest and making misleading statements to their clients. To settle the charges, Hudson Valley agreed to pay a civil penalty of $200,000, and Conover agreed to pay more than $600,000 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and a $150,000 civil penalty.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s order, between September 2017 and October 2021, Hudson Valley and Conover advised a private investment fund and their individual clients to make investments in films produced by a particular film production company. At the same time, Conover, through his affiliated company, received approximately $530,000 from the production company in exchange for the money that the investment fund and the individual clients invested in these same films. Hudson Valley and Conover initially failed to disclose these payments to the clients and then later misrepresented that Conover earned this compensation for work as an executive producer on these films.</p>
<p>In addition, the SEC&rsquo;s order finds that, in May 2021, Hudson Valley and Conover satisfied a redemption request from one fund investor but did not satisfy several redemption requests submitted at the same time by other fund investors who were Hudson Valley advisory clients. By preferencing one investor&rsquo;s redemption request over other client redemption requests, Hudson Valley and Conover violated their fiduciary duties to the other clients.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fully and fairly disclosing conflicts of interest are at the heart of an investment adviser&rsquo;s fiduciary duty,&rdquo; said Andrew Dean, Co-Chief of the Enforcement Division&rsquo;s Asset Management Unit. &ldquo;Investors must have confidence that their investment advisers are treating them fairly and acting in their best interest when investing their funds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s order finds that Hudson Valley and Conover violated the antifraud provisions of Sections 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder. In addition to disgorgement and penalties, Hudson Valley and Conover agreed to cease-and-desist orders and censures.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Brian Kudon of the Division of Enforcement&rsquo;s Asset Management Unit and David Zetlin-Jones and Hermann Vargas of the New York Regional Office, with assistance from Kerri Palen and James Addison, also of the New York Regional Office. The investigation was supervised by Lee A. Greenwood, and Mr. Dean of the Asset Management Unit, and Sandeep Satwalekar and Antonia Apps of the New York Regional Office.</p>

<div> enforcement, action, fraud, cattle, scheme
<br />
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission filed a civil enforcement action against Agridime LLC and its co-founders for defrauding customers in a cattle investment scheme.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced it filed a civil enforcement action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas against&nbsp;Agridime LLC,&nbsp;a Texas corporation,&nbsp;and&nbsp;its co-founders,&nbsp;Joshua Link&nbsp;of Gilbert, Arizona&nbsp;and&nbsp;Jed Wood&nbsp;of Ft. Worth, Texas.</p>
<p>The complaint alleges the defendants engaged in a scheme to defraud thousands of customers in at least 14 states by soliciting, accepting, and using customers&rsquo; funds to pay undisclosed commissions and used later customers' funds to pay profits to earlier customers, in the manner of a Ponzi scheme, rather than for the purposes Agridime represented those funds would be used.&nbsp;Agridime claimed the funds would be used in connection with contracts of sale of a commodity in interstate commerce (i.e., the customer&rsquo;s purchase of cattle). As alleged in the CFTC&rsquo;s complaint, upon information and belief, from approximately 2021 until December 2023, the defendants received more than $161 million from over 2,000 customers.</p>
<p>In its continuing litigation against the defendants, the CFTC seeks restitution to defrauded customers, civil monetary penalties, trading bans, and a permanent injunction against further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC regulations.</p>
<p>Case Background</p>
<p>As alleged in the complaint, Agridime operated an online platform that purportedly allowed customers to buy and sell cattle and pitched victims with the prospect of guaranteed annual rates of return between at least 15% and 20%. As advertised, Agridime&rsquo;s cattle purchase program afforded customers the opportunity to buy and sell cattle without the actual day-to-day care of the cattle, or as Agridime stated in solicitation materials, purchasers of livestock would &ldquo;make money raising cattle without having to do all the work.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As further alleged in the Agridime cattle program, customers supposedly bought cattle, typically for $2,000 a head, and Agridime was to handle the feeding and care of the cattle, via farmers with whom Agridime partnered, until the cattle were ready to be processed and the beef sold.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As alleged in the complaint, Agridime represented the customers&rsquo; funds would be used only for the purchase, raising, and feeding of the purchased cattle. Instead, because Agridime did not buy the number of cattle required to fulfill its obligations under the livestock contracts, Agridime had to use recent customers&rsquo; funds to pay the guaranteed profits of earlier customers. In addition, as further alleged, upon information and belief, customers&rsquo; funds were also used to pay approximately $11&nbsp;million in undisclosed commissions to Agridime personnel, including to Link, his wife, and Wood.<span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The Division of Enforcement (DOE) thanks the Arizona Corporation Commission, Securities Division, and the Securities and Exchange Commission for their assistance in this matter.</p>
<p>The DOE staff responsible for this case are Janine Gargiulo, Nicole Buseman, Judith M. Slowly, Trevor Kokal, David W. MacGregor, Lenel Hickson, Jr., and Manal M. Sultan.</p>
<p>* * * * * *</p>
<p>CFTC&rsquo;s Fraud Advisories</p>

<div> default judgment, fraud, forex, CFTC, restitution <br />
Summary: The CFTC obtained default judgments against nine defendants for forex fraud, ordering restitution and penalties. It warns the public about forex scams and urges reporting of suspicious activities. <div>
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced the Honorable Darrin P. Gayles of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida issued an order of default judgment against four individuals and five companies (nine defendants):&nbsp;Jase Davis&nbsp;of Brandon, Mississippi;&nbsp;Borys Konovalenko&nbsp;of Ukraine;&nbsp;Anna Shymko&nbsp;of Duluth, Georgia;&nbsp;Alla Skala&nbsp;of Grand Island, New York and/or Fort Erie, Canada;&nbsp;Easy Com LLC d/b/a ROFX, a New Hampshire LLC;&nbsp;Global E-Advantages LLC a/k/a&nbsp;Kickmagic LLC d/b/a ROFX, a Delaware LLC and New York foreign LLC;&nbsp;Grovee LLC d/b/a ROFX, a Delaware LLC;&nbsp;Notus LLC d/b/a ROFX, a dissolved Colorado LLC; and&nbsp;Shopostar LLC d/b/a ROFX, a&nbsp;Colorado LLC.</p>
<p>The default judgment order stems from the CFTC&rsquo;s August 31, 2022 amended complaint charging the nine defendants and defendant&nbsp;Timothy F. Stubbs&nbsp;with fraud, misappropriation, and registration violations in connection with a fraudulent foreign currency (forex) scheme. [See CFTC Press Release Nos.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8486-22">8486-22</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8486-22">8790-23</a>.]</p>
<p>The default judgment order, issued April 22 finds the nine defendants liable for all violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC regulations alleged in the amended complaint, including fraud involving forex transactions which resulted in the misappropriation of over $57 million of customer funds. Under the terms of the default judgment order, the nine defendants are required to pay jointly and severally over $56 million in restitution to defrauded customers and a $169,086,837 civil monetary penalty. The default judgment order also permanently enjoins them from engaging in conduct that violates the CEA, as charged, and permanently bans them from registering with the CFTC and from trading in any CFTC-regulated markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On May 8, the court also issued a supplemental consent order against the remaining defendant, Timothy F. Stubbs, a certified public accountant and resident of Atlanta, Georgia. The supplemental consent order requires Stubbs to pay a $314,000 civil monetary penalty and $153,000 in restitution. Previously, on December 19, 2023, the court entered an initial&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/media/10666/enftimothyfstubbsconsentorder121923/download">consent order of permanent injunction</a>&nbsp;against Stubbs. The initial consent order finds Stubbs engaged in fraud and participated in the common enterprise through his control and operation of Grovee LLC, including accepting and misappropriating customer funds intended for forex trading. The initial consent order imposes a permanent injunction and permanent trading, solicitation, and registration bans against Stubbs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The default judgment order against the nine defendants and supplemental consent order against Stubbs resolve the CFTC&rsquo;s lawsuit against all of the defendants.</p>
<p>Case Background</p>
<p>The default judgment order against the nine defendants and initial consent order against Stubbs both find from January 2018 through September 2021, the five companies, acting as a common enterprise under the control of the five individual defendants, used the ROFX.net website to fraudulently solicit and misappropriate at least $57.5 million from U.S. and international customers for purported trading in forex. The defendants obtained customers through the ROFX website, wherein ROFX falsely claimed to trade forex utilizing a highly successful automated trading robot with guaranteed coverage of losses. The default judgment order and consent order also find the defendants misappropriated all of the customer funds they accepted into the defendant companies&rsquo; bank accounts by wiring the funds to offshore entities with no connection to forex trading and to the individual defendants&rsquo; personal accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to their misrepresentations and misappropriation, the default judgment order and consent order find the five companies acted as futures commission merchants by doing business as ROFX, soliciting or accepting orders for retail forex transactions via the ROFX website, and accepting funds in or in connection with such transactions without being registered with the CFTC.</p>
<p>The CFTC acknowledges and thanks the Alabama Securities Commission, Mississippi Secretary of State&rsquo;s Office (Securities Division), Rankin County (Mississippi) Sheriff&rsquo;s Office, and Oregon Division of Financial Regulation for their assistance in this matter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this case are Danielle Karst, Timothy J. Mulreany, George H. Malas, Kelly Makimoto-Murphy, Chrystal Gonnella, and Paul G. Hayeck.</p>
<p>CFTC&rsquo;s Forex Fraud Advisory</p>
<p>The CFTC has issued several customer protection&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/index.htm">Fraud Advisories and Articles</a>&nbsp;that provide the warning signs of fraud, including the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/ConsumerProtection/FraudAwarenessPrevention/CFTCFraudAdvisories/fraudadv_forex.html">Foreign Currency Trading (Forex) Fraud Advisory</a>, which alerts customers to forex fraud and lists simple ways to spot forex scams.</p>
<p>The CFTC also strongly urges the public to verify a company&rsquo;s registration with the CFTC before committing funds.&nbsp; If unregistered, a customer should be wary of providing funds to that company.&nbsp; A company&rsquo;s registration status can be found using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nfa.futures.org/basicnet/">NFA BASIC</a>.</p>

<p align="justify"><span>Euronext announced on 29 March 2024 that it has entered into an agreement to acquire 75% of the share capital of Global Rate Set Systems (GRSS).</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>GRSS is a leading and highly respected provider of services to benchmark administrators. GRSS is a mission-critical service provider to the benchmark administrators that notably produce three of Europe&rsquo;s critical interest rate benchmarks: EURIBOR&reg;, STIBOR&reg; and NIBOR&reg;.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>The acquisition of GRSS contributes to the growth of Euronext&rsquo;s fixed and subscription-based revenue. This acquisition further diversifies and strengthens Euronext&rsquo;s index franchise, positioning the Group as a leading player for calculating and administrating Interbank Offered Rate (IBOR) indices. In partnership with GRSS management and its founder, Euronext aims to reinforce the positioning of GRSS to become the go-to provider in the contributed data and indices space, leveraging on Euronext&rsquo;s global leadership and recognition.</span><br /><br /></p>

<p align="justify"><span>In April 2024, Euronext announced the successful launch of Euronext Mid-Point Match across all its European markets, its advanced suite of dark, mid-point and sweep functionalities embedded within Euronext's Central Order Book. These enhancements allow trading members and buy-side firms to trade at the real mid-point, without incurring implicit latency costs, to access increased liquidity, while tapping into Euronext&rsquo;s unique pool of liquidity fostered by local brokers and investors.</span><br /><br /></p>

<li><span><strong>St&eacute;phane Boujnah, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext, said:</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify"><span><em>&ldquo;In the first quarter of 2024, Euronext reached record revenue and income of &euro;401.9 million. Strong organic growth in our non-volume related businesses, combined with record quarter in fixed income and power trading and double-digit growth in our post-trade activities, drove the Group revenue's growth to +8.0%.</em></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span><em>Combined with our trademark cost discipline in an inflationary environment, this record performance led to a +15.0% increase in adjusted EBITDA, to &euro;251.3 million, and to a 62.5% adjusted EBITDA margin.</em></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span><em>Our reported net profit grew +44.8% to &euro;139.7 million as a result of this strong performance and of the positive base effect of the provision related to the termination fee of the clearing agreement in Q1 2023. Adjusted net profit grew +11.7% to &euro;164.2 million, and adjusted EPS reached &euro;1.58, representing a +15.0% increase from last year.</em></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span><em>We continued to work on the delivery of our &lsquo;Growth for Impact 2024&rsquo; strategic plan and we reached &euro;79 million of cumulated run-rate EBITDA synergies in relation with the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group at the end of the first quarter of 2024. We have successfully completed in March the migration of Italian derivatives trading to Optiq&reg;, the third and final phase in the migration process of Borsa Italiana's markets onto Euronext&rsquo;s proprietary trading platform. The final step of the integration will be delivered in the third quarter of 2024 when we will expand the operations of Euronext Clearing to Euronext European listed derivatives to complete our presence on the entire trading value chain. This milestone will be the final step to reaching the targeted &euro;115 million of run-rate EBITDA synergies by the end of 2024.</em></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span><em>We strengthened and broadened our data and indices offering with the acquisition of Global Rate Set Systems (GRSS). GRSS is a leading provider of services to benchmark administrators and has a strong track record of continued revenue growth and high-quality service. We are glad to welcome the GRSS teams, to work together to take GRSS to the next step and further globally expand Euronext&rsquo;s index capabilities. Meanwhile we continue to work actively on the preparation of our 2024 Capital Market Day that will be take place on 8 November 2024 in Paris.&rdquo;</em></span></p>

</ul>
<p align="justify"><span>In Q1 2024, Euronext&rsquo;s revenue and income amounted to &euro;401.9 million, up +8.0% compared to Q1 2023, driven by the strong performance of post-trade activities, resulting from the positive contribution of the Euronext Clearing European expansion at the end of November 2023, record performance in fixed income and power trading, as well as solid organic growth in non-volume related businesses.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>On a like-for-like basis and at constant currencies, Euronext revenue and income was up +8.5% in Q1 2024 compared to Q1 2023.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>Non-volume related revenue accounted for 58% of Group revenue in Q1 2024, stable compared to Q1 2023, reflecting continued strong performance of non-volume-related revenue and strong growth in fixed income and power trading as well volume-related clearing activity. The&nbsp;underlying operating expenses excluding D&amp;A coverage by non-volume related revenue ratio was at 155% in Q1 2024, compared to 141% in Q1 2023.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><span><strong>Q1 2024 adjusted EBITDA</strong></span><br /><br /></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify"><span>Underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation decreased by -2.0% to &euro;150.7 million, reflecting continued cost discipline in an inflationary environment and the release of some costs provisions. On a like-for-like basis, underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation decreased by -1.6% compared to Q1 2023.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>Consequently, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter totalled &euro;251.3 million, up +15.0% compared to Q1 2023. This represents an adjusted EBITDA margin of 62.5%, up +3.8 points compared to Q1 2023. On a like-for-like basis, adjusted EBITDA for Q1 2024 was up +15.4%, and adjusted EBITDA margin was up +3.8 points compared to the same perimeter in Q1 2023.</span></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><span><strong>Q1 2024 net income, share of the parent company shareholders</strong></span><br /><br /></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify"><span>Depreciation and amortisation accounted for &euro;44.0 million in Q1 2024, +8.6% more than in Q1 2023 due to ongoing migration projects. PPA related to acquired businesses accounted for &euro;20.2 million and is included in depreciation and amortisation.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>Adjusted operating profit was &euro;232.3 million, up +15.6% compared to Q1 2023. On a like-for-like basis, adjusted operating profit was up +16.1% compared to Q1 2023.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>&euro;33.7 million of non-underlying expenses, including depreciation and amortisation, were reported in Q1 2024, related to the implementation of the &lsquo;Growth for Impact 2024&rsquo; strategic plan and the PPA of acquired businesses.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>Net financing income for Q1 2024 was &euro;4.7 million, compared to a net financing expense of &euro;4.5 million in Q1 2023. This results from higher interest income due to higher interest rates, offsetting the cost of debt.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>No result from equity investments was recorded in Q1 2024. As a reminder, in Q1 2023, Euronext reported &euro;8.4 million in results from equity investments, reflecting a dividend payment by Sicovam and the contribution from LCH SA.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>Income tax for Q1 2024 was &euro;54.7 million. This translated into an effective tax rate of 26.9% for the quarter, compared to 24.5% in Q1 2023.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>Share of non-controlling interests mainly relating to the Borsa Italiana Group and Nord Pool amounted to &euro;8.9&nbsp;million in Q1 2024.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>As a result, the reported net income, share of the parent company shareholders, increased by +44.8% for Q1 2024 compared to Q1 2023, to &euro;139.7 million. This represents a reported EPS of &euro;1.35 basic and &euro;1.34 diluted in Q1 2024, compared to &euro;0.90 basic and &euro;0.90 diluted in Q1 2023. Adjusted net income, share of the parent company shareholders was up +11.7% to &euro;164.2 million. Adjusted EPS (basic) was up +15.0% in Q1 2024, at &euro;1.58 per share, compared to an adjusted EPS (basic) of &euro;1.38 per share in Q1 2023. This increase reflects higher profit and a lower number of outstanding shares over the first quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2023.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>The weighted number of shares used over the first quarter of 2024 was 103,640,164 for the basic calculation and 104,040,256 for the diluted calculation, compared to 106,726,832 and 106,991,437 respectively over the first quarter of 2023.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>In Q1 2024, Euronext reported a net cash flow from operating activities of &euro;184.6 million, compared to &euro;318.2 million in Q1 2023, reflecting significantly lower negative changes in working capital from CCP activities at Euronext Clearing. Excluding the impact on working capital from Euronext Clearing and Nord Pool CCP activities, net cash flow from operating activities accounted for 68.6% of EBITDA in Q1 2024.</span></p>

<li><span><strong>Acquisition of Global Rate Set Systems to strengthen Euronext index franchise</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify"><span>On 29 March 2024, Euronext announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire 75% of the share capital of Global Rate Set Systems (GRSS), a leading provider of services to benchmark administrators. This acquisition significantly strengthens the Euronext index franchise adding very strong capabilities in contributed data indices and data from a highly respected provider.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>Founded in 2009 and headquartered in New Zealand, GRSS is a mission-critical service provider to the benchmark administrators that produce three of Europe&rsquo;s critical interest rate benchmarks: EURIBOR&reg; (global, the world&rsquo;s largest benchmark), STIBOR&reg; (Sweden) and NIBOR&reg; (Norway). GRSS also owns and operates two regulated benchmark administrators that produce CIBOR&reg; (Denmark) and PRIBOR (Czech Republic), and a benchmark administrator that produces the TAB, TADO and ICP indices (Chile). GRSS provides a complete solution for developing, operating, and monetising benchmarks, indices, and other forms of regulated or unregulated market data.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>The acquisition of GRSS further diversifies and strengthens Euronext&rsquo;s index franchise, positioning the Group as a leading player for calculating and administrating Interbank Offered Rate (IBOR) indices. In partnership with GRSS management and its founder, Euronext aims to reinforce the positioning of GRSS to become the go-to provider in the contributed data and indices space, leveraging on Euronext&rsquo;s global leadership and recognition. This acquisition contributes to the growth of Euronext&rsquo;s fixed and subscription-based revenue.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>The transaction complies with Euronext capital allocation policy, with a ROCE expected to exceed WACC between years three to five after closing. The completion of the transaction is expected in Q2 2024 and is subject to the usual regulatory approvals.</span></p>

<li><span><strong>Successful completion of the migration of Borsa Italiana to the Optiq&reg; trading platform</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify"><span>On 3 April 2024, Euronext announced the successful completion of the migration of Italian derivatives trading to Optiq&reg;, the third and final phase in the migration process of Borsa Italiana's markets onto Euronext&rsquo;s state-of-the-art, proprietary trading platform Optiq&reg; on 25 March 2024. This migration was the last in the ambitious integration plan of Italian markets onto the Euronext single trading platform, and was completed less than three years after the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>The migration of Borsa Italiana to Optiq&reg; has been conducted with the ultimate objective of maximising the reciprocal benefits of Euronext the harmonisation process and minimising disruption for the Italian markets and other markets in the Group.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>This key achievement of the &ldquo;Growth for Impact 2024&rdquo; strategic plan in 2024 is core to Euronext&rsquo;s ambition to build a single liquidity pool, powered by a single technology platform across its markets. The seamless integration of Borsa Italiana&rsquo;s markets onto the Optiq&reg; platform ensures a harmonised trading environment and streamlined access to a full suite of services for investors and issuers alike. This convergence enhances market efficiency and reinforces Euronext's position as the leading listing and trading venue in Europe.</span>&nbsp;<span>The completion of the transaction is expected in Q2 2024 and is subject to the usual regulatory approvals.</span></p>

<li><span><strong>Successful launch of Euronext Mid-Point Match offering dark, mid-point and sweep functionalities</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify"><span>On 14 April 2024, Euronext announced the successful launch of Euronext Mid-Point Match, its advanced suite of dark, mid-point and sweep functionalities embedded within Euronext's Central Order Book. These enhancements allow trading members and buy-side firms to trade at the real mid-point, without incurring implicit latency costs, to access increased liquidity, while tapping into Euronext&rsquo;s unique pool of liquidity fostered by local brokers and investors. First introduced on the Brussels market on 18 March 2024, Euronext Mid-Point Match was launched across all Euronext markets on 8 April 2024.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>Euronext Mid-Point Match offers a sweep functionality, allowing intermediaries to leverage both Euronext&rsquo;s dark and lit liquidity pools, to increase execution opportunities and flexibility across Euronext seven regulated markets. Dark orders in Euronext Mid-Point Match are pegged to the real-time mid-point of the Euronext Primary Best Bid and Offer, and provide traders with accurate execution opportunities. This results in lower market impact compared to London-based Multilateral Trading Facilities, which typically exhibit a 7-8 millisecond delay in displaying the Primary mid-point. Furthermore, dark-to-lit sweep orders interact seamlessly with the Euronext Central Order Book with zero latency, facilitating swift and efficient execution.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>Under the Reference Price Waiver for small trades and Large In Scale Waiver for block trades, investors benefit from flexibility in their execution strategies.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>To safeguard execution quality, Euronext Mid-Point Match offers Minimum Acceptable Quantity and Minimum Execution Size features, providing traders with additional control over their orders.</span></p>

<li><span><strong>Euronext Securities rolls-out a harmonised corporate actions service to tackle post-trade fragmentation in Europe</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify"><span>On 22 April 2024, Euronext Securities, the central securities depository (CSD) network connecting European economies to global capital markets, announced the first go-live of its new harmonised corporate actions service. The service, now available for Portuguese fixed income securities, uses a platform developed in partnership with software provider Vermeg to manage the entire lifecycle of corporate actions. It will be extended to Danish fixed income securities this year, and all asset classes across Euronext Securities&rsquo; markets by the end of 2025.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>The management of corporate actions plays a key role in the financial industry. However, the lack of standardisation and harmonisation across markets has led to fragmentation, translating into extra costs and complexity for issuers, investors, and financial intermediaries.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>The new service addresses these challenges and delivers an efficient, automated and harmonised client experience across all Euronext Securities markets. It will allow users to manage their corporate actions across all the Euronext CSDs on a single efficient and user-friendly platform. The service fully adheres to corporate actions standards and applicable legislation such as the Shareholder Rights Directive II. In sum, the launch of this new service marks a significant contribution to the building of the Capital Markets Union.</span></p>

<p><span>Appendix</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>Adjustments in financial disclosure</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>To highlight its underlying performance, since Q1 2023 Euronext has published underlying recurring costs, adjusted EBITDA and non-recurring costs.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>Euronext has removed the exceptional items line from its financial statements. Consequently, costs previously reported as exceptional items have from Q1 2023 been included in their respective lines within Euronext operating expenses as non-recurring items.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>The &euro;150 million of implementation costs to deliver on the &lsquo;Growth for Impact 2024&rsquo; strategic plan targets are therefore considered as non-recurring items and have been withdrawn from the underlying recurring costs.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>The computation of adjusted net income and earnings per share has been adjusted accordingly. The computation of reported net income and earnings per share is not impacted.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>2024 strategic plan targets remain unchanged and are not affected by this change in reporting.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>The new non-IFRS indicators are defined below.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>Non-IFRS financial measures</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>For comparative purposes, the company provides unaudited non-IFRS measures including:</span></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><span>Operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation, underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation;</span></li>
<li><span>EBITDA, EBITDA margin, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin.</span></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify"><span>Non-IFRS measures are defined as follows:</span></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><span>Operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation as the total of salary and employee benefits, and other operational expenses;</span></li>
<li><span>Underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation as the total of salary and employee benefits, and other operational expenses, excluding non-recurring costs;</span></li>
<li><span>Underlying revenue and income as the total of revenue and income, excluding non-recurring revenue and income;</span></li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
<li><span>Non-underlying items as items of revenue, income and expense that are material by their size and/or that are infrequent and unusual by their nature or incidence are not considered to be recurring in the normal course of business and are classified as non-underlying items on the face of the income statement within their relevant category in order to provide further understanding of the ongoing sustainable performance of the Group. These items can include:</span> 
<ul type="circle">
<li><span>integration or double run costs of significant projects, restructuring costs and costs related to acquisitions that change the perimeter of the Group;</span></li>
<li><span>one-off finance costs, gains or losses on sale of subsidiaries and impairments of investments:</span></li>
<li><span>amortisation and impairment of intangible assets which are recognised as a result of acquisitions and mostly comprising customer relationships, brand names and software that were identified during purchase price allocation (PPA);</span></li>
<li><span>tax related to non-underlying items.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
<li><span>Adjusted operating profit as the operating profit adjusted for any non-underlying revenue and income and non-underlying costs, including PPA of acquired businesses;</span></li>
<li><span>EBITDA as the operating profit before depreciation and amortisation;</span></li>
<li><span>Adjusted EBITDA as the adjusted operating profit before depreciation and amortisation adjusted for any non-underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation;</span></li>
<li><span>EBITDA margin as EBITDA divided by total revenue and income;</span></li>
<li><span>Adjusted EBITDA margin as adjusted EBITDA, divided by total revenue and income;</span></li>
<li><span>Adjusted net income, as the net income, share of the parent company shareholders, adjusted for any non-underlying items and related tax impact.</span></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify"><span>Non-IFRS financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable IFRS measures and should be read only in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify"><span>Non-volume related revenue definition</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>Non-volume related revenue includes Listing excl. IPOs, Advanced Data Services, Custody &amp; Settlement and other Post-Trade, fixed revenue from the Clearing activities (including for instance NTI and membership fees), Investor Services, Technology Solutions, Other Income and Transitional Revenue.</span></p>

<div> Community Development Financial Institution, CDFI, Federal Reserve, research, economic opportunity
Summary: CDFIs are crucial for underserved communities, facing challenges in capital supply, rising lending costs, and staffing, but are supported by the Federal Reserve. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>Thank you, Jack. And thank you to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for hosting this timely event. It is good to be back at the New York Fed where I conducted research on financial institutions as a dissertation fellow over two decades ago.</p>
<p>Your recent research on the Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) industry is a welcome prelude to today's conversation. A lot of thoughtful, interesting research is also being produced by other Reserve Banks on this topic, some of which I will highlight today.</p>
<p>Let me start by saying it is a great honor for me to be among those doing this important work every day. You help to encourage and strengthen the financially and economically vulnerable, and to create economic opportunity that benefits them and our broader economy. CDFIs are a subject I know something about, and care about a great deal. I personally know the impact these financial institutions have in communities, having previously served on the board of Rende Progress Capital, a CDFI in Grand Rapids, Michigan.</p>
<p>It is also wonderful to see that many more Americans are becoming aware of CDFIs. A CDFI in Arkansas, People Trust, was featured in the 2023 short film "The Barber of Little Rock." That documentary was nominated for an Oscar at this year's Academy Awards. In the film, the founder talks about how the People Trust name is inspired by potential borrowers, some of whom had been turned away by other institutions and want to prove they are trustworthy, creditworthy, and able to run successful businesses. It is exciting to see the stories of CDFIs reaching new audiences in such an auspicious way.</p>
<p>CDFIs are having a moment off the silver screen, too. A significant portion of the federal funding directed to community development activities during the height of the pandemic flowed through CDFIs. These investments exemplify how CDFIs can meet increased demand while managing rapid growth through expanded capitalization.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20240514a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;Addressing the funding needs of CDFIs has also helped to elevate awareness of the critical services these institutions provide.</p>
<p>Today, I will speak about the crucial role CDFIs play in their communities, the challenges they face in a rapidly changing landscape, the innovations they are adopting to overcome these challenges, and the support the Federal Reserve gives to this important industry.</p>
<p><strong>Why Are CDFIs Important?</strong><br />As all of you in the room know, CDFIs represent a range of institution types, including banks, credit unions, loan funds, and venture capital funds. They provide loans to entrepreneurs to start or expand businesses, families to purchase their first homes, healthy food retailers to operate in food deserts, community health centers to service low-income communities, and they also support many other community and economic development activities.</p>
<p>Termed by some as "financial first responders," CDFIs have the creativity, mission, and funding structures to respond to needs through customized products and services for the people and communities they serve. CDFIs are a critical source of financing for organizations working on the front lines of community development. They reach households, individuals, businesses, and civic organizations that might otherwise be underserved&mdash;as compared with the level of attention, favorable terms, and assistance offered by CDFIs&mdash;or even unserved by traditional financial institutions. In the current interest rate environment, where financial institutions have generally tightened credit, CDFIs are especially important for those borrowers who benefit from the flexible underwriting and terms they offer.</p>
<p>These institutions also provide other important services that complement their loan offerings. For example, they often require clients to participate in assistance programming, such as credit counseling, homeownership counseling, or business coaching, before receiving loans. As a result, many of these institutions serve as financial literacy educators, and provide support for new entrepreneurs. CDFIs often continue their work with borrowers even after loans are made, for example, by helping them through rough spots, should borrowers experience difficulty repaying loans. They leverage their relationships to help their borrowers grow and thrive. These capacity-building efforts and technical support were particularly important during and immediately following the pandemic, when there was a historic surge in new businesses formed in the U.S.</p>
<p>When speaking about CDFIs, it is essential to highlight whom they serve and where they work. CDFIs frequently work with historically underserved populations and communities. Roughly 20 percent of CDFIs are headquartered in counties with persistently high poverty rates, and 40 percent are located in communities of color.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20240514a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;For example, research from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas indicates that mission-driven financial institutions, including CDFIs, provided more Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans to borrowers in low- and moderate-income communities and majority-minority communities than their traditional counterparts.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20240514a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a></p>
<p><strong>Growth in Demand for CDFI Products and Services</strong><br />Therefore, it is encouraging to see that the industry is growing both in terms of number of certified CDFIs and total assets held. From 2018 to the start of 2023, the number of certified CDFIs rose 40 percent and assets have nearly tripled, according to research from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20240514a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a></p>
<p>Interest in CDFI products and services also continues to grow. The Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond's 2023 CDFI Survey indicates that nearly three-quarters of CDFI respondents experienced an increase in demand for their products from 2022 to 2023.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20240514a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;CDFIs are especially adept at leveraging capital&mdash;with some programs leveraging $8 in private-sector investment for every $1 of public funding.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20240514a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;That leverage helps meet this growing demand.</p>
<p>Despite growth in demand, many CDFIs still face challenges in today's economic environment, especially as it relates to meeting the needs of the communities they serve. I emphasize that the communities CDFIs serve are ones that were disproportionately impacted by business and school closures as well as negative health outcomes resulting from the pandemic. They also have been among the most affected by recent inflation. I would like to highlight three specific issues that CDFIs are struggling with, as identified by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond's CDFI survey.</p>
<p>First, demand is outpacing the supply of capital. While there has been an influx of federal funding for CDFIs, much of that is tied to pandemic-related relief programs and other programs with specific purposes. Therefore, building out long-term sources of capital is a continuing challenge. One hopeful strategy is selling loans on secondary markets. New research from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows that CDFIs sell billions of dollars of loans each year but tend not to do so systematically. Also, residential mortgage loans account for almost all the volume sold by CDFIs. As such, there is likely substantial room for growth.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20240514a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;Later in today's program, you will hear more about opportunities for CDFIs to explore options, such as pooling and securitizing loans to expand their access to capital markets as well as further developing the secondary market for loans backed by other collateral types aside from residential mortgages.</p>
<p>Second, the increasing cost of lending capital makes extending affordable credit to their low- and moderate-income borrowers more difficult.</p>
<p>Third, CDFIs are not immune to the challenges associated with hiring and retaining staff, and managing labor costs, that are faced by many employers in a tight job market.</p>
<p><strong>How the Federal Reserve System Supports CDFIs</strong><br />The Board and regional Reserve Banks have long understood the unique value of CDFIs. CDFIs are key partners to our Reserve Bank Community Development programs and integral members of our Board and Reserve Bank Community Development Advisory Councils. We rely on the insights they share with us to understand how low- and moderate-income communities are faring in the economy.</p>
<p>The Fed also supports CDFIs through certain supervisory and regulatory activities, including through evaluation of compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). Among other provisions, the CRA allows banks to receive CRA credit for undertaking community development activities in cooperation with CDFIs.</p>
<p>As mentioned, CDFIs were key providers of PPP funding in low- and moderate-income communities during the pandemic. The Federal Reserve's PPP Liquidity Facility created more opportunities for banks and CDFIs to leverage funding in our most vulnerable communities impacted by the pandemic.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20240514a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a>&nbsp;In addition, the Fed clarified the capital treatment of funds made available through the Emergency Capital Investment Program, and provided technical assistance throughout the application process.</p>
<p>Another key area of the Federal Reserve's support for CDFIs is research, which is an area of interest for several of the Reserve Banks. In particular, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge the stellar research efforts of our host, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, related to the growth of the CDFI industry and the origination and sale of loans by CDFIs. The latter was the impetus for today's event. I hope this research will facilitate more conversations and serve as a resource for the industry as CDFIs and those who support them consider how to increase liquidity to meet demand.</p>
<p>And of course, gatherings like today's event are another component of our role in supporting CDFIs: Bringing together thought leaders to share information and ideas with the goal of advancing the work of CDFIs.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />In closing, the CDFI industry has been a critical source of responsive, flexible capital and technical assistance for people and places most in need. Recent investment in CDFIs positions the industry to leverage new capital to deliver a greater impact in the communities they serve. I am pleased to see the meaningful work the CDFI industry has accomplished and eager to see the creative innovation and impactful outcomes of the CDFI industry. And in my role here at the Federal Reserve, I am proud of the many ways the entire System has supported the timely and important work of CDFIs. I look forward to continuing this vital partnership.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>On 13 May 2024, with its&nbsp;<a href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtUAQdUBVIBBkwOVAUCHVZYBQYdUAkFURoHUFcGDQcNB1BSDlMdWAZbUgkGBVsdBgsEVx0GCAEAGlcAUgIZAg0EUAkEBVFRVFYHRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" target="_blank">Decision No 07/2024</a>, ACER amended the methodology for Coordinating Operational Security Analysis (CSAM).</p>
<p>The amendment proposal was submitted to ACER in&nbsp;<a href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsAAFNUUlhRVkwABlABHVYNBlUdCg8AUxoEBwsEBgsDVVQIBAQdWAZbUgkGBVsdBgsEVx0GCAEAGlcAUgIZAg0EUAkEBVFRVFYHRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" target="_blank">November 2023</a>&nbsp;by the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) on behalf of Transmission System Operators (TSOs).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why&nbsp;is the methodology important for the EU's operational security?</span></p>
<p>CSAM supports the EU&rsquo;s operational security by outlining the TSOs' requirements to ensure:</p>
<ul>
<li>the electricity transmission system is operated in a coordinated manner;</li>
<li>effective system operational planning;</li>
<li>transparency and reliability of information on transmission system operation.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the main improvements in the methodology?</span></p>
<p>The amendments relate to the implementation of the observability area (i.e., where TSOs implement real-time monitoring and modelling of their systems to maintain operational security), following the recommendations of the&nbsp;<a href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtQCAUGWFRVBkxdAgFUHVZaAAMdC11XBxoMAFJVBAoNAVIIBVQdWAZbUgkGBVsdBgsEVx0GCAEAGlcAUgIZAg0EUAkEBVFRVFYHRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" target="_blank">Incident Classification Expert Panel&rsquo;s final report on Continental Europe Synchronous Area Separation on 8 January 2021</a>.</p>
<p>The main changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aligning the observability area reassessment period with that of the external contingency list (i.e., the list of contingencies to be simulated to test the compliance with the operational security limits). This alignment is important to ensure that the operational security analysis is carried out accurately across all timeframes.</li>
<li>The inclusion of busbar couplers in the contingency lists and in the TSOs&rsquo; Individual Grid Models (IGMs), along with a defined timeline for implementation by the TSOs. This update ensures that the power flows are kept within the operational security limits after a contingency has occurred.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the next steps?</span></p>
<p>Within a year after the adoption of the new CSAM (by 13 May 2025), TSOs are required to update their ordinary contingency lists.</p>

<p><span><span><img alt="GlobalData_MandA_BioPharma_Q1_24" src="https://mondovisione.com/_assets/images/GlobalData_MandA_BioPharma_.jpg" title="GlobalData_MandA_BioPharma_Q1_24" /><br /></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The largest M&amp;A deal reported in Q1 2024 was Novo Nordisk&rsquo;s holding and investment company&rsquo;s Novo Holdings&rsquo; $16.5 billion acquisition of US-based contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) Catalent, announced in February 2024. Another notable M&amp;A deal was&nbsp;Gilead Sciences&rsquo; $4.3 billion acquisition of US-based company CymaBay Therapeutics, which was completed in March 2024.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Labya adds: &ldquo;Companies developing antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and radiopharmaceuticals attracted high levels of M&amp;A investment continuing into Q1 2024, as large pharmaceutical companies seek to replenish portfolios with those sought-after drug classes.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Johnson &amp; Johnson acquired US-based ADC company Ambrx Biopharma for $2 billion in March 2024, and AstraZeneca also announced in the same month to acquire US-based radiopharmaceutical company Fusion Pharmaceuticals for $2 billion.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Oncology was the top therapy area for M&amp;A deals in Q1 2024, with a total deal value of $29 billion. However, immunology-focused M&amp;As had the largest growth in deal activity compared to Q1 2023, with a 314% surge in deal value in Q1 2024 totalling to $14 billion.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Labya concludes: &ldquo;Q1 2024 saw an increase in billion-dollar M&amp;A transactions involving large biopharmaceutical companies, such as Gilead and Novartis. Given that the biopharmaceutical industry can overcome regulatory challenges set by the Federal Trade Commission, the remainder of 2024 is poised for continued M&amp;A investment from large biopharmaceutical companies, which could accelerate R&amp;D and the launch of innovative drugs.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note: Data in the chart includes all announced and completed M&amp;A deals globally from 2021 to Q1 2024 where at least one drug is involved, as well as deals with and without a deal value disclosed in the public domain.</span></span></p>

<div> Barclays Bank, CLS, Cross Currency Swaps, settlement risk, FX market
Summary:<br /><br />CLS's CCS service, integrated with CLSSettlement, reduces settlement risk, optimizes liquidity, and aligns with public policy efforts to mitigate FX settlement risk. <div>
<p>CLS, a financial market infrastructure group delivering settlement, processing and data solutions, today announced that Barclays Bank has officially gone live on its Cross Currency Swaps (CCS) service.</p>
<p>The CCS service &ndash; an extension of CLS's unique payment-versus-payment (PvP) settlement service, CLSSettlement &ndash; mitigates settlement risk for CCS transactions. By integrating CCS flows into CLSSettlement, the service allows for multilateral netting against all other FX transactions, providing substantial liquidity optimization benefits as well as reducing daily funding requirements for clients.</p>
<p>As public policy efforts to mitigate settlement risk have increased, CLS&rsquo;s CCS service has seen a notable rise in activity. Values of CCS submitted to CLSSettlement are up 48% year-on-year in 2023, highlighting the industry&rsquo;s support for the service.</p>
<p><b>Lisa Danino-Lewis, Chief Growth Officer at CLS&nbsp;</b>commented, "Barclays Bank going live on our CCS service is a positive step in our continual work toward making the global FX market more resilient and efficient. The adoption of our CCS service by Barclays, one of the world's premier banking institutions, demonstrates the value and trust placed in our risk mitigation and liquidity management solutions by the industry. The growing number of institutions, as well as growing volumes on the platform, underlines the industry's commitment towards minimizing settlement risk in the FX market."</p>
<p><b>Michael Pollak, Head of Cross Currency Trading, Barclays Bank PLC&nbsp;</b>commented, "As markets continue to navigate an uncertain period, being able to mitigate FX settlement risk via CLS&rsquo;s CCS service is a vital part of our risk management practices. Through multilateral netting, we can also optimize our liquidity, reduce our funding requirements and remove friction from the market&rsquo;s infrastructure. We look forward to the continued benefits the service will bring to our operations and the wider industry."</p>
<p>The CCS service supports FX market participants&rsquo; adherence to Principle 35 of the FX Global Code.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;It also helps market participants respond to recent public policy efforts to mitigate settlement risk, such as the European Central Bank&rsquo;s new guidance on how banks should mitigate FX settlement risk and the Financial Stability Board&rsquo;s Roadmap to Enhance Cross-Border Payments.</p>

<title>InvestEngine Hits Half A Billion AUM Milestone, As Demand For ETF Investing Continues To Grow</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> ETFs, AUM, InvestEngine, growth, pension<br />
InvestEngine's AUM surpasses £500 million with 70% growth in 4 months. 620+ ETF offerings, low fees, and recent expansion into pensions and savings plans. <br /><br />Summary: InvestEngine's AUM exceeds £500 million amid 70% growth, offering 620+ ETFs, low fees, and expanded products including pensions and savings plans. <div>
<ul>
<li>Investment platform InvestEngine has smashed through the &pound;500 million AUM barrier, amidst continuing high demand for ETFs among retail investors.</li>
<li>The platform,&nbsp;which launched its DIY solution in 2021,&nbsp;brings easy, automated investing&nbsp;to new and experienced investors, offering commission-free investing in more than 620 ETFs&nbsp;from the likes of Vanguard, iShares, Invesco and JPMorgan</li>
<li>The company&rsquo;s latest milestone follows its recent expansion into new product and service areas, including pensions and savings plans.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) investment platform&nbsp;<a href="https://investengine.com/" target="_blank">InvestEngine&nbsp;</a>has today announced it has passed &pound;500 million in assets under management (AUM), a 70% increase in assets in the past four months, as the company&rsquo;s growth trajectory reaches new heights.</p>
<p>The success of the platform reflects the market opportunity presented by ETFs, a type of investment fund designed to track the performance of a financial index and can be traded like shares. ETFs offer wide choice and diversification, often holding hundreds of individual shares or bonds. PwC has forecast that global ETF AUM could grow to more than $20 trillion by 2026. *</p>
<p>The growth of ETFs as a diversified and low-risk form of investing, coupled with InvestEngine&rsquo;s focus on providing unbeatable value on fees and trades, automated investing and the choice of over 620 ETFs has made it the platform of choice for tens of thousands of customers in the UK.</p>
<p>Launched in 2019, InvestEngine offers a range of products for both individuals and businesses, with stocks and shares ISAs, General Investment Accounts and Business accounts, with growth taking off with the launch of its fee-free DIY ISA. In the last year alone, the platform has more than doubled its customers to 50,000 and has saved these customers over &pound;11 million in trading and account fees.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, InvestEngine expanded its offering to launch its self-invested personal pension (SIPP) account and help more people to take control of how they invest for their retirement. Meanwhile the launch of its Savings Plan feature last summer is helping customers to automate investing on a regular basis and better grow their long-term wealth.</p>
<p>Recently, it was given the top-rated product status by Times Money Mentor.</p>
<p><b>Andrey Dobrynin, Co-Founder and Managing Director, InvestEngine said:</b>&nbsp;&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s milestone is a great moment for us. It underlines the growing demand from consumers to be able to invest better. We make investing easy, automated and affordable,&nbsp; overcoming all of the issues that investors previously faced, and based on the feedback we receive from customers it&rsquo;s working.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The benefits of ETFs are clear, and we&rsquo;ve been working tirelessly to bring these benefits to experienced and new investors alike, providing features that enable people to take greater control of their investments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The recent launch of our pension product and new features like Savings Plans, coupled with our recent accolades as a top provider in the investment space, is a testament to what we&rsquo;ve achieved in the last few years. I&rsquo;m looking forward to the years ahead, as the ETF market continues to grow, and we work to help more people utilise them in increasing their long-term wealth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>ETFs are a basket of securities that trade on an exchange and contain securities like stocks, bonds, and commodities. Investment funds like ETFs are considered a lower-risk investment because of the increased diversification and flexibility when compared with single-stock investing.</p>
<p>InvestEngine&rsquo;s crowdfunding round last year raised over &pound;1.9 million, significantly surpassing its &pound;1.25 million target. The money raised has helped the company to move into new areas, including self-invested personal pensions (SIPPs) and become the ETF distributor of choice for many of the world's leading ETF providers, including Invesco, JPMorgan and BlackRock..</p>

<div> partnership, virtual card issuing, OTA market, Visa, Worldline
<br />
Worldline and Visa form a strategic partnership to launch a virtual card solution for the OTA market, aiming to streamline cash flow and enhance payment infrastructure.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p><span>Worldline [Euronext: WLN], a global leader in payment services, today announced a strategic partnership with Visa, a global leader in digital payments, to launch a new virtual card issuing solution. This strategic collaboration marks a pivotal moment, propelling Worldline beyond payment processing and into direct card issuance. The project will focus on the Online Travel Agency (OTA) market due to a high demand for this solution and Worldline&rsquo;s strong heritage and portfolio in travel. By combining the parties&rsquo; acceptance networks and seamless payouts, the virtual card issuing solution will streamline cash flow for OTAs.</span></p>
<p>The OTA market is rapidly growing and demand for innovative payment solutions is surging. Industry analysts expect Travel and Tourism will generate 76% of all revenues from online sales by 2028 (<a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/mmo/travel-tourism/worldwide">Statista</a>) while the entire travel industry is expected to reach USD 1.74 trillion in volume by 2026 (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">PhocusWright data</span>). OTAs currently representing 40% of the global travel market<span>&nbsp;</span>(Pata:&nbsp;<a href="https://mize.tech/blog/online-travel-agencies-market-share-across-the-world/">3</a>), are poised to play an increasingly influential role across all sectors, including airlines, hotels, packaged tours, rail, and cruises. For OTAs, virtual cards play an integral part in streamlining operational procedures and this new partnership enables the OTAs to further optimise their business.</p>
<p>By choosing Visa as its international scheme partner, Worldline will provide OTAs with access to a dedicated B2B virtual card programme and enable them to pay their suppliers more quickly and securely. With both parties making a significant investment into this partnership, the opportunity to substantially enhance the payments infrastructure of the online travel sector is clear.</p>
<p>The partnership connects Worldline&rsquo;s Merchant Services Acceptance capabilities with its innovative Financial Services Card issuing platform. The offering, with joint acceptance and issuing, further supports OTAs in the management and optimisation of cash flows while reducing operational frictions. Worldline&rsquo;s experience and deep understanding of the online travel sector will enable it to develop a market-leading solution that bridges the gap between acceptance and issuing.</p>
<p><span>Guillaume Tournand, VP of Growth at Worldline Merchant Services,&nbsp;</span>said: &ldquo;<i>We are delighted to announce this significant partnership with Visa, a global influential and respected brand. It will transform the way online travel agencies handle payments by offering a unified solution that combines payment performance and cost effectiveness. By leveraging our strong travel footprint, this initiative unlocks significant market expansion for Worldline, propelling us as the leading payment solution for travel agencies and driving sustainable revenue growth.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Ed Chandler, Senior Vice President, Visa Commercial and Money Movement Solutions,&nbsp;</span>also comments:&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;At Visa, we obsess about working with partners to deliver innovative, secure and reliable payment solutions. We are excited to partner with Worldline, to streamline, unify and enhance how online travel agencies are paid and pay their suppliers seamlessly.&rdquo;&nbsp;</i></p>

<div> ABX Studio, FX pricing data, ABX Platform, emerging markets, deliverable payments
Summary:
ABX Studio offers FX pricing data from multiple EM payments providers to support deliverable payments in emerging markets, addressing challenges faced by commercial banks, MSBs, NGOs, and international charities. The platform improves pricing transparency, accuracy, and regulatory compliance, benefiting all user types. The ABX Platform, developed by AbbeyCross, provides a single access point to accurate and transparent EM FX payment pricing sourced directly from multiple payment partners, offering unparalleled EM payments pricing accuracy and transparency without the cost and time associated with building multiple direct connections. The launch of ABX Studio with its first US Tier 1 bank client marks a major milestone in AbbeyCross's effort to optimize and improve the emerging markets FX payments ecosystem. This will ultimately reduce the bank’s client costs, simplify their processes and improve their client experience. <div>
<p><span><a href="https://info.therealizationgroup.com/e3t/Ctc/I6+113/cWmHt04/VV_1Bk4rjFdcN8hlbDpBg9BsVfQRxk5f3bYGN4zFKLd3lYMRW69sMD-6lZ3ncW99YMR_8kTbjSW6WWflr19bWPzW6wVZ8m6kVJh5W2ykdvB8zsLN5N15Z0GzphZhqW4p-1lM5R3TmFN1g3lkwkmv2tMJdl0Ndnk4zN1H8dBy3wRX0W5YZqwB7F7cN-N2s8gcJTzfqNW2kPJV239Yf4KN20C8KVGkfbVW5mC4Qz8HmTpMW7vv8YR4rV8h3VtTqYf5dNwPMW5KGSKC6FtHhvVbw_F966jPR2W7rpkdK3dznDKW4Vlq8F6hPFlpf8dTfJg04" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span><strong>AbbeyCross</strong></span></a><strong>,</strong>&nbsp;the company focused on transforming the FX and payments landscape for Emerging Markets (EM), announces the launch of ABX Studio with its first US Tier 1 bank client. ABX Studio, the first solution to go live on the ABX Platform, provides unique emerging market FX pricing data directly from multiple EM payments providers, enhancing price discovery and comparison, to support deliverable payments to emerging markets.</span></p>
<p><span>Developed by payment industry veterans and built with best-in-class, proven and trusted financial markets transaction technologies, the ABX Platform has been created specifically to address the challenges faced today by commercial banks, Money Services Businesses (MSBs), Non-Government Organisations (NGOs) and international charities operating in the world&rsquo;s emerging markets.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Historically, commercial banks have suffered from a lack of choice when addressing emerging markets payments with most limited to one FX rate provider. This harms margins, limits services to their clients and creates compliance risks to regulators. MSBs may struggle to access banking services and are limited to banks&rsquo; wholesale offerings rather than having direct access to provider bank solutions. NGOs and Charitable Trusts face the same challenges as MSBs, along with a heightened need for pricing transparency for governance purposes.</span></p>
<p><span>These organisations can now benefit from a single access point to accurate and transparent EM FX payment pricing sourced directly from multiple payment partners. Through a single integration to the ABX Platform, users get unparalleled EM payments pricing accuracy and transparency without the cost and time associated with building multiple direct connections.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>ABX Studio users can:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>View and compare real-time and historic deliverable FX rates from multiple payment providers&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Benchmark existing payment providers against the wider market to drive competition, improve margins and support more accurate customer pricing</span></li>
<li><span>Address regulatory and supervisory challenges with independent verification of payment-relevant EM FX execution rates</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Mike Robertson, CEO and Co-Founder, AbbeyCross said:&nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;Today marks a major milestone in our journey to optimise and improve the outdated and inefficient emerging markets FX payments ecosystem. For this US Tier 1 bank client, joining the ABX Platform recognises its commitment to continuous innovation for its global client base. Using ABX Studio will help improve their decision-making capabilities for FX payments to emerging markets and bring greater efficiency, increase price transparency, and mitigate risk. This will ultimately reduce the bank&rsquo;s client costs, simplify their processes and improve their client experience. We would like to thank our investors, payment partners, technology partners and the AbbeyCross team, all of whom share our vision for a better solution for EM payments, for their fantastic support.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Olann Kerrison, Chief Commercial Officer</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>AbbeyCross</strong>&nbsp;<strong>said</strong>: &ldquo;We are thrilled to go live with our first US Tier 1 bank client and look forward to adding more banks, institutions, and organisations in the near future. All of our user types &ndash; from commercial banks to global charities &ndash; can now benefit from unparalleled access to real-time and historic FX rate data from leading payment partners. The ability to more easily benchmark providers and generate comparison reporting supports true price discovery and ultimately results in better decision-making.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Ben McConnell, CTO, AbbeyCross said:</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;The launch of ABX Studio on the ABX Platform is a huge achievement for the AbbeyCross team and our technology partners. Our collaboration with Chronicle Software, the specialist financial markets technology provider has proved to be a great fit for us. Their reputation and relationships in global financial markets, as well their expertise in delivering outstanding technology solutions, have been &ndash; and continue to be &ndash; instrumental in the successful development and delivery of the ABX Platform&rdquo;.</span></p>

<title>BMet Opens Doors To UK’s First FinTech Short Course</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/bmet-opens-doors-to-uks-first-fintech-short-course/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/bmet-opens-doors-to-uks-first-fintech-short-course/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The first FinTech course of its kind in the country is actively recruiting students ready to start in Birmingham at the beginning of June.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>BMet is launching what is believed to be the first Further Education (FE)-led short course in FinTech in the country. Over the next two years, BMet anticipates rolling out courses which will support around fifty to sixty new students.</span></p>
<p><span>The first short course will take four months with self-study, online and in-college learning options. It will introduce learners to FinTech, covering behavioural and technology strands, and feature engagement with industry experts as it delivers on the demand for continuous innovation.</span></p>
<p><span>The course has been developed by BMet with partners following publication last year of its FinTech Skills Framework - a &lsquo;Blueprint for Further Education in Birmingham and the West Midlands.&rsquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The sixteen-week course will provide a solid foundation in FinTech concepts and technologies; develop understanding of FinTech's historical context and evolution; support students in exploring various sectors and identifying opportunities for innovation; offer insights into the regulatory environment and strategies for compliance and underpin career progression and development opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span>BMet has developed the course working with the West Midlands Combined Authority (WMCA); SuperTech, the UK&rsquo;s only tech supercluster, and leading industry experts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Suzie Branch-Haddow, Vice Principal for External Development at BMet, said:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t wait to start this FinTech programme at BMet!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;We know this region is already a major centre for FinTech with huge potential for this critical growth sector. There is a big role for FE to play in empowering our diverse talent pool to take advantage of the exciting opportunities in Birmingham and the West Midlands.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Jo Griffin, Project and Skills Lead at SuperTech, will be one of the specialist lecturers on the course. Last year, SuperTech&rsquo;s Impact Report found the estimated annual economic output from the sector in the West Midlands was &pound;474M with FinTech productivity almost twice the regional average per worker.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Hilary Smyth-Allen, Executive Lead for SuperTech, said:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thrilled to see this innovative course open its doors for recruitment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;The FE Blueprint cemented the status of FinTech in the region as one of the fastest growing tech sectors, but also one that has a significant skills shortage with a specific market gap in our sector. Unsurprisingly, the sector competes for these high value skills among the UK&rsquo;s major growth sectors, but FE presents an untapped talent pipeline.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Students who complete the programme will be awarded with a certificate. Employers in the SuperTech community and beyond will recognise the high value of the course. It will give a significant skills boost to participants and form an important element in their Continuous Professional Development (CPD).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Development of the programme has been supported by the WMCA.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>David Gaughan, Head of Employer Services at the WMCA, said:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;We are delighted to back this fantastic new FinTech course at BMet which, along with FE partners across the region, plays such a crucial role in our skills system.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;The business, professional and financial services cluster is set to see significant growth over the next decade, and we&rsquo;re delighted that the WMCA focus in developing new skills pathways in key growth clusters has resulted in the development of this new FinTech offer to support our residents and employers.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>Employers and aspiring students who are interested in the FinTech Short programme should visit</span><span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.bmet.ac.uk%2Fcourse%2Ffin-tech-skills-bootcamp%2F/1/0102018f75e7bbcf-c07d0089-446b-406f-aba9-c923891e4190-000000/ozz4C74Lrs4DxRh8yar3Ski1Puw=373" target="_blank"><span>the couse page&nbsp;</span></a><span>&nbsp;or email Suzie Branch-Haddow:&nbsp;</span><a><span>Suzie.Branch@bmet.ac.uk</span></a><span>&nbsp;.</span></p>

<div> Legacy technology, Temenos Positions, real-time data, financial efficiency, core transformation
Summary:
Temenos introduces Positions, a real-time financial processing solution, addressing legacy tech, providing real-time data transparency and high-volume processing. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>Temenos (SIX: TEMN) today introduced Temenos Positions, a financial processing solution designed to transform banking operations for institutions with complex, multi-core systems across multiple lines of business in both Retail and Corporate banking.</p>
<p>Temenos Positions serves as a real-time source for maintaining and sharing balances, instruments, and financial movements across an entire bank's system landscape, regardless of underlying technology stack. This allows banks to reduce operational risk, increase financial efficiency, and develop and quickly take to market complex financial products and services, thus increasing profitability and customer experience.</p>
<p>Many banks today run on legacy technology stacks with multiple core systems operating in silos and face massive challenges in core transformation because of the complexity of replacing the entire IT landscape. This results in a lack of a 360-degree view of real-time financial positions, high costs of integration and reconciliation and manual processing. With Temenos Financial Positions, banks can address their immediate operational efficiency needs and can also embark on a progressive modernization journey without having to transform their entire core banking platform.</p>
<p>Composed of Temenos banking capabilities, Temenos Positions leverages decades of investment in the Temenos core banking platform. This investment ensures that it can meet the complex use cases for back value processing and multiple balance types. The solution is designed for serverless deployment - a new leaner and faster way for Temenos to build and release solutions. This new deployment technology builds and deploys capabilities as discrete libraries offering up to 30% faster deployment and supporting cloud-native deployments on a single database. Additionally, the solution is extensible to other related areas such as party and pricing, further enhancing its versatility.</p>
<p><b>Jost Hoppermann, Hoppermann Advisory, said:</b>&nbsp;&ldquo;Most banks are burdened by a legacy debt of multiple core systems from different generations, and many need to manage the co-existence of legacy and modern cores. With Temenos Positions, Temenos is offering a lean solution that will help isolate different architectural elements, move off older back-end&nbsp;capabilities, and add new front-end capabilities in a smoother way. A real-time data source of truth is essential for&nbsp;<a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.linkedin.com/pulse/evolutionary-architecture-digital-transformation-micro-hoppermann-mp10e?trackingId=dZsfj4oYknYRnYig299pWg*3D*3D&amp;lipi=urn*3Ali*3Apage*3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_recent_activity_content_view*3BZ7IV5wOzRA6qCW9qYdRPtQ*3D*3D__;JSUlJSUlJSU!!M3LOjqNU!Yz76rGnA10DPnnq5dxOpg_8RTgZ2qVHZEuHNLN6xW-kh4BZXEszKcfh3_hDaTgDFavcACr9EupqUcIEEBUYu8Q$" target="_blank">evolutionary transformation</a>&nbsp;in banking. This will also help banks to deliver an improved customer experience, with real-time updates on account balances, enhancing transparency and trust.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Tony Coleman, Chief Technology and Innovation Officer, Temenos, commented: &ldquo;</b>The inconvenient truth for many banks is that they have no real-time positions or funds authorization across the enterprise. Temenos Positions solves this problem by providing a real-time&nbsp;source&nbsp;for all balances and funds authorization. Engineered to handle a vast number of instruments and high-volume processing, Temenos Positions can process high volumes of instruments efficiently and at scale. It does this without Close of Business processing, just a simple date flip, making it ideal for banks with large transaction volumes.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Statement on the President’s Decision Prohibiting The Acquisition By MineOne Cloud Computing Investment I L.P. Of Real Estate, And The Operation Of A Cryptocurrency Mining Facility, In Close Proximity To Francis E. Warren Air Force Base</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> CFIUS, President Biden, MineOne, divestment, national security
Summary:
President Biden ordered divestment of MineOne's cryptocurrency mining facility near an Air Force base due to national security concerns. CFIUS process focuses on case-by-case national security concerns. <div>
<p>Today President Biden issued an order prohibiting the purchase and requiring the divestment of certain real estate operated as a cryptocurrency mining facility located within one mile of Francis E. Warren Air Force Base (F.E. Warren AFB), as well as requiring the removal of certain improvements and equipment at the property by MineOne Partners Limited, which is ultimately majority owned by nationals of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China;&nbsp;MineOne Cloud Computing Investment I L.P.; MineOne Data Center LLC; and MineOne Wyoming Data Center LLC (collectively MineOne), as well as their affiliates.</p>
<p>MineOne acquired the property in June 2022 and then made improvements to allow for use of the property for specialized cryptocurrency mining operations within one mile of F.E. Warren AFB in Cheyenne, Wyoming, a strategic missile base and home to Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles. &nbsp;The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS or the Committee) reviewed and investigated this transaction pursuant to authorities provided by Congress in the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 (FIRRMA) to cover real estate transactions in close proximity to certain sensitive U.S. facilities, including F.E. Warren AFB.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s divestment order underscores President Biden&rsquo;s steadfast commitment to protecting the United States&rsquo; national security.&nbsp; It also highlights the critical gatekeeper role that CFIUS serves to ensure that foreign investment does not undermine our national security, particularly as it relates to transactions that present risk to sensitive U.S. military installations as well as those involving specialized equipment and technologies,&rdquo; said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CFIUS identified national security risks arising from the transaction relating to the proximity of the property to F.E. Warren AFB. CFIUS also assessed the risk associated with the presence of specialized equipment on the property used to conduct cryptocurrency mining operations, some of which is foreign-sourced and presents significant national security concerns.&nbsp; The proximity of the foreign-owned cryptocurrency mining facility to a strategic missile base and key element of America&rsquo;s nuclear triad,&nbsp;and the presence of specialized and foreign-sourced equipment potentially capable of facilitating surveillance and espionage activities, presented a significant national security risk that led to CFIUS&rsquo;s referral to the President. &nbsp;To address this risk, the President&rsquo;s order directs both the prompt divestment of foreign ownership of the property as well as the removal of the equipment and improvements that were added to the property.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By law, CFIUS is authorized to negotiate and enter into an agreement or take other actions to mitigate the national security risk arising from a covered transaction.&nbsp; In some cases, however, CFIUS determines that mitigation of the national security risk is not adequate or appropriate, and that the President should prohibit a transaction.&nbsp; In such instances, most transaction parties voluntarily take steps to forgo or abandon a transaction.&nbsp; In other cases, parties are unwilling or unable to take actions or to timely agree to terms and conditions the Committee deems necessary to adequately address the national security risks.&nbsp; In all CFIUS reviews, the parties&rsquo; conduct can impact the Committee&rsquo;s assessment of what steps or actions are needed to resolve national security risks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If CFIUS parties are unwilling or unable to fully address national security risks, CFIUS won&rsquo;t hesitate to exercise the full scope of its authorities, including Presidential referrals, to address the risk,&rdquo; said Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Investment Security Paul Rosen.&nbsp;Rosen added that &ldquo;CFIUS expects complete, accurate, and timely information, particularly when serious national security issues are on the line.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>MineOne did not file the transaction with CFIUS until after CFIUS&rsquo;s non-notified team investigated the transaction as a result of a public tip.&nbsp; CFIUS&rsquo;s non-notified function has been enhanced by authorities provided by Congress in FIRRMA and ongoing appropriations to support the Committee&rsquo;s ability to identify and review non-notified transactions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>By law, CFIUS may enter into a negotiated mitigation agreement only if it is effective, verifiable, and monitorable based on a careful evaluation. &nbsp;In this case, the Committee determined that it would not be possible to enter into a negotiated agreement with MineOne that would sufficiently address the national security risks in an effective, verifiable, and monitorable manner, resulting in CFIUS&rsquo;s referral to the President.</p>
<p>This decision is based on the facts and national security risks related to this transaction only.&nbsp; The CFIUS process focuses exclusively on identifying and addressing national security concerns arising from a covered transaction on a case-by-case basis, which reinforces CFIUS&rsquo;s commitment to encouraging foreign investment while protecting national security.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>These changes in Regulation CC include the minimum amount of deposited funds that banks must make available for withdrawal by opening of business on the next day for certain check deposits as well as the amount of funds deposited by certain checks in a new account that are subject to next-day availability.</p>
<p>By law, the agencies are required to adjust these dollar thresholds every five years by the annual percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). The inflation measurement period for this adjustment began in July 2018 and ended in July 2023.</p>
<p>To help ensure that depository institutions have sufficient time to implement the adjustments, the compliance date for the new amounts is July 1, 2025.</p>

<title>Statement On Customer Identification Programs for Registered Investment Advisers and Exempt Reporting Advisers, SEC Commissioner Mark T. Uyeda, May 13, 2024</title>

<div> proposal, investment advisers, BSA, FinCEN, customer identification programs
Summary:
The joint proposal by the Commission and the Department of the Treasury seeks to implement BSA provisions for investment advisers, although there are concerns about the expansive scope and the potential burdens on smaller investment advisers. The proposal is closely tied to a separate rulemaking initiative by FinCEN, and there are concerns about duplicative efforts and lack of clarity on the baseline for requirements. <div>
<p>Today, the Commission and the Department of the Treasury issued a joint proposal to implement provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act (&ldquo;BSA&rdquo;) for certain investment advisers.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-cip-registered-investment-advisers-exmpt-reporting-advisers-051324#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, Section 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, which amended the BSA, requires the Secretary of the Treasury (the &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo;) to issue regulations that require financial institutions to implement specified procedures for identifying customers that seek to open an account.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-cip-registered-investment-advisers-exmpt-reporting-advisers-051324#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp; These procedures are referred to as Customer Identification Programs (&ldquo;CIPs&rdquo;).</p>
<p>The Secretary can impose CIP requirements only on a &ldquo;financial institution,&rdquo; which is a defined term in the BSA.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-cip-registered-investment-advisers-exmpt-reporting-advisers-051324#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp; Twenty-four types of entities are specifically listed in the definition of &ldquo;financial institution,&rdquo; but not investment advisers.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-cip-registered-investment-advisers-exmpt-reporting-advisers-051324#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp; However, the BSA gives the Secretary discretion to add other types of entities to that statutory definition.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-cip-registered-investment-advisers-exmpt-reporting-advisers-051324#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p>Thus, on February 15, 2024, the Secretary, acting through the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (&ldquo;FinCEN&rdquo;), proposed to include certain investment advisers as &ldquo;financial institutions&rdquo; under the BSA.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-cip-registered-investment-advisers-exmpt-reporting-advisers-051324#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp; The proposal would apply to investment advisers that: (1) are registered or required to register with the Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (&ldquo;Advisers Act&rdquo;);<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-cip-registered-investment-advisers-exmpt-reporting-advisers-051324#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;or (2) report to the Commission as exempt reporting advisers (&ldquo;ERAs&rdquo;) under that Act.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-cip-registered-investment-advisers-exmpt-reporting-advisers-051324#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p>An important question is the scope of the FinCEN Proposed Rule, which requests comment on whether &ldquo;specific services provided by investment advisers, such as advisory services that do not involve management of client assets or subadvisory services, should be included or excluded from coverage of this proposed rule.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-cip-registered-investment-advisers-exmpt-reporting-advisers-051324#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp; Presumably, this is because there are legitimate questions as to the relevance of such services to money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illicit financial activity.</p>
<p>However, the overly broad definitions within this proposal would appear to sweep in such services.&nbsp; The proposal defines &ldquo;account&rdquo; as &ldquo;any contractual or other business relationship between a person and an investment adviser under which the investment adviser provides investment advisory services.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-cip-registered-investment-advisers-exmpt-reporting-advisers-051324#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;&ldquo;Customer&rdquo; is defined as &ldquo;[a] person that opens a new account,&rdquo; subject to certain limited exceptions such as regulated financial institutions and persons that have an existing account with the investment adviser.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-cip-registered-investment-advisers-exmpt-reporting-advisers-051324#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp; While &ldquo;investment advisory services&rdquo; is not defined, the broad definition of &ldquo;investment adviser&rdquo; in the Advisers Act includes any person that, &ldquo;either directly or through publications or writings,&rdquo; is in the business of advising others &ldquo;as to the value of securities&rdquo; or who &ldquo;issues or promulgates analyses or reports concerning securities.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-cip-registered-investment-advisers-exmpt-reporting-advisers-051324#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Registered investment advisers or ERAs may provide a wide range of investment advisory services, including services that do not generally present any opportunity for money laundering or terrorist financing activities.&nbsp; For example, while the proposal would deem the CIP requirements satisfied for an adviser that advises a mutual fund, such adviser may also provide investment advice to collective investment trusts, or create model portfolios for wrap fee programs &ndash; all of which involve &ldquo;investment advisory services&rdquo; to &ldquo;accounts&rdquo; of &ldquo;customers&rdquo; under the proposal.&nbsp; Other types of investment advisory services may not at all involve or relate to the transfer of funds or securities.&nbsp; It is difficult to envision a money laundering concern that should be addressed with these activities, and it is unreasonable to require advisers to implement a CIP and verify customer identities in these circumstances. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because of the interrelatedness of this proposal and the FinCEN Proposed Rule, the proposing release states that &ldquo;[w]e anticipate that any change to the scope of the [FinCEN Proposed Rule], as finalized, would also be reflected in this rule, to ensure that the scope of both rules remain consistent.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-cip-registered-investment-advisers-exmpt-reporting-advisers-051324#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>&nbsp; This explicit interrelatedness is the precise reason that the scoping question should be addressed through a two-step process.&nbsp; First, determine the scope of investment advisory services that should be covered under the BSA, which is the subject of the FinCEN Proposed Rule.&nbsp; Second, determine how a CIP should be applied with respect to that set of investment advisers, which is the subject of this proposed rule.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it becomes difficult to provide a thoughtful economic analysis for this rulemaking.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/uyeda-statement-cip-registered-investment-advisers-exmpt-reporting-advisers-051324#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>&nbsp; It also dilutes the quality of public comments submitted in response to the proposal.&nbsp; Commenters seeking to analyze this proposal have no way of knowing the baseline against which the requirements of the proposal should be assessed.&nbsp; That baseline will be set by FinCEN on a standalone basis in connection with a separate rulemaking initiative.&nbsp; Depending on that outcome, time and money may be spent unnecessarily articulating why certain investment advisory services should be excluded, thereby diluting attention from more relevant and practical concerns about the proposal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By waiting for FinCEN to finalize its proposal prior to proposing these implementing regulations, the scope of this proposal would have been known, and the Commission and the public would have been better able to analyze its costs and benefits.</p>
<p>For smaller investment advisers, the additional burdens will add to a mountain of new regulations that have been imposed in recent years.&nbsp; While the goals of preventing money laundering and terror financing are laudable, there are legitimate questions as to whether imposing additional burdens on investment advisers will meaningfully contribute to those efforts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For these reasons, I am unable to support this proposal.&nbsp; I thank the staff in the Divisions of Investment Management and Economic and Risk Analysis, and the Office of the General Counsel, as well as the staff at the Department of the Treasury for their efforts.</p>

<div> consultation, draft regulatory technical standards, EBA, credit risk, EU Banking Package
Summary:<br />The EBA is consulting on draft regulatory technical standards for an equivalent mechanism for unfinished property under the EU Banking Package. Deadline for comments is 13 August 2024. A public hearing will be held on 11 June 2024. These standards aim to strengthen the regulatory framework for credit risk and ensure more efficient supervision. The draft RTS specify the conditions for recognizing a property under construction in the own fund requirements calculation under the standardised approach of credit risk. A public consultation is ongoing until 7 August 2024, and interested stakeholders can provide their comments to the EBA. <div>
<p><em style="font-size: 11px;">The EBA plays an important role in the implementation of the EU Banking Package.&nbsp;</em></p>
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<ul>
<li><em>These draft regulatory technical standards are part of the first phase of the EBA roadmap for implementing the EU Banking Package in the area of credit risk.</em></li>
<li><em style="font-size: 11px;">These draft technical standards will contribute to a more a robust regulatory framework, efficient supervision, and enhanced risk control by credit institutions.&nbsp;</em></li>
</ul>
<br />
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today launched a public consultation on its draft regulatory technical standards (RTS) under the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR3) regarding the equivalent mechanism for unfinished property. These technical standards specify the conditions that a legal mechanism should meet in order to recognise a property under construction in the own fund requirements calculation under the standardised approach of credit risk. The consultation runs until 7 August 2024.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The draft RTS clarify that an equivalent legal mechanism requires three conditions to be met:</p>
<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an entity should be required to or have committed in a legally binding manner to ensuring that the property under construction will be finished within a reasonable timeframe;<br />2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this entity should have the legal powers and ability to do so;<br />3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a counter guarantee is provided by a central government or assimilated entities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The consultation paper also presents an alternative approach, with a more comprehensive understanding of the equivalence legal mechanism and aimed to capture completion guarantees already in place in some EU jurisdictions.</p>
<h4>Consultation process</h4>
<p>Comments to this consultation can be sent to the EBA by clicking on the "send your comments" button on the consultation page. Please note that the deadline for the submission of comments is 13 August 2024.</p>
<p>The public hearing on these draft RTS will take place via conference call on Tuesday 11 June 224 from 10.00 to 12.00 CEST. The EBA invites interested stakeholders to register using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/public-hearing-draft-rts-equivalent-mechanism-unfinished-property" title="Public Hearing on draft RTS on equivalent mechanism for unfinished property"><span>this link</span></a>&nbsp;by Friday 7 June 2024 at 16:00 CEST.</p>
<h4>Legal basis and background</h4>
<p>The draft RTS have been developed according to Article 124(12) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR), as amended by the CRR3.&nbsp;</p>

<div> Promotion, FINRA, Executive Vice President, Examinations, Membership Application Program <br />
Summary: FINRA promotes Solomon to EVP of Examinations and Membership Application Program to oversee examination programs and membership application processes.<br /> <div>
<p>FINRA announced today that it has promoted&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/about/executives/michael-solomon">Michael Solomon</a>&nbsp;to Executive Vice President of Examinations and Membership Application Program, effective immediately. Solomon has taken on an expanded leadership role since rejoining FINRA in 2022 as a Senior Vice President and Head of Examinations. Solomon continues to report to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/about/governance/executives#member">Greg Ruppert, Executive Vice President, Member Supervision</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Michael Solomon" src="https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/2024-05/michael-solomon-300x178.png" /></p>
<p>Solomon will continue to lead FINRA&rsquo;s National Examination Program, which was consolidated over the past 18 months to include all exams conducted by FINRA. In that role, he is responsible for overseeing approximately 750 examiners and managers and all aspects of the program, including strategic direction and execution, operations, continuous improvement, and key internal and external relationships.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Examinations program is a crucial component of FINRA&rsquo;s regulatory operations, and FINRA staff conduct more than 1,000 examinations a year to determine compliance with FINRA&rsquo;s rules, federal securities laws and regulations, and when applicable, exchanges&rsquo; rules. Member firms are examined at least once every four years and as often as annually, depending on the risk profile of the firm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Regular and thorough examinations are critical to maintaining strong investor protection and often uncover and remedy problems before they can harm investors,&rdquo; Ruppert said. &ldquo;Michael's continued leadership and experience, both as a regulator and in global financial services firms, will serve him well as he brings his vision and understanding of this evolving industry to our Examinations team and Membership Application Program.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I look forward to continuing to utilize a risk-based approach to our oversight and leading our talented teams dedicated to&nbsp;identifying and sharing emerging trends and patterns that present risks to the investing public, the broker-dealer industry and the securities markets,&rdquo; Solomon said.</p>

<div> enforcement, digital asset exchanges, Falcon Labs, CFTC, registration
Summary: 
The CFTC settled charges against Falcon Labs for failing to register as a futures commission merchant, facilitating access to digital asset exchanges, and will pay penalties. <div>
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today issued an order simultaneously filing and settling charges against&nbsp;Falcon Labs, Ltd., an entity organized under the laws of the Seychelles, for failing to register with the CFTC as a futures commission merchant (FCM), as required. This marks the CFTC's first action against an unregistered FCM that inappropriately facilitated access to digital asset exchanges.</p>
<p>Falcon Labs is ordered to cease and desist from acting as an unregistered FCM by providing U.S. persons access to digital asset derivatives trading platforms. The order also requires Falcon Labs to pay $1,179,008 in disgorgement and a $589,504 civil monetary penalty. The reduced civil monetary penalty reflects Falcon Labs&rsquo; substantial cooperation with the CFTC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement, as detailed in the order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The CFTC&rsquo;s enforcement program has made clear it will not tolerate digital asset exchanges that fail to register with the CFTC or comply with the agency&rsquo;s rules that maintain integrity in the derivatives markets,&rdquo; said Director of Enforcement Ian McGinley.</p>
<p class="x">&ldquo;And now the CFTC is taking the fight one step further by, for the first time, charging an&nbsp;intermediary&nbsp;that inappropriately facilitated access to those exchanges.&nbsp;Today&rsquo;s action highlights that the CFTC will not hesitate to charge any entities&mdash;exchanges or intermediaries&mdash;who are providing customers access to digital asset products and services that require registration but have failed to appropriately register.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="x">&ldquo;In recognizing Falcon Labs substantial cooperation and remediation in this order in the form of a lower penalty, the CFTC hopes to encourage other digital asset intermediaries operating illegally to come forward and report their activities to the agency.&rdquo;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Case Background</p>
<p>The order finds from approximately October 2021 through at least March 27, 2023, Falcon Labs solicited or accepted orders for digital asset derivatives from customers located in the U.S. Throughout this period, Falcon Labs functioned as an intermediary facilitating customer trading on various digital asset exchanges, including institutional customers located in the U.S. Falcon Labs provided its customers with direct access to exchanges by first creating a main account in its own name and then creating associated sub-accounts. The exchanges generally did not require, and Falcon Labs generally did not provide, customer-identifying information for the sub-account holders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The order finds Falcon Labs collected net fees of approximately $1,179,008 from customers entering into digital asset derivative transactions intermediated by Falcon Labs. As recognized in the order, Falcon Labs voluntarily improved its controls for identifying the location of its customers after the CFTC filed its complaint against&nbsp;Changpeng Zhao, Binance Holdings Limited, Binance Holdings (IE) Limited, Binance (Services) Holdings Limited and Samuel Lim, which alleged in relevant part that prime brokers opened &ldquo;sub-accounts&rdquo; through which U.S.-located customers traded digital asset derivatives on the Binance platform. [See CFTC Press Release No.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8680-23">8680-23</a>]</p>
<p>The Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this matter are Candy Haan, Joseph Platt, Joseph Patrick, Elizabeth N. Pendleton, Scott Williamson, and Robert T. Howell.</p>
<p>* * * * * * *</p>
<p>The CFTC strongly urges the public to verify a company&rsquo;s registration with the CFTC before committing funds. If unregistered, a customer should be wary of providing funds to that company. A company&rsquo;s registration status can be found using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nfa.futures.org/basicnet/">NFA BASIC</a>.</p>
<p>Customers and other individuals can report suspicious activities or information, such as possible violations of commodity trading laws, to the Division of Enforcement via a toll-free hotline 866-FON-CFTC (866-366-2382),&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/complaint">file a tip or complaint&nbsp;</a>online, or contact the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.whistleblower.gov/">Whistleblower Office</a>. Whistleblowers may be eligible to receive between 10 and 30 percent of the monetary sanctions collected paid from the CFTC Customer Protection Fund financed through monetary sanctions paid to the CFTC by violators of the CEA.</p>

<title>CFTC Warns Students And Job Seekers Not To Become “Money Mules”</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cftc-warns-students-and-job-seekers-not-to-become-money-mules/</link>

<div> scams, money mules, crypto-assets, criminal organizations, CFTC <br />
Summary: Criminal organizations are targeting students and job seekers for money mule scams involving crypto-assets, leading to potential criminal charges. Protect yourself and report any suspicious activity. <br /><br /> <div>
<p><span><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission&rsquo;s Office of Customer Education and Outreach (OCEO) today issued a customer advisory warning students and other job seekers looking for remote work to be aware of the warning signs and dangers of &ldquo;money mule&rdquo; scams. Money mule scams involve individuals sending and receiving money into their bank accounts, digital wallets, or spot-market crypto trading accounts as part of their job duties or at the direction of others.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The warning comes as part of CFTC&rsquo;s participation in the global Money Mule Initiative, an annual international effort to disrupt money laundering networks. During this year&rsquo;s Money Mule Initiative campaign, the U.S. Department of Justice reported, agencies took actions against more than 3,000 money mules, including criminal charges against 24 individuals.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&ldquo;Young people looking for summer jobs may be just looking for part-time income and could be attracted to offers that require being online a few hours a day,&rdquo; said OCEO Director Melanie Devoe. &ldquo;Unfortunately, they could become unwitting accomplices to money laundering or what the criminals call &lsquo;money mules,&rsquo; and that association could land them in jail.&rdquo;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Criminal organizations rely on networks of people to move illicit funds between bank accounts, currencies, and blockchains in an attempt to evade law enforcement. In some cases, the criminals involve people who may not realize they are participating in a criminal scheme. They may think they&rsquo;re helping a friend, doing a favor for a love interest, or performing job duties. However, the consequences &ndash; often in the form of criminal charges &ndash; remain the same for witting and unwitting participants.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The 2024 paper by University of Texas researchers John Griffin and Kevin Mei, &ldquo;<span><span>How Do Crypto Flows Finance Slavery? The Economics of Pig Butchering,&rdquo;</span></span>&nbsp;states relationship confidence frauds, also known as financial grooming frauds, rely on crypto-assets. An estimated $75 billion has moved through digital wallets connected to these frauds, the study said. Law enforcement is getting better at tracing and seizing stolen assets on blockchains, so criminals are motivated to &ldquo;off-ramp&rdquo; or convert their tokens to dollars, and may recruit unwitting accomplices to do so.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Money mule scam victims may also be directed to &ldquo;on-ramp&rdquo; cash to a blockchain by converting cash to crypto using bitcoin kiosks or other methods, and then sending the assets to different digital wallets. Another common practice is &ldquo;smurfing&rdquo; or receiving a large crypto-asset payment to a digital wallet and then sending smaller amounts to a list of other digital wallets. Money mules are commonly paid by keeping a portion of the ill-gotten gains they received.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Over the past year, the CFTC brought charges in two cases that allegedly involved money mule activity. [See CFTC Press Release Nos.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8850-24"><span>8850-24</span></a><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8841-23"><span>8841-23</span></a><span>]</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><strong><span>About the Office of Customer Education and Outreach (OCEO)</span></strong></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>OCEO is dedicated to helping customers protect themselves from fraud or violations of the Commodity Exchange Act through the research and development of effective financial education materials and initiatives. OCEO engages in outreach and education to retail investors. The office also frequently partners with federal and state regulators as well as consumer protection groups. The CFTC&rsquo;s full repository of customer education materials can be found at:&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect"><span><span>https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect</span></span></a><span>.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><i><span>Customer Advisory: Don&rsquo;t Become an Unwitting Money Laundere</span></i><span>r is available in full below and on&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/MoneyMules.html"><span>CFTC.gov</span></a><span>.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p align="center"><span><span>*****</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Criminal organizations are targeting students and people looking for easy stay-at-home income. The online offers say all you have to do is set up bank accounts, send or receive money, convert dollars to crypto-assets or vice-versa, or receive funds to buy merchandise and deliver the goods to a third-party. For your time and trouble, you get to keep some of the money you receive.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>In reality, transnational criminal organizations use the recruits&rsquo; unsuspicious accounts to make it harder for law enforcement to trace the funds the criminals have stolen through fraud or other serious crimes such as human trafficking or illegal drug sales. The criminals call them &ldquo;money mules&rdquo; &mdash; people who, at someone else&rsquo;s direction, receive and move assets. Law enforcement calls it money laundering, and it could land you in jail if it continues unreported. Your identity could also be reused by the criminals.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Besides job seekers who may believe offers to be &ldquo;secret shoppers&rdquo; or &ldquo;payment processors&rdquo; are legitimate, other people may think they are helping a friend through an urgent or difficult situation, but may actually be victims of a&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/romancefrauds"><span>romance or friendship confidence scam</span></a><span>. Relationship confidence scams, which the criminals call &ldquo;pig butchering&rdquo; frauds, fuel much of these vast and sophisticated money laundering networks.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>What to look for</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Off-ramping.</span></span><span>&nbsp;One of the easiest ways for criminals to move money is via crypto-assets on a blockchain, such as Tether (USDT) on the Tron blockchain, or bitcoin. Meanwhile, law enforcement is getting better at tracing and seizing stolen assets. So, the criminals need to convert their tokens to dollars or &ldquo;off-ramp&rdquo; money from the blockchain. The criminals might send coins to a digital wallet and instruct you to move the money to your digital-asset trading account, convert the crypto to dollars, and move the cash from your bank to another account.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>On-ramping.</span></span><span>&nbsp;Criminals could also want you to move dollars to the blockchain by accepting cash, using it to buy crypto-assets&mdash;sometimes at a bitcoin kiosk&mdash;and forward the crypto to another wallet.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Smurfing.</span></span><span>&nbsp;In this situation, you might receive a large amount of crypto to your digital wallet or trading account and you are asked to send several smaller amounts to a list of wallet addresses.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Remember</span></span></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span><span>Moving money for illegal activities can lead to criminal and civil charges.</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>If you are approached online and asked to move money, immediately end communications.</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>If you have already received money or crypto assets from a person you met online, do not send it to anyone else. Notify your financial institution and consider changing accounts and wallet addresses, especially if you have provided any personally sensitive information about yourself, bank, or crypto-asset trading accounts.</span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><span>Immediately notify the FBI&rsquo;s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ic3.gov/">ic3.gov</a>, and contact your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices">local FBI field office</a>.

<title>Statement On Customer Identification Program, SEC Chair Gary Gensler, May 13, 2024</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/statement-on-customer-identification-program-sec-chair-gary-gensler-may-13-20/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/statement-on-customer-identification-program-sec-chair-gary-gensler-may-13-20/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="content aside statement">
<div class="article-body">
<p>Today, the Commission is considering a joint rule proposal with the U.S. Department of Treasury to help guard against illicit financial activity. The proposed rule is designed to align investment adviser Customer Identification Program obligations with those of other financial entities. I support this rule because it could reduce the risk of terrorists and other criminals accessing U.S. financial markets to launder money, finance terrorism, or move funds for other illicit purposes.</p>
<p>Congress enacted the Bank Secrecy Act in 1970 to fight against money laundering, the financing of terrorism, and other illicit financial activity. Such activities enable criminals, distort markets, and can have negative consequences for the public. The Bank Secrecy Act also helps protect U.S. national security.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gensler-statement-customer-id-program-05-13-24#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>In the Bank Secrecy Act, Congress set forth recordkeeping and reporting obligations for entities they deemed &ldquo;financial institutions.&rdquo; Further, they authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to designate other entities as &ldquo;financial institutions&rdquo; from time to time. To address illicit finance risks in the investment adviser industry, the Treasury Department recently proposed to designate certain investment advisers as &ldquo;financial institutions&rdquo; under the Bank Secrecy Act.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gensler-statement-customer-id-program-05-13-24#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;That rule proposal would subject certain investment advisers to anti-money laundering and countering of the financing of terrorism requirements, including obligations to file Suspicious Activity Reports.</p>
<p>In 2001, Congress amended the Bank Secrecy Act through Section 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gensler-statement-customer-id-program-05-13-24#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;These 2001 amendments required that financial institutions had to implement Customer Identification Programs. Subject to the Department of Treasury completing their related rule, today&rsquo;s proposal would help extend this mandate to certain investment advisers, thus filling a gap in the current U.S. regime to guard against illicit financial activity. Currently, investment advisers have not generally been required to implement comprehensive obligations under the Bank Secrecy Act.</p>
<p>The proposed rule is designed to make it more difficult to use false identities to establish customer relationships with investment advisers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s proposed rule would require registered investment advisers and exempt reporting advisers to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement procedures to verify the identity of any person seeking to open an account to the extent reasonable and practicable;</li>
<li>Maintain records of the information and methods used to verify the person&rsquo;s identity. Such records would enhance investment advisers&rsquo; internal compliance efforts and help them to detect and take measures to prevent potential illegal activity; and</li>
<li>Determine whether the person appears on any federal government-provided lists of known or suspected terrorists or terrorist organizations.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>The proposed rule would align investment adviser CIP obligations with those of other entities. Such harmonization would help reduce the risk of terrorists and other criminals accessing U.S. financial markets by using investment advisers to launder money, finance terrorism, or move funds for other illicit purposes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian Nelson, and the staff of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network for working with the SEC on this joint rule.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also like to thank members of the SEC staff for their work on this rule proposal, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Natasha Vij Greiner, Sarah ten Siethoff, Melissa Harke, Tom Strumpf, Adele Murray, Daniel Levine, Thoreau Bartmann, and Matthew Cook in the Division of Investment Management;</li>

<title>ISDA Publishes DC Review And Launches Market Consultation</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-publishes-dc-review-and-launches-market-consultation/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-publishes-dc-review-and-launches-market-consultation/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ISDA has published an independent review on the structure and governance of the Credit Derivatives Determinations Committees (DCs) and launched a market-wide consultation on its recommendations.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/a/lS1gE/DC-Review-Report-042924.pdf">review was conducted by Linklaters LLP</a>&nbsp;and covers the composition, functioning, governance and membership of the DCs. The report makes several recommendations on possible changes that could be made to improve the structure of the DCs, which are now&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/05/13/market-consultation-on-issues-and-solutions-from-the-independent-review-of-the-cds-determinations-committees/">available on the ISDA website for public consultation</a>. Boston Consulting Group has been appointed to oversee the consultation process, which will remain open until July 26, 2024.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A robust, standardized settlement process for credit default swaps (CDS) that is binding on all market participants is absolutely critical for central clearing, which, in turn, significantly reduces risk in the financial system. While the DCs have functioned well for 15 years, we think it&rsquo;s appropriate for the industry to consider whether any changes could be made to improve the structure and governance of the process. We look forward to receiving industry comments on the changes proposed by Linklaters as part of its independent review,&rdquo; said Scott O&rsquo;Malia, ISDA&rsquo;s Chief Executive.</p>
<p>The proposals for consultation include:</p>
<p><span>Conflicts of interest</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Should the DC rules provide for the appointment of up to three independent members of the DCs (with one acting as DC chairperson)?</li>
<li>Should the rules enhance the minimum requirements on DC members&rsquo; compliance procedures?</li>
<li>Should be DCs be permitted, by a simple majority, to refer DC questions to an independent panel for a decision?</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>DC composition</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Should the number of dealer members of the DCs be reduced to eight and the number of non-dealer members be reduced to four (in addition to central counterparties and any independent members)?</li>
<li>Should the eligibility threshold to serve as a non-dealer DC member be reduced from the current $1 billion in CDS notional outstanding referencing a single reference entity?</li>
<li>Should a non-dealer be able to volunteer for membership of individual DCs, rather than having to join all the DCs?</li>
<li>Should the provisions relating to consultative dealer and non-dealer members be removed?</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Governance</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Should a separate governance body be established, with responsibility for overseeing the operation of the DCs (including reporting to market participants and obtaining feedback from them) and making changes to the DC rules from time to time (in lieu of the DCs)?</li>
<li>Should the governance body be able to appoint independent auditors to audit DC members&rsquo; compliance procedures under the DC rules?</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Representation and transparency</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.isda.org/2023/12/14/isda-launches-independent-review-of-dc-process/">ISDA announced in December 2023</a>&nbsp;that it had launched an independent review of the DC process to determine if any changes are necessary to maintain the integrity of the DCs in changing economic and market conditions.</p>
<p>Following the results of the consultation, ISDA will work with members to propose specific changes to implement any of the measures that receive broad public support. ISDA will then recommend these solutions to the DCs, which are solely responsible for agreeing and implementing any changes.</p>
<p>The DCs were introduced in 2009 as a centralized decision-making body to enable a standardized auction settlement process and ensure central clearing could be implemented for CDS. Although ISDA does not control the DC rules and is not involved in the decision-making process or administration of the committees, ISDA has an interest as a global trade association for over-the-counter derivatives in ensuring the DCs continue to function robustly.</p>
<p>The DCs are industry committees currently comprising up to 10 sell-side and five buy-side voting firms. More information about the DCs and the decision-making process is available on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdsdeterminationscommittees.org/">DC website</a>.</p>
<p>On January 26, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdsdeterminationscommittees.org/dc-rules/">DCs announced</a>&nbsp;they are considering whether certain changes should be made to the DC rules. This initiative is separate from ISDA&rsquo;s independent review of the DCs.</p>

<title>SEC, FinCEN Propose Customer Identification Program Requirements For Registered Investment Advisers And Exempt Reporting Advisers</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-fincen-propose-customer-identification-program-requirements-for-registered/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-fincen-propose-customer-identification-program-requirements-for-registered/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today the Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Department of the Treasury&rsquo;s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) jointly proposed a new rule that would require SEC-registered investment advisers (RIAs) and exempt reporting advisers (ERAs) to establish, document, and maintain written customer identification programs (CIPs). The proposal is designed to prevent illicit finance activity involving the customers of investment advisers by strengthening the anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) framework for the investment adviser sector.</p>
<p>Under this proposal, RIAs and ERAs would be required to implement reasonable procedures to identify and verify the identity of their customers, among other requirements, in order to form a reasonable belief that RIAs and ERAs know the true identity of their customers. The proposed rule would make it more difficult for criminal, corrupt, or illicit actors to establish customer relationships &mdash; including by using false identities &mdash; with investment advisers for the purposes of laundering money, financing terrorism, or engaging in other illicit finance activity.</p>
<p>This proposed rulemaking complements a separate FinCEN proposal in February 2024 to designate RIAs and ERAs as &ldquo;financial institutions&rdquo; under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and subject them to AML/CFT program requirements and suspicious activity report (SAR) filing obligations, among other requirements. That proposal cites a&nbsp;<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/US-Sectoral-Illicit-Finance-Risk-Assessment-Investment-Advisers.pdf">Treasury risk assessment</a>&nbsp;that identified that the investment adviser industry has served as an entry point into the U.S. market for illicit proceeds associated with foreign corruption, fraud, tax evasion, and other criminal activities. Together, these proposals aim to prevent illicit finance activity in the investment adviser sector and further safeguard the U.S. financial system.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The proposed rule is designed to make it more difficult to use false identities to establish customer relationships with investment advisers,&rdquo; said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. &ldquo;I support this proposal because it could reduce the risk of terrorists and other criminals accessing U.S. financial markets to launder money, finance terrorism, or move funds for other illicit purposes.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Criminal, corrupt, and illicit actors have exploited the investment adviser sector to access the U.S. financial system and launder funds,&rdquo; said FinCEN Director Andrea Gacki. &ldquo;This proposal would help investment advisers better identify and prevent illicit actors from misusing their services, while advancing a harmonized set of CIP obligations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rule, if adopted, would require RIAs and ERAs to, among other things, implement a CIP that includes procedures for verifying the identity of each customer to the extent reasonable and practicable and maintaining records of the information used to verify a customer&rsquo;s identity, among other requirements. The proposal is generally consistent with the CIP requirements for other financial institutions, such as brokers or dealers in securities and mutual funds.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/proposed/2024/bsa-1.pdf">proposal is published</a>&nbsp;on SEC.gov and will be published in the Federal Register. The public comment period will remain open for 60 days after publication of the proposing release in the Federal Register.&nbsp;A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/bsa-1-fact-sheet.pdf">fact sheet</a>&nbsp;on the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is available.</p>

<div> transmission, monetary policy, communication, Federal Reserve, central banking
Summary:<br />Evolution of Federal Reserve communications, Loretta Mester's contributions, current communication channels, research advancements, and communication challenges.<br /> <div>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br />Thank you, Ed, for the kind introduction and for the opportunity to speak.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20240513a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a></p>
<p>You and the organizers of this conference have put together an excellent program on a very important topic, central bank communication, which is key for effective transmission of monetary policy to the economy. To fulfill our dual mandate of promoting maximum employment and price stability, it is vital that we make good monetary policy decisions and that we communicate those decisions to the public effectively.</p>
<p>Today, I'll do three things. First, I'll discuss the channels that the Federal Reserve currently relies on in its communications with the public. Second, I'll offer a few historical examples of how economic thinking on monetary policy communication has evolved over time. Along the way, I'll highlight how President Mester has contributed to this evolution. And, finally, I'll share some thoughts on the communication challenges that policymakers face.</p>
<p><strong>Current Federal Reserve Communication Channels</strong><br />Currently, Fed policymakers communicate often. The Fed publishes a statement after every Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, FOMC minutes three weeks following each meeting, a Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) four times a year, and monetary policy, financial stability, and supervision and regulation reports twice a year. The Chair holds a press conference after every FOMC meeting and testifies in front of Congress on the&nbsp;<em>Monetary Policy Report</em>&nbsp;twice a year. Other written communications from the Board and the 12 Federal Reserve Banks, as well as policymakers' speeches, interviews, and other appearances, help inform the public about the Fed's goals and its strategies to achieve those goals.</p>
<p>Communication isn't only about talking, it's about listening also. Listening is reflected in our activities. In addition to listening to the steady beat of economic data, the Board and the Reserve Banks conduct numerous surveys of financial market participants, businesses, and families. Some of what we hear is summarized in the Beige Book published eight times a year. And the Fed has many forms of community outreach, including&nbsp;<em>Fed Listens</em>&nbsp;events where Fed policymakers go into local communities to hear directly from people living and working there. Alternatively, sometimes representatives from communities come to us. For example, earlier this year, I heard from a rancher, a manufacturing consultant, and the head of a nursing school at one of these events.</p>
<p>Today, it's widely accepted that clear communication contributes greatly to the effective transmission of monetary policy, especially because clear communication can affect the expected path of interest rates and financial conditions more generally. Loretta, in one of her speeches, describes very well the role of central bank communication: "The public will have a better understanding of monetary policy when policymakers are clear about their policy goals, those aspects of the economy monetary policy can and can't influence, and the economic information that influences their forecasts and policy decisions" (Mester, 2018).</p>
<p>She went on to explain that when policymakers are systematic in their policy responses to changing economic conditions, the public will have a better idea of how the Committee's monetary policy is likely to change in response to anticipated and unanticipated economic developments. In particular, she noted: "With such knowledge, households and firms can plan better; they can make better saving, borrowing, investment, and employment decisions" (Mester, 2018).</p>
<p><strong>The Evolution of Federal Reserve Communications</strong><br />The view reflected in Loretta's words seems commonplace now, but it wasn't always so. When Loretta joined the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia in 1985, the FOMC didn't disclose its interest rate decisions. It didn't even report that it had made a decision. In 1981, Karl Brunner, the Swiss monetary economist, called central banking an esoteric art and lamented central banks' "inherent impossibility to articulate its insights in explicit and intelligible words and sentences" (Brunner, 1981). At the time, central banking wisdom dictated that monetary policymakers should say as little as possible. Some research of that vintage tried to rationalize this "secrecy" through the notion that monetary policy would be particularly effective if it surprised markets.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20240513a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a></p>
<p>In the 1990s, central bank communication changed dramatically. In 1993, the Fed started to publish FOMC meeting minutes in their current form, and in 1994, it began releasing FOMC meeting transcripts with a five-year lag. In February 1994, the Fed started to publish post-FOMC meeting statements following meetings at which there was a change in the intended federal funds rate. In May 1999, the FOMC started to publish statements after every meeting, even on occasions when there was no change in policy. By then, the move toward greater transparency was fully embraced by Chairman Greenspan, who had once prided himself on "mumbling with great incoherence."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20240513a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a></p>
<p>There were two primary reasons for this change. First, it was thought that greater transparency would demonstrate the Fed's accountability to the public and safeguard its political independence. Second, there was a growing appreciation in the economics profession that clarity about policy could improve macroeconomic outcomes. Expectations became a focal point in academic and policy circles with the emergence of New Keynesian models in the 1990s as a framework for monetary policy. In these models, aligning the expectations of decisionmakers in the private sector with those of policymakers produced superior economic outcomes.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20240513a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;Mike Woodford, one of the developers of the New Keynesian model, put it this way: "Not only do expectations about policy matter, but . . . very little&nbsp;<em>else</em>&nbsp;matters" (Woodford, 2005, p. 402). Communicating a policy strategy and following through on it increased the credibility of the central bank and, therefore, its ability to steer expectations and the economy. Clear communication also helped stabilize the economy and keep inflation closer to target because, when the Fed clearly articulated a reaction function, financial markets would be able to anticipate the likely future course of monetary policy and help the central bank do its work by affecting long-term rates and other asset prices.</p>
<p>During the tenure of Chairman Bernanke, there was another burst of innovation in the way monetary policy was communicated. In 2007, the first SEP was published to convey systematically the economic outlook of FOMC participants. In 2011, Chairman Bernanke started holding press conferences after every other FOMC meeting. In 2012, the Fed adopted an explicit inflation target of 2 percent and started publishing individual FOMC participants' views on the appropriate future path of the federal funds rate, now famously known as the "dot plot."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20240513a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;During these years, Loretta, in her capacity as the research director at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, contributed to ongoing work on communications, in collaboration with policymakers and Federal Reserve Board staff.</p>
<p>Of course, this was an extraordinary time for monetary policy, as interest rates in most advanced economies were close to zero following the Global Financial Crisis. The FOMC employed forward guidance&mdash;explicit communication about the future path of the policy rate&mdash;as a key tool to deal with the unprecedented situation. The research community had found that such forward guidance could be very effective in the context of the New Keynesian paradigm.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20240513a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;When Loretta became president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland in 2014, she supported the continued use of forward guidance during these extraordinary times, in particular to communicate a lower-for-longer policy that could provide accommodation in the presence of the effective lower bound constraint. She also insisted that forward guidance could be used effectively even in normal times as a means of clarifying the FOMC's reaction function.</p>
<p>Loretta, as a member of the FOMC subcommittee on communications, developed and advocated for several proposals to improve communications. One proposal was to publish a measure of uncertainty surrounding the SEP forecast numbers. She was concerned that uncertainty could be underestimated by the public if it wasn't communicated. The proposal was adopted, and "fan" charts showing uncertainty associated with the median projections have been a feature of the SEP materials since 2017. Progress toward greater transparency and more effective communication has since continued. For example, since 2019 Chair Powell has been holding a press conference after every FOMC meeting.</p>
<p>Researchers at academic and policy institutions have made advances in recent years in measuring the effectiveness of central bank communication. For example, several researchers are now using natural language processing techniques to analyze the impact of central bank communications&mdash;including statements, press conferences, speeches, and minutes&mdash;on asset prices and economic outcomes.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20240513a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;Another development is the identification of the effect that Federal Reserve policy communications may have on asset prices using high-frequency financial market data. This empirical strategy has allowed researchers to establish new facts. For example, some economists have found that policymaker speeches affect asset prices as much as the information released via FOMC statements and press conferences, and the effects that central bank communications have on asset prices can differ, depending on whether the communication conveys news about the policy rate path or about the economic outlook.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20240513a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a></p>
<p><strong>Communication Challenges Facing Policymakers</strong><br />As my brief retelling indicates, we have come a long way. Over the past 30 years, the Fed and many other central banks have embraced transparency and deliberately used their communications as a policy tool. And researchers keep developing better methods to measure and evaluate our communications.</p>
<p>At this point, you may be wondering how much longer I am going to talk. And that question leads me to the following one, which is salient for my topic today: Are there limits to the benefits of communication?</p>
<p>Surely, sometimes central bank communications can have unintended consequences. Let me give you two examples. First, there is always a risk that policymakers' statements about their economic outlook or their expected future path of the policy rate are interpreted by the public with a false sense of certainty. For example, a data-dependent forward-guidance announcement can be mistaken for a commitment to a fixed path of interest rates. When that interpretation is proven wrong down the road, it can create more volatility and uncertainty than if there had been no announcement. That is why policymakers always make sure to stress the data dependence of future policy decisions. Second, it's also possible that the public misinterprets the views of individual policymakers as a Committee view. The potential for misinterpretation is especially acute when many policymakers speak at the same time and disagree with each other.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20240513a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;The diversity of viewpoints among policymakers lends itself to stimulating debates and, ultimately, better policy. But in such a situation, more communication could increase rather than reduce uncertainty about our policies.</p>
<p>I think we stand to benefit a lot from more research in this area. Important questions include, how does the diversity of views among policymakers affect the effectiveness of communications? And, more generally, what distinguishes effective from ineffective central bank communication?</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />Let me conclude by repeating what I said at the beginning: To fulfill our dual mandate of promoting maximum employment and price stability, we need to formulate good policies and to make sure that our policies are clearly understood. Doing so helps make monetary policy more effective. Therefore, I encourage researchers to continue to address important questions related to central bank communication. Finally, I congratulate President Mester on her outstanding career in the Federal Reserve System and wish her the best of luck in her new adventures.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<title>Hong Kong Securities And Futures Commission Warns Public Of Suspicious Virtual Asset-Related Product “LENA Network”</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/hong-kong-securities-and-futures-commission-warns-public-of-suspicious-virtual-a/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/hong-kong-securities-and-futures-commission-warns-public-of-suspicious-virtual-a/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Authorised, investment, warning, virtual asset, SFC<br />
Summary:<br />The Securities and Futures Commission warns of unauthorized "LENA Network" investment involving virtual assets, cautioning against high-risk schemes and too-good-to-be-true opportunities.<br /><br /> <div>
<p>The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) today warns the public of a suspicious investment product named &ldquo;LENA Network&rdquo; involving virtual asset-related staking, borrowing and lending arrangements, and claiming to offer high returns to investors.</p>
<p>The product has not been authorised by the SFC for offering to the Hong Kong public (Notes 1 and 2).</p>
<p>The SFC notes that information regarding the product and the product itself are accessible to the Hong Kong public via the internet. This led the SFC to post the product and its related information on the SFC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sfc.hk/en/Suspicious-Investment-Products" target="_blank">Suspicious Investment Products Alert List</a>&nbsp;on 13 May 2024.</p>
<p>On this note, the SFC would like to warn investors of &ldquo;staking&rdquo; arrangements relating to virtual assets. As these arrangements could amount to unauthorised collective investment schemes and may be highly risky, their investors have no or very limited protection under the SFO and may lose all their investments. In addition, the public should be cautious and sceptical about &ldquo;too-good-to-be-true&rdquo; investment opportunities, and stay vigilant when making investment decisions (Note 3).</p>
<p>The SFC will take all appropriate actions where there is any breach of the law.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>The product displays characteristics of a collective investment scheme (CIS) as defined in section 1 of Part 1 of Schedule 1 to the SFO. It is an offence under section 103 of the SFO for a person to issue, whether in Hong Kong or elsewhere, an advertisement, invitation or document which is or contains an invitation to the Hong Kong public to acquire an interest in or participate in a CIS, unless the SFC has authorised the issue or an exemption applies. In general, CIS must be sold by an intermediary licensed by or registered with the SFC. Unauthorised CIS may generally be sold to professional investors only.</li>
<li>It is an offence under section 114 of the SFO for a person to carry on, or hold himself out as carrying on, a business in a regulated activity (which will include promoting interests in a CIS) without a licence where required. It is also an offence under section 115 of the SFO for a person to actively market, whether in Hong Kong or from a place outside Hong Kong, to the Hong Kong public any services that the person provides and such services, if provided in Hong Kong, would constitute a regulated activity.</li>
<li>In its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sfc.hk/en/News-and-announcements/Policy-statements-and-announcements/Statement-on-virtual-asset-arrangements-claiming-to-offer-returns-to-investors" target="_blank">Statement on virtual asset arrangements claiming to offer returns to investors</a>&nbsp;issued on 13 December 2022, the SFC reminded investors of the risks associated with virtual asset arrangements (including &ldquo;earnings&rdquo; and &ldquo;staking&rdquo; services) and also the persons engaging in these arrangements that they could amount to a CIS.</li>

<title>Joint Press Release Of The People’s Bank Of China,, The Hong Kong Securities And Futures Commission And The Hong Kong Monetary Authority On Swap Connect Enhancements To Advance High-Quality Opening-Up Of China’s Financial Market</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/joint-press-release-of-the-peoples-bank-of-china-the-hong-kong-securities-and/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>To implement the national strategy to steadily advance the opening-up of China&rsquo;s financial markets, the mutual access between the Mainland and Hong Kong interest rate swap markets (&ldquo;Swap Connect&rdquo;) was launched on 15 May 2023. Since the launch, the trading and clearing arrangements of Swap Connect have been operating smoothly and its trading volume has been on the rise with active participation of Mainland and overseas investors.</p>
<p>As of the end of April 2024, 20 Mainland dealers and 58 overseas investors had conducted more than 3,600 interest rate swap transactions with an aggregate notional amount of approximately RMB1.77 trillion, representing an average daily turnover of RMB7.6 billion or thereabouts in notional amount. The average daily turnover calculated on a monthly basis had increased by around three times from approximately RMB3 billion in the first month after the launch to over RMB12 billion in April 2024, providing Mainland and overseas investors with a convenient and efficient risk management tool to manage their RMB asset allocation.</p>
<p>To further promote the coordinated development of financial derivatives markets in the Mainland and Hong Kong and establish a framework to facilitate high-quality opening-up in the realm of finance, the People&rsquo;s Bank of China, the Securities and Futures Commission and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority have resolved to support the following further enhancements of Swap Connect, after thoroughly reviewing the operational experiences of Swap Connect and carefully considering comments and suggestions from Mainland and overseas investors.</p>
<p>First, to enrich the product types, interest rate swap contracts with payment cycles based on the International Monetary Market dates will be accepted for clearing to align with mainstream products traded globally and meet the diverse risk management needs of Mainland and overseas investors.</p>
<p>Second, to improve the ancillary services, compression service and the clearing of backdated swap contracts as the associated supporting arrangement will be introduced to facilitate participating institutions to manage the notional amount outstanding, lower capital costs, and foster active trading.</p>
<p>In addition, the China Foreign Exchange Trade System (National Interbank Funding Center), the Shanghai Clearing House, and OTC Clearing Hong Kong Limited will roll out other system enhancements and incentive programmes simultaneously to reduce the participation costs of Mainland and overseas investors.</p>
<p>For the next step, the Mainland and Hong Kong regulators will guide the financial market infrastructure institutions in both markets to extend the business collaboration under Swap Connect in a steady and orderly manner and further enhance the operational arrangements of the scheme, with a view to facilitating the steady opening-up of China&rsquo;s financial markets and strengthening Hong Kong&rsquo;s status as an international financial centre.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Temenos Generative AI is transparent and explainable, allowing users and regulators to verify the results produced. Furthermore, with a robust permissions and access security framework, these solutions can transform efficiency, operations, and product management in banking.&nbsp; Temenos Generative AI both addresses the main challenges banks face in deploying and integrating this type of technology with their existing data infrastructure, while also addressing their data security and privacy concerns.</p>
<p>The new Generative AI solutions can be applied in customer and middle office operations or product development, enabling banks to create products in real-time based on customers&rsquo; preferences. The new solutions help banks augment the power of their users and their expertise with the insights drawn from Explainable and Generative AI.&nbsp;They can be deployed as standalone for banks, connecting with their existing core systems with minimal integration.

<div> securities regulation, economics, financial markets, challenges, gradualism
Summary:
- Role of Economists in Regulation vital.
- Economic Analysis under uncertainty.
- Gradualism in Regulation essential.
- Need for Ex Post Analysis.
- Regulatory Approach based on Methodological Challenges. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to deliver the lunch keynote address at the Commission&rsquo;s 11th Annual Conference on Financial Market Regulation. The SEC&rsquo;s Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, led by Chief Economist Jessica Wachter, has spent much time and energy to hold this conference. I also appreciate our partners at the University of Maryland&rsquo;s Center for Financial Policy and Lehigh University&rsquo;s Center for Financial Services for their contributions to the event. Today&rsquo;s gathering provides a platform that pulls together viewpoints, insights and analysis from academia, industry, and the Commission pertinent to contemporary policy issues facing the financial markets. My remarks today reflect my individual views as a Commissioner and do not necessarily reflect the views of the full Commission or my fellow Commissioners.</p>
<p>By profession, I am a lawyer and not an economist. However, as an undergraduate student, I studied finance. I distinctly recall, as a junior in the fall of 1990, my finance professor coming into class and beaming with excitement at the news that financial economists Harry Markowitz, Merton Miller, and William Sharpe had been awarded the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences. Little did I realize how their work, such as Markowitz&rsquo;s modern portfolio theory, would help shape my views on issues that I face in my current role as Commissioner.</p>
<p>The Commission was created ninety years ago in the midst of the greatest economic calamity that the United States had ever faced. The stock market crash had commenced in 1929 before bottoming out by 1933, with an overall decrease in value that approached 90 percent.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-conference-financial-market-regulation-051024#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;In 1933, the unemployment rate was about 25%<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-conference-financial-market-regulation-051024#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;and real GDP was down 27%.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-conference-financial-market-regulation-051024#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;At the same time, thousands of banks across the country were failing. The Glass-Steagall Act of 1933,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-conference-financial-market-regulation-051024#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act),<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-conference-financial-market-regulation-051024#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act)<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-conference-financial-market-regulation-051024#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;were passed by Congress during this period.</p>
<p>My remarks will describe a regulatory philosophy as applied to the financial markets. It is driven by the obligation to act in accordance with the U.S. Constitution, which lays out the separation of legislative, executive, and judicial powers. Staying within the parameters of the Commission&rsquo;s statutory authority under the laws enacted by Congress is mandatory, not optional. The Commission also must act in furtherance of its mission to protect investors, to maintain fair, order, and efficient markets, and to facilitate capital formation. What is the role that economics can play in this mission?</p>
<p>Given the assumption of perfect information and a few other assumptions, neoclassical economics holds that competitive markets generally work in promoting the economic welfare of the public. One founder of neoclassical economics, W. Stanley Jevons, thought these assumptions reasonably approximated reality. In 1871, Jevons wrote in his &ldquo;Theory of Political Economy&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The theoretical conception of a perfect market is more or less completely carried out in practice. It is the work of brokers in any extensive market to organize exchange, so that every purchase shall be made with the most thorough acquaintance with the conditions of trade. Each broker strives to gain the best knowledge of the conditions of supply and demand, and the earliest intimation of any change.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-conference-financial-market-regulation-051024#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While assumptions may be a useful starting point for analytical and predictive purposes, experience across time has revealed that markets are&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span>&nbsp;necessarily characterized by perfect information, an important distinction. The problem of asymmetrical information between a buyer and a seller may result in what economists refer to as &ldquo;agency cost.&rdquo; This asymmetry can lead to sub-optimal outcomes, as economist George Akerlof described in his Nobel-winning paper &ldquo;The Market for Lemons.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-conference-financial-market-regulation-051024#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;Fraud can be an aspect of this asymmetry. History also teaches that, if left unpoliced, the financial markets are susceptible to these failures, which can cause them to implode.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-conference-financial-market-regulation-051024#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<p>Law professor Bernard Black, in applying the Lemon&rsquo;s Principle to the securities markets, observed that &ldquo;[jurisdictions that fail to adequately address these market failures have] fallen into what insurance companies call a &lsquo;death spiral,&rsquo; in which information asymmetry and adverse selection combine to drive almost all honest issuers out of the market and to drive share prices to zero.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-conference-financial-market-regulation-051024#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;One of the Commission&rsquo;s responsibilities is to prevent that outcome from happening and the work of economists assists those efforts.</p>
<p>By any measure, the initial set of federal securities laws passed by Congress ninety years ago during the Great Depression have held up well. What the financial markets needed during that period was a concerted effort by the government to set disclosure standards and provide legal tools to remove bad actors from the market. Congress&rsquo;s efforts resulted in a regulatory framework that avoided the death spiral implied by the Lemon&rsquo;s Principle.</p>
<p>In passing the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, Congress could have followed the merit-based approach featured in many contemporaneous state securities laws, but it did not. Instead, Congress chose to rely on market mechanisms, while addressing informational asymmetries through disclosure. This approach provided the foundation for the subsequent success of the U.S. financial markets to date, which facilitate capital formation and the resulting prosperity from economic growth, jobs creation, and innovation.</p>
<p>Congress gave additional direction through the National Securities Markets Improvements Act of 1996,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-conference-financial-market-regulation-051024#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;which requires the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&amp;height=800&amp;iframe=true&amp;def_id=15-USC-1283237621-452767504&amp;term_occur=999&amp;term_src=">Commission</a>, when engaged in rulemaking, to consider, &ldquo;in addition to the protection of investors, whether the action will promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-conference-financial-market-regulation-051024#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;This obligation often requires the Commission to consider potential trade-offs. In so doing, the Commission should pursue analytical and evidence-based methods. In other words, the Commission should be scientific in its approach to the maximum extent possible. But what does that mean and what does it entail?</p>
<p>As a general matter, scientific discovery has provided modern conveniences to our economy and society, many of which are taken for granted by the public today &mdash; whether they are automobiles and aircraft; heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems; mobile phones with applications and worldwide connectivity; clean water; medicines, antibiotics, and medical devices; rockets, satellites, and space travel; and electronic trading.</p>
<p>But how can science apply to the study of the financial markets? What does it mean to apply the scientific method in that context? Are there aspects of the scientific method that apply differently? Are there limitations on what can be learned about financial markets through the scientific method? With what confidence can the results of such analysis be applied? By applying methodological tools to the study of the financial markets, economists can make an important contribution. Hopefully, these efforts will provide insight about efficiency, competition and capital formation, and gauge any tradeoffs among them.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s divide this discussion into three parts. First, a brief summary of a few philosophers of science and what they have stated regarding what science can and cannot do.</p>
<p>Second, a discussion on the analytical challenges presented by today&rsquo;s financial markets, which might limit the ability to understand the effects and possible unintended consequences of regulation.</p>
<p>Third, describing a regulatory approach in light of the analytical challenges inherent to the financial markets. This approach focuses on steady, evidence-based gradualism that recognizes the limits of regulator knowledge, maximizes the scope of decentralized innovation through the markets and market intermediaries, and embraces economic analysis as a key tool for navigating this complex terrain.</p>
<p>While it may not be surprising, an approach to regulate the financial markets using a gradualist, evidence-based approach is grounded in traditional methodological fundamentals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Methodological Insights from the Philosophy of Science</span></p>
<p>What are the methodological challenges in applying economics to the financial markets? Let&rsquo;s start with a fundamental insight described by Scottish philosopher and economist David Hume, who died in 1776, which was the same year as the publication of Adam Smith&rsquo;s&nbsp;<i>Wealth of Nations</i>&nbsp;and the signing of the American Declaration of Independence.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-conference-financial-market-regulation-051024#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>&nbsp;Hume argued that one cannot establish truth through induction&mdash;that is, through repeated observation. No matter how many times that a set of conditions appears to result in a particular outcome, it does not necessarily mean that it will be true the next time. As Hume stated in&nbsp;<i>A Treatise of Human Nature</i>, &ldquo;there can be no demonstrative arguments to prove, that those instances, of which we have had no experience, resemble those, of which we have had experience.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-conference-financial-market-regulation-051024#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>&nbsp;The reason is that no matter how many times a potentially causal relationship is observed, it is unknown whether there might be another causal element of which one is unaware. Or, as securities lawyers put it, past performance is no guarantee of future results. This is known as the Problem of Induction.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-conference-financial-market-regulation-051024#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></p>
<p>British philosopher Bertrand Russell made an amusing point in his book&nbsp;<i>The Problems of Philosophy</i>.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-conference-financial-market-regulation-051024#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>&nbsp;An inductive chicken notices that when the door to the chicken coop opens and the farmer appears, chicken feed soon appears. After observing this numerous times, the chicken concludes that this is a causal truth. When the chicken hears the door open, it runs out expecting to be fed. One day, a causal condition changes of which the chicken was unaware, and that destroys the predictive content of its inductively derived truth. The change of condition is that the farmer is hungry. Thus, the farmer grabs that first chicken and has it for dinner. So much for inductive reasoning.</p>
<p>If one cannot discern the truth from observation, how can one know it at all? Milton Friedman answers in his&nbsp;<i>Essays in Positive Economics</i>. He argues that while one cannot know that whether a model is true, one can know if it has predictive content. Friedman posits that the task of &ldquo;positive economics&rdquo; is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>to provide a system of generalizations that can be used to make correct predictions about the consequences of any change in circumstances. Its performance is to be judged by the precision, scope, and conformity with experience of the predictions it yields.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-conference-financial-market-regulation-051024#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to Friedman, what matters is the model&rsquo;s predictive power as &ldquo;theory is to be judged by its predictive power for the class of phenomena which it is intended to explain.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-conference-financial-market-regulation-051024#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a>&nbsp;With this approach, Friedman attempts to avoid the problem of whether the model is true by pointing out that the ultimate criterion should be whether the model is useful in terms of predictive content. Friedman&rsquo;s approach, however, still leaves the problem of knowing which model to select based on the empirical evidence&mdash;what might be called the problem of theory choice&mdash;and what to do if there are counterexamples with respect to the predictive content of the model.</p>
<p>Philosopher Karl Popper, who was at the London School of Economics for a time, had an answer.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-conference-financial-market-regulation-051024#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a>&nbsp;Popper noted that there was a fundamental asymmetry between corroboration and falsification. With corroboration, irrespective of how many times a seemingly causal connection is observed, it cannot be proven. In contrast, with falsification, it takes only one counterexample to disprove a proposition.</p>
<p>As Aristotle notes, one would think that one could conclude that all swans are white, if enough of them were observed.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-conference-financial-market-regulation-051024#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a>&nbsp;But it turns out that induction does not even work in terms of Aristotle&rsquo;s famous example, which was disproven by a single observation in Australia of a black swan.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-conference-financial-market-regulation-051024#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a>&nbsp;That is Popper&rsquo;s point, which is the potential for falsification lies at the heart of good science and appropriate methodology. As Popper describes, &ldquo;it is only in searching for refutations that science can hope to learn and to advance. It is only in considering how its various theories stand up to tests that it can distinguish between better and worse theories and so find a criterion of progress.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-conference-financial-market-regulation-051024#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a></p>
<p>Popper asks: if proof cannot be accomplished through the process of induction, then what is the nature of science? He based his concept of good science on the asymmetry between corroboration and falsification.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-conference-financial-market-regulation-051024#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a>&nbsp;Popper argues that the essence of science is generating hypotheses that can be maintained tentatively as possibly true in that they must have predictive content consistent with what has been observed. At the same time, those hypotheses must not have been falsified by a counterexample, even though framed in a manner that would render them susceptible to falsification. Thus, good science constitutes tentatively held theories that have survived in the face of the potential for counterexamples. Good science was not so much about corroborating the content, but rather testing it for falsification against potential counterexamples. In other words, good scientists should try to disprove their own work.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-conference-financial-market-regulation-051024#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a></p>
<p>For example, if a person hypothesized that water boils at 100 degrees centigrade, he or she might hire research assistants with Bunsen burners to corroborate the proposition over and over again. But knowledge might advance faster if one tried to disprove the proposition, in which case it might try boiling water on a mountain top and find that the hypothesis did not apply there. In that case, one might consider modifying the hypothesis to factor in air pressure.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-conference-financial-market-regulation-051024#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a></p>
<p>In sum, Popper&rsquo;s view of science is as a process of bold, falsifiable hypotheses combined with ruthless efforts to falsify them, with the resulting hypotheses maintained as possibly true and tentatively held. This is not too different than the methodological perspective espoused by Friedman. As Friedman states, &ldquo;[f]actual evidence can never &lsquo;prove&rsquo; a hypothesis; it can only fail to disprove it, which is what we generally mean when we say, somewhat inexactly, that the hypothesis has been &lsquo;confirmed&rsquo; by experience.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-conference-financial-market-regulation-051024#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a></p>
<p>There are a few problems with Popper&rsquo;s view. First, most scientists do not spend extensive time trying to disprove their own work. Second, an &ldquo;observation&rdquo; that might constitute a counterexample may itself be wrong, and this is a potentially significant problem. Third, in actual scientific practice, a theory that confronts a counterexample may not necessarily be disposed.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-conference-financial-market-regulation-051024#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a>&nbsp;If that theory has some uses where it has predictive power, it may be retained until a better theory comes along, even if the original theory has been disproven in some applications. Also, a theory that appears to be falsified through a potential counterexample might be modified in a manner where the counterexample is deemed a mere &ldquo;anomaly.&rdquo; For example, if a planet is not quite where the theory says it should be, one might hypothesize the presence of a small but thus far unobserved gravitational presence that is just beyond it and pulling it out of orbit.</p>
<p>Philosopher Imre Lakatos, who was a student of Popper, addressed some of these critiques. Lakatos described science as competing research programs.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-conference-financial-market-regulation-051024#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[28]</a>&nbsp;A &ldquo;research program&rdquo; consists of an interrelated set of hypotheses that is tested by identifying anomalies and transforming them into corroborated content by adjusting the model or theory. Within a given discipline, that is often deemed the real test of the scientist. Can they take a research program and extend its predictive content through such refining adjustments to address the seeming anomalies presented? The result of such a research program is not growth of proven content, but a growth in predictive content and perhaps a growth in knowledge.</p>
<p>While Lakatos&rsquo; approach might not result in an absolute truth, it can be used as a means of improving predictive capabilities. Friedman agreed with this methodological insight. Friedman referred to such promise within a competing theory as &ldquo;fruitfulness.&rdquo; He explained: &ldquo;[a] theory is &hellip; more &lsquo;fruitful&rsquo; the more precise the resulting prediction, the wider the area in which the theory yields predictions, and the more additional lines for research it suggests.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-conference-financial-market-regulation-051024#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29">[29]</a>&nbsp;If you are a junior scientist entering the field, you would want to work on a &ldquo;fruitful&rdquo; research program to make your mark.</p>
<p>Thus, good science entails a process by which the predictive content of research programs increases across time by transforming anomalies into corroborated content, even if unexplained anomalies remain. The professionalization of economics as a discipline reflects in part the prowess of the Lakatosian approach. In response to an anomaly, if an adjustment is made to a theory that results in both corroborated excess empirical content and the retention of unrefuted content, then it is rational to accept the new adjusted theory and reject the old theory. The reason is not because the new adjusted theory is proven, but rather because it is better than the old theory.</p>
<p>Now, having described methodological insights from the philosophy of science, how does one apply them to the financial markets?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The Analytical Challenges Inherent in Financial Markets</span></p>
<p>From a methodological perspective, fully capturing concerns about investor protection, efficiency, competition and capital formation in the financial markets is challenging. One reason is that the financial markets have developed and continue to evolve at a rapid pace. Because of the complexity of this ecosystem, developing a theoretic framework with corroborated content across time is very challenging. The Lakatosian approach may prove to be difficult to apply if what one is trying to model keeps changing. In the financial markets, constant developments and innovations result from the interaction of technological, regulatory, infrastructural, and demographic changes, which, in turn, shift incentives resulting in further evolution.</p>
<p>The fundamental problem is that we are not examining investor protection, efficiency, competition, and capital formation in a steady state ecosystem. Rather, it is fast-changing, with multiple drivers of the change that are in constant flux. The effect of a particular driver may vary over time. These drivers keep shifting among each other, often in nuanced and sometimes unpredictable ways. The systematic and diligent application of research program to enhance the corroborated content of models takes time. But what happens when the markets being studied move so fast that what may have previously constituted corroborated content is now rendered false by the evolution of that ecosystem?</p>
<p>From a methodological point of view, this matters. The &ldquo;problem of induction&rdquo; becomes more severe in this context. Model content that may be accurate and corroborated at one point in time may become false, and falsifiable, in the next period of time. Does this mean that economic analysis is doomed from the start? I think not.</p>
<p>Such a fast-moving system means that more economic analysis is needed, not less. Economic analysis must also be conducted on a continual basis because the likelihood of changing conditions altering the findings is high. Given that the Commission is trying to understand policy decisions across a complex ecosystem in a relatively short order &mdash; often meaning less than a year or so, not over a period of years &mdash; that makes the contribution of economists to the Commission&rsquo;s decision-making process more vital. Because many of the emerging changes to the ecosystem are imposed by the Commission itself in the form of regulatory reforms, the Commission has an obligation to engage its economists to analyze the overall impact of these reforms. It is not sufficient only to analyze each reform in isolation.</p>
<p>One substantial constraint on economics as a science is that economics largely is not and cannot be an experimental science. As Friedman describes:<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-conference-financial-market-regulation-051024#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30">[30]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Economics as a positive science is a body of tentatively accepted generalizations about economic phenomena that can be used to predict the consequences of changes in circumstances. Progress in expanding this body of generalizations, strengthening our confidence in their validity, and improving the accuracy of the predictions they yield is hindered not only by the limitations of human ability that impede all search for knowledge but also by obstacles that are especially important for the social sciences in general and economics in particular to them. &hellip; The necessity of relying on uncontrolled experience rather than on controlled experiment makes it difficult to produce dramatic and clear-cut evidence to justify the acceptance of tentative hypotheses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Friedman&rsquo;s insights hit hard with respect to regulatory policymaking in the financial markets. If the Commission is engaged in rulemaking, how does the Commission know what the impact of that rule will be on investor protection, efficiency, competition, and capital formation if it has never observed a world with such a rule in it and generally cannot do so before adopting it? The Commission is generally not in a position to conduct an experiment to test the effects of a rule. A prior attempt by the Commission to engage in a pilot program as a means of gathering data was successfully opposed in court.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-conference-financial-market-regulation-051024#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31">[31]</a>&nbsp;Other times, the relatively short tenures of Commission leadership often leave less incentive to conduct long-term research. By not engaging in experiments, the Commission cannot hold other variables constant when evaluating potential policy choices.</p>
<p>Of course, this challenge does not mean that the Commission should refrain from estimating the effects of its proposals. However, the Commission&rsquo;s ability to do so with a high level of confidence is limited. But this is only the beginning of the methodological challenges.</p>
<p>Other challenges include that the financial system is fraught with positive and negative feedback loops that render many non-linear responses and may result in non-normal probability distributions.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-conference-financial-market-regulation-051024#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32">[32]</a>&nbsp;There can be sudden and unanticipated mass shifts in behavior as markets receive new information. For example, market variables that may normally not be correlated with one another become correlated in the midst of a panic.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-conference-financial-market-regulation-051024#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33">[33]</a>&nbsp;These shifts in correlations during a panic often render recent data taken from a period&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span>&nbsp;characterized by panic as irrelevant and even misleading. However, even if one were to examine a previous historical panic to obtain data, the system, and its causal interrelationships, may have evolved from that earlier period, also rendering that data potentially misleading. This can make it difficult to predict potential unintended consequences of a change in the regulatory framework.</p>
<p>In the midst of these challenges, how likely is the occurrence of Hume&rsquo;s problem &mdash; that there is a variable that matters to a particular prediction but was not observed through empirical efforts? The many variables and changing correlations make the financial markets difficult to analyze. Like history, what holds in one moment, may not hold in the next. There is also the risk that one can be &ldquo;fooled by randomness.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-conference-financial-market-regulation-051024#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34">[34]</a></p>
<p>Additional complexities are introduced by the types of principal-agent conflicts that characterize many aspects of the financial markets. One can partition principal-agent conflicts into three categories: (1) simple conflicts, such as where the agent favors itself ahead of clients or is embezzling money from clients, (2) conflicts where the agent favors some clients over others, such as allocating profitable trades to preferred clients, and (3) conflicts favoring some lines of business over others, such as unloading bad initial public offerings on retail brokerage customers to support an investment banking client. Various components of financial services can be bundled and unbundled over time, resulting in shifts in business models. With these new business models, the potential for new principal-agent conflicts arises.</p>
<p>When a financial services firm has multiple lines of business, they often have different categories of customers. In the normal course of business, some business lines will be more profitable than others. With respect to customers, some are more sophisticated and better at monitoring potential principal-agent issues than others, and some customers have the leverage to bargain for contractual terms that tend to mitigate those issues. In such circumstances, there is a temptation to favor the more profitable lines of business at the expense of the less profitable lines of business, especially if the customers of the more profitable businesses are less sophisticated. The bundling of some functions into one entity, and the outsourcing of other functions, may sometimes be driven by such opportunities.</p>
<p>Adding to the complexity of issues facing regulators is the continuing advances in information technology and connectivity. Financial services are an information intensive industry, and the digital era continues to promote rapid changes in business models. In particular, technology has had a significant impact on the cost structures of various components of financial services, thereby prompting various forms of unbundling, rebundling, outsourcing, disintermediation and reintermediation. Reduction in transaction costs can change the optimal organizational boundaries of any given financial service firm, since it may be cheaper to outsource and monitor the quality of certain functions than to provide such functions internally.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-conference-financial-market-regulation-051024#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35">[35]</a></p>
<p>Although the Exchange Act is nearly 90 years old, Congress, in its great wisdom, embedded a degree of nimbleness by authorizing the Commission to facilitate innovation through rules and exemptive applications. The Commission also has discretion as to how to enforce the federal securities laws. The Commission&rsquo;s staff, while not empowered to act on behalf of the Commission absent an express delegation of authority, has issued no-action letters and guidance. These efforts are attempts to respond to changing market conditions in a manner that benefits market participants. One particularly effective method is to draft principles-based regulations that anticipate innovation and avoid prescriptive measures that might become outdated. Effective regulators provide timely guidance to the industry when faced with new technological approaches. More importantly, effective regulators can play a significant role in helping market participants consider different perspectives on the interaction of technology and regulation.</p>
<p>Amidst these complexities, the financial markets are fraught with network externalities. An economist might describe a network externality as any framework, standard, system or technology where the more people that use it, the more the benefit of being a user of it. The classic example is the telephone system. When only a small number of persons had access to the telephone system, there was not much utility. As more persons who are added to the telephone system, it became exponentially more useful for all of them. In a way, this is the opposite of the &ldquo;scarcity&rdquo; assumption that drives so much of economic analysis.</p>
<p>The trading of securities, and the phenomenon of liquidity itself, involve network externalities. The more people who participate in a trading venue, the more likely they will find counterparties, and there will be more liquidity for all participants. As frequently heard by market participants, &ldquo;liquidity begets liquidity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Network externalities, when combined with traditional economies of scale, can make the financial markets susceptible to oligopolistic or monopolistic tendencies. For example, there might be a propensity for one exchange platform to dominate. Should that result occur, there could be negative ramifications, such as a reduction in innovation and more rent-seeking behavior.</p>
<p>In their book&nbsp;<i>Information Rules</i>, economists Carl Shapiro and Hal Varian describe the economic pattern inherent in a network as follows:<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-conference-financial-market-regulation-051024#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36">[36]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Technologies subject to strong network effects tend to exhibit long lead times followed by explosive growth. The pattern results from positive feedback: as the installed base of users grows, more and more users find adoption worthwhile. Eventually, the product achieves critical mass and takes over the market. . . . But network externalities are not confined to communications networks. They are also powerful in &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; networks . . . Because these virtual networks of compatible users generate network externalities, popular hardware and software systems enjoy a significant competitive advantage over less popular systems. As a result, growth is a strategic imperative, not just to achieve the usual production side economies of scale but to achieve the demand side economies of scale generated by network effects. . . . Once you have a large enough customer base, the market will build itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a networked context, regulation may play an important role in facilitating competition, especially given the contrary dynamic provided by network externalities. For example, in railroad law there is &ldquo;common carrier&rdquo; regulation, which is an attempt to ensure some competitive uses of that network.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-conference-financial-market-regulation-051024#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37">[37]</a>&nbsp;Similarly, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 attempted to promote competition through ensuring competitive access to what was known as the &ldquo;last mile.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-conference-financial-market-regulation-051024#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38">[38]</a></p>
<p>The point here is a simple one. An important objective of securities regulation is to promote competition. However, because of the power of network externalities, it can be difficult to achieve the proper balance. Even if the regulator can obtain an appropriate balance that succeeds in promoting competition, technological change can throw off that balance by altering cost structures and it is possible for that the entire network can be affected by changing types of information connections and interflows. Thus, maintaining a competitive ecosystem can be fragile.</p>
<p>In short, the financial markets are characterized by asymmetries of information, evolving issues of agency cost, positive and negative feedback loops, network externalities, and informational intensity. The financial markets are highly susceptible to changes in technology and communications, which can quickly change the economic incentives for the outsourcing and insourcing of functions. Thus, the financial markets constitute a very noisy system, hard to fully grasp in real time, evolve rapidly, and, at best, are a moving target in terms of developing useful models to predict the impact of regulatory changes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The Vital Contribution of Economics to Securities Regulation</span></p>
<p>In the midst of these challenges, how can economists contribute to the discussion &ndash; even if the complexities of the financial markets make it difficult to develop corroborated content of a model? My view is that economists are important to the Commission&rsquo;s policy considerations, particularly in light of these analytic challenges. Economists serve as gatekeepers, helping to inform the Commission as to whether a proposed regulatory action is consistent with its statutory requirement to consider whether the action will promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation. It is imperative that the agency&rsquo;s economists conduct their analyses in an objective manner and that the Division&rsquo;s cost-benefit analysis is not simply a&nbsp;<i>post hoc</i>&nbsp;exercise to justify a predetermined policy outcome.</p>
<p>First, economists have a comparative advantage in analyzing the impacts of incentive structures, and estimating the consequences, including unintended consequences. The results of that analytic and empirical work, as applied to financial markets, can be nuanced and often unexpected. In particular, we need economists to employ their analytic and evidence-based skills in tracing and measuring the impact of shifting conflicts of interest that can potentially undermine the markets&rsquo; ability to facilitate capital formation and harm investors.</p>
<p>Second, economists, with their various models, can bring to bear insights and hypotheses that may be different than those from lawyers and accountants. There needs to be competition among a wide variety of hypotheses and evidence-based criticism thereof, which is an activity to which economists are well-position to engage in. It is vital that multiple perspectives are brought to bear on the costs and benefits of the Commission&rsquo;s rules.</p>
<p>Third, economists not only need to do quality cost-benefit analysis prior to the adoption of a rule, but they need to regularly conduct ex post cost-benefit analysis as well. The Commission should be regularly reviewing its rules and regulations across time to identify those which are excessively costly in light of the benefits they bring and, more importantly, those which may be counterproductive in terms of unintended consequences.</p>
<p>Fourth, the Commission&rsquo;s economists need to be interacting on a regular basis with other interested economists through both internal and external research efforts. These interactions cannot be limited solely to economists in academia, but also in the industry and in government. For that reason, today&rsquo;s gathering is a testament to that interaction.</p>
<p>Precisely because of the challenges in financial regulation, the Commission needs exposure to as many schools of thought pertinent to its mission &ndash; and all of them need to be constantly pressure tested through evidence-based criticism.</p>
<p>To the greatest extent possible, financial regulators such as the Commission should engage in evidence-based policymaking. However, given the analytical challenges inherent in the securities markets, this process is inevitably judgment laden. Exercising that judgment is the responsibility of the five Commissioners and they need to be provided with the full range of arguments supported by the most reliable and indicative evidence. Economists&mdash;with their toolset and skills&mdash;can play an important role in that process.</p>
<p>Friedman had some interesting comments on the need for judgment in the application of positive economic analysis. In noting that regardless of how successful economists might be in developing a model, there will inevitably remain room for judgment in applying the model. He further stated:<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-conference-financial-market-regulation-051024#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39">[39]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The capacity to judge that these are or are not to be disregarded, that they should or should not affect what observable phenomena are to be identified with what entities in the model, is something that that cannot be taught; it can be learned but only by experience and exposure in the &ldquo;right&rdquo; scientific atmosphere, not by rote. It is at this point that the &ldquo;amateur&rdquo; is separated from the &ldquo;professional&rdquo; in all sciences and that the thin line is drawn which distinguishes the &ldquo;crackpot&rdquo; from the scientist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>Policy Insights Based on the Analytical Challenges of Regulating Financial Markets</span></p>
<p>As a final note, I would like to return to articulating how the Commission should approach regulation. Gradualism is a key component. At any point in time, there is a delicate balance of factors and drivers supporting the financial market ecosystem. The Commission is not in a position to fully grasp it, because it is in constant flux. This is precisely why the Commission should not try to control the capital formation process through any form of merit regulation, but rather provide a regulatory framework that facilitates a competitive and decentralized knowledge process that constitutes the markets themselves. This is the essence of capitalism, and it is driven by the recognition that a centralized planning system lacks sufficient information and knowledge to optimize the allocation of scarce resources.</p>
<p>Gradualism also is pragmatic in light of the often unforeseen and unintended effects of regulatory policy on the financial markets. It is reminiscent of the quote from Prussian military theorist Carl von Clausewitz: &ldquo;war is the realm of uncertainty; three quarters of the factors on which action is based are wrapped in a fog of greater or lesser uncertainty.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/uyeda-remarks-conference-financial-market-regulation-051024#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40">[40]</a>&nbsp;His observation could be equally pertinent to financial regulation.</p>
<p>Recognizing the limitation of knowledge, the Commission should remain focused on addressing key market externalities and not attempt to re-order the decentralized pricing system that has served the capital markets so efficiently and is vital to the nation&rsquo;s continued prosperity. In regulating the financial markets, the Commission should consider refraining from addressing theoretical concerns with respect to aspects of the markets that are generally working well. The financial markets are a delicate ecosystem and the danger of unintended consequences&mdash;the unknown unknowns&mdash;always loom large.</p>
<p>Economic analysis and insight should be part of every stage of the rulemaking process. It is needed to identify the issues in the financial markets that might need to be addressed from a regulatory perspective. It is needed to contemplate alternative ways of addressing the issue. It is needed as the Commission develops rule proposals. It is needed when the Commission considers rule adoptions. It is needed within the Commission&rsquo;s enforcement and examination programs. And it is certainly needed&nbsp;<i>ex post</i>&mdash;to look back at the Commission&rsquo;s various rules, regulations, and forms, including the interaction among them&mdash;to ensure that they are effective and cost-efficient.</p>
<p>This is a long-winded way of saying thank you for the great work that economists are doing to advance understanding of the financial markets and to thank you for this conference.</p>

<title>State Banking Representative Superintendent Adrienne A. Harris Statement On FSOC Nonbank Mortgage Servicing Report - Statement By Superintendent Adrienne A. Harris New York State Department Of Financial Services On The Report On Nonbank Mortgage Servicing By The US Financial Stability Oversight Council</title>

<div> report, nonbank mortgage market, state regulators, coordination, supervision <br />
Summary: The report discusses the state regulators' efforts to supervise nonbank mortgage companies, and the need for better coordination and supervision. It also recommends reforms to strengthen the market. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>First, I would like to acknowledge the work of the FSOC Secretariat, Federal Reserve, and Ginnie Mae staff who led the drafting of the report. I am proud to be here today representing the CSBS and my fellow state financial regulators. Having the state perspective here today is critical because states are the primary prudential regulators of nonbank mortgage companies.</p>
<p>This market has changed considerably since the 2008 financial crisis. In 2008, nonbank mortgage companies had servicing rights on four percent of mortgages. Fourteen years later, in 2022, that had increased over 13 times to 54 percent of the market. Along with that period of enormous growth, market participants have experienced a rapidly changing credit environment and market conditions.</p>
<p>As today&rsquo;s report shows, over this period, states have been working to enhance supervision of these entities. The report also acknowledges, however, that state regulators and federal agencies need to do more. We can better coordinate supervision and strengthen regulatory tools, working together to maintain a safe and sound financial system.</p>
<p>Since the 2008 crisis, state regulators have increased collaboration on the supervision of nonbank mortgage companies. The states have established model prudential standards, raising the bar for supervision across the country. We also have adopted new processes and tools to license and examine these institutions on a multi- state basis.</p>
<p>But the report rightly notes more work is needed to facilitate robust, real-time information sharing among state regulators and federal supervisors of the mortgage sector.</p>
<p>Like FSOC has recommended over the past decade, I support efforts to strengthen coordination. This includes the recommendation that Congress remove legal impediments to information sharing between Ginnie Mae and state regulators. Collaboration between state regulators and federal agencies is key to ensuring that the housing market and homeowners are protected at all times, particularly during periods of economic volatility or stress.</p>
<p>I would also like to highlight a few other findings in today&rsquo;s report.</p>
<p>First, the FSOC report discusses the costs and complexities of current Ginnie Mae program requirements. These requirements, including servicing advance obligations, contribute to liquidity risk and industry concentration. The report notes that we can strengthen the resiliency of this program by modernizing operational requirements for counterparties. Such reforms also could increase the value of mortgage servicing rights and expand market participation.</p>
<p>Next, the report recommends that state regulators require the largest nonbank servicers adopt recovery and resolution plans. Given the growth in this industry, such plans could be useful in promoting normal market functions in times of economic stress. If adopted, regulators should develop requirements that recognize the unique characteristics of the nonbank mortgage market, including the contractual restrictions on counterparties that affect execution of such plans. But to be effective, such plans cannot be a one-time exercise left to sit on a shelf collecting dust until a crisis strikes. They must be practical, actionable, tested and kept up to date.</p>
<p>The report also recommends the establishment of a liquidity fund for nonbank mortgage servicers that are in bankruptcy or distress. Additional efforts to mitigate servicing disruptions make sense, but creating new liquidity programs raises complex operational and policy questions that warrant further development. A feasibility study to fully explore these issues will help policymakers make informed, data-driven evaluations of proposals, including considerations of unintended consequences.</p>
<p>I know all policymakers can agree that continued close collaboration and innovation by state regulators and federal agencies will strengthen our mortgage market.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s report provides a helpful snapshot of the current state of the nonbank mortgage market and provides a set of thoughtful initial recommendations. I look forward to working with my fellow Council members, Congress, and my colleagues in the states to further analyze and develop these proposals.</p>
<p>Together we will continue to foster the health and stability of a nonbank mortgage market that serves and protects all consumers.</p>

<div> Workshop, IFRS, Sustainability Disclosure, TSE, SSE Initiative,<br />
Summary:<br />
TSE held a workshop on IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards, emphasizing the importance of sustainability, aligning strategies, identifying risks, and promoting transparency. <div>
<p><i>A workshop on IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards was held by Tehran Securities Exchange (TSE) in collaboration with the UN&rsquo;s Sustainable Stock Exchanges (SSE) Initiative and attending of around two hundred participants.</i></p>
<p>Dr. Mahmoud Goudarzi, TSE&rsquo;s CEO made an opening speech to the workshop on 7 May 2024, appreciating the organizers of this unprecedented event in Iran&rsquo;s capital market, and noted that in line with the implementation of the corporate governance regulations and the significance of sustainability disclosure in it, the listed issuers are called for a new approach to the environmental, social and economic principles.</p>
<p>The instructors of this workshop were representatives from SSE Initiative, IFRS Sustainability, as well as IFC, and it was aimed at familiarizing companies with the international sustainability disclosure standards and how to implement the principles.</p>
<p>The first part of this workshop dealt with the issue of what conceptual framework sustainability standards are based on and what information and what features it has and where and how it should be disclosed. In the second part, efforts were made to enable companies to align their disclosure strategies with international sustainability disclosure standards and also consider their geographical or industry-related obligations. In the next section, guidance was provided on identifying sustainability opportunities and risks, assessing the importance of related information, evaluating strategy and the company&rsquo;s ability to cope with climate risks. The final topic was the effective and efficient transfer of sustainability-related topics and the company&rsquo;s ability to deal with climate issues to the audience of sustainability reports.</p>
<p>The modern concept of sustainability considers that while making a profit today is important, we need to think about the long-term effects of our activities and the availability of resources in the future. Disclosure of sustainability information leads to increased transparency, brand promotion, making sound investment decisions and increased competitiveness of companies.</p>

<div> originated, vulnerabilities, risks, recommendations, sectors
Summary:<br />Nonbank mortgage servicing sector vulnerabilities identified. Recommendations to address liquidity risks, safe operations, and ensure continuity of servicing operations. Council to continue monitoring risks. 

Summary: <div>
<p>The Financial Stability Oversight Council (Council) today released its&nbsp;<em>Report on Nonbank Mortgage Servicing</em>. &nbsp;The report documents the growth of the nonbank mortgage servicing sector and the critical roles that nonbank mortgage servicers play in the mortgage market. &nbsp;It identifies certain key vulnerabilities that can impair servicers&rsquo; ability to carry out these critical functions and describes how these vulnerabilities could amplify shocks to the mortgage market and pose risks to financial stability.&nbsp; The report includes the Council&rsquo;s recommendations to enhance the resilience of the nonbank mortgage servicing sector, drawing on existing authorities of state and federal regulators and also encouraging Congress to act to address the identified risks. &nbsp;The report was drafted by Council member agencies in coordination with the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The nonbank mortgage servicing sector plays an important role in our economy, and the Council has produced a comprehensive analysis of risks in the sector and is making concrete recommendations to protect U.S. financial stability,&rdquo; Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen said.&nbsp; &ldquo;We need further action to promote safe and sound operations, address liquidity risks, and enable continuity of servicing operations when a servicer fails. &nbsp;Moving the Council&rsquo;s recommendations forward is crucial to protecting borrowers and preventing disruptions to economic activity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 2022, nonbank mortgage companies (NMCs) originated approximately two-thirds of mortgages in the United States and owned the servicing rights on 54 percent of mortgage balances.&nbsp; NMC market share has risen significantly since its low in 2008, when NMCs originated 39 percent of mortgages and owned the servicing rights on only 4 percent of mortgage balances.&nbsp; Nonbank mortgage servicers are 7 of the 10 largest servicers for Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>NMCs bring certain strengths to the mortgage market. &nbsp;However, NMCs also have vulnerabilities, and in a stress scenario, NMCs&rsquo; vulnerabilities could cause NMCs to amplify and transmit the effect of a shock to the mortgage market and broader financial system.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><em>NMC strengths</em>: NMCs are significant mortgage originators and servicers for groups that have historically been underserved by the mortgage market. Some NMCs have also developed technology platforms that enable them to originate mortgages more quickly than their competitors, and others have expanded into specialty default servicing for nonperforming loans and loss mitigation.</li>
<li><em>NMC vulnerabilities</em>: NMCs&rsquo; concentrated exposure to mortgage-related assets means that stress in the mortgage market can lead to adverse effects on their income, balance sheets, and access to credit simultaneously.&nbsp; NMCs&rsquo; obligations to make certain contractually required advances, as well as their reliance on debt that can be repriced, reduced, or canceled in times of stress, can lead to significant liquidity risk, which is exacerbated by high leverage carried by some NMCs.&nbsp; Finally, vulnerabilities are similar across NMCs, so certain macroeconomic scenarios may lead to stress across the entire sector.</li>
<li><em>Transmission channels</em>: When these vulnerabilities compromise NMCs&rsquo; ability to carry out their critical functions, borrowers may suffer from disruptions in the servicing of their mortgages, and Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae may experience sizeable losses. Since NMCs have similar business models and share financing sources and subservicing providers, distress in the NMC sector may be widespread during times of strain.&nbsp; Financial distress at NMCs that is sufficiently severe and widespread could lead to a reduction in servicing capacity and in the availability of mortgage credit. &nbsp;Large servicing portfolios cannot be transferred quickly because the transfer process is inherently resource-intensive and complicated.&nbsp; In addition, it might be difficult to identify another servicer to take over the portfolio, in part because the similarity of NMC business models means that other NMCs may be facing the same stresses at the same time.</li>
</ul>
<p>State regulators and federal agencies have taken steps in recent years to mitigate the risks posed by the rising share of mortgages serviced by NMCs, but the combination of various state requirements and limited federal authorities to impose additional requirements do not adequately and holistically address the risks described in the Council&rsquo;s report.&nbsp; Stress in the sector could harm mortgage borrowers and, more broadly, disrupt the provision of financial services and impair the ability of the financial system to support economic activity.&nbsp; The Council is making several recommendations to address the risks posed by nonbank mortgage servicers identified in the report.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><em>Promoting safe and sound operations</em>: The Council encourages state regulators, as the primary prudential regulators of nonbank mortgage servicers, to enhance prudential requirements as appropriate, adopt enhanced standards in those states that have not yet done so, and further coordinate supervision of nonbank mortgage servicers. State regulators should require recovery and resolution planning by large nonbank mortgage servicers to enhance the financial and operational resilience of the nonbank mortgage sector.&nbsp; The Council also encourages Congress to provide the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) and Ginnie Mae with additional authorities to better manage the risks of NMC counterparties to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and to Ginnie Mae, respectively. &nbsp;Congress should consider providing FHFA and Ginnie Mae with additional authority to establish appropriate safety and soundness standards and to directly examine nonbank mortgage servicer counterparties for, and enforce compliance with, such standards.&nbsp; To facilitate coordination, the Council recommends Congress consider authorizing Ginnie Mae and encouraging state regulators to share information with each other and with Council member agencies, as appropriate.</li>
<li><em>Addressing liquidity pressures in the event of stress</em>: The Council recommends that Congress consider legislation to provide Ginnie Mae with authority to expand the Pass-Through Assistance Program into a more effective liquidity backstop to mortgage servicers participating in the program during periods of severe market stress. In addition, the Council supports the Department of Housing and Urban Development&rsquo;s ongoing administrative work to relieve liquidity pressures for Ginnie Mae issuers as well as Ginnie Mae&rsquo;s ongoing efforts to explore ways to facilitate financing for relieving liquidity pressures for solvent issuers.&nbsp; Federal agencies should further explore and evaluate how existing policy tools and authorities could be further leveraged to reduce liquidity pressures from servicing advance obligations in times of stress.</li>
<li><em>Ensuring continuity of servicing operations:</em>&nbsp;The Council encourages Congress to consider establishing a fund financed by the nonbank mortgage servicing sector to provide liquidity to nonbank mortgage servicers that are in bankruptcy or have reached the point of failure. The fund should be designed to facilitate operational continuity of servicing, including loss-mitigation activities for borrowers and advancement of monthly payments to investors, until servicing obligations can be transferred in an orderly fashion or the company has been recapitalized by investors or sold.&nbsp; The legislation should outline the scope and objectives of the fund, which include avoiding taxpayer-funded bailouts.&nbsp; The legislation should also provide sufficient authorities to an existing federal agency to implement and maintain the fund, assess appropriate fees, set criteria for making disbursements, and mitigate risks associated with the implementation of the fund. &nbsp;The establishment of such a fund should be accompanied by the additional regulatory authorities and consumer protections recommended in the Council&rsquo;s report.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Council will continue to monitor the evolution of the risks identified in the report and may take or recommend additional actions to mitigate such risks in accordance with the Analytic Framework for Financial Stability Risk Identification, Assessment, and Response that the Council adopted in November 2023, if needed.</p>

<div> mortgage-backed securities, non-bank mortgage servicers, financial system, risks, report
Summary: The report discusses the importance of monitoring non-bank mortgage servicers and their associated risks in the $12 trillion mortgage-backed securities market. It provides recommendations to protect the wider financial system. <div>
<p>Thank you, Secretary Yellen. I thank the staff for their collaboration on the Nonbank Mortgage Servicing Report, which I am pleased to support.</p>
<p>The $12 trillion mortgage-backed securities market is important to everybody who owns a home or one day wishes to own a home.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-fsoc-051024#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;It's also interconnected and integrated with our overall financial system &mdash; and we've seen in the past when problems in the mortgage markets have actually spilled out into our overall economy.</p>
<p>As we witnessed in the Great Financial Crisis of 2008, key failures in both the banking and non-bank sectors caused a collapse that started in the mortgage industry and ultimately destabilized the financial system. It devastated millions of American workers, businesses, and families nationwide.</p>
<p>Since the crisis, we've seen a shift in these markets. As the report details, non-bank mortgage companies have continued to expand their role in the market, increasing the share of residential real estate mortgages they originate and service.</p>
<p>The Council first mentioned the inherent risks of non-bank servicing in its 2014 annual report.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-fsoc-051024#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;This Council should remain vigilant in monitoring the mortgage-backed securities market, including non-bank mortgage servicers and their associated risks &mdash; from liquidity risks to leverage risks and operational risks.</p>
<p>The report under consideration today highlights how these risks are particularly exacerbated in the non-bank servicing market, with recommendations to protect the wider financial system. There are many agencies around this table, starting with the Federal Housing Finance Agency, that play important roles in overseeing these matters. Here at the SEC, we&rsquo;re tasked with overseeing the $12 trillion mortgage-backed securities market.</p>
<p>I support publishing the report, which provides important context, guidance, and legislative guideposts to Congress. I also support the FSOC&rsquo;s consideration of further efforts within its authorities to enhance the resiliency of the financial system.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, Commodity Exchange Act, event contracts, CFTC regulation, public interest
Summary:<br />The Commodity Futures Trading Commission proposed to further specify event contracts that are contrary to the public interest, particularly those involving gaming activities. Comments accepted until July 9, 2024. <br /> <div>
<p><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to further specify types of event contracts that fall within the scope of Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) section 5c(c)(5)(C) and are contrary to the public interest. The Commission has recently observed an increase in the number and variety of event contracts listed for trading by CFTC-registered exchanges. In addition, the Commission has recently received applications for exchange registration, and expressions of interest regarding registration, from entities indicating that they are interested in listing event contracts for trading.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In light of these developments, the Commission proposes to amend CFTC regulation 40.11 to further specify types of event contracts that fall within the scope of CEA section 5c(c)(5)(C) and are contrary to the public interest. The proposal includes a determination that event contracts involving each of the activities enumerated in CEA section 5c(c)(5)(C) (gaming, war, terrorism, assassination, and activity that is unlawful under any Federal or State law) are, as a category, contrary to the public interest and therefore may not be listed for trading or accepted for clearing on or through a CFTC-registered entity.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Further, the proposal defines &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; in detail, and the proposal lists illustrative examples of gaming that include staking or risking something of value on the outcome of a political contest, an awards contest, or a game in which one or more athletes compete, or an occurrence or non-occurrence in connection with such a contest or game. Thus, event contracts involving these illustrative examples of gaming could not be listed for trading or accepted for clearing under the proposal.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Comments must be received on or before July 9, 2024 and will be published on&nbsp;<a href="https://comments.cftc.gov/PublicComments/ReleasesWithComments.aspx">CFTC.gov</a>.</span></span></p>

<title>Remarks By US Secretary Of The Treasury Janet L. Yellen At The Open Session Of The Meeting Of The US Financial Stability Oversight Council</title>

<div> Nonbank mortgage servicing, risks, vulnerabilities, recommendations, impact <br />
Nonbank mortgage servicing risks analyzed, vulnerabilities identified, recommendations for regulatory and Congressional action to address risks and ensure financial stability. <br /><br />Summary: Because of the risks associated with nonbank mortgage servicing, the report identifies vulnerabilities and makes recommendations for regulatory and Congressional action. <div>
<p>Today, the Financial Stability Oversight Council will vote on publishing a report on nonbank mortgage servicing. The Council has highlighted in its annual reports the risks associated with the growing share of mortgages serviced by nonbank mortgage companies. It has also promoted collaboration on this issue among regulators and federal agencies through its Nonbank Mortgage Servicing Task Force. Now, the Council is leveraging its Analytic Framework, published this past November, to undertake a comprehensive analysis of risks on a sector-wide basis and make concrete recommendations to address them.</p>
<p>Nonbank mortgage companies play a critical function in the mortgage market, helping ensure accurate and timely payments to investors and appropriate loss-mitigation options for borrowers. And over the past decade, this sector has only become more important. While no single nonbank mortgage servicer owned the servicing rights on more than 5 percent of outstanding mortgage balances as of the end of 2023, nonbanks collectively originate and service the majority of U.S. residential mortgages. In 2022, they originated approximately two-thirds of mortgages and serviced the majority of mortgage balances. This is a substantial increase from 2008, when they originated 39 percent and serviced 4 percent. The share of outstanding mortgages guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae has also increased. Together, these shifts mean that exposures to the nonbank mortgage sector have grown significantly.</p>
<p>As the report outlines, some of these nonbank mortgage companies have certain strengths, from greater efficiency due to adoption of technology to acting as key mortgage originators and servicers for groups that have historically been underserved.</p>
<p>But nonbank mortgage companies also present unique risks. The report finds that their specialized business model means they are especially susceptible to macroeconomic fluctuations in the housing market, such as changes in housing prices, interest rates, and delinquency rates. They are more reliant than depository institutions on the value of mortgage servicing rights, which may lose value in the event of a downturn in the housing market. And they are also vulnerable because they can have high leverage, short-term funding, and operational risks.</p>
<p>These vulnerabilities matter. If a nonbank mortgage company fails, it may be difficult for it to find funding to continue critical servicing operations, such as making required servicing advances or providing adequate loss mitigation for distressed borrowers. Suspending services can in turn harm borrowers and other stakeholders. Even transferring the portfolio of a distressed servicer is a resource-intensive and time-consuming process, and disorderly servicing transfers can cause additional harm to borrowers. And if a new servicer cannot be found, the federal government may be left to assume the servicing obligations itself. All of these outcomes could disrupt economic activity and the provision of financial services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because the risk profiles of nonbank mortgage companies are similar, stresses in the mortgage market can affect multiple nonbank mortgage companies simultaneously and can also spread throughout the sector. &nbsp;And sufficiently large and widespread disruption in the sector could lead to a temporary restriction of mortgage credit. This would make credit more expensive and difficult to obtain, particularly for borrowers who have been historically underserved by the mortgage market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Put simply, the vulnerabilities of nonbank mortgage companies can amplify shocks in the mortgage market and undermine financial stability, and the Council has now laid this out in detail for the first time.</p>
<p>This analysis also points to recommendations to address identified vulnerabilities. As the report finds, current state-based requirements and limited federal authorities mean risks have not been fully addressed. We need further action to promote safe and sound operations, address liquidity risks, and promote continuity of servicing operations when a servicer cannot perform its critical functions.</p>
<p>The Council encourages state regulators to strengthen prudential standards if they have not already done so and to require resolution and recovery planning by large nonbank mortgage servicers to enhance sector resilience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Council also makes recommendations for Congressional action. Congress should consider legislation to authorize and protect the sharing of confidential information, which would facilitate coordination among Council member agencies, state regulators, and Ginnie Mae. Congress should consider providing FHFA and Ginnie Mae with additional authorities to better manage nonbank mortgage company counterparty risk and for Ginnie Mae to expand its Pass-Through Assistance Program into a more effective liquidity backstop. And to facilitate continuity of servicing, the Council encourages Congress to establish a fund financed by the industry to provide liquidity to failing nonbank mortgage servicers to enable their critical servicing operations to continue until servicing obligations can be transferred in an orderly fashion.</p>
<p>Moving these recommendations forward is crucial to protecting borrowers and preventing disruptions to economic activity.</p>
<p>With that, I commend the Council for this important and timely work. And I will now turn to Sandra Lee, Treasury&rsquo;s Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Council.</p>

<div> meeting, Financial Stability Oversight Council, private credit market, nonbank mortgage servicing, report
<br />
The Financial Stability Oversight Council discussed FMUs, private credit market, and approved a report on nonbank mortgage servicing.
<br /><br />Summary: The Council discussed FMUs, private credit market, and approved a report on nonbank mortgage servicing. <div>
<p>Today, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen convened a meeting of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (Council) in executive and public sessions at the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury).&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the executive session, the Council received an update from member agency staff on recent and planned work of the Council&rsquo;s Financial Market Utilities (FMU) Committee, including the committee&rsquo;s review of the eight FMUs that the Council designated in 2012.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Council also received an update from staff of Treasury and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on market developments related to corporate credit, including private credit.&nbsp; While risks remain balanced in credit markets overall, the private credit market has grown substantially and is a relatively opaque segment of the broader financial market that warrants continued monitoring.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the public session, the Council received a presentation on the Council&rsquo;s Report on Nonbank Mortgage Servicing.&nbsp; The Council voted unanimously to approve the issuance of the report.</p>
<p>The Council also voted to approve the minutes of its previous meeting on February 23, 2024.&nbsp;</p>

<div> Federalism, CFTC, Event Contracts, Gaming, State Regulation
Summary:
- Commissioner dissents from Event Contracts Proposal
- Emphasizes the importance of federalism and state regulation of gaming
- Raises concerns about the proposal's legal impact
- Criticizes the proposal for misunderstanding the law and overstepping the CFTC's role
- Highlights specific areas for public comment
- Raises concerns about new delegation of authority, missing comment letters, and misplaced election integrity concerns
Summary: <div>
<p><span><span><span><span>I respectfully dissent from the Event Contracts Proposal because it takes the CFTC&rsquo;s regulation of event contract markets backwards with its fundamental misunderstanding of how we regulate derivatives and the States regulate gaming. Instead of thoughtfully considering how to effectively regulate these markets while fostering innovation, the Event Contracts Proposal ties itself in knots over the bounds of gaming, which Congress has neither asked nor directed the Commission to regulate. I am simply disappointed in this wasted opportunity to regulate retail binary options, sidestepping our responsibility, and concerned about its legal impact.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The United States is built on a foundation of federalism. Federalism reflects the Founders&rsquo; understanding that a one-size-fits-all approach would not work for this country, and allows for States to govern in ways that best suit their residents.</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024b?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;The simple language of the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution (&ldquo;The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people&rdquo;) emphasizes that the Federal government is a government of limited and enumerated powers.</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024b?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;The Tenth Amendment, importantly, protects the American people from Federal encroachment.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>State regulation of gaming, ranging from betting to lotteries, is long-established in the U.S., and is clearly a power reserved to the States.</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024b?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;No one understands their local cultures, economies, and values better than the States,</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024b?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;which leads to State laws that have been crafted to reflect the needs of their residents. This approach has allowed some States to embrace gaming and leverage it as a source of revenue and tourism, while others take a more conservative approach.</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024b?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>When it comes to event contracts related to gaming, I have been clear that the CFTC should exercise caution, primarily because I believe the Commission fundamentally misunderstands the law in this area and Congressional intent.</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024b?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;That fear has proven well-founded with the Event Contracts Proposal.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The CFTC has a role in regulating event contracts as a market regulator, but it is essential that the CFTC does not encroach upon the prerogatives of States. An appropriate Event Contracts Proposal would have struck a balance between Federal oversight and State autonomy by focusing on the CFTC&rsquo;s core mandate of promoting market stability and protecting market participants from fraud and abusive practices.</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024b?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;In doing so, the CFTC could have maintained the integrity of event contracts without undermining the authority of State governments.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Instead, as I will explain below, the Event Contracts Proposal bigfoots into State regulation of gaming by drawing unintelligible lines in the sand that will either at best result in confusion for State gaming authorities, or at worst push event contracts into illegal, unregulated offshore markets.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The Event Contracts Proposal Ignores the Supreme Court&rsquo;s Preemption Doctrine</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The Constitution&rsquo;s Supremacy Clause provides that &ldquo;the Laws of the United States . . . shall be the Supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024b?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;This language is the basis for the doctrine of Federal preemption, according to which Federal law supersedes conflicting State laws.</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024b?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The Supreme Court has identified two general ways in which Federal law can preempt State law: expressly, when a Federal statute or regulation contains explicit preemptive language; and impliedly when its structure and purpose implicitly reflect Congress&rsquo;s preemptive intent.</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024b?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;But the Federal government cannot preempt traditional State powers that are the exclusive domain of States to regulate, recognizing the right to self-determination by the people.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The Event Contracts Proposal uniquely ignores the fact that the limits Congress placed on the Commission&rsquo;s regulation of event contracts&nbsp;<i>save</i>&nbsp;the Commission from becoming a gaming regulator. In other words, the Commission could have relied on implied preemption to regulate event contracts as derivatives in our markets separate and apart from State gaming regulation. Instead, the Commission&nbsp;<i>creates</i>&nbsp;preemption concerns by proposing a gaming definition that incomprehensibly relies so heavily on State law that I don&rsquo;t know how any exchange could understand where the Commission&rsquo;s rules begin and end for these contracts.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Together, under CEA Section 5c(c)(5)(C), Rule 40.11, and the preamble to the final rulemaking for Rule 40.11, whether an event contract is prohibited by Rule 40.11 depends on the underlying activity that the contract is based upon. When the Commission reviewed an exchange&rsquo;s political control contracts, I raised that the underlying activity was political control, which was neither terrorism, assassination, war, gaming, nor unlawful under any Federal or State law.</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024b?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;Therefore, Rule 40.11(a)(1) did not apply. Yet in disapproving the contracts, the Commission argued that &ldquo;<i>taking a position</i>&nbsp;in the Congressional Control Contracts&rdquo; (emphasis added) amounted to gaming.</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024b?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>When taking a position in a derivatives contract is gaming, the Commission starts to look like a gaming regulator. Congress may not compel a State to enact or enforce a regulatory regime,</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024b?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;and indeed, Congress has not here. Yet in doubling down on its logic in the Event Contracts Proposal, when the act of entering into a derivatives contract that meets the Proposal&rsquo;s overbroad definition of gaming, drawn from dozens of State laws, is now gaming under the Commission&rsquo;s jurisdiction, we begin encroaching on State gaming oversight. State-regulated sportsbooks, in trying to comprehend where the Commission&rsquo;s gaming derivatives begin and traditional bets end, will be captured in this confusion and question the need to register with the Commission as exchanges. I certainly don&rsquo;t want the Commission to be registering Las Vegas sportsbooks and other betting venues.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The Commodity Exchange Act is Clear that the Commission&nbsp;<i>Regulates</i>&nbsp;Event Contracts</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Congress has been clear in its direction for the CFTC.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>First, in relevant part, the purpose of the Commodity Exchange Act is to deter and prevent price manipulation or any other disruptions to market integrity; to ensure the financial integrity of all transactions; to protect all market participants from fraudulent or other abusive sales practices and misuses of customer assets; and to promote responsible innovation and fair competition among boards of trade, other markets and market participants.</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024b?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Second, the Commission is authorized to review event contracts if the underlying activity that the contract is based upon is terrorism, assassination, war, gaming, or unlawful under any Federal or State law.</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024b?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Read together, Congress intended that the Commission regulate event contracts within the bounds of the section 5(c) prohibitions. Instead of telling market participants how we will regulate the innovative contracts and exchanges that have appeared in recent years, the Commission has decided to &ldquo;identif[y] the types of event contracts that may&nbsp;<i>not</i>&nbsp;be listed for trading or accepted for clearing&rdquo; (emphasis added), seemingly primarily to avoid the work. If the number of contract reviews has increased, then the Commission should increase its resources and capacity&mdash;not to prohibit public activity.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>As referenced above, the Commission then embarks on a survey of state gaming definitions to insert the concept into the Commission&rsquo;s rules. The Commission even notes the approach &ldquo;reflects the similar approach taken in numerous state gambling statutes,&rdquo; and mentions 35 States. The word &ldquo;state&rdquo; appears in the 95 page release 133 times. The Event Contracts Proposal reads as a defense against becoming a gaming regulator while inserting State gaming into our rules, which is not only confusing but unnecessary because Congress has clearly defined our role with respect to the States.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>To make matters worse, the Commission then leaps from the overbroad, vague definition of gaming to provide examples of the types of event contracts that the Commission believes fall outside of the scope of CEA section 5c(c)(5)(C) and, by extension, Regulation 40.11. Given the fact that the Event Contracts Proposal repeatedly states that the broad range and volume of new contracts motivated this rulemaking, I find it stunning that the outer bounds provided are limited to contracts based on: (1)&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>economic indicators, (2) financial indicators, and (3) foreign exchange rates or currencies.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Instead of creating a framework, the Commission is creating a vast gray area for exchanges. Where gaming begins and the scope of Regulation 40.11 ends is anyone&rsquo;s guess now, and I fear State gaming authorities will be left to figure it out on their own.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Specific Areas for Public Comment</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>In addition to my concerns raised above, I highlight the following specific areas for public comment to aid in review of the Proposal:</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><i><span><span>New Delegation of Authority</span></span></i></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The Event Contracts Proposal contains an alarming new delegation of authority to let staff&mdash;rather than the Commission&mdash;decide when event contracts fall within a prohibited category under Rule 40.11.</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024b?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;Combined with an overbroad definition of gaming, this will exponentially increase the number of&nbsp;<i>self-certified</i>&nbsp;exchange contracts suspended from trading at the whim of staff with no check or oversight from the Commission.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>This stunning overreach flies in the face of the Commission&rsquo;s self-certification framework. I encourage commenters to review this new delegation and comment on whether it upends the self-certification processes exchanges currently employ.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><i><span><span>Missing Comment Letters</span></span></i></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The Event Contracts Proposal completely omits any discussion of the comment letters the Commission recently received on the definition of gaming, as well as Rule 40.11 and event contracts more broadly. All told, the Commission has received around 200 comments in response to requests for public comment on an exchange&rsquo;s political control contracts.</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024b?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;These comments came from exchanges, academics, former CFTC officials, and other industry participants, and were directly on point on the issues raised in today&rsquo;s Proposal.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The Commission cannot selectively decide to tell one side of the story. It strains credulity that the Commission has selective amnesia and makes no mention of these letters in the Event Contracts Proposal.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><i><span><span>Misplaced Election Integrity Concerns</span></span></i></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The Commission gets hung up on the fact that &ldquo;it is not tasked with the protection of election integrity or enforcement of campaign finance laws&rdquo; in justifying prohibiting event contracts based on political contests. However, the Federal Election Commission polices campaigns. Congress has never asked, nor suggested, the CFTC should police elections, much like the Commission has not become the weather police for weather derivatives, or the crop yield police when we have the USDA, the changes to corporate officers or asset purchases police when we have the SEC, the regional insured property losses police when we have state insurance regulators, or the bankruptcy police when we have the courts, or the temperature police.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The Commission&rsquo;s concern over policing elections would be akin to worrying that the Commission might have to look over the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s shoulder to ensure rates increases are fair and become the Fed police.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Conclusion</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>I would like to thank Grey Tanzi, Andrew Stein, Lauren Bennett, Nora Flood, and Vince McGonagle in the Division of Market Oversight for their work on the Proposal.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The contracts causing so much consternation for the Commission have not been, and are not, gaming. If the Commission could accept that and move on, we could have a healthy discussion over how to effectively regulate these markets as we do any other and protect against abusive trading in retail binary options contracts. Instead, we have muddled it and made a mess.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>I look forward to the comments.</span></span></span></span></p>

<div> Securities, Contracts, Prohibition, Economic purpose test, Rulemaking
<br />
The Commissioner dissents from the proposed rulemaking on event contracts, citing legal overreach, lack of justification, and inaccuracies.
<br /><br />Summary: The Commissioner argues against the proposed rulemaking due to legal overreach, lack of justification, and inaccuracies. <div>
<p>I support the Commission<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;undertaking a rulemaking on event contracts, which is long overdue.&nbsp; During my tenure on the Commission, I have consistently called for a rulemaking process to establish a framework for the Commission to exercise the discretionary authority with respect to event contracts that Congress granted to the agency in our governing statute, the Commodity Exchange Act (&ldquo;CEA&rdquo;).<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, though, I cannot support this particular proposed rulemaking (the &ldquo;Proposal&rdquo;).&nbsp; At first blush, it appears to be &ldquo;much ado about nothing,&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3">[3]</a>&nbsp;as it seems to do little more than rubber-stamp what the Commission has already said and done.&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon closer inspection, though, it is a &ldquo;wolf in sheep&rsquo;s clothing&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4">[4]</a>&nbsp;because where the Proposal departs from our past practice, it lays the foundation to prohibit entire categories of potential exchange-traded event contracts whose terms and conditions the Commission has never even seen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In planting the seeds of future bans of countless event contracts, sight unseen, the Proposal&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>Exceeds the legal authority that Congress granted the Commission in the CEA;</li>
<li>Relies heavily on a brief snippet of legislative history consisting of a colloquy between two Senators &ndash; cherry-picking parts of the colloquy it likes, while ignoring other parts of the same colloquy;</li>
<li>Resurrects an &ldquo;economic purpose test&rdquo; for evaluating the public interest that was based on a provision of the CEA that was repealed by Congress nearly a quarter-century ago;</li>
<li>Fails to do the hard work of analyzing the unique nature of event contracts, which are different in kind from traditional derivatives contracts more familiar to the agency;</li>
<li>Relies on unsupported conjecture, treats similar circumstances differently, and raises more questions than it answers; and</li>
<li>Flies in the face of the CFTC&rsquo;s mandate to promote responsible innovation as Congress directed in the CEA.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My dissent should not be taken as an indication that I am a fan of all event contracts.&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is hard not to conclude from the multitude of defects in this Proposal that its significant overreach is motivated more by a seemingly visceral antipathy to event contracts than by reasoned analysis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It does not matter whether we think event contracts are a good idea or a bad idea; the Commission must exercise its authority with respect to event contracts within the scope of the CFTC&rsquo;s legal authority, and must appropriately implement the authority that Congress has provided us.&nbsp;&nbsp;This Proposal fails both tests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Event Contracts in Brief<span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>CEA Section 5c(c)(5)(C), which was added to the CEA in 2010 by the Dodd-Frank Act,<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5">[5]</a>&nbsp;permits the Commission to prohibit an event contract from being listed for trading on an exchange<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6">[6]</a>&nbsp;if:&nbsp;&nbsp;1) the contract involves one of five enumerated activities&nbsp;<i>(i.e.,</i>&nbsp;activity that is unlawful under Federal or State law; terrorism; assassination; war; or gaming); and 2) the Commission determines that the contract is contrary to the public interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;CEA Section 5c(c)(5)(C) also provides that the Commission may determine, by rule or regulation, that an event contract involves &ldquo;other similar activity&rdquo; to the five enumerated activities, which would subject event contracts involving that similar activity to the &ldquo;contrary to the public interest&rdquo; standard.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7">[7]</a></p>
<p>Congress in CEA Section 5c(c)(5)(C) did not decree that event contracts involving enumerated activities are contrary to the public interest&nbsp;<i>per se</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather, if an event contract involves an enumerated activity, the Commission &ldquo;may&rdquo; determine that it is contrary to the public interest and prohibited from trading &ndash; which necessarily indicates that the Commission also has the discretion to determine that it is not.</p>
<p>A year after enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Commission adopted CFTC Rule 40.11<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8">[8]</a>&nbsp;to implement the CEA&rsquo;s new event contract provisions.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9">[9]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is Rule 40.11 that the Commission is now proposing to amend.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Proposed Definition of &ldquo;Gaming&rdquo; is Significantly Overbroad</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Neither the CEA nor the Commission&rsquo;s rules define the term &ldquo;gaming.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Rule 40.11 Adopting Release implementing CEA Section 5c(c)(5)(C), the Commission acknowledged that &ldquo;the term &lsquo;gaming&rsquo; requires further clarification,&rdquo; and said that the Commission may issue a future rulemaking concerning event contracts that involve &ldquo;gaming.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10">[10]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I agree that, 13 years later, it is long past time for the Commission to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp;But, the Proposal&rsquo;s definition of &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; is much too broad.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Proposal Sweeps in the Universe of Every &ldquo;Occurrence or Non-Occurrence in Connection With a Game</p>
<p>The proposed definition of &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; includes both the outcome of a game and the performance of one or more competitors in a game.&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, so good.</p>
<p>But it then tacks on an additional category of &ldquo;any other occurrence or non-occurrence in connection with&rdquo; a game.&nbsp;&nbsp;The all-encompassing nature of the phrase &ldquo;any other occurrence or non-occurrence&rdquo; is self-evident.&nbsp;&nbsp;And that universality is further reinforced by its attachment to the &ldquo;in connection with&rdquo; wording.</p>
<p>The motivation for this expansive wording in the Proposal is likely that, where the phrase &ldquo;in connection with&rdquo; appears in various enforcement provisions of the CEA, the Commission interprets it &ldquo;broadly, not technically or restrictively.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11">[11]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Proposal gives no indication that it should be interpreted any differently here.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the Proposal (at page 29) goes so far as to say that staking or risking something of value on a contingent event &ldquo;in connection with&rdquo; a game &ldquo;would be as much of a wager or a bet on the game . . . as staking or risking something of value on the outcome of the game . . . would be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under this incredibly far-reaching formulation, there are countless &ldquo;occurrence[s] or non-occurrence[s] in connection with&rdquo; a game that the Proposal would deem to be &ldquo;gaming.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obvious examples include event contracts involving the attendance at a baseball or football game, or whether a particular nation will be selected to host a soccer World Cup.&nbsp;&nbsp;These would clearly be &ldquo;in connection with&rdquo; the underlying baseball, football, or soccer games &ndash; but there is no reason why staking something of value on those contingent events should be treated the same as staking something of value on the outcome of those games.</p>
<p>Indeed, there is no better illustration of the overbreadth of the &ldquo;in connection with&rdquo; aspect of the proposed &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; definition than the Proposal&rsquo;s own example (at page 32) of &ldquo;whether a particular individual will attend a game.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult to fathom why an event contract involving whether Taylor Swift will attend a Kansas City Chiefs football game should constitute &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; &ndash; and impossible to understand why the Proposal treats similar things differently, since whether she attends a Beyonc&eacute; concert would not constitute &ldquo;gaming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I acknowledge that it might be appropriate to extend the definition of &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; to include events that can affect the outcome of a game or the performance of a competitor in a game.&nbsp;&nbsp;Event contracts involving, say, whether an injury to Shohei Ohtani would prevent him from playing in the World Series, or involving the score of a football game at halftime, might be examples of this.&nbsp;&nbsp;But to broadly define as &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; every &ldquo;occurrence or non-occurrences in connection with&rdquo; a game &ndash; regardless of whether it has any bearing on the outcome of the game or the performance of a competitor in the game &ndash; is wholly unwarranted.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; &nbsp;Elections and Awards are Not &ldquo;Gaming&rdquo;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The Proposal rubber-stamps two prior Commission Orders that found that event contracts involving political control or elections are &ldquo;gaming,&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12">[12]</a>&nbsp;essentially repeating the same discussion from those Orders &ndash; and then throwing awards into its &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; definition as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, this definition is inconsistent with the legislative history of CEA Section 5c(c)(5)(C) &ndash; legislative history on which, for other issues discussed below, the Proposal relies heavily.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That legislative history consists of a colloquy between Senators Blanche Lincoln and Dianne Feinstein.&nbsp;&nbsp;Senator Lincoln was then the Chair of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, which is the CFTC&rsquo;s authorizing committee.</p>
<p>In the colloquy, the Senators talked about &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; only in the limited context of sporting events.&nbsp;&nbsp;In responding to Senator Feinstein&rsquo;s question about the CFTC&rsquo;s authority under Section 5c(c)(5)(C) to determine that a contract is a &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; contract, Senator Lincoln said that &ldquo;[i]t would be quite easy to construct an &lsquo;event contract&rsquo; around sporting events such as the Super Bowl, the Kentucky Derby, and Masters Golf Tournament.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13">[13]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, Senator Lincoln clearly associated &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; with sporting events,&nbsp;<i>i.e.,</i>&nbsp;games.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14">[14]</a></p>
<p>But rather than remain true to the legislative history that equated &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; with only sporting events, the Proposal broadly sweeps all &ldquo;contests&rdquo; into its definition of &ldquo;gaming.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it then concludes that elections and awards are &ldquo;contests&rdquo; and, therefore, &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; &ndash; even though neither Senator Lincoln nor Senator Feinstein ever mentioned elections or awards (or &ldquo;contests,&rdquo; for that matter).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Proposal attempts to squeeze elections and awards into the &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; category through the following tortured chain of reasoning:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Gaming means gambling;</li>
<li>Some State statutes link gambling to betting or wagering on contests; therefore,</li>
<li>Contests (including elections and awards) constitute gaming.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet, one has to ask:&nbsp;&nbsp;If Congress had intended for elections and awards to be enumerated activities, is it more likely that Section 5c(c)(5)(C) would have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Included elections and awards in its list of enumerated activities; or</li>
<li>Enumerated &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; and hoped the Commission would&mdash;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Define &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; to include &ldquo;contests;&rdquo; and</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider &ldquo;contests&rdquo; to include elections and awards?</p>
<p>Congress easily could have included elections and awards as enumerated activities, but it did not.&nbsp;&nbsp;Confronted with this Congressional silence, I do not believe the Commission can simply decree that elections and awards are enumerated activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;And this is especially the case when Congress in CEA Section 5c(c)(5)(C) provided the Commission with&nbsp;a ready-made process for determining, through a rulemaking proceeding, whether contests, elections, and/or awards are similar to the enumerated activities, including &ldquo;gaming.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am baffled at why the Commission is tying itself into knots by trying to reason its way from &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; to &ldquo;gambling&rdquo; to &ldquo;contests&rdquo; to elections and awards, rather than simply do what Congress said it could do: consider whether elections and awards are similar to &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; (or another enumerated activity).&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a matter of form over substance.&nbsp;&nbsp;Approach matters when it comes to exercising our authority under the CEA, and I cannot support the Proposal&rsquo;s approach to stretch the statutory term &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; to include elections and awards.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission Lacks Legal Authority to Determine in Advance that Entire&nbsp;Categories of Event Contracts are Contrary to the Public Interest</p>
<p>The overbreadth of the Proposal&rsquo;s &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; definition would suffice for me to dissent.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Proposal&rsquo;s most brazen overreach is its determination, in advance, that every event contract that involves an enumerated activity is automatically contrary to the public interest &ndash; regardless of the terms and conditions of that contract.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Proposal would prohibit these contracts &ndash; sight unseen &ndash; through the shortcut of declaring entire categories of event contracts to be contrary to the public interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Commission lacks legal authority under the CEA to make public interest determinations by category.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Proposal&rsquo;s justification for its approach (at page 37) is that &ldquo;the statute does not require this public interest determination to be made on a contract-specific basis.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is backwards.&nbsp;&nbsp;The CFTC is a creature of statute, and has only the authorities granted to it by the CEA.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no provision in CEA Section 5c(c)(5)(C) for public interest determinations regarding event contracts involving enumerated activities to be made by category.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, the Commission cannot claim that authority through the&nbsp;<i>ipse dixit</i>&nbsp;of &ldquo;Congress didn&rsquo;t say we couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is not a mere question of what procedure to follow.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Proposal would allow the Commission to make the substantive policy determination that entire categories of event contracts, regardless of their terms and conditions, are contrary to the public interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;And the consequences of such a determination are severe &ndash; a complete prohibition on exchanges&rsquo; ability to list event contracts, and on market participants&rsquo; ability to trade them.&nbsp;&nbsp;If Congress had intended for the Commission to wield this immense authority, surely it would have said so.</p>
<p>In fact, in another CEA provision similar to CEA Section 5c(c)(5)(C) that also was added by the Dodd-Frank Act, Congress did say so.&nbsp;&nbsp;CEA Section 2(h)(2)(A)(i) specifically states that the Commission shall review &ldquo;each swap, or any group,&nbsp;<i>category</i>, type, or class of swaps to make a determination as to whether the swap or group,&nbsp;<i>category</i>, type, or class of swaps should be required to be cleared.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15">[15]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, when it enacted the Dodd-Frank Act, Congress knew how to tell the Commission that it could make a determination on either an individual or categorical basis when it wanted to do so.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16">[16]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, Congress did not say in CEA Section 5c(c)(5)(C) that the Commission could make public interest determinations for event contracts by category.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Proposal&rsquo;s premise is that a grant of authority to make a determination about one thing necessarily includes authority to make a determination about a category of such things &ndash;&nbsp;<i>unless&nbsp;</i>Congress says otherwise.&nbsp;&nbsp;But if that were the case, then there was no need for Congress to tell the Commission in CEA Section 2(h)(2)(A)(i) that it could make mandatory swap clearing determinations either by individual swap or by category.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17">[17]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Proposal&rsquo;s determination would render statutory text in CEA Section 2(h)(2)(A)(i) mere surplusage in violation of established canons of statutory construction.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn18">[18]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;It also would violate the canon of statutory construction that provisions enacted as part of the same statute (here, the Dodd-Frank Act) should be construed in a similar manner.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn19">[19]</a></p>
<p>In the absence of any statutory text in CEA Section 5c(c)(5)(C) like that in CEA Section 2(h)(2)(A)(i), I cannot accept that Congress silently authorized the CFTC to make life easier for itself through the shortcut of making impactful determinations that entire categories of event contracts are contrary to the public interest and thus are prohibited from trading on exchanges.</p>
<p>IV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if there is Legal Authority, the Proposal Fails to Justify Making Advance&nbsp;Public Interest Determinations by Category &ndash; For a Host of Reasons</p>
<p>Even if the Commission has legal authority to make public interest determinations for event contracts by category, the Proposal is wholly unpersuasive in its attempt to justify doing so.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a multitude of failings.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is No Basis to Resurrect the Repealed &ldquo;Economic Purpose Test,&rdquo;&nbsp;Which Shouldn&rsquo;t&nbsp;be Applied to Event Contracts in Any Event</p>
<p>The Proposal would ban entire categories of event contracts as being contrary to the public interest based largely on the proposition that they fail the &ldquo;economic purpose test.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are four significant problems with this approach.</p>
<p><i>Congressional Intent:</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Proposal relies on a single, ambiguous, passage in the legislative history to conclude that Congress intended, for purposes of a public interest review of an event contract, to resurrect the &ldquo;economic purpose test&rdquo; that the Commission once used to determine whether a futures contract was contrary to the public interest &ndash; until Congress repealed that public interest requirement in 2000.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn20">[20]</a></p>
<p>The Proposal&rsquo;s resurrection of the &ldquo;economic purposes test&rdquo; is based entirely on this one passage in the colloquy between Senator Dianne Feinstein and Senator Blanche Lincoln:</p>
<p>Mrs. Feinstein: . . . Will the CFTC have the power to determine that a contract is a gaming contract if the predominant use of the contract is speculative as opposed to hedging or economic use?</p>
<p>Mrs. Lincoln:&nbsp;&nbsp;That is our intent.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission needs the power to, and should, prevent derivatives contracts that are contrary to the public interest because they exist predominantly to enable gambling through supposed event contracts.&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be quite easy to construct an &lsquo;event contract&rsquo; around sporting events such as the Super Bowl, the Kentucky Derby, and Masters Golf Tournament.&nbsp;&nbsp;These types of contracts would not serve any real commercial purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather, they would be used solely for gambling.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn21">[21]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>To be clear, the Dodd-Frank Act did not codify the Commission&rsquo;s prior &ldquo;economic purpose test.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I cannot accept the Proposal&rsquo;s assertion that this isolated colloquy between two Senators establishes an intent by the whole of Congress that the Commission conduct its public interest reviews of event contracts based on an &ldquo;economic purpose test&rdquo; that the Commission had withdrawn as a result of the repeal (by the whole of Congress) of the statutory provision it implemented a decade earlier.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After all, neither Senator Feinstein nor Senator Lincoln used the term &ldquo;economic purpose test&rdquo; or referred to the Commission&rsquo;s Guideline No. 1 that set out that test.&nbsp;&nbsp;As someone who spent over a decade working in Congress, and who was present on the Senate floor for countless colloquies and even had a hand in preparing talking points for similar floor discussions, I am confident that if the Senators believed we should resurrect the &ldquo;economic purpose test,&rdquo; they would have said just that.&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Difference in Kind:</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the &ldquo;economic purpose test&rdquo; was designed for traditional futures contracts that have been listed and traded on exchanges for decades.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn22">[22]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;These contracts differ in kind from event contracts, which typically are structured as binary (yes/no) options.</p>
<p>The two prongs of the &ldquo;economic purpose test,&rdquo; which the Proposal adopts as a primary basis for prohibiting entire categories of event contracts as being contrary to the public interest, evaluate:&nbsp;&nbsp;1) the contract&rsquo;s utility for price basing; and 2) whether the contract can be used for hedging purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, the Commission itself has previously recognized the difference between event contracts and the traditional futures contracts for which the &ldquo;economic purpose test&rdquo; was developed.&nbsp;&nbsp;In a Concept Release issued in 2008, the Commission stated that &ldquo;[i]n general, event contracts are neither dependent on, nor do they necessarily relate to, market prices or broad-based measures of economic or commercial activity,&rdquo; and elaborated as follows:</p>
<p>Since 2005, the Commission&rsquo;s staff has received a substantial number of requests for guidance on the propriety of offering and trading financial agreements that may primarily function as information aggregation vehicles.&nbsp;&nbsp;These event contracts generally take the form of financial agreements linked to eventualities or measures that neither derive from, nor correlate with, market prices or broad economic or commercial measures.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn23">[23]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In other words, the Proposal would ban entire categories of event contracts largely on the basis of price basing and hedging requirements that event contracts (described in the Concept Release as &ldquo;information aggregation vehicles&rdquo;) likely &ndash; because of their very structure &ndash; have little chance of satisfying.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This problem is compounded by the fact that under the Proposal, some event contracts that fail to satisfy the &ldquo;economic purpose test&rdquo; would be banned, while other contracts failing the test would not.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the Proposal&rsquo;s statement (at page 52) that &ldquo;most contracts falling within the proposed definition of &lsquo;gaming&rsquo; would have no underlying cash market with bona fide economic transactions to provide directly correlated price forming information&rdquo; is equally true of weather-related event contracts &ndash; but those contracts would not be banned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the weather is not an enumerated activity, event contracts involving the weather can trade because they are not subject to a public interest review under CEA Section 5c(c)(5)(C).&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, the Proposal&rsquo;s reliance on the &ldquo;economic purpose test&rdquo; means that exchanges can list for trading event contracts (such as those involving weather) that the Commission believes are contrary to the public interest &ndash; which I find untenable.</p>
<p>These are the inevitable results of imposing an &ldquo;economic purpose test&rdquo; on event contracts that was not designed for event contracts.&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly, a rulemaking proceeding could be appropriate to fully explore the economic attributes of event contracts, and to consider how to incorporate such attributes into a public interest review that is tailored to the nature of event contracts.&nbsp;&nbsp;But, that is not this Proposal.</p>
<p><i>Government paternalism:</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the Proposal asserts (at page 50) that &ldquo;the economic impact of an occurrence (or non-occurrence) in connection with a contest of others, or a game of skill or chance . . . generally is too diffuse and unpredictable to correlate to direct and quantifiable changes in the price of commodities or other financial assets or instruments, limiting the hedging and price-basing utility of an event contract involving such an occurrence.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But to say that there are limits to the hedging utility of an event contract is simply a statement that the contract may not be a particularly good hedging vehicle.&nbsp;&nbsp;Market participants should be permitted to make their own choices about what financial products meet their hedging needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not the CFTC&rsquo;s role to deny them that choice altogether because we feel a given product&rsquo;s hedging value is &ldquo;limited.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>The &ldquo;Economic Purpose Test&rdquo; Was Not Applied to Categories of Contracts:</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, even assuming that the &ldquo;economic purpose test&rdquo; is an appropriate part of a public interest analysis for event contracts, it does not support making public interest determinations for event contracts by category &ndash; because the Commission applied its &ldquo;economic purpose test&rdquo; to the terms and conditions of individual contracts.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission&rsquo;s Guideline No. 1 provided that&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;[i]ndividual contract terms and conditions</i>&nbsp;must be justified&rdquo; in order for an exchange to demonstrate that it met the &ldquo;economic purpose test.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn24">[24]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Commission took no shortcuts in applying its subsequently withdrawn &ldquo;economic purpose test&rdquo; to futures contracts.&nbsp;&nbsp;It did not group contracts into categories (such as all futures contracts on wheat, corn, gold, or silver) in evaluating the public interest through its &ldquo;economic purpose test.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather, the Commission looked at each contract&rsquo;s &ldquo;individual contract terms and conditions&rdquo; to make that determination.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Proposal is going to (incorrectly) adopt that &ldquo;economic purpose test&rdquo; in determining whether an event contract is contrary to the public interest, then it should apply that test the same way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Proposal&rsquo;s Application of Other Factors Falls Far Short of Justifying its Prohibition&nbsp;Entire Categories of Event Contracts</p>
<p>Aside from the &ldquo;economic purpose test,&rdquo; the Proposal points to a hodgepodge of other factors to try to justify prohibiting entire categories of event contracts, whose terms and conditions the Commission has never seen, from being traded on exchanges.&nbsp;&nbsp;But its discussion of these factors is conjectural and without evidentiary support, calls into question other contracts that are trading on regulated exchanges, and raises more questions than it answers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Taken as a whole, the Proposal falls far short of justifying the shortcut of prohibiting entire categories of event contracts (even assuming the Commission has the legal authority to do so).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Examples of these defects in the Proposal abound, but I will focus here on just a few:</p>
<p><i>Hopelessly Impractical:&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>The category of activities illegal under State law demonstrates the type of problems inherent in determining that all event contracts in a category are contrary to the public interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some activities are illegal in some States, but not others.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, the Proposal does not provide any guidance on several obvious questions:&nbsp;&nbsp;Is an event contract automatically contrary to the public interest if it involves an activity that is illegal in only a single State &ndash; and if so, why?&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, if not, then how many States have to declare an activity illegal before the automatic prohibition on event contracts involving that activity is triggered?&nbsp;&nbsp;More than half?&nbsp;&nbsp;States comprising a certain percentage of the country&rsquo;s population?<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn25">[25]</a></p>
<p>The problem is exacerbated by the Proposal&rsquo;s suggestion that the prohibition of event contracts can hinge on decisions by judges.&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this reference limited to Supreme Courts of the States?&nbsp;&nbsp;Or would a ruling by a lower court of a State that a particular activity is illegal trigger an automatic determination that an event contract involving that activity is contrary to the public interest?&nbsp;&nbsp;What if that decision is appealed?</p>
<p>While I have focused here on the category of event contracts involving activities illegal under State law, these types of practical questions are a foreseeable and inevitable result of any determination that an entire category of event contracts is contrary to the public interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;I recognize that a contract-specific approach to making public interest determinations regarding event contracts may be difficult and resource-intensive for the CFTC.&nbsp;&nbsp;But aside from my view that a contract-specific approach is required by the CEA, it also is a better approach from a policy perspective precisely because it would permit the CFTC to consider these practical questions in the context of the specific circumstances applicable to a particular event contract.&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not get to override a requirement under the law because it will be hard or require more work for us.</p>
<p><i>Absolutism Based on Conjecture:&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>Another defect in the Proposal is illustrated by the following (at page 50): &ldquo;<i>Generally speaking</i>, the Commission believes that something of value is staked or risked upon an occurrence (or non-occurrence) in connection with a contest of others, or a game or [sic] skill or chance, for entertainment purposes &ndash; in order wager [sic] on the occurrence.&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, the Commission believes that contracts involving such occurrences are&nbsp;<i>likely</i>&nbsp;to be traded predominantly &lsquo;to enable gambling&rsquo; and &lsquo;used predominantly by speculators or participants not having a commercial or hedging interest&rsquo; . . .&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Emphasis added; footnote omitted)&nbsp;</p>
<p>These assertions are entirely conjectural, as the Proposal does not cite any support for these statements.&nbsp;&nbsp;One can readily envision an event contract involving whether a particular US city will be awarded the summer or winter Olympic games in a given year, which would be used by hotel and restaurant owners, as well as other businesses, that would make money if their city gets the Olympics but not if the Olympics are awarded elsewhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such an event contract would not necessarily be used predominantly for entertainment or speculative purposes.</p>
<p>Indeed, the quoted text itself uses wording like &ldquo;[g]enerally speaking&rdquo; and &ldquo;likely,&rdquo; which is an acknowledgement that its conclusions are not universally true.&nbsp;&nbsp;A belief for which no evidence is cited, and that is acknowledged not to be true across-the-board, cannot justify an absolutist determination that all event contracts involving an activity are automatically contrary to the public interest, nor can it justify a prohibition on trading all event contracts in that category.&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Calling into Question Traditional Futures Contracts:&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>I agree that an event contract involving the outcome of a sporting event, and that allows players or coaches to trade that contract, would be contrary to the public interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;But consistent with its overreach, the Proposal also concludes that even where the terms and conditions of such a contract prohibit such persons from trading, the contract is nonetheless contrary to the public interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Proposal&rsquo;s stated rationale (at page 51) is that &ldquo;the athlete or coach would potentially have a platform &ndash; for example, access to media, combined with public perception as an authoritative source of information regarding the team &ndash; that could be used to disseminate misinformation that could artificially impact the market in the contract for additional financial gain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The same can be said of many traditional exchange-traded futures contracts.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, oil companies (or companies in the agricultural or metals sectors, or other energy companies) also have &ldquo;access to media, combined with public perception as an authoritative source of information regarding&rdquo; the oil (or other) industry, &ldquo;that could be used to disseminate misinformation that could artificially impact the market in the contract for additional financial gain.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet, exchanges are permitted to list oil futures for trading (in fact, oil companies are permitted to trade them).</p>
<p>The Proposal offers no explanation for why a possible incentive to spread misinformation should render all event contracts involving sporting events (or occurrences or non-occurrences in connection with sporting events) contrary to the public interest when traditional futures contracts with the same incentive are not.&nbsp;&nbsp;A contract-specific public interest analysis, by contrast, could take into account the terms and conditions of a particular event contract &ndash; such as whether athletes and coaches can trade, or whether there are guardrails against the spread of misinformation &ndash; to determine whether the threat of misinformation in that contract is such that it is contrary to the public interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Fallacies Concerning the CFTC&rsquo;s Regulatory and Enforcement Roles</i><i>:&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>The Proposal raises in alarmist tones the red herring that sweeping public interest determinations are necessary so that the CFTC does not get drawn into a regulatory or enforcement role for which it is not well-equipped.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the Proposal says (at page 44) that one factor that may be relevant in evaluating whether event contracts are contrary to the public interest is the extent to which they &ldquo;would draw the Commission into areas outside of its primary regulatory remit.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn26">[26]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Other examples are:&nbsp;&nbsp;1) the statements (at page 55) relating to event contracts involving elections that the Commission &ldquo;is not tasked with the protection of election integrity or enforcement of campaign finance laws;&rdquo; and 2) the statement (in the first sentence of footnote no. 127) that &ldquo;the oversight function in this area [regarding elections] is best reserved for other expert bodies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To be clear:&nbsp;&nbsp;The CFTC does not administer, oversee, or regulate elections, sporting events, gambling, or any other activity or event discussed in the Proposal &ndash; and that will not change with respect to any event contract that is found not to be contrary to the public interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather, the CFTC would exercise its exact same authorities under the CEA that it does with respect to all other derivatives contracts.</p>
<p>Nor would the CFTC become some type of &ldquo;election cop.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, the CFTC has anti-fraud and anti-manipulation enforcement authority with respect to futures contracts on broad-based security indices, but that does not mean the CFTC regulates the securities markets or that it is tasked with the protection of the integrity of the securities markets or enforcement of securities laws &ndash; the Securities and Exchange Commission (&ldquo;SEC&rdquo;) does all that.&nbsp;&nbsp;The CFTC similarly has enforcement authority with respect to natural gas and electricity since there are futures contracts on those commodities, but that does not mean the CFTC regulates the transmission of natural gas or electricity or that it is tasked with the protection of the integrity of physical natural gas or power markets, or enforcement of the Natural Gas Act or the Federal Power Act &ndash; the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (&ldquo;FERC&rdquo;) does all that.</p>
<p>The same is true with respect to an event contract that is not contrary to the public interest and thus is permitted to trade on a regulated exchange.&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Supreme Court has stated:&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;This Court&rsquo;s cases have consistently held that the use of the words &lsquo;public interest&rsquo; in a regulatory statute is not a broad license to promote the general public welfare.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather, the words take meaning from the purposes of the regulatory legislation.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn27">[27]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;If a particular event contract involving elections were found not to be contrary to the public interest and thus permitted to trade, the CFTC would have absolutely no authority to administer, oversee, or regulate the elections that are the subject of that contract, or to enforce any campaign finance laws.&nbsp;&nbsp;Its authority would extend only so far as is the case with respect to all commodities underlying derivatives contracts within our jurisdiction, as provided by Congress in the CEA.&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Why This is Important:&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>I can understand why some might ask:&nbsp;&nbsp;You have been pleading for an event contracts rulemaking for some time now, and here it is &ndash; so what is the problem?&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is this:&nbsp;&nbsp;CFTC Rule 40.11(a)(1) already prohibits the listing and trading of any event contract involving an enumerated activity.&nbsp;&nbsp;As I explained in my Kalshi Dissenting Statement:</p>
<p>Rule 40.11 contradicts the statute.&nbsp;&nbsp;CEA Section 5c(c)(5)(C) grants the Commission discretion to determine&nbsp;<i>whether</i>&nbsp;[an exchange&rsquo;s] event contract that involves an enumerated activity is contrary to the public interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;CFTC Rule 40.11(a), by contrast, provides that [an exchange] &ldquo;<i>shall not</i>&nbsp;list for trading&rdquo; a contract that involves . . . an enumerated activity (emphasis added).&nbsp;&nbsp;Read literally, Rule 40.11(a) removes entirely the flexibility that Congress granted the Commission to evaluate [exchange] event contracts from a public interest perspective.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn28"></a><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn28">[28]</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn28"></a></p>
<p>Rather than fix this problem, though, the Proposal doubles down on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;By making categorical public interest determinations in advance, the Proposal would impermissibly transform the two-step analysis that Congress provided for event contracts into a single step.&nbsp;&nbsp;It would transmogrify the&nbsp;<i>discretion</i>&nbsp;that Congress gave the Commission to determine that an event contract involving an enumerated activity is contrary to the public interest into a&nbsp;<i>mandate</i>&nbsp;that it do so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Proposal actually is quite candid in acknowledging that it would re-write CEA Section 5c(c)(5)(C).&nbsp;&nbsp;It states (at page 38):&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;If, as proposed, [Rule 40.11] is amended to include a categorical public interest determination with respect to contracts involving each of the Enumerated Activities, the Commission would not, going forward, undertake a contract-specific public interest analysis as part of a review . . . Rather, the focus of any such review would be to evaluate whether the contract involves an Enumerated Activity, in which case, it may not be listed for trading . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Congress had intended that every event contract involving an enumerated activity is automatically contrary to the public interest and prohibited from trading, it could have provided for such a single-step process in CEA Section 5c(c)(5)(C).&nbsp;&nbsp;But it did not do that, and instead provided that even if an event contract involves an enumerated activity, the Commission cannot prohibit the contract without exercising its discretion in a second step of determining that the contract is contrary to the public interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission can&rsquo;t short-circuit the process that Congress established by determining that an event contract is contrary to the public interest &ndash; in advance and without knowing the contract&rsquo;s terms and conditions &ndash; simply because that makes things easier for the agency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Granted, the Proposal makes categorical public interest determinations only for the activities enumerated in CEA Section 5c(c)(5)(C).&nbsp;&nbsp;I admit that I am not going to lose sleep over a determination that all event contracts involving terrorism, assassination, and war are contrary to the public interest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But this is where the &ldquo;wolf in sheep&rsquo;s clothing&rdquo; arrives.&nbsp;&nbsp;While this Proposal only addresses event contracts involving enumerated activities, it sets the precedent for how the Commission can handle event contracts involving other activities that it determines are similar to enumerated activities, too.</p>
<p>If the Proposal is adopted as final, then at any time in the future, the Commission could determine that other activities are similar to enumerated activities &ndash; and could then determine that every event contract involving that activity is automatically contrary to the public interest (and therefore prohibited from trading) regardless of its particular terms and conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;And given all the deficiencies in this Proposal&rsquo;s categorical public interest determinations discussed above, that appears to be a low bar to clear.&nbsp;</p>
<p>V.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Portions of the Proposal are Inaccurate or Extremely Weak, or Make No Sense</p>
<p>The fact that certain portions of the Proposal are inaccurate, extremely weak, or simply make no sense suggests that it either was hastily prepared, or is motivated primarily by the sheer hatred that the Commission seems to bear towards event contracts.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are a few examples:&nbsp;</p>
<p>--The Proposal says (at page 44) that &ldquo;the public good&rdquo; is a relevant factor for consideration in an evaluation of whether an event contract is contrary to the public interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;It makes no sense that the Commission should consider &ldquo;the public good&rdquo; in evaluating whether a contract is contrary to &ldquo;the public interest.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is tautological &ndash; &ldquo;the public good&rdquo; and &ldquo;the public interest&rdquo; mean the same thing.</p>
<p>--The Proposal&rsquo;s statement (at pages 39-40) that in the colloquy, Senators Feinstein and Lincoln &ldquo;discussed the Commission&rsquo;s authority, prior to the enactment of the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 (&lsquo;CFMA&rsquo;), &lsquo;to prevent trading that is contrary to the public interest&rdquo; is incorrect.&nbsp;&nbsp;Senators Feinstein and Lincoln did not &ldquo;discuss&rdquo; the Commission&rsquo;s pre-CFMA authority.&nbsp;&nbsp;Senator Feinstein referenced it in asking a question, but Senator Lincoln (the Committee Chair) did not talk about it &ndash; in fact, she did not even mention the CFMA.</p>
<p>--Footnote no. 49 cites the CFTC Reauthorization Act of 2019 as support for the Proposal&rsquo;s view that an erroneous reference to a non-existent CEA Section 1a(2)(i) in CEA Section 5c(c)(5)(C) was intended by Congress to refer to CEA Section 1a(19)(i) instead, since the bill included a provision to replace the reference to Section 1a(2)(i) with a reference to Section 1a(19)(i).&nbsp;&nbsp;But an amendment in a bill introduced in a subsequent Congress (nine years later) sheds no light on what was intended by the Congress that enacted the statutory provision in question &ndash; especially when the referenced bill was not enacted and nothing has happened on it during the ensuing five years.</p>
<p>VI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain Implementation Timeline Provisions in the<span>&nbsp;</span>Proposal are Ill-Advised</p>
<p><i>Implementation Timeline:&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>As discussed above, I do not support the proposal to determine that all event contracts involving enumerated activities are contrary to the public interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;But if the Commission decides to do so, I oppose applying that determination to contracts that are already listed for trading as of the date of publication of final rule amendments in the Federal Register.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is my hope that there would be few such contracts.&nbsp;&nbsp;But for any contracts that would be impacted, the Proposal is pollyanaish in its rosy view that &ldquo;a 60-day implementation period for these contracts will minimize any market disruption that might be caused by the rule amendments.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;For one thing, given the Proposal&rsquo;s repeated emphasis (at pages 29, 33, and 54) that its examples of activities that constitute &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; under the proposed definition are non-exclusive, I am dubious that exchanges and traders necessarily will know exactly which existing event contracts the Commission believes are now suddenly prohibited.</p>
<p>Beyond that, this aspect of the Proposal is fundamentally unfair.&nbsp;&nbsp;At any time during the 13 years since its adoption of Rule 40.11, the Commission could have concluded that a given event contract involving an enumerated activity is contrary to the public interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;Exchanges and market participants that have listed and traded an event contract in good faith reliance on the fact that the Commission had not determined the contract to be contrary to the public interest should not pay the price (literally) for the Commission&rsquo;s inaction by having to halt trading in a fixed amount of time because the Commission has finally gotten around to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This would be the antithesis of &ldquo;good government.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, I do not believe that any rule amendments finalized as part of this rulemaking should apply to an event contract that is listed and available for trading as of the date of their publication in the Federal Register.</p>
<p>VII.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Conclusion</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Rather than undertake a rulemaking process to do the hard work of building a framework for evaluating event contracts pursuant to CEA Section 5c(c)(5)(C), the Commission squandered the 14 years since that provision was enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank Act.&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Commission is now proposing an event contract rulemaking, that hard work still has yet to be done.&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, the Commission is skipping right over building a proper framework &ndash; and simply proposing to prohibit contracts outright.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This result seems preordained, given the hostility that the Commission has displayed toward event contracts since the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act.&nbsp;&nbsp;This Proposal rubber-stamps the Commission&rsquo;s two prior Orders finding proposed event contracts to be contrary to the public interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, it continues the &ldquo;tradition&rdquo; of stretching a solitary, cryptic colloquy to form the basis for evaluating whether event contracts are contrary to the public interest through the &ldquo;economic purpose test&rdquo; that:&nbsp;&nbsp;1) is not mentioned in the statute; 2) had previously been withdrawn due to Congress&rsquo; repeal of the CEA provision it implemented; 3) was not designed for this type of contract; and 4) many event contracts, due to their structure, likely will be unable to meet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And now the Proposal goes even further, adopting an overly broad definition of &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; and declaring entire categories of event contracts to be contrary to the public interest, sight unseen.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission&rsquo;s legal authority to make such determinations by category is questionable, at best; that it is inappropriate from a policy perspective cannot reasonably be questioned.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Proposal flatly contravenes Congress&rsquo; direction in the CEA that the CFTC &ldquo;promote responsible innovation.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn29">[29]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The unmistakable take-away for exchanges is not to expend resources developing an innovative event contract because the Commission will go to great lengths to find that it is contrary to the public interest and prohibit it from trading.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn30">[30]</a></p>
<p>I want to be very clear:&nbsp;&nbsp;My dissent should not be taken as an endorsement of the wisdom of event contracts generally, or of any event contract in particular.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather, it reflects my application of Congress&rsquo; direction to the Commission in CEA Section 5c(c)(5)(C).&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever we may think of event contracts, we cannot re-write the CEA to claim an authority that Congress did not give us because we have been derelict in applying the authority that Congress did give us.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor should we be prohibiting an event contract without a proper showing that it involves an enumerated activity and is contrary to the public interest based on the application of well-defined factors to the particular terms and conditions of that particular contract.</p>
<p>Because this wolf in sheep&rsquo;s clothing fails on many levels for the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>

<title>SEC Charges Pennsylvania Resident With Insider Trading In Dick’s Sporting Goods Securities</title>

<div> charged, insider trading, Dick's Sporting Goods, misappropriating, nonpublic information
<br />
Poerio charged with insider trading for misappropriating nonpublic info about Dick's Sporting Goods, making illegal profits. SEC and US Attorney's Office took action.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Gibsonia, PA resident Frank T. Poerio, Jr. with insider trading for misappropriating material, nonpublic information concerning Dick&rsquo;s Sporting Goods Inc. and trading on that information, realizing illegal profits of more than $800,000.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, between November 2019 and May 2021, Poerio knew a Dick&rsquo;s employee who had access to multiple internal sources of material nonpublic information about the company&rsquo;s financial results. The SEC alleges that Poerio frequently asked the employee for updates on the company&rsquo;s performance, and, at times, the employee responded with statements to the effect that the company was &ldquo;doing very well,&rdquo; coupled with requests that Poerio not trade in Dick&rsquo;s securities. The SEC alleges that Poerio understood that these statements were based on the employee&rsquo;s access to nonpublic financial information and previews of the company&rsquo;s upcoming quarterly revenue figures. Poerio used this information to trade in Dick&rsquo;s securities, in breach of his duty of trust and confidence to the employee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We allege that Poerio exploited the trust of someone close to him by pumping that person for information and then ignoring his repeated requests not to trade on that information,&rdquo; said Mark Cave, Associate Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s charges showcase the SEC&rsquo;s ability to detect and charge those who seek to profit off insider trading.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, charges Poerio with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without denying the allegations of the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Poerio agreed to a settlement that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil money penalty in amounts to be determined by the Court. The settlement is subject to the Court&rsquo;s approval.</p>
<p>In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania today announced criminal charges against Poerio.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Jason Litow, with assistance from Brian Shute, Max Clarke, Steve Rapkin, Derek Bentsen, and James Carlson, under the supervision of Kevin Guerrero, Stacy Bogert, and Mr. Cave. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania and the FBI.</p>

<div> Education, dedication, teamwork, humility, gratitude
Summary: Strive for continuous learning, work hard, collaborate, stay resilient, be humble, express gratitude. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>Congratulations, Class of 2024! Let me also congratulate your families, friends, teachers, mentors, and everyone else who believed in you and supported you on the path that brought you here today. Thank you, President Burwell, Provost Wilkins, and Dean Jacknowitz.</p>
<p>Before I came to the Federal Reserve, I led the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan for five years, so I am used to addressing public policy graduates in May, wearing a robe, and praying it won't rain for the afterparty. Or in Michigan, hail! It is an honor to be able to join in this celebration of you completing your studies and entering a new and exciting stage of your lives. This is particularly special to me, as later in life my mom went back to school at American University (AU) to earn her master's in education. Today, May 10, would have been her birthday&mdash;so I can celebrate your path forward and honor her memory.</p>
<p>I had a chance to speak with a few of your classmates last week, and they gave me a window into the passion and commitment that you bring to your work. It is easy right now for some to look at the world and be cynical about the possibility of making it a better place. But in so many ways, the world is a much better place than it was 50 or 100 years ago, in large part thanks to people like you who've gone into public policy. In my personal experience, I've seen many things get better over the course of my professional lifetime. I can see it now in the work that we do at the Federal Reserve. And most importantly, I can see it in each of you.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it's easy to look at the government or a large corporation or even the nonprofit sector and see some large, distant kind of entity. But the government is made up of individual human beings. You, your friends and your colleagues, your predecessors here at AU, and the people who will come after you. Those individuals make a big difference.</p>
<p>And that's true the moment you leave school. Early on, for example, I worked as a special assistant for Bob Rubin when he was the Secretary of the Treasury. And one of the first things I noticed when he hosted a meeting was that he didn't involve just the top people in the Treasury Department. He included the people who were closer to the issue, such as a research assistant or junior analyst. And he would ask them questions and engage them, and he cared what they thought about the issue. While they didn't necessarily have the same judgment or context as more senior people, they had a lot of knowledge and analytic chops and sometimes a new way of thinking about a problem.</p>
<p>And I've carried that approach to my job today. Many of the people in my meetings at the Federal Reserve are quite junior in the organization, but they speak up in a way that can change how I think about a problem. Please know that you can make a difference as a very junior person and in a very large organization.</p>
<p>Even if today marks the conclusion of your time in the classroom, it isn't the end of your education. The best career advice that I can offer is also the best advice for a happy life&mdash;whatever you do, try to put yourself in a position where you are always learning, every day. This is something my father&mdash;a labor lawyer by day and a poet by night&mdash;tried to live by. Seeking out a role where you are learning every day will guide you to work that stimulates and motivates you, making you a more knowledgeable and hopefully wiser person, even when the lessons imparted are hard ones. As they often are.</p>
<p>This striving to always be learning has guided me to fulfilling work and it has told me, at times, when I needed to take a risk and put myself out there. I was not anyone's first choice for the job I have now, or the job leading the Ford School, or running point on financial reform at Treasury. But I did all of those things. As you will in your lives, when opportunities come along that you never expected.</p>
<p>When I was graduating, I had no idea what I would eventually do in life. And that was scary. That is okay. That is normal. You don't need to know what you want to do for the rest of your life. None of us older people know that either. We're figuring it out as we go.</p>
<p>I've just mentioned one of the ingredients to doing your best&mdash;learning every day and being open to new opportunities even if they are scary&mdash;but another more obvious one is effort. It has become more common nowadays to recognize the costs of working too hard, and that is a good thing. But I hope that this emphasis on work-life balance does not deprive you of the satisfaction, and sometimes, joy, that can come from working incredibly hard toward a goal that you find meaningful. Most things worth doing in life are hard.</p>
<p>And if you do want to get anything done in the world, you need a team. There's a Michigan saying: "the team, the team, the team," and it's a good one. You can't do things alone. Certainly, the work that I have found most impactful, whether intellectually or to the world, has been with other people. The work I'm proudest of, as an academic, is work that I did with a psychologist and an economist on behaviorally informed financial regulation. In the process, we changed the way each of us thought about crucial questions we were considering. What an amazing gift to be able to do that with colleagues.</p>
<p>Along with working hard to achieve your goals, being open to new opportunities, and working as a team, I think it is also important to be tough. Partly, this means being resilient because life is not a continuous march to the top. I've failed many times. There will be criticism and setbacks, and it is how you respond, constructively, to those developments that will matter much more than the progress you make when things are going great. I use the word "tough" because, more than just resilience, sometimes it will be necessary for you to be tough with others. Sometimes you will have to tell colleagues, or even bosses, that they are wrong. Sometimes, you'll have to decide whether to take a stand.</p>
<p>And sometimes being tough requires you to be tough with yourself. When you are in jobs like mine, things go wrong all the time. And it's important to understand that when things go wrong, it is your responsibility. It's not somebody on your team's fault. Your team is giving you the best inputs they can. So having the ability to not point a finger at other people, and to point it at yourself, and understand that you are accountable and responsible, is an important part of being a leader.</p>
<p>Being tough doesn't mean being hard or insensitive. One can be resilient, make tough decisions, and stand up to pressure in ways that treat people with respect&mdash;the kind of respect that you hope others will show you. One of the primary ways that we show respect for others is to listen. If you are always learning, that means you are always listening, taking on board what you hear from others, even if it is very unwelcome, and perhaps, adjusting your views and gaining knowledge from that input. And it means talking in a way that others can hear.</p>
<p>One can make tough decisions and hold people to high standards while treating others well. Treating others well, for me, boils down to a simple rule&mdash;don't be a jerk. All of us have had enough experiences with others acting like jerks to understand this advice, but it's a bit harder when applied to yourself. At least for me it is.</p>
<p>Humility is an attribute that I consider essential to avoid being a jerk. Life often gives one the opportunity to learn and relearn the lesson of humility&mdash;and I am humbled every day. Humility is recognizing the limits of knowledge, confidence, and self-regard. It is the line between what we truly know and understand, and what we don't really know and cannot grasp.</p>
<p>Humility means being open to new information, to weighing information in an objective way, and being able to take on that input and sometimes change one's mind. In a practical way, it means being open to and seriously considering the views of others, and in that sense, it is often a vital way to connect with other people.</p>
<p>Let me leave you today with two words, the most important two words that you will ever know, or ever say. Those words are "thank you." "Thank you" means the recognition that someone has done something valuable for you. Gratitude binds us together. So please turn to your parents, your partners, your friends and other family, your teachers and mentors, your fellow students, and say, thank you.</p>
<p>Congratulations, Class of 2024, and thank you, for listening to me today.</p>

<div> Securities and Exchange Commission, economics, economic analysis, market resiliency, AI<br />
<br />
Summary: Securities and Exchange Commission Commissioner emphasizes the importance of economic analysis, clear communication, and pursuit of excellence in regulatory work. <div>
<p>Thank you, Vlad [Ivanov], for that introduction. To Jessica Wachter: thank you for your leadership as Director of the Commission&rsquo;s Division of Economic and Risk Analysis (&ldquo;DERA&rdquo;), and for inviting me to deliver these remarks today<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/lizarraga-remarks-conference-financial-market-regulation-051024#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>To DERA staff, Lehigh University&rsquo;s Center for Financial Services, and the University of Maryland&rsquo;s Center for Financial Policy: thank you for organizing this informative event.</p>
<p>It is a pleasure to be here in a room full of economists, whose contributions are so vital to the Commission&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>My 10-year-old daughter recently asked me a very basic but important question: what is economics? In the moment, the best response I could muster was that it&rsquo;s a social science focused on the study of markets.</p>
<p>It was a simple &ndash; many of you here might say simplistic &ndash; answer, but it seemed to satisfy her curiosity. The question made me reflect about one of the key challenges we face every day here at the Commission: how can we best communicate the value and relevance of our work to the public, in the most user-friendly way possible?</p>
<p>It is a theme that I&rsquo;ll return to later in my remarks. But I hope that you, too, will reflect on this in the context of your own discussions today and in your future work. In my mind, it is part of the pursuit of excellence that is central to our success.</p>
<p>Let me return to my basic definition of &ldquo;economics.&rdquo; Of course, it doesn&rsquo;t do justice to the wide scope of areas that you, as economists, study or the research you will discuss here today &ndash; on market microstructure, corporate finance, financial intermediaries, or asset management.</p>
<p>Economic analysis plays an essential role in the Commission&rsquo;s work &ndash; whether in rulemaking, or in calculating disgorgement or distributions to harmed investors in enforcement actions. Or in any other areas where expertise in economics contributes to fulfilling our mission.</p>
<p>In rulemaking, it serves the essential purpose of providing the public and all market participants with impartial analysis of a new or updated Commission rule, including its costs and benefits.</p>
<p>It allows the Commission to compare a proposed rulemaking against other reasonable alternatives.</p>
<p>It helps us describe the economic baseline as it exists today in the specific space affected by the rule, and how that baseline might change once the rule is implemented.</p>
<p>It provides a framework for understanding how a rulemaking addresses a specific problem or deficiency, and the rule&rsquo;s impact on affected stakeholders and our capital markets.</p>
<p>During my time here, the Commission has proposed and adopted a range of reforms aimed at strengthening market resiliency and investor protection. These rules depend, in no small part, on high quality economic analysis. That said, there&rsquo;s always room for improvement in all that we do.</p>
<p>The extensive knowledge and innovative ideas that experts like you bring to the table can benefit the Commission&rsquo;s approach to economic analysis. So, as you engage in your discussions today, I offer you a few thoughts for your consideration.</p>
<p>First, it is important to bear in mind that the investor base in our capital markets is diverse.</p>
<p>Retail investors are a significant segment of our capital markets &ndash; in the neighborhood of 150 million. These investors, who aspire to build wealth for themselves and their families, have varying levels of financial sophistication and investment horizons. They may process market information, or react to transaction costs, in ways that differ significantly from institutional investors.</p>
<p>Younger investors may prefer online trading platforms or robo-advisers. These younger investors may have higher risk tolerances compared to investors in other age groups, who may prefer to interact with our markets in more traditional ways.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurs in underserved or minority communities, or in rural areas, may encounter unique structural barriers when it comes to accessing investment capital.</p>
<p>In short, in the context of their own unique circumstances, all investors behave differently. Economic analysis that builds in and measures these unique differences where possible can be more useful.</p>
<p>Which leads me to my second point. Use of innovative AI, machine learning, and data analytics, with appropriate guardrails, may be worth exploring if it can yield improved and strengthened economic analysis. And provided it does not in any way undermine our statutory mission or the public interest.</p>
<p>Thankfully, DERA&rsquo;s Office of Data Science is already leading initiatives to develop and support cutting-edge data analytics powered by AI to support multiple functions across the Commission.</p>
<p>A rapidly evolving market landscape offers both challenges and opportunities: the challenge of keeping up, adapting to, and getting ahead of rapid change, but also the opportunity to harness technology and data to strengthen economic analysis and our rulemaking.</p>
<p>A unique challenge we face in economic analysis is quantifying costs and benefits. Generally, costs can be easier to quantify because discrete data from past experience is more readily available. But data on future benefits that might accrue to investors, our capital markets, or the broader economy is more diffuse and harder to come by.</p>
<p>More than three decades ago, my graduate school economics professor, mentor, and thesis adviser, James K. Galbraith, introduced me to the work of Nobel Prize-winning Swedish economist, Gunnar Myrdal. In particular, the principle of circular cumulative causation as applied to the analysis of economic disparities in 1940s Black America.</p>
<p>Myrdal&rsquo;s work in this area was funded by a prominent American foundation. His main researcher was Ralph Bunche, a scholar and diplomat who was awarded the 1950 Nobel Peace Prize &ndash; the first African American Nobel laureate. Their work was so influential that the U.S. Supreme Court cited it in&nbsp;<i>Brown v. Board of Education</i>.</p>
<p>Myrdal&rsquo;s thinking really captivated me. His framework offered a valuable tool to analyze how factors that exacerbate economic disparities can mutually reinforce each other in a vicious cycle that can persist over time. But the framework applied to the solution, too. Policy changes can interrupt the vicious cycle and turn it into a virtuous one, with beneficial multiplier effects.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a compelling logic to this framework. So, as economists, I ask you to consider this: leveraged with data analytics, and innovative AI tools used responsibly, could this framework enhance the quality of our economic analysis?</p>
<p>I see much potential in it to broaden our thinking in this area.</p>
<p>In an age where data analytics can unlock so many new possibilities, the optimist in me believes it can help us improve modeling and estimating of potential benefits. Benefits such as reducing asymmetric information and competitive barriers, fostering greater investor confidence and financial stability, and reducing unnecessary or excessive risk-taking.</p>
<p>Let me now return to what I raised at the outset: the imperative of clear and understandable communication with the public.</p>
<p>One-year ago this week, I had the special privilege of delivering a commencement address at my alma mater, the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas, Austin.</p>
<p>I urged the graduates to strive for clear and effective communication with the public. As policy professionals, articulating how their work benefits the public is essential for public support of their mission.</p>
<p>As researchers, your work can contribute so much to the effective fulfillment of our mission. But to maximize its impact, a non-technical audience should be able to understand it. I cannot emphasize this enough.</p>
<p>Yes, our work is necessarily technical and complex, but nothing that we do here should be out of reach to the public. If we fail to meet this most basic of tests, we are also failing the public that we have a duty to serve and whose interests we must protect above all others.</p>
<p>To me, this is a vital element in the pursuit of excellence.</p>
<p>We serve the public most effectively when the Commission&rsquo;s valuable work to protect our markets and investors meets the highest standards of excellence.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll close with a story about why the pursuit of excellence matters so much. It involves soccer, a sport that I follow closely and love.</p>
<p>Pep Guardiola, the Catalan manager of Manchester City Football Club, is probably the greatest football manager of all time. By any measure.</p>
<p>The most coveted achievement in European football is winning the Continental Treble in a single season, a feat that only eight clubs in Europe have achieved. Guardiola is the only manager to have won it twice, with two different clubs. In the last 14 seasons, he has won 11 league titles. And he&rsquo;s on the verge of leading his team to a fourth consecutive English Premier League title.</p>
<p>A documentary that has been running on one of the streaming services offers a glimpse into Guardiola&rsquo;s commitment to the pursuit of excellence. His players enter the locker room at half-time, giddy because they&rsquo;ve scored four goals against their cross-town rivals, Manchester United. But Guardiola tells his players: &ldquo;4-0. I cannot say it&rsquo;s bad, but it&rsquo;s not perfect&hellip;You were brilliant, but I push you to be more perfect&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lesson I draw from this vignette that applies to our work is that even in our peak moments we must not &ndash; and cannot &ndash; lose sight of the pursuit of excellence.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and for joining us here today. Best wishes to all of you in your upcoming discussions.</p>

<title>Statement Of CFTC Commissioner Caroline D. Pham: The CFTC Needs To Get Serious. A Strategic Plan For Reform</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> commodity futures trading commission, jurisdiction, expansion, GAO study, accountability
Summary:<br /><br />Commissioner Pham voices concern about CFTC's lack of procedures, judicial opinions, and enforcement. Urges for a GAO study and implementing reforms for effectiveness. <div>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Today, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) will take yet another step down a misguided path that encroaches so far onto States&rsquo; rights that it makes a mockery of the Tenth Amendment. &nbsp;It pains me to say that despite the road here being paved with good intentions, today&rsquo;s event contracts rulemaking is yet another example of how far the Commission has strayed from the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act and the Constitution, and how little the Commission seems to care for fairness and due process under the law.&nbsp; I have repeatedly raised troubling concerns that the breakdown of the Commission&rsquo;s internal procedures and processes I have observed in the past two years severely compromises the Commission&rsquo;s ability to fulfill our mission and statutory mandate set forth in the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), faithfully serve the public interest, and treat market participants fairly.&nbsp; That is why, before the Commission is granted or usurps any additional jurisdiction over products or asset classes, I believe that a Government Accountability Office (GAO) study is necessary of the Commission&rsquo;s procedures for rulemaking, examinations and compliance reviews, investigations and enforcement, adjudicatory proceedings, due process protections, and compliance with the CEA, APA, Good Accounting Obligation in Government Act, Government Management Reform Act of 1994, Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) Modernization Act of 2010, and other laws and requirements applicable to administrative agencies.&nbsp; A GAO study and recommendations for improvement will ensure that the Commission has the internal operations, structure, technology, expertise, personnel, and funding to be effective in our oversight of commodity derivatives markets.&nbsp; The Commission must be able to walk in a straight line before we run headlong into any expansion of jurisdiction.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>As Commissioners, it&rsquo;s our duty to ensure adequate governance of the CFTC. &nbsp;We must support our talented staff with the tools, training, and resources to be successful, and ensure that we are sticking to our mission, our authority, and our own rules. &nbsp;And it&rsquo;s our duty to take appropriate corrective action if we ever lose sight of those principles. &nbsp;The Commission must uphold the highest standards of integrity, diligence, and excellence to maintain the public&rsquo;s trust in the CFTC&rsquo;s ability to oversee our markets with fairness and in service to justice.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp; Unfortunately, in the last two years, there has been a disturbing number of judicial opinions and public reports that the Commission is failing to meet those standards.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp; This is a challenging time for all of us, and I thank Chairman Behnam for his leadership through it.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Identifying and Reporting the CFTC&rsquo;s Issues</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Six months into my term as a Commissioner, I gave a speech to leaders and practitioners in compliance and enforcement on the well-known maxim, &ldquo;If you see something, say something.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp; In my career as a senior Compliance officer in the private sector overseeing billion-dollar compliance programs, my job was to implement policies and procedures, controls, monitoring, testing, and assessment to achieve compliance with laws and regulations to ensure safety and soundness of the bank and market integrity and conduct. &nbsp;These efforts included processes to identify, escalate, and report issues, and ensure remediation and self-reporting to authorities as appropriate.&nbsp; These responsibilities might not always be popular&mdash;as anyone familiar with Compliance and Internal Audit are aware&mdash;but they&rsquo;re absolutely necessary. &nbsp;Not only did they keep the firm out of trouble, but they promoted trust with our regulators and clients and upheld the firm&rsquo;s reputation.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>As a public company, nothing less than the highest standard is owed to investors and other stakeholders. &nbsp;Well, the CFTC is a public institution, and I believe the Commission owes the American taxpayer that same high standard.&nbsp; At my last job, if I discovered the kind of issues that I&rsquo;ve seen here at the CFTC, I would escalate and report those issues so they could be fixed.&nbsp; Now that I&rsquo;m a Commissioner, it&rsquo;s still my job to say something if I see something wrong. And it&rsquo;s what the CFTC expects of its registrants.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>In the government, the public trust is paramount. &nbsp;Failing to adhere to the law and principles of fairness that are essential to U.S. democracy not only causes us to fail at our mission, but it ultimately hurts the Commission and its dedicated public servants.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve seen a recent cautionary tale at one of our sister agencies that resulted in the resignation of two members of staff.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s important that the Commission is proactive now and takes stock of our own approaches to rulemaking, enforcement, and other administrative actions, that we acknowledge our issues, and that we get help when we need it.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>I have consistently raised concerns both internally and publicly about the CFTC&rsquo;s lack of procedures,</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;improper expansion of jurisdiction,</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;incorrect application of the law,</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;increased delegation of authority,</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;dubious enforcement actions and unfair adjudicatory proceedings,</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;failure to comply with the APA,</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;and general disregard for due process.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span><span><span>Over the past several years, a concerning number of CFTC complaints filed in litigation in federal court have been dismissed for failure to state a claim (insufficient facts to support a charge or incorrect as a matter of law) or on summary judgment (incorrect as a matter of law), or overturned in appellate court, meaning that the CFTC does not understand and is wrong about the application of our&nbsp;<i>own</i>&nbsp;statute and our&nbsp;<i>own</i>&nbsp;regulations.</span></span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a><span><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am deeply disturbed that just a few weeks ago, a federal judge has called the CFTC&rsquo;s recent actions in another litigation matter &ldquo;troubling at best&rdquo; and ordered a hearing on sanctions against the CFTC for an alleged &ldquo;pattern of misconduct&rdquo; that includes knowingly submitting false statements to the court and attempting to intrude on attorney-client privilege.</span></span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a><span><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp; This is cause for alarm and the Commission must address this crisis.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The Commission&rsquo;s recent history with event contracts is another example of the CFTC&rsquo;s issues.</span></span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a><span><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp; The CFTC is currently a defendant in two litigation matters relating to event contracts that allege that the CFTC violated the Administrative Procedure Act, due process, and other Constitutional rights.&nbsp; In one of the lawsuits, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has called the CFTC the &ldquo;epitome of arbitrary and capricious,&rdquo; and found that the CFTC violated the Fifth Circuit&rsquo;s injunction.&nbsp; U.S. Senators and Members of Congress have sent letters to the Commission to express their concerns with the CFTC&rsquo;s conduct of the event contracts rulemaking.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>My concerns are informed by my decades of experience in both the public and private sectors.&nbsp; Not only did I have the privilege of serving at the CFTC between 2009 and 2014 during the response to the 2008 financial crisis, but I have also served at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC).&nbsp; I know the standards that the CFTC used to meet, and the standards expected at the SEC and the OCC, two of the preeminent U.S. financial regulators that are much larger and older than the CFTC.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>I&rsquo;ve had to use my voice not only because it&rsquo;s my job as a Commissioner, but out of true devotion to an agency that I have loved and cared about so much that I&rsquo;m back for the fourth time.&nbsp; The CFTC is where I started my career, and I believe deeply in our mission and our people.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>&nbsp;<span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;Like a mom who will always hold her kids to a high bar and push them to reach their potential, I want to see us all succeed.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp; That means not being afraid to look inward, seek guidance, and be honest with ourselves about our missteps. &nbsp;The most important leadership lessons I&rsquo;ve learned is to never be complacent, have a growth mindset, embrace diverse viewpoints, and focus on continuous improvement.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>GAO Study and Implementing Reforms to Ensure the CFTC&rsquo;s Effectiveness</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Sometimes fresh eyes are warranted, and that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m calling for a GAO study and recommendations.&nbsp; And, I&rsquo;m also calling for the Commission to adopt review and accountability measures to regularly assess the CFTC&rsquo;s effectiveness and identify areas of improvement. &nbsp;Absent these forward looking and proactive measures, I fear that the Commission will continue to lack the procedures and controls needed to be effective at our mission, making the CFTC susceptible to failure to protect our markets and the public.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>If this sounds like a surprising request, consider this: Subtitle F&mdash;Improvements to the Management of the Securities and Exchange Commission of the Investor Protection and Securities Reform Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act Title IX) required the SEC, which has existed nearly twice as long as the CFTC and has six times the amount of budget and employees, to hire an independent consultant to perform an organizational study and review of the SEC&rsquo;s internal operations, structure, funding, and the need for comprehensive reform, and for the SEC to report to Congress on the progress of its implementation of the consultant&rsquo;s organizational reform recommendations.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dodd-Frank also requires the SEC to submit annual reports and certifications to Congress with an assessment of the effectiveness of the SEC&rsquo;s internal supervisory controls and procedures applicable to staff performing examinations, enforcement investigations, and reviews of corporate financial securities filings,</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;and for the GAO to conduct regular reviews of the adequacy and effectiveness of the SEC&rsquo;s internal supervisory control structure and procedures. &nbsp;And, Dodd-Frank requires the GAO to regularly review and report to Congress on the quality of the SEC&rsquo;s personnel management, including effectiveness of supervisors, promotion criteria and fairness, competence of the professional staff, efficiency of communication between divisions and offices, staff turnover, excessive numbers of managers, initiatives to increase the competence of the staff, performance improvement and termination, and recommendations to use staff more effectively and efficiently to carry out the SEC&rsquo;s mission.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>At that time back in 2010, the SEC not only had greatly expanded jurisdiction over new products and categories of registrants, but was facing new challenges in securities markets from technological developments like high-frequency algorithmic trading.&nbsp; These Dodd-Frank studies, reviews, and reports were a sensible way to ensure the SEC would be well prepared to take on its new oversight responsibilities.&nbsp; The CFTC also had greatly expanded jurisdiction over new products and categories of registrants, including the swaps market and systemically important financial institutions, and the CFTC faced similar challenges from technological developments. &nbsp;But there was no similar Dodd-Frank mandate to improve management at the CFTC.&nbsp; Now in the present day, the CFTC may potentially have its jurisdiction expanded again, and is facing a new wave of technological developments like crypto assets and generative artificial intelligence (AI).&nbsp; It&rsquo;s time for the CFTC to finally have the benefit of comprehensive studies and recommendations to make sure we are prepared and able to carry out our mission.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>These accountability measures are not only standard practice for management at any organization and common sense, but they have already been proven at our peer agencies. &nbsp;I think we&rsquo;d all agree that the CFTC&rsquo;s mission is no less critical. Shouldn&rsquo;t we be just as accountable?</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>In addition, a GAO study would provide a roadmap for implementation of reforms. &nbsp;I have made a number of proposals to improve the CFTC&rsquo;s effectiveness to better serve the American people. &nbsp;These proposals have ranged from preserving our institutional knowledge by establishing a CFTC Historical Society,</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;to enhancing retail protection by establishing an Office of the Retail Advocate and considering a new registration category for direct clearing retail derivatives clearing organizations (DCO),</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;to promoting responsible innovation through market pilot programs, to creating executive champions for our employee resource groups, to launching leadership skills and professional development initiatives, to a transformation of the agency across five pillars: governance, culture, talent, operations, and excellence.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Most urgently, I have proposed that the Commission establish a CFTC examination program for systemically important swap dealers because the CFTC is an outlier and the only regulator in the world who directly oversees global systemically important banks (G-SIB) and lacks such an examination program to protect financial stability and mitigate systemic risk.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Demanding the CFTC&rsquo;s Accountability</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Government accountability is the cornerstone of the U.S. system of federalism and individual liberty.&nbsp; As public servants sworn to uphold the Constitution, we should embrace the opportunity to improve.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Nobody, and no regulator, gets it right all the time.&nbsp; This obvious fact is a good thing&mdash;it creates opportunities to address challenges, fix problems, and build for the future.&nbsp; Change is hard, and transformation is even harder.&nbsp; But as someone whose career has been to drive change and transformation, I know it&rsquo;s worth it.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Some of my statements and staff questions as a Commissioner haven&rsquo;t always been popular. &nbsp;Speaking truth can be uncomfortable to hear, but that&rsquo;s essential to governance and oversight to ensure accountability.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s been my job as a Compliance officer, and that&rsquo;s my job as a Commissioner.&nbsp; My objective has always been for the Commission to excel at its mission to promote market integrity, and to avoid embarrassment and the degradation of our reputation as a leading regulator. &nbsp;I believe at this point, a third-party review could help us get back to the basics and on track to do what we do best.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Thank you.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h4>Payment landscape in Europe</h4>
<div class="dombanner"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Declining use of cash: the proportion of cash payments fell from 72% to 59% (2019-2022); number of banknotes in circulation decreased for the first time in 2023.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Fragmentation: there is no single European payment solution for digital payments at the point of sale anywhere in the euro area.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Dependence on international providers: 13 out of 20 euro area countries don&rsquo;t have a national card scheme and rely instead on international schemes for digital payments. These schemes account for 64% of all electronically-initiated transactions with cards issued in the euro area.</li>

<title>Statement Of CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam Regarding Proposed Event Contracts Rulemaking</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/statement-of-cftc-chairman-rostin-behnam-regarding-proposed-event-contracts-rule/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Proposed amendments, event contracts, CFTC, regulations, public interest<br />
Summary:<br />
Proposed amendments to CFTC rules on event contracts aim to clarify and restrict certain types of contracts to protect market integrity.<br /> <div>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>I support the proposed amendments to the Commission&rsquo;s rules concerning event contracts.&nbsp; Before further discussion, I would like to acknowledge the tremendous work by many CFTC colleagues.&nbsp; I particularly would like to thank Vince McGonagle, Nora Flood, and Grey Tanzi for all of their thorough and thoughtful work on the proposal.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Starting in 2021, there has been a significant uptick in the number of event contracts listed for trading by CFTC-registered exchanges.&nbsp; To put that increase into perspective, more event contracts were listed for trading in 2021 than had been listed in the prior 15 years combined.&nbsp; And that has continued to be true each year since.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Given this exponential increase, the Commission today proposes to further specify the types of event contracts that fall within the scope of CEA section 5c(c)(5)(C) and are contrary to the public interest.&nbsp; The amendments will support efforts by registered entities to comply with the CEA by more clearly identifying the types of event contracts that may not be listed for trading or accepted for clearing.&nbsp; These changes will support responsible and efficient market innovation, by helping registered entities and new applicants to make informed decisions with respect to product design.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Specifically, the Commission is proposing to amend&nbsp;</span></span><span>Commission Regulation<span>&nbsp;40.11 to, among other things, further specify types of event contracts that fall within the scope of CEA section 5c(c)(5)(C) and are contrary to the public interest, such that they may not be listed for trading or accepted for clearing on or through a registered entity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The proposal defines &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; and provides illustrative examples of gaming, including the outcome of a political contest, the outcome of an awards contest, the outcome of a game in which one or more athletes compete, or an occurrence or non-occurrence in connection with such a contest or game.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The proposal includes a determination that event contracts involving each of the Enumerated Activities in CEA section 5c(c)(5)(C) (gaming, war, terrorism, assassination, and activity that is unlawful under state law) are, as a category, contrary to the public interest and therefore may not be listed for trading or accepted for clearing through a registered entity.&nbsp; The illustrative examples of gaming that I just mentioned are therefore contrary to the public interest and cannot be listed for trading.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>To be clear, that means that even contracts on the outcome of a political contest such as an election could not be listed for trading or accepted for clearing under the proposed rule.&nbsp; Such contracts not only fail to serve the economic purpose of the futures markets&mdash;they are illegal in several states and could potentially and impermissibly preempt State responsibilities for overseeing federal elections.&nbsp; This is not a new phenomenon for the CFTC. Over the course of the last 20 years, the CFTC has remained steadfast&mdash;through many administrations&mdash;that election or political contracts should not be allowed on the US futures and options markets.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Contracts involving political events ultimately commoditize and degrade the integrity of the uniquely American experience of participating in the democratic electoral process. &nbsp;Allowing these contracts would push the CFTC, a financial market regulator, into a position far beyond its Congressional mandate and expertise.&nbsp; To be blunt, such contracts would put the CFTC in the role of an election cop.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The CFTC&rsquo;s jurisdiction as mandated by Congress and solidified in our statute, the Commodity Exchange Act, recognizes our expertise in markets for goods, services, rights, and interests&mdash;which can include events associated with financial, commercial, or economic consequences.&nbsp; We are tasked with upholding the public interest by ensuring that America&rsquo;s derivatives markets provide a means for managing and assuming price risks and providing for price discovery through liquid, fair, open, transparent, and financially secure trading facilities.&nbsp; Market integrity is featured so prominently within that mandate that the CFTC has civil enforcement authority when it comes to the potential for fraud, manipulation, and other abuses such as the dissemination of false information in the underlying or commodity cash markets.&nbsp; Political control contracts on CFTC-regulated exchanges would push the CFTC far beyond this historical expertise and jurisdiction, and potentially place the CFTC in the position of monitoring such markets for fraud and manipulation in elections themselves.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>I thank the staff for their hard work in producing this important proposal.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p>On 16 April 2024 the Governing Council adopted Decision&nbsp;<a class="link-inline external" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024D1209&amp;qid=1714983433437">ECB/2024/11</a>&nbsp;on the remuneration of non-monetary policy deposits held with national central banks and the European Central Bank, under which the remuneration ceiling for euro area overnight government deposits will remain unchanged at euro short-term rate (&euro;STR) minus 20 basis points. It also adopted two legal acts adjusting the remuneration of other non-monetary policy deposits, namely Guideline&nbsp;<a class="link-inline external" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024O1210&amp;qid=1714983497957">ECB/2024/12</a>&nbsp;amending Guideline (EU) 2019/671 on domestic asset and liability management operations by the national central banks (ECB/2019/7) and Guideline&nbsp;<a class="link-inline external" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024O1211&amp;qid=1714983528549">ECB/2024/13</a>&nbsp;on the Eurosystem&rsquo;s provision of reserve management services in euro to central banks and countries located outside the euro area and to international organisations.

<h2>Macroprudential policy and financial stability</h2>
<p><em>Financial Stability Review &ndash; May 2024</em></p>
<p>On 8 May 2024 the Governing Council held an exchange of views on euro area financial stability issues on the basis of the May 2024 edition of the Financial Stability Review and authorised its publication on the ECB&rsquo;s website. In addition to providing an overview of key financial stability vulnerabilities in the euro area, this edition includes three special features. The first examines the implications of geopolitical risk for euro area financial stability. The second investigates the financial stability risks and benefits associated with the rise of artificial intelligence, while the third looks closer into the financial stability risks stemming from private markets. The Review is scheduled to be published on the ECB&rsquo;s website on 16 May 2024.</p>
<h2>Market infrastructure and payments</h2>

The update suggested that the overall ECMS project delivery is on track, while some challenges remain.</p>

<div> Proposed International Ethics Standards for Sustainability Assurance, IOSCO, IESBA, sustainability information, transparency<br />
Summary:<br />
IOSCO congratulates IESBA on publishing Proposed International Ethics Standards for Sustainability Assurance. They aim for global consistency in sustainability-related disclosures. Ethical standards are a prerequisite for credible statements. <div>
<p>IOSCO today congratulated the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA) on achieving an important milestone by publishing for consultation their Proposed International Ethics Standards for Sustainability Assurance (IESSA) and Other Revisions to the Code Relating to Sustainability Assurance and Reporting (the Paper).</p>
<p>IOSCO also acknowledged IESBA&rsquo;s extensive outreach program conducted during the exposure draft development and during the consultation period.</p>
<p>Based on its review of the Paper and additional stakeholder engagement,&nbsp;<a href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iosco.org%2Flibrary%2Fpubdocs%2Fpdf%2FIOSCOPD765.pdf&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cmailing-lists%40iosco.org%7C82fca3c85d044d4bf65108dc70f6dfe0%7Cbcc6c66cdb3b48328af2cc363a097444%7C0%7C0%7C638509452839571606%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=wN8au3Q3jNz%2Bukh%2BNXgvE9tYEdNoYs6MWrJX%2BIfpKvQ%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank">IOSCO outlined its general observations and its six key priority areas for IESBA&rsquo;s consideration in developing its final standard</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Definition of sustainability information</li>
<li>Scope of International Independence Standards</li>
<li>Non-compliance with laws and regulations</li>
<li>Group Sustainability Assurance engagements</li>
<li>Value Chain</li>
<li>Transparency when reporting on PIEs</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Jean-Paul Servais, Chair of the Board of IOSCO</strong>, commented: &ldquo;I congratulate the IESBA Chair, the IESBA Board, and wider staff for this achievement, and for their excellent cooperation with the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) throughout. IESBA&rsquo;s work towards the development of profession-agnostic ethics and independence standards, combined with standards under development by the IAASB, means we are well placed to deliver a global assurance framework at the start of 2025, in accordance with IOSCO&rsquo;s preferred timetable.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Rodrigo Buenaventura, Chair of the Sustainable Finance Task Force said</strong>: &ldquo;When IOSCO endorsed the inaugural sustainability disclosure standards of the ISSB, we were very clear that having assurance (including ethical) standards in place was a prerequisite for achieving consistently prepared and independently assured sustainability disclosures by issuers of securities across the globe. Only through independent assurance will we have credible statements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>IOSCO will continue to play a key role in promoting global consistency in the assurance of sustainability-related disclosures by market issuers and support its members and other stakeholders as they work to enhance trust in corporate sustainability-related reporting.</p>

Summary: Taheer Sardar sentenced to 18 months for perverting course of justice with forged document in FCA's investigation of fraud. <div>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>Taheer Sardar has today been sentenced to 18 months&rsquo; imprisonment for perverting the course of justice at Southwark Crown Court. Mr Sardar pleaded guilty on 7 May 2024.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>Mr Sardar was interviewed by the FCA as part of an investigation it was conducting into a sophisticated boiler room scam that had defrauded 120 investors of &pound;1.3m. Three individuals, Mr Mirza, Mr Solaja and Mr Vickers were subsequently convicted and sentenced to 23 years for that fraud following prosecution by the FCA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In his interview, Mr Sardar, acting with Mr Mirza, provided a forged document, which he claimed had been signed by 'Mohammed Khan'. Mr Sardar sought to use the document to bolster a defence raised by Raheel Mirza and Opeyemi Solaja, who had claimed &ndash; without evidence &ndash; that someone named 'Mohammed Khan' was the architect of the fraud they had been involved in.</p>
<p>The FCA did not find that Mr Sardar was involved in the fraud itself, but he provided the document in order to mislead the FCA. &nbsp;</p>
<p><span>At Mr Sardar&rsquo;s sentencing on 10 May 2024, the Judge, Mr Recorder Gavaghan, remarked that</span>:</p>
<p>'This was a sophisticated attempt using a forged document to undermine the course of justice&hellip;[it was] a very serious offence that strikes at the very core of the legal system.'&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Steve Smart, joint Executive Director, Enforcement and Market Oversight at the FCA, said</span>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>'Mr Sardar&rsquo;s conviction and sentence, is a strong warning to anyone who may be tempted to try to help others escape justice- there is no stone we will leave unturned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>'Perverting the course of justice is a serious offence, and the FCA will not hesitate to take action when it identifies this has taken place.'</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<ol>
<li>Taheer Sardar is from East London, date of birth 16 June 1978.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Raheel Mirza was convicted of conspiracy to defraud and perverting the course of justice on 3 April 2023. He received an 18 month consecutive sentence for the perverting the course of justice offence (consecutive with the 8 years sentence for fraud).&nbsp;</li>
<li>The facts concerning the conviction of Raheel Mirza on 3 April 2023 for perverting the course of justice were subject to reporting restrictions until the conclusion of the trial of Taheer Sardar. Perverting the course of justice is a serious criminal offence with a maximum sentence up to life imprisonment.&nbsp;</li>

<div> Financial stability, bank supervision, regulation, monetary policy, risk monitoring <br />
Summary: Financial stability is promoted through effective bank supervision, calibrated regulation to mitigate risks, and considering unintended consequences. Monetary policy impacts must also be addressed. <div>
<p>I would like to thank the Texas Bankers Association for the invitation to share my thoughts with you at this year's Annual Meeting.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240510a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;My remarks today focus on financial stability and the role of banking regulators in promoting financial stability and resiliency in the financial system.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240510a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;I will also describe principles that are complementary to promoting safety and soundness&mdash;to help inform the regulatory and supervisory agenda.</p>
<p>Of course, it would be difficult to provide an exhaustive list of the financial stability risks facing the financial system in the time we are together today. So, while I will highlight a few key risks, one must approach this topic with humility, acknowledging that there are limits to a regulator's ability to anticipate every possible financial stability risk in a dynamic and increasingly interconnected world.</p>
<p>Financial stability is an important function of the Federal Reserve. Our financial stability function is supported through appropriate monetary policy, bank supervision and regulation, and by monitoring risks in the U.S. and abroad. A stable financial system provides a solid foundation for a healthy banking system and a growing economy that facilitates maximum employment and stable prices. The Fed's recently published&nbsp;<em>Financial Stability Report</em>&nbsp;discusses financial stability risks in terms of interactions between shocks and vulnerabilities. A financial stability shock is an adverse event or series of events that often occur without warning and severely affect the financial system. A financial stability vulnerability includes a specific characteristic of, or activity conducted in, the financial system that can increase the severity of a stress event when a shock occurs.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240510a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;Since shocks are difficult to predict, the Federal Reserve's monitoring efforts primarily focus on vulnerabilities and the buildup of risks that can accrue over time potentially affecting the resiliency of the financial system.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<em>Financial Stability Report</em>&nbsp;is worth a read. And while I will not recite the many findings of that report today, I will highlight a few of the risks discussed in the report. It is important to keep in mind that the report provides only a snapshot of the current financial stability vulnerabilities and risks. Because the report treats cyberattacks and geopolitical events as shocks, it touches on them only in a cursory way, even though these are important financial stability risks. Instead, the report focuses on key vulnerabilities that are more easily monitored and provides insights into the financial stability outlook as it relates to these factors.</p>
<p>While the framing of the&nbsp;<em>Financial Stability Report</em>&mdash;in terms of shocks and vulnerabilities&mdash;can be a useful, structured approach to consider this topic, there are many ways to think about financial stability. Often the boundary between shocks and vulnerabilities is a permeable one, and the buildup of risk can become so severe that it becomes a shock. The Federal Reserve plays an important&mdash;but limited and non-exclusive&mdash;role in proactively addressing financial stability risks and responding to them once they manifest as stress across the system.</p>
<p>As I think about the tools we use to address financial stability concerns&mdash;and the tradeoffs we are often forced to make when exercising these powers&mdash;it is helpful to consider the lessons regulators have learned over time. While the end goal is the same&mdash;ensuring resiliency in the financial system to promote financial stability&mdash;there are a number of tools that can be used to address the unique characteristics of vulnerabilities and shocks.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve's financial stability monitoring does not operate in a vacuum. To the contrary, our other statutory authorities&mdash;including monetary policy or promoting safety and soundness in the banking system&mdash;can complement or conflict with the goal of promoting financial stability. Many of these authorities interact with banking activities and institutions that are subject to our supervisory or regulatory authority.</p>
<p>In light of this, I will begin by discussing how the use of traditional tools to support safety and soundness&mdash;both regulation and supervision&mdash;can help promote financial stability. I will then describe the limits of these tools, and then conclude with a brief discussion of some other key financial stability risks.</p>
<p><strong>Financial Stability and the Role of Regulators</strong><br />The Federal Reserve plays an important but limited role in promoting the stability of the financial system through resiliency to shocks, and by proactively addressing vulnerabilities. This responsibility can be complemented and supported, or in some cases weakened through the execution of the Federal Reserve's other responsibilities, including monetary policy or the exercise of our emergency authorities. At times, these objectives may appear to present tension or be in conflict.</p>
<p>For example, the banking stress last year resulted from a number of underlying causes. But it is clear that trends in the interest rate environment when the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) was rapidly tightening policy to combat inflation were an important factor that contributed to Silicon Valley Bank's (SVB's) failure. The Federal Reserve's documented supervisory shortcomings and the lack of SVB management attention to these risks were also key contributors to the firm's failure.</p>
<p>To be sure, the role of monetary policy in the demise of SVB does not excuse SVB's management from its inability to manage the firm's interest rate risk exposures or excuse the ineffective supervisory response that enabled the buildup of the firm's excessive risk. And I am not calling into question the FOMC's monetary policy decisions from that time, which were appropriately focused on our congressionally established mandates of maximum employment and stable prices. Instead, these issues highlight the challenging interrelationships of the various roles and functions of the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>This becomes more complicated when we consider the Federal Reserve's financial stability objectives in the context of its prudential mandates to promote the safe and sound operation of regulated financial institutions. The tools of bank regulation and supervision can promote the safety and soundness of individual financial institutions, but they can also be a positive force when it comes to financial stability. When regulators are successful in their task of ensuring the safe and sound operation of the banking system&mdash;one of the core mandates for banking regulators&mdash;often there is a corresponding benefit to financial stability. Put another way, if the individual parts of the banking system are healthy, this often promotes the health and stability of the broader financial system.</p>
<p>But the goal of promoting bank safety and soundness is narrowly focused within the regulatory perimeter&mdash;and the institutions and activities within our regulatory and supervisory authority. By contrast, financial stability must be concerned with the broader financial system, including the multitude of nonbank institutions that play an important role not only in delivering financial products and services, but also in the broader U.S. economy.</p>
<p>So today, I'd like to share three principles that can help frame a discussion of the role of banking regulators in promoting financial stability:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bank supervision can be an effective and efficient tool to promote financial stability. It is important that supervisors focus on core banking risks.</li>
<li>Where bank regulation may create or exacerbate financial stability risks, we need to take a hard look at whether those risks are justified by the safety-and-soundness benefits of the regulation.</li>
<li>As we evaluate the merits of bank regulation and supervision, we must consider how the Federal Reserve's regulatory proposals affect markets and institutions beyond the bank regulatory perimeter. This will enable us to better understand the potential unintended consequences.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is value in our current approach to addressing financial stability risks. We monitor risks and how they build up or manifest as stress in the financial system. And we react in a way that is informed by that monitoring, either to proactively address the buildup of risk, or to address the consequences of events that could threaten financial stability. A review of past events that presented stability concerns can help us evaluate our existing work and inform the direction of future investments.</p>
<p><strong>Effective Bank Supervision to Promote Financial Stability</strong><br />First, bank supervision can be an effective and efficient tool to promote financial stability. I think it is helpful to consider commercial real estate (CRE) as an example.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240510a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;Commercial real estate continues to be an area of focus for both banks and regulators. Some banks have experienced an increase in CRE loan delinquencies, although delinquency rates generally remain low. As we know, one of the factors that has led to CRE stress in certain property types, like office, is the post-pandemic changes in the demand for, and use of, these CRE properties. Should this trend continue, we could see declines in property values, reduced rental income cash flows, or other conditions that could lead to impairment of some banks' CRE loans or portfolios, especially if those loans mature and are refinanced at higher interest rates. I expect we will continue to see material differences in the performance of CRE across the various types of commercial property and in specific geographic regions. This will be due, in part, to variations in regional return-to-office patterns, and the shifting demand for different types of CRE properties.</p>
<p>So, what can we learn from this CRE experience? First, supervision can be an effective tool to mitigate vulnerabilities, like the increasing credit risk associated with certain kinds of lending. Underwriting standards and loan-to-value ratios have improved significantly since the 2008&ndash;09 financial crisis, and more recently we have seen credit conditions for CRE lending tighten, even as loan demand weakened. I see this as reflecting both better management of these loans and portfolios, and more proactive supervision of material risk.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240510a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;Banks are also well-equipped to work with their CRE borrowers to mitigate stress, including through loan accommodations and workouts.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240510a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;Supervision can be particularly effective at addressing well-known, core banking risks, especially when this supervisory work is conducted effectively and without being distracted by non-core risks.</p>
<p>Despite the promise of supervision as a tool to promote financial stability, supervision can sometimes fail to address the significant buildup of traditional risk. And supervision can be susceptible to being diverted from core risks to issues of less material concern. For example, take the dynamics that led to the failure of SVB. The buildup of interest rate risk in the banking system was a known vulnerability and material risk, not just for SVB, but for all financial institutions. The responsibility for managing this risk fell on the management team at SVB, just as it falls on every bank that has material exposure to interest rate risk. And yet, the failure of SVB created something of a "shock" event within the banking system, one that led to a vigorous response with the creation of the Bank Term Funding Program and invoking the systemic risk exemption to guarantee all depositors of SVB and Signature Bank.</p>
<p>I think it is an oversimplification to point to any one factor as the root cause of the failure of SVB. There were a number of issues that contributed to the firm's ultimate failure. These events included rapid growth, poor risk management, poor public communication, a lack of supervisory attention to core risks, and an insufficiently robust supervisory response to the buildup of interest rate and funding risk. These issues were exacerbated by operational and technological problems with FedWire and discount window lending. The cumulative effect of these issues likely accelerated the firm's failure and increased the scope of the resulting financial harm. But certainly, this is a clear example of where the Federal Reserve's proactive tools&mdash;supervision of risk management, and the operation of liquidity support and payment tools&mdash;could have been much more effective.</p>
<p>Therefore, the virtue of supervision as a proactive measure to support financial stability comes with a cautionary note. Ineffective supervision itself can compound financial stability risks by allowing the buildup of risk without commensurate risk-management measures or supervisory attention. One protective measure that we can take to support effective supervision is to ensure that focus on traditional risks is not lost or diluted. One example of a supervisory and regulatory distraction is from the Fed's recent focus on climate risk. Recently, the Federal Reserve conducted a pilot climate scenario exercise with a subset of the largest U.S. global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) and issued guidance to large institutions on managing climate-related financial risk. This regulatory attention and focus on one specific, non-core risk could reasonably call into question whether regulatory priorities are focused sufficiently on key risks. Firms are already required to manage all material risks, and prioritizing climate risk in this way could lead to the misallocation of risk-management resources.</p>
<p><strong>Regulatory Approaches to Promote Financial Stability</strong><br />Second, where regulation may create or exacerbate financial stability risks, we need to take a close look at whether those risks are justified by the safety and soundness benefits of the regulation.</p>
<p>For example, consider the threat to financial stability resulting from market illiquidity. Liquidity is essential to effective market functioning, and liquidity in the U.S. Treasury market is particularly important due to its critical role in the U.S. and global financial systems.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240510a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;This is an area that, in relative terms, has recently experienced stress events as in the September 2019 repo market stress, and the so-called "dash for cash" in March of 2020. These events raised concerns about the resiliency of U.S. Treasury markets. Even today, some indicators signal low market liquidity through market depth in U.S. Treasury cash markets, which have been at levels below historical norms.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240510a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a></p>
<p>Banks play an important role in providing liquidity, and there are clear signs that liquidity in Treasury markets is low.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240510a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;While there may be a number of reasons for reduced Treasury market liquidity, I would note two specific factors and ongoing risks: (1) concerns by banks about balance sheet capacity to engage in low-margin market activities, and (2) the cumulative regulatory burden on banks when they engage in market-making activities, which includes most recently the proposed increase in capital costs for market making activity proposed by the Basel III endgame rulemaking, and an apparent lack of interest in addressing the constraints on bank activities caused by bank leverage ratios. Ultimately, liquidity in the U.S. Treasury market has the potential to amplify or dampen shocks to the financial system.</p>
<p>Where we can take proactive regulatory measures to ensure that primary dealers have adequate balance sheet capacity to intermediate Treasury markets in times of stress, we should do so. This could include amending the leverage ratio and G-SIB surcharge for the largest U.S. banks. And where we can take into consideration the impact of regulatory reforms on financial stability, we must at least acknowledge the tradeoffs and the potential downside risks that regulatory changes could create. This is particularly important when considering significant increases to capital requirements, especially those of the scale contemplated by the Basel III proposal, including the market risk capital increases.</p>
<p>Adopting regulatory changes to mitigate these concerns may not be sufficient to promote market liquidity, but it would be an important step toward building resiliency in advance of future stress events. In my view, it would be better to fix the roof now, while the sun is shining, by addressing over-calibrated leverage ratio requirements and moderating capital increases for the Basel III proposal.</p>
<p><strong>Unintended Consequences of Overregulation and Disproportionate Supervision</strong><br />Finally, as we evaluate the merit of regulations and supervisory approaches, we must understand the broader implications beyond the regulatory perimeter. We have seen a migration of activity out of the regulated banking sector to a variety of alternative service providers and nonbank financial institutions and intermediaries. As the&nbsp;<em>Financial Stability Report</em>&nbsp;notes, hedge fund leverage reached 18 to 1 in the third quarter of 2023 for "average on-balance sheet leverage of the top 15 hedge funds by gross asset value."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240510a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a>&nbsp;Throughout 2023, bank&nbsp;<em>lending&nbsp;</em>to nonbank financial institutions&mdash;a category that includes hedge funds&mdash;also increased.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240510a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a>&nbsp;While this increase was accompanied by continued declines in delinquency rates for bank lending to nonbank financial institutions, I think it is worth considering how this activity could ultimately bleed back into the regulated banking system.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240510a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a></p>
<p>We should also consider structural shifts that have potential implications for financial stability. In shaping the bank regulatory framework, we must acknowledge that regulation and supervision already influence the location of activity and will continue to do so.</p>
<p>We also know that the cost of bank regulation, including bank capital requirements, influences&nbsp;<em>where</em>&nbsp;activities occur, either within the banking system or in nonbank entities outside of the regulatory perimeter. Absent other factors, over time the cost difference of providing a service between a bank and nonbank provider will lead activity to migrate to the lowest cost provider. Just as with the residential mortgage market, these shifts have real consequences for where activity occurs.</p>
<p>Therefore, the threshold question we need to ask is whether regulation and supervision are appropriately calibrated to risk over time. Ultimately, even if regulation and supervision are rigorous&mdash;imposing higher standards on banks than on nonbanks&mdash;this does not necessarily mean that the standards applied to banks are not appropriate. It may be that activity conducted by nonbanks lacks appropriate supervision and regulation.</p>
<p>Imposing the same level and type of regulation and oversight on activity that occurs outside of the banking system is beyond the scope of bank regulatory authority. However, we must be careful not to facilitate the transfer of activity and risk out of the banking system simply by imposing standards that are disproportionate to risk for the same activities that are conducted by banks. The same activity presenting the same risk should receive the same regulation. Same activity, same risk, same regulation.</p>
<p>Striking the right balance and calibration for the regulation of specific activities is not always a simple task, nor is the establishment of expectations that accompanies regulation and supervision always subject to scientific precision. That being said, one does not need to look any further than the proposed Basel III endgame capital rules to find reforms that are excessively calibrated and disproportionate to risk. This proposal contemplated a 20 percent increase in risk-weighted assets across bank holding companies subject to the rule. Public commenters raised significant concerns that the limited analysis included with the Basel III proposal may have significantly understated the scope of the capital increase. In response to this concern, the Board launched a data collection to gather more information from banks to better understand the impacts of the proposal, the results of which will hopefully be released soon.</p>
<p>As I have discussed in the past, if implemented as proposed, the effects are predictable: higher costs of capital for banks, higher costs of services for customers, less availability and narrower selection of services, and increased concentration in the providers of financial products and services.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240510a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a>&nbsp;Driving risk out of the regulated banking system could lead to marginal improvements in bank safety and soundness, but the consequences for financial stability could be severely adverse. As I noted above, we have already seen reduced market activity driven by the leverage ratio and other regulatory constraints on bank balance sheets. We have also seen banks tighten credit standards and reduce lending activity, which often leads to a credit "gap" left to be filled by nonbank lenders. As activity and risk migrates from the banking system to nonbanks, we should ask how these shifts will impact financial stability over the long run, even though we have less visibility and insight once they leave the banking system.</p>
<p>The Basel III capital rules are only a subset of regulatory proposals for change that involve the challenging task of achieving the right calibration to risk over time. A glut of new bank regulatory reforms and supervisory guidance raise this concern, including revisions to the G-SIB surcharge, new long-term debt requirements, amended resolution plan guidance, contemplated changes to the regulatory approval of merger and acquisition activity, and revisions to the interchange fee cap. The cumulative effects of these regulatory proposals are significant.</p>
<p>This cautionary note does not mean that I am opposed to appropriate reforms to bank regulation and supervision&mdash;both tools must adapt to changing conditions and risks. Last year we saw significant stress in the banking system due to a few bank failures and the persistence of higher inflation and interest rates in the U.S. and in many other countries around the world. But we should not assume that "more" is always better. More regulation and more supervision are only effective if the changes are targeted to address an existing problem and are appropriately focused and efficient.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240510a.htm#fn14" title="footnote 14"><span>14</span></a><a name="f14"></a>&nbsp;When they are targeted and efficient, they may result in a net positive both in bank safety and soundness, and in financial stability. The function of bank regulators is not to create a bank regulatory framework that eliminates risk. Banking is inherently about managing, not eliminating, risk.</p>
<p><strong>Closing</strong><br />My remarks today are not meant to be an exhaustive list of all the financial stability threats facing the U.S. banking system, but I would be remiss in concluding without briefly mentioning a few other key financial stability risks, all of which I expect are familiar to you.</p>
<p>First, monetary policy and the fight against inflation. This is a key risk identified in the&nbsp;<em>Financial Stability Report</em>, and in surveys of bankers. When effectively implemented, monetary policy promotes price stability and maximum employment. In the long run, achieving both of these objectives promotes the stability of the broader financial system. It is of utmost importance that we maintain credibility in pursuing our fight against inflation by proceeding carefully and deliberately to achieve our 2 percent goal.</p>
<p>But we cannot ignore the fact that monetary policy can present risks to the banking system and the broader financial system. Changes in interest rates can make it more difficult for banks to manage interest rate risk, particularly in the face of rapid rate increases like those from 2022 and 2023. We know that many banks have seen a significant increase in unrealized losses on their balance sheets, a trend that has led to pressure on liquidity, funding, and capital for some institutions.</p>
<p>While monetary policy mandates may support long-term financial stability, monetary policy is an independent function that may heighten short-term stresses in the banking system. Our supervisory activities should reflect an awareness of these effects on bank management decisionmaking as we rely on regulation and supervision to promote resilience in the regulated banking system, with the goal of helping banks as they navigate an evolving macroeconomic environment and adjust to major shifts in the stance of monetary policy.</p>
<p>Today's banking system has also been heavily shaped by the effects of COVID-related stimulus on deposit activity. Many banks saw a significant inflow of deposits as a direct result of COVID-related stimulus with excess savings accumulating due to lockdowns. This trend created challenges for banks, who may have lacked sufficient opportunities to invest or extend credit in a world affected by COVID lockdowns. The rapid increase in deposits in the banking system, and their subsequent drawdown, have pressure tested banks' abilities to manage funding and interest rate risks, and posed significant challenges for banks faced with few opportunities to put funding to productive use.</p>
<p>While there are important pockets of financial stability risk where the Federal Reserve lacks authority, there are meaningful improvements that can be made to our regulatory and supervisory approach that could enhance financial stability. Bank regulation and supervision can best accomplish their goals when guided by transparency, fairness, and efficiency. We must remember that there are always consequences to financial stability from miscalibrated regulatory and supervisory actions and the cumulative effects of regulatory proposals.</p>
<p>I hope my discussion today has helped to highlight the role of financial regulators in promoting financial stability, through (1) applying supervision to mitigate and promote resilience to financial system vulnerabilities, (2) adopting bank regulatory approaches that further financial stability goals, and (3) taking into account the unintended consequences and tradeoffs of overregulation and disproportionate supervision&mdash;particularly as they may result in negative consequences.</p>
<p>Of course, while these principles are helpful guides to how regulators can best promote financial stability, they are also insufficient. We must be thoughtful about the limits of regulatory authorities&mdash;and abide by those limits, even in the face of significant stress. The Federal Reserve and the bank regulatory framework do not hold the solution to every financial stability problem, and we must have confidence that other regulators, and other branches of government, will take appropriate steps to preserve financial stability when needed.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time today, and I look forward to our discussion.</p>

<div> initiative, financial literacy, investment, teachers, educational institutions
Summary:<br />SET's "INVESTORY Investment Learning Design Bootcamp" promotes financial literacy through teacher training and classroom activities, reaching 11,422 students in 66 institutions nationwide. <div>
<p>The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) is committed to promoting financial literacy among Thai youth. The recent educational initiative so called &nbsp;&ldquo;INVESTORY Investment Learning Design Bootcamp&rdquo; has been organized for two &nbsp;consecutive years. The initiative provides knowledge and skills for secondary school teachers to design active learning models on personal finance and investment knowledge for their students. SET aims to further develop an investment curriculum for secondary school students in national education. To date, there are learning facilitators of this initiative in 66 educational institutions nationwide.</p>
<p><b>SET President Pakorn Peetathawatchai </b>said that SET has continuously promoted financial literacy to the Thai people for over two decades, especially among youths. SET recognized that financial knowledge would lead to good money management skills that youths were able to apply in their daily lives and that teachers played a part in cultivating and transferring such knowledge, thanks to their rapport with deep understanding of their students. SET has therefore provided a learning space for teachers to apply knowledge gained from SET and design suitable investment learning activities to be used in schools with different environment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The INVESTORY Investment Learning Design Bootcamp initiative focuses on supporting and preparing secondary school teachers as the students from Grade 7- Grade 12 are interested in learning how to start investing. Laying the foundation from the very beginning is crucial. SET serves as a teacher's coach, providing knowledge, tools, and materials to enable teachers to become learning facilitators. The teachers, in turn, create an active learning process and tailor the teaching materials suitable for the context of each classroom to meet the needs of their students. Until now, this initiative has created investment-learning facilitators in 66 educational institutions across 24 provinces nationwide, reaching a total of 11,422 students. There are currently 19 investment classroom models. SET will continue to develop investment toolkits for teachers to use more easily and conveniently. With this unique opportunity, we are certain that the investment knowledge will be introduced into the Thai education system more broadly," added Pakorn.</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s &ldquo;Show &amp; Share&rdquo; event of INVESTORY Investment Learning Design Bootcamp initiative provides a platform for the teachers to showcase the activities and teaching processes that have been developed and successfully tested in their classrooms to other teachers and the general public. In addition, three investment-learning facilitators from two schools also share their experiences of creating successful investment classrooms.</p>
<p><b>A teacher at Chulalongkorn University Demonstration Secondary School, and the creator of "Classroom for Wealth&rdquo; Kamonchanok Sakondhawat</b> said that participating in the first batch of this initiative has given her a clearer understanding on previously misunderstood investment issues and more confidence to teach investment. In addition, she has learned a lot more by networking and exchanging ideas with teams from SET, BlackBox, and teachers from other schools. The teams from SET and BlackBox have provided advice and assistance continuously. Even after completing the first batch of training, there have also been a lot of opportunities to join and update knowledge with learning facilitators in other batches, emphasizing that the training ended but the spirit of the Bootcamp group would continue.</p>
<p><b>A teacher at Ban Maengonkilek School Chiang Mai Provincial Administrative Organization and a co-creator of "Lights in Highlands"</b> <b>Rattanachat Sarapo </b>said that personal finance and investment knowledge were challenging not only for students, but also for teachers. He has been in a process of trial and error himself to manage his money more appropriately. He believed it would be better for students and teachers to learn together in the classroom in order to change their lives and future using the knowledge from SET.</p>
<p><b>Another teacher at Ban Maengonkilek School Chiang Mai Provincial Administrative Organization and a co-creator of "Lights in Highlands"</b> <b>Chalermkwan Wongphanit</b> said that for her this initiative was like a sincere friend in designing investment classrooms for students. Knowledge, teaching ideas, and physical as well as mental support from the Bootcamp group brought personal finance and investment knowledge closer to students. Moreover, teachers&rsquo; attitude towards spending money has been changed after participating in this initiative.</p>

<div> charged, unlicensed, fund management, trial, offences
<br />
Pixelvest and Infinity Trustee Berhad (ITB) charged for unlicensed fund management. Individuals claimed trial for related offences. SC encourages caution.
<br /><br />Summary: Pixelvest and ITB charged for unlicensed fund management. Individuals claimed trial for related offences. SC advises caution. <div>
<p>The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) had charged two companies and one individual in the Kuala Lumpur Sessions Court with three offences relating to unlicensed capital market activities.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Pixelvest Sdn Bhd (Pixelvest) was charged today with one count under section 58(1) of the Capital Markets and Services Act 2007 (CMSA) for carrying on a fund management business without a licence. Pixelvest, represented by its director Ang Jen Chuen (Dexter Ang), claimed trial to the charge before Sessions Court judge Puan Norina binti Zainol Abidin.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This follows the charges filed by the SC against Infinity Trustee Berhad (ITB) on 30 April 2024, with two counts under section 58(1) read together with section 370(b) of the CMSA.&nbsp; &nbsp;The offence is in relation to ITB transferring funds amounting to RM116,292,904.15 to Pixelvest through two accounts in furtherance of the offence committed by Pixelvest.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>ITB company representative, Tan Boon Hoong, had claimed trial to both charges before Sessions Court judge Datin Fadzlin Suraya Mohd Suah.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Separately, former ITB director Chin Wai Lan (Sophia Chin) was also charged today with one count under section 58(1) read together with sections 370(b) and 367(1) of the CMSA.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The charge against Sophia Chin is in relation to ITB&rsquo;s act of transferring funds amounting to RM859,750.00 from ITB&rsquo;s account to Pixelvest in furtherance of Pixelvest&rsquo;s offence under section 58(1) of the CMSA. Sophia Chin was deemed to have committed the offence by virtue of her position as director of ITB at the material time.</p>
<p>Sophia Chin claimed trial to the charge before Sessions Court judge Tuan Azrul Darus. No bail sum was imposed by the judge in view of Sophia Chin&rsquo;s existing bail conditions in her other ongoing case before the Court.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The offences committed by Pixelvest and Sophia Chin took place in Petaling Jaya, Selangor between December 2020 and October 2022.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Fund management is a regulated activity that requires a licence by the SC under Schedule 2 of the CMSA. Any person carrying on this activity without a licence commits an offence under the CMSA which is punishable with a maximum fine of RM10 million or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years, or both.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The charges follow the SC&rsquo;s charging of Sophia Chin, Dexter Ang and Syaiful Riezal Ahmad, ITB&rsquo;s former Chief Executive Officer for related offences under section 58(1) of the CMSA and section 4(1)(b) of the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act 2001 (AMLATFPUAA).&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The SC views unlicensed activities seriously and remains committed in investor protection by continuous enforcement actions against those who contravene the law. When evaluating investment offers, investors are advised by the SC to exercise caution.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The public is encouraged to use the <a href="https://www.sc.com.my/investment-checker">SC Investment Checker</a><a href="https://www.sc.com.my/investment-checker">,</a> a one-stop portal available on the SC&rsquo;s website, to verify if an individual and/or entity is authorised by the SC to offer, promote, or sell any capital market products and services in Malaysia.</p>

Compliance with the guidelines is expected by 2025. The forum aims to enhance understanding and find effective solutions to strengthen resilience. The SC is proactive in preparing the industry for potential cyber threats through the Capital Market Cyber Simulation.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p align="left"><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Key Highlights:</span></b></p>
<p>In his welcoming remarks, SC Chairman, Dato&rsquo; Seri Dr. Awang Adek Hussin, stressed on the need for effective leadership to navigate the complexities of technological advancements.

<p>Here are highlights from his welcoming remarks:</p>
<ol>
<li>The SC's commitment to driving fintech development through upcoming initiatives like the Innopolicy Roundtables, Pitch and Match sessions, and the SCxSC Fintech Summit underscores the importance of collaboration between regulators and industry stakeholders in addressing emerging challenges.&nbsp; </li>
<li>Cyber hygiene practices are fundamental to an organisation&rsquo;s ability to defend itself from cyber-attack, ransomware, and even data loss events. </li>
<li>It is important to ensure a comprehensive technology risk management framework is in place for leaders of organisations.&nbsp; </li>
<li>The SC is preparing the industry to face challenges that may arise through intiatives such as the Guidelines on Technology Risk Management (GTRM) and the Capital Market Cyber Simulation (CMCS).&nbsp; </li>
<li>Guidelines on Technology Risk Management will take effect on 1 August 2024.&nbsp; </li>
<li>Entities are expected to submit a declaration of compliance to the GTRM to the SC by the first quarter of 2025. </li>
</ol>
<p align="left"><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Full Speech:</span> </b></p>
<p>Tuan-Tuan dan Puan-Puan Yang Dihormati Sekalian</p>
<p>Assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh, salam sejahtera dan selamat pagi.</p>
<ol>
<li>Welcome to today&rsquo;s SCxSC: C-Suite Forum on Managing Technology and Cyber Risks. </li>
<li>First and foremost, I wish to express my sincere apologies for not being able to join you in person this morning. </li>
<li>Despite my physical absence, I am truly honoured to address such an esteemed gathering and would like to express my heartfelt appreciation for your participation.&nbsp; </li>
<li>Your presence here this morning represents your strong commitment to managing the technology and cyber risks within the Malaysian capital market.&nbsp; </li>
<li>As such, I eagerly anticipate the invaluable insights and discussions that will unfold today.&nbsp; </li>
</ol>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>The pace of technological advancement, both globally and locally is unprecedented. Cloud computing, big data, blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) offer opportunities to redefine our market and optimise operations like never before. </li>
<li>Additionally, we have observed a growing reliance on third-party service providers, particularly in areas like Cloud Services and artificial intelligence, among others. </li>
<li>But with every advancement, there are inherent risks &ndash; from cybersecurity vulnerabilities to regulatory compliance concerns. </li>
<li>We need effective leadership to navigate the complexities of technological advancements.&nbsp; </li>
<li>Effective leadership sets the tone on technology governance and cybersecurity culture. This would also bridge conversations between business, IT, and security functions and ensure organisational alignment and adaptability. </li>
<li>Today&rsquo;s forum holds special significance. Against the backdrop of ever-evolving landscape of technology and cyber risks, it is crucial for us to come together to enhance our understanding and find effective solutions that can strengthen our resilience. </li>
<li><b>The SC&rsquo;s commitment to driving fintech development through upcoming initiatives like the Innopolicy Roundtables, Pitch and Match sessions, and the SCxSC Fintech Summit</b> underscores the importance of collaboration between regulators and industry stakeholders in addressing emerging challenges.&nbsp; </li>
<li>Similarly, this event aims to keep the industry abreast with the latest technology trends and shed light on prevalent industry technology audit findings and incidents that may impact business operations. The SC would also like to align leadership role expectations, reinforcing what is expected of the top brass regarding managing technology risk. </li>
<li>I have been informed that many industry players still fall short in their cyber hygiene practices even in terms of basic controls to critical systems. This is highly concerning because such basic hygiene is fundamental to an organisation&rsquo;s ability to defend itself and our analysis suggests that inadequacies lead to cyber-attacks, ransomware, and even data loss.&nbsp; </li>
<li>Many organisations also are not keeping up with key security practices like penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, hardening practice, privileged access management and regular review on user ID, to name a few. This is alarming especially with cyber incidents, such as ransomware and data breaches becoming more common. </li>
<li>In today&rsquo;s business landscape, use of third-party services such as cloud services is increasingly predominant. We find that organisations can do better in managing risks related to third-party service providers by putting proper frameworks in place. </li>
<li><b>For leaders of organisations such as yourselves, it is important to ensure a comprehensive technology risk management framework is in place.</b> This guides organisations to identify key risks and put the right controls in place. </li>
<li>Through initiatives like the <b>Guidelines on Technology Risk Management (GTRM)</b> and the <b>Capital Market Cyber Simulation (CMCS)</b>, we are preparing the industry to face any challenges that arise.&nbsp; </li>
<li><b>Please note that the Guidelines on Technology Risk Management will take effect on 1 August 2024.</b> It is designed to guide the market participants to establish a sound and robust technology risk governance and oversight. </li>
<li>In addition to that, <b>entities are expected to submit a declaration of compliance to the GTRM to the SC by quarter 1, 2025</b>. More information regarding this will follow closer to the Guidelines taking effect. </li>
<li>Meanwhile, the Capital Market Cyber Simulation serves as a testament to the SC&rsquo;s proactive approach in preparing the industry for cyber incidents. By simulating realworld scenarios, organisations can test their response and recovery strategies, thereby strengthening their resilience against potential cyber threats. </li>
</ol>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p>
<ol start="22">
<li>In conclusion, today&rsquo;s forum marks the beginning of an ongoing partnership aimed at shaping the future of our industry.&nbsp; </li>
<li>Your attendance here today underscores your commitment to fortifying our collective resilience in the face of technological challenges. </li>
<li>Together, let us embark on this journey towards a brighter future, defined by innovation and collaboration, with resilience. </li>
<li>Thank you. Sekian, terima kasih. </li>

<div> private placement, debentures, TMX Group, offering, Canada
Summary: TMX Group offers private placement of $300 million debentures in Canada, closing on May 24, 2024, to be used for repaying debt. <div>
<p class="sizeable">TMX Group Limited ("TMX Group") today announced that it has priced a Canadian private placement offering (the "Offering") of $300 million aggregate principal amount of 4.747% Series J Senior Unsecured Debentures due May 26, 2026 (the "Debentures") to accredited investors in Canada. The Debentures will be direct senior unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of TMX Group and will rank&nbsp;<em>pari passu&nbsp;</em>with all other senior unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of TMX Group.</p>
<p class="sizeable">TMX Group expects the Offering to close on May 24, 2024 and the Debentures are expected to receive a credit rating of "AA (Low)" with a Negative Trend from DBRS Limited.</p>
<p class="sizeable">The net proceeds from the Offering will be used to repay a portion of outstanding indebtedness and for general corporate purposes.</p>
<p class="sizeable">The Debentures are being offered exclusively to persons resident in a Canadian province through a syndicate of agents led by RBC Capital Markets and Scotiabank and including BMO Capital Markets, Canaccord Genuity, CIBC Capital Markets, National Bank Financial, TD Securities, Barclays, Casgrain &amp; Company, Citigroup and Laurentian Bank Securities, and on a private placement basis in reliance upon exemptions from the prospectus requirements under applicable securities laws in those provinces. The Debentures have not been qualified for sale to the public under such securities laws.</p>
<p class="sizeable">This news release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the Debentures or any other securities of TMX Group in any jurisdiction, and is not an offer for sale within the United States of any securities of TMX Group. Securities of TMX Group, including any debt securities, may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration under U.S. securities laws or unless exempt from registration under such laws. The Offering described in this news release is not being made in the United States and has not been and will not be registered under U.S. securities laws. Accordingly, the Debentures may not be offered or sold in the United States except in certain transactions exempt from the registration requirements under applicable U.S. securities laws.</p>
<p class="sizeable"><span>Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Information&nbsp;</span>This press release of TMX Group contains "forward-looking information" (as defined in applicable Canadian securities legislation) that is based on expectations, assumptions, estimates, projections and other factors that management believes to be relevant as of the date of this press release. Often, but not always, such forward-looking information can be identified by the use of forward-looking words such as "plans," "expects," "is expected," "budget," "scheduled," "targeted," "estimates," "forecasts," "intends," "anticipates," "believes," or variations or the negatives of such words and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or results "may," "could," "would," "might," or "will" be taken, occur or be achieved or not be taken, occur or be achieved. Forward-looking information, by its nature, requires us to make assumptions and is subject to significant risks and uncertainties which may give rise to the possibility that our expectations or conclusions will not prove to be accurate and that our assumptions may not be correct.</p>
<p class="sizeable">Examples of forward-looking information in this press release include, but are not limited to, the closing of the Offering and the benefits of the Offering, and the expected credit rating of the Debentures, all of which are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. These risks include, but are not limited to: dependence on the economy of Canada; adverse effects on our results caused by global economic conditions (including geopolitical events, interest rate movements, threat of recession) or uncertainties including changes in business cycles that impact our sector; geopolitical and other factors which could cause business interruption); dependence on information technology; vulnerability of our networks and third party service providers to security risks, including cyber-attacks; regulatory constraints; constraints imposed by our level of indebtedness, risks of litigation or other proceedings; currency risk; dependence on third-party suppliers and service providers; adverse effect of a systemic market event on certain of our businesses; the regulatory constraints that apply to the business of TMX Group and its regulated subsidiaries.</p>
<p class="sizeable">Forward-looking information is based on a number of assumptions which may prove to be incorrect, including, but not limited to, business and economic conditions generally; exchange rates (including estimates of exchange rates from Canadian dollars to the U.S. dollar or GBP), commodities prices, the level of trading and activity on markets, and particularly the level of trading in TMX Group's key products; changes to interest rates and the timing thereof; the amount and timing of revenue and technology cost synergies resulting from the AST Canada acquisition; productivity at TMX Group, as well as that of TMX Group's competitors; market competition; research and development activities; the successful introduction and client acceptance of new products and services; successful introduction of various technology assets and capabilities; the impact on TMX Group and its customers of various regulations; TMX Group's ongoing relations with its employees; and the extent of any labour, equipment or other disruptions at any of its operations of any significance other than any planned maintenance or similar shutdowns.</p>
<p class="sizeable">We have attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially from those current expectations described in forward-looking information. However, there may be other factors that cause actions, events or results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended and that could cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially from current expectations. There can be no assurance that forward-looking information will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking information. These factors are not intended to represent a complete list of the factors that could affect us. A description of the above-mentioned items is contained in the section "Enterprise Risk Management" of our 2023 annual MD&amp;A.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday released a summary of the exploratory pilot Climate Scenario Analysis (CSA) exercise that it conducted with six of the nation's largest banks.</p>
<p>The summary describes how these banks are using climate scenario analysis to explore the resiliency of their business models to climate-related financial risks. Participating banks took a wide range of approaches in this exercise to consider the possible implications of different physical and transition risk scenarios. The exercise highlighted data gaps and modeling challenges that arise when estimating the financial impacts of highly complex and uncertain risks over various time horizons.</p>
<p>The banks that participated in the exercise were Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo.</p>
<p>The exercise was exploratory in nature and does not have capital consequences. Drawing on lessons learned from the exercise, the Board will continue to engage with participating banks regarding their capacity to measure and manage climate-related financial risks.</p>

<title>"Adam Smith, The SEC, Data, And the Public Good" Prepared Remarks Before The 11th Annual Conference On Financial Market Regulation, SEC Chair Gary Gensler, Washington D.C., May 9, 2024</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/adam-smith-the-sec-data-and-the-public-good-prepared-remarks-before-the-11t/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/adam-smith-the-sec-data-and-the-public-good-prepared-remarks-before-the-11t/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good afternoon. It&rsquo;s a pleasure to welcome you to the 11th Annual Conference on Financial Market Regulation. As is customary, I&rsquo;d like to note that my views are my own as Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and I am not speaking on behalf of my fellow Commissioners or the staff.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My thanks to the Center for Financial Services at Lehigh University, the Center for Financial Policy at the University of Maryland, and of course the staff of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Economic and Risk Analysis (DERA).</p>
<p>DERA&rsquo;s terrific team of more than 170 economists, statisticians, data scientists, engineers, attorneys, accountants, and other staff are at the heart of everything we do at the SEC.</p>
<p>The Division has a seat at the table for all of the SEC&rsquo;s decision-making, whether it&rsquo;s monitoring markets, enforcement, or policymaking. For all of this work, we depend on data.</p>
<h3>The Nature of Finance</h3>
<p>Since antiquity, finance has been about the pricing and allocation of money and risk throughout the economy. There are those who have money who want to invest it. Others need money to fund good ideas, buy a house, or help get through life&rsquo;s inevitable challenges. There are those who have risk but don&rsquo;t want to bear it, and others willing to take on that risk.</p>
<p>Finance sits in the middle, like the neck of an hourglass whose grains of sand are money and risk.</p>
<p>Finance depends on data.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s with data that investors and issuers on either side of the hourglass participate in markets. It&rsquo;s with data that the intermediaries who sit at the neck of the hourglass help price and allocate money and risk. Intermediaries don&rsquo;t just sit passively passing the sand through the hourglass. They become important market participants themselves. They retain and transform money and risk. They also accumulate significant amounts of data on markets, pricing, and risk.</p>
<p>In finance, there also is a tendency toward concentrated data sets with sometimes dominant influence.</p>
<p>This is the nature of finance.</p>
<h3>Data, a Public Good</h3>
<p>Adam Smith, known as the father of modern economics, noted in The Wealth of Nations more than 200 years ago that the whole economy benefits when the price of information is lowered, or information is free.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;Smith&rsquo;s maxim is relevant every day in our modern capital markets.</p>
<p>Reliable, accessible data benefits everyone. No one private entity, though, has the incentive to create a database with reliable, comparable, and accessible data, even if they themselves may benefit. Thus, data is a public good.</p>
<p>Relying solely on market-based incentives would lead to under-production of the public good of information about securities.</p>
<p>President Franklin Roosevelt and Congress understood this. Setting rules that determine what data is provided to the public is one of the most consequential things we do at the SEC. The basic bargain Roosevelt and Congress laid out 90 years ago was that investors get to decide which risks to take so long as those companies raising money from the public make what Roosevelt called &ldquo;complete and truthful disclosure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roosevelt and Congress set up the SEC in 1934 to oversee the markets&mdash;and the intermediaries at the neck of the hourglass&mdash;to promote fair, orderly, and efficient markets.</p>
<p>While Smith&rsquo;s maxim and the SEC&rsquo;s role in promoting data as a public good is a constant, technology, business models, and risks change. Thus, we have an obligation to continue to refresh rules with regard to data, disclosure, and transparency.</p>
<p>I think of the SEC&rsquo;s roles with regard to promoting data as a public good in at least four areas: issuer disclosure, disclosure by market participants, transparency of markets, and the SEC&rsquo;s role providing to the public economic research as well as aggregate statistics.</p>
<h3>Issuer Disclosure</h3>
<p>First, Congress embedded in our securities laws a role for the SEC to oversee disclosures from public companies and registered investment companies. Further, they recognized from the SEC&rsquo;s beginning the importance of guarding against insider trading where insiders abuse information that hasn&rsquo;t been disclosed.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;Few things undermine trust in the markets more than insiders abusing their positions for personal advantage, such as by trading using material nonpublic information.</p>
<p>The core benefits of a mandatory disclosure-based regime and guarding against insider trading haven&rsquo;t changed in the last nine decades. As I said, though, technology and business models do change. What investors find important to their investment decisions also changes over time.</p>
<p>For instance, under Chair Arthur Levitt, the SEC in 2000 implemented Regulation Fair Disclosure to prevent companies from disclosing material non-public information to only certain individuals and not everyone.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>More recently, the SEC has updated disclosure requirements underlying the basic bargain. These last two years we&rsquo;ve adopted rules providing investors with disclosures on emerging risks like climate<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;and cybersecurity;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;capital raising technologies, like special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs),<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;and an age-old topic&mdash;executive compensation.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p>The public has benefitted from the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval System (EDGAR) in the three decades since the Commission first required mandatory EDGAR filings in 1993. To keep pace with ever-evolving markets, technology, and business models, we&rsquo;ve updated EDGAR over the years. We recently made proposals that would enhance EDGAR&rsquo;s security and further improve filers&rsquo; access to the EDGAR system. We have also worked across our rulemaking agenda to increase the structuring of data filed with the Commission. Further, since 2021, the Commission has made available Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that facilitate public access to financial statements and other disclosures made by publicly traded companies. Studies show that machine-readable disclosures benefit investors, markets, and issuers, for example by decreasing information processing costs, making stock prices more informative,&nbsp;as well as reducing market inefficiencies and risks.</p>
<p>We are now working with other agencies to implement the Financial Data Transparency Act, which seeks to promote interoperability of financial regulatory data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also have an important job in reviewing thousands of company and fund disclosures each year.</p>
<p>The Division of Corporation Finance in FY 2023 reviewed offering documents and periodic reports from among the approximately 7,400 actively reporting issuers, including more than 4,000 companies listed on U.S. exchanges.</p>
<p>The Division of Investment Management in FY 2023 reviewed more than 1,900 filings related to more than 4,400 funds and insurance products as well as annual reports from more than 4,200 funds.</p>
<p>Essential to investors&rsquo; trust in the reliability of public companies&rsquo; financial information is an independent audit of issuers&rsquo; financial statements. Congress understood this when they gave the SEC authority over setting accounting standards for public companies. Congress further understood this when they passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in response to some of the largest accounting frauds and bankruptcies in the history of our country.</p>
<h3>Market Participant Disclosure</h3>
<p>Second, beyond issuer disclosure, the public benefits from data about market participants. Such data enhances price discovery, reduces information asymmetries, and promotes trust in the markets.</p>
<p>Such disclosures include institutional investment managers holdings,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;beneficial ownership reporting,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;and portions of broker-dealer annual audited financial statements.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p>Again, technology, business models, and risks change. To that end, the SEC has updated a number of these market participant disclosure requirement in the last few years. For instance, we recently adopted rule amendments governing beneficial ownership reporting under Sections 13(d) and 13(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;The rules shortened the deadlines by which certain beneficial owners of a company must inform the public of their position.</p>
<p>Further, as mandated by Congress, we adopted last year a rule to broaden the scope of short sale related data available to regulators as well as the investing public.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></p>
<h3>Market Transparency</h3>
<p>Third, the SEC has a role in promoting the transparency of the buying and selling of securities.</p>
<p>Such transparency matters, whether it&rsquo;s prior to the transaction (so-called pre-trade transparency) or after the transaction (so-called post-trade transparency). We see this in our daily lives, whether we&rsquo;re shopping for a car, a security, or a copy of Adam Smith&rsquo;s book. We benefit from knowing what others paid for a product or a security in a transaction that recently occurred.</p>
<p>Post-trade transparency promotes liquidity and helps investors. There is something about that sunshine. It gives everyone a sense of where the current market is. The public gets to see details of the last trade that two counterparties just negotiated in that market.</p>
<p>Last year, we adopted a rule mandated by Dodd-Frank to bring greater transparency and efficiency to the securities lending market.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></p>
<p>We also recently adopted final rules to require that large broker-dealers&mdash;those with more than 100,000 customers&mdash;disclose execution quality to the public.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></p>
<p>In terms of the National Market System, a great deal has changed since we adopted Regulation NMS in 2005. In particular, a large and growing amount of equity trading now occurs in what many call the dark markets, particularly off-exchange market centers such as wholesalers and dark pools.</p>
<p>In addition to proposing a rule to narrow the minimum tick size,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>&nbsp;the proposal would update the more than 120-year-old definition<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>&nbsp; of round lot<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a>&nbsp;by determining the size of round lots by the share price. The proposal also would add quotes on odd-lots to core data. Further, it would bring greater transparency to the access fees charged and related rebates paid by exchanges.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, we also approved a Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) rule change to enhance post-trade transparency in the Treasury markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a>&nbsp;The FINRA rule, for the first time, will provide the public with post-trade transparency in the Treasury markets on a trade-by-trade basis, rather than on an aggregated basis. The scope of what will be published to the public will include a trade&rsquo;s time, price, direction, venue, and volume.</p>
<h3>Economic Research and Aggregate Market Statistics</h3>
<p>Fourth, we have a role in publishing economic research. DERA provides impartial economic analyses that consider the costs and benefits of our rules as well as their effects on efficiency, competition, and capital formation.</p>
<p>We get feedback from the public on these economic analyses, which benefits our rulemaking. Our economic analyses also benefit the markets broadly because, as Smith said, making data available creates a public good. Our economists, from time to time, also publish research that&rsquo;s outside of rulemaking. Taken together, this economic research helps improve market transparency and promotes the public&rsquo;s understanding of markets.</p>
<p>The SEC also has had a history of publishing aggregate data with regard to the securities markets.</p>
<p>Since 2014, we have published quarterly aggregated trading information data, sourced from the Market Information Data Analytics System (MIDAS), as well as monthly money market fund statistics. In 2015, we began publishing quarterly private fund statistics. Since 2022, we have been publishing data on the security-based swaps market twice a year.</p>
<p>In addition, the SEC has made data more accessible and usable. Since 2015, DERA has published data sets aggregated from structured disclosures by individual registrants. Currently, it publishes 12 such data sets.</p>
<p>Such publications by the SEC helps the public better understand how our economy and securities markets function.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recently began publishing a new report, the Registered Fund Statistics report,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a>&nbsp;which aggregates data about the more than $25 trillion registered fund industry. This will give the public a view into the registered fund industry, which includes more than 12,000 mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and closed-end funds.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve asked staff to make recommendations about other areas where we might periodically publish aggregate market statistics.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Adam Smith&rsquo;s nearly 250-year-old notion&mdash;that the whole economy benefits when the price of information is lowered, or information is free&mdash;is as relevant today as it has ever been. The SEC, as mandated by Congress, has an important role to promote data as a public good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m proud to work with all of my colleagues at the SEC, including those of you from DERA, to ensure for the public good of data.</p>
