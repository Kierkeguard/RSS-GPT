<div> Proposed International Ethics Standards for Sustainability Assurance, IOSCO, IESBA, sustainability information, transparency<br>
Summary:<br>
IOSCO congratulates IESBA on publishing Proposed International Ethics Standards for Sustainability Assurance. They aim for global consistency in sustainability-related disclosures. Ethical standards are a prerequisite for credible statements. <div>
<p>IOSCO today congratulated the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA) on achieving an important milestone by publishing for consultation their Proposed International Ethics Standards for Sustainability Assurance (IESSA) and Other Revisions to the Code Relating to Sustainability Assurance and Reporting (the Paper).</p>
<p>IOSCO also acknowledged IESBA&rsquo;s extensive outreach program conducted during the exposure draft development and during the consultation period.</p>
<p>Based on its review of the Paper and additional stakeholder engagement,&nbsp;<a href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iosco.org%2Flibrary%2Fpubdocs%2Fpdf%2FIOSCOPD765.pdf&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cmailing-lists%40iosco.org%7C82fca3c85d044d4bf65108dc70f6dfe0%7Cbcc6c66cdb3b48328af2cc363a097444%7C0%7C0%7C638509452839571606%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=wN8au3Q3jNz%2Bukh%2BNXgvE9tYEdNoYs6MWrJX%2BIfpKvQ%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank">IOSCO outlined its general observations and its six key priority areas for IESBA&rsquo;s consideration in developing its final standard</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Definition of sustainability information</li>
<li>Scope of International Independence Standards</li>
<li>Non-compliance with laws and regulations</li>
<li>Group Sustainability Assurance engagements</li>
<li>Value Chain</li>
<li>Transparency when reporting on PIEs</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Jean-Paul Servais, Chair of the Board of IOSCO</strong>, commented: &ldquo;I congratulate the IESBA Chair, the IESBA Board, and wider staff for this achievement, and for their excellent cooperation with the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) throughout. IESBA&rsquo;s work towards the development of profession-agnostic ethics and independence standards, combined with standards under development by the IAASB, means we are well placed to deliver a global assurance framework at the start of 2025, in accordance with IOSCO&rsquo;s preferred timetable.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Rodrigo Buenaventura, Chair of the Sustainable Finance Task Force said</strong>: &ldquo;When IOSCO endorsed the inaugural sustainability disclosure standards of the ISSB, we were very clear that having assurance (including ethical) standards in place was a prerequisite for achieving consistently prepared and independently assured sustainability disclosures by issuers of securities across the globe. Only through independent assurance will we have credible statements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>IOSCO will continue to play a key role in promoting global consistency in the assurance of sustainability-related disclosures by market issuers and support its members and other stakeholders as they work to enhance trust in corporate sustainability-related reporting.</p>

Summary: Taheer Sardar sentenced to 18 months for perverting course of justice with forged document in FCA's investigation of fraud. <div>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>Taheer Sardar has today been sentenced to 18 months&rsquo; imprisonment for perverting the course of justice at Southwark Crown Court. Mr Sardar pleaded guilty on 7 May 2024.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>Mr Sardar was interviewed by the FCA as part of an investigation it was conducting into a sophisticated boiler room scam that had defrauded 120 investors of &pound;1.3m. Three individuals, Mr Mirza, Mr Solaja and Mr Vickers were subsequently convicted and sentenced to 23 years for that fraud following prosecution by the FCA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In his interview, Mr Sardar, acting with Mr Mirza, provided a forged document, which he claimed had been signed by 'Mohammed Khan'. Mr Sardar sought to use the document to bolster a defence raised by Raheel Mirza and Opeyemi Solaja, who had claimed &ndash; without evidence &ndash; that someone named 'Mohammed Khan' was the architect of the fraud they had been involved in.</p>
<p>The FCA did not find that Mr Sardar was involved in the fraud itself, but he provided the document in order to mislead the FCA. &nbsp;</p>
<p><span>At Mr Sardar&rsquo;s sentencing on 10 May 2024, the Judge, Mr Recorder Gavaghan, remarked that</span>:</p>
<p>'This was a sophisticated attempt using a forged document to undermine the course of justice&hellip;[it was] a very serious offence that strikes at the very core of the legal system.'&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Steve Smart, joint Executive Director, Enforcement and Market Oversight at the FCA, said</span>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>'Mr Sardar&rsquo;s conviction and sentence, is a strong warning to anyone who may be tempted to try to help others escape justice- there is no stone we will leave unturned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>'Perverting the course of justice is a serious offence, and the FCA will not hesitate to take action when it identifies this has taken place.'</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<ol>
<li>Taheer Sardar is from East London, date of birth 16 June 1978.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Raheel Mirza was convicted of conspiracy to defraud and perverting the course of justice on 3 April 2023. He received an 18 month consecutive sentence for the perverting the course of justice offence (consecutive with the 8 years sentence for fraud).&nbsp;</li>
<li>The facts concerning the conviction of Raheel Mirza on 3 April 2023 for perverting the course of justice were subject to reporting restrictions until the conclusion of the trial of Taheer Sardar. Perverting the course of justice is a serious criminal offence with a maximum sentence up to life imprisonment.&nbsp;</li>

<div> Financial stability, bank supervision, regulation, monetary policy, risk monitoring <br>
Summary: Financial stability is promoted through effective bank supervision, calibrated regulation to mitigate risks, and considering unintended consequences. Monetary policy impacts must also be addressed. <div>
<p>I would like to thank the Texas Bankers Association for the invitation to share my thoughts with you at this year's Annual Meeting.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240510a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;My remarks today focus on financial stability and the role of banking regulators in promoting financial stability and resiliency in the financial system.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240510a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;I will also describe principles that are complementary to promoting safety and soundness&mdash;to help inform the regulatory and supervisory agenda.</p>
<p>Of course, it would be difficult to provide an exhaustive list of the financial stability risks facing the financial system in the time we are together today. So, while I will highlight a few key risks, one must approach this topic with humility, acknowledging that there are limits to a regulator's ability to anticipate every possible financial stability risk in a dynamic and increasingly interconnected world.</p>
<p>Financial stability is an important function of the Federal Reserve. Our financial stability function is supported through appropriate monetary policy, bank supervision and regulation, and by monitoring risks in the U.S. and abroad. A stable financial system provides a solid foundation for a healthy banking system and a growing economy that facilitates maximum employment and stable prices. The Fed's recently published&nbsp;<em>Financial Stability Report</em>&nbsp;discusses financial stability risks in terms of interactions between shocks and vulnerabilities. A financial stability shock is an adverse event or series of events that often occur without warning and severely affect the financial system. A financial stability vulnerability includes a specific characteristic of, or activity conducted in, the financial system that can increase the severity of a stress event when a shock occurs.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240510a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;Since shocks are difficult to predict, the Federal Reserve's monitoring efforts primarily focus on vulnerabilities and the buildup of risks that can accrue over time potentially affecting the resiliency of the financial system.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<em>Financial Stability Report</em>&nbsp;is worth a read. And while I will not recite the many findings of that report today, I will highlight a few of the risks discussed in the report. It is important to keep in mind that the report provides only a snapshot of the current financial stability vulnerabilities and risks. Because the report treats cyberattacks and geopolitical events as shocks, it touches on them only in a cursory way, even though these are important financial stability risks. Instead, the report focuses on key vulnerabilities that are more easily monitored and provides insights into the financial stability outlook as it relates to these factors.</p>
<p>While the framing of the&nbsp;<em>Financial Stability Report</em>&mdash;in terms of shocks and vulnerabilities&mdash;can be a useful, structured approach to consider this topic, there are many ways to think about financial stability. Often the boundary between shocks and vulnerabilities is a permeable one, and the buildup of risk can become so severe that it becomes a shock. The Federal Reserve plays an important&mdash;but limited and non-exclusive&mdash;role in proactively addressing financial stability risks and responding to them once they manifest as stress across the system.</p>
<p>As I think about the tools we use to address financial stability concerns&mdash;and the tradeoffs we are often forced to make when exercising these powers&mdash;it is helpful to consider the lessons regulators have learned over time. While the end goal is the same&mdash;ensuring resiliency in the financial system to promote financial stability&mdash;there are a number of tools that can be used to address the unique characteristics of vulnerabilities and shocks.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve's financial stability monitoring does not operate in a vacuum. To the contrary, our other statutory authorities&mdash;including monetary policy or promoting safety and soundness in the banking system&mdash;can complement or conflict with the goal of promoting financial stability. Many of these authorities interact with banking activities and institutions that are subject to our supervisory or regulatory authority.</p>
<p>In light of this, I will begin by discussing how the use of traditional tools to support safety and soundness&mdash;both regulation and supervision&mdash;can help promote financial stability. I will then describe the limits of these tools, and then conclude with a brief discussion of some other key financial stability risks.</p>
<p><strong>Financial Stability and the Role of Regulators</strong><br />The Federal Reserve plays an important but limited role in promoting the stability of the financial system through resiliency to shocks, and by proactively addressing vulnerabilities. This responsibility can be complemented and supported, or in some cases weakened through the execution of the Federal Reserve's other responsibilities, including monetary policy or the exercise of our emergency authorities. At times, these objectives may appear to present tension or be in conflict.</p>
<p>For example, the banking stress last year resulted from a number of underlying causes. But it is clear that trends in the interest rate environment when the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) was rapidly tightening policy to combat inflation were an important factor that contributed to Silicon Valley Bank's (SVB's) failure. The Federal Reserve's documented supervisory shortcomings and the lack of SVB management attention to these risks were also key contributors to the firm's failure.</p>
<p>To be sure, the role of monetary policy in the demise of SVB does not excuse SVB's management from its inability to manage the firm's interest rate risk exposures or excuse the ineffective supervisory response that enabled the buildup of the firm's excessive risk. And I am not calling into question the FOMC's monetary policy decisions from that time, which were appropriately focused on our congressionally established mandates of maximum employment and stable prices. Instead, these issues highlight the challenging interrelationships of the various roles and functions of the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>This becomes more complicated when we consider the Federal Reserve's financial stability objectives in the context of its prudential mandates to promote the safe and sound operation of regulated financial institutions. The tools of bank regulation and supervision can promote the safety and soundness of individual financial institutions, but they can also be a positive force when it comes to financial stability. When regulators are successful in their task of ensuring the safe and sound operation of the banking system&mdash;one of the core mandates for banking regulators&mdash;often there is a corresponding benefit to financial stability. Put another way, if the individual parts of the banking system are healthy, this often promotes the health and stability of the broader financial system.</p>
<p>But the goal of promoting bank safety and soundness is narrowly focused within the regulatory perimeter&mdash;and the institutions and activities within our regulatory and supervisory authority. By contrast, financial stability must be concerned with the broader financial system, including the multitude of nonbank institutions that play an important role not only in delivering financial products and services, but also in the broader U.S. economy.</p>
<p>So today, I'd like to share three principles that can help frame a discussion of the role of banking regulators in promoting financial stability:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bank supervision can be an effective and efficient tool to promote financial stability. It is important that supervisors focus on core banking risks.</li>
<li>Where bank regulation may create or exacerbate financial stability risks, we need to take a hard look at whether those risks are justified by the safety-and-soundness benefits of the regulation.</li>
<li>As we evaluate the merits of bank regulation and supervision, we must consider how the Federal Reserve's regulatory proposals affect markets and institutions beyond the bank regulatory perimeter. This will enable us to better understand the potential unintended consequences.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is value in our current approach to addressing financial stability risks. We monitor risks and how they build up or manifest as stress in the financial system. And we react in a way that is informed by that monitoring, either to proactively address the buildup of risk, or to address the consequences of events that could threaten financial stability. A review of past events that presented stability concerns can help us evaluate our existing work and inform the direction of future investments.</p>
<p><strong>Effective Bank Supervision to Promote Financial Stability</strong><br />First, bank supervision can be an effective and efficient tool to promote financial stability. I think it is helpful to consider commercial real estate (CRE) as an example.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240510a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;Commercial real estate continues to be an area of focus for both banks and regulators. Some banks have experienced an increase in CRE loan delinquencies, although delinquency rates generally remain low. As we know, one of the factors that has led to CRE stress in certain property types, like office, is the post-pandemic changes in the demand for, and use of, these CRE properties. Should this trend continue, we could see declines in property values, reduced rental income cash flows, or other conditions that could lead to impairment of some banks' CRE loans or portfolios, especially if those loans mature and are refinanced at higher interest rates. I expect we will continue to see material differences in the performance of CRE across the various types of commercial property and in specific geographic regions. This will be due, in part, to variations in regional return-to-office patterns, and the shifting demand for different types of CRE properties.</p>
<p>So, what can we learn from this CRE experience? First, supervision can be an effective tool to mitigate vulnerabilities, like the increasing credit risk associated with certain kinds of lending. Underwriting standards and loan-to-value ratios have improved significantly since the 2008&ndash;09 financial crisis, and more recently we have seen credit conditions for CRE lending tighten, even as loan demand weakened. I see this as reflecting both better management of these loans and portfolios, and more proactive supervision of material risk.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240510a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;Banks are also well-equipped to work with their CRE borrowers to mitigate stress, including through loan accommodations and workouts.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240510a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;Supervision can be particularly effective at addressing well-known, core banking risks, especially when this supervisory work is conducted effectively and without being distracted by non-core risks.</p>
<p>Despite the promise of supervision as a tool to promote financial stability, supervision can sometimes fail to address the significant buildup of traditional risk. And supervision can be susceptible to being diverted from core risks to issues of less material concern. For example, take the dynamics that led to the failure of SVB. The buildup of interest rate risk in the banking system was a known vulnerability and material risk, not just for SVB, but for all financial institutions. The responsibility for managing this risk fell on the management team at SVB, just as it falls on every bank that has material exposure to interest rate risk. And yet, the failure of SVB created something of a "shock" event within the banking system, one that led to a vigorous response with the creation of the Bank Term Funding Program and invoking the systemic risk exemption to guarantee all depositors of SVB and Signature Bank.</p>
<p>I think it is an oversimplification to point to any one factor as the root cause of the failure of SVB. There were a number of issues that contributed to the firm's ultimate failure. These events included rapid growth, poor risk management, poor public communication, a lack of supervisory attention to core risks, and an insufficiently robust supervisory response to the buildup of interest rate and funding risk. These issues were exacerbated by operational and technological problems with FedWire and discount window lending. The cumulative effect of these issues likely accelerated the firm's failure and increased the scope of the resulting financial harm. But certainly, this is a clear example of where the Federal Reserve's proactive tools&mdash;supervision of risk management, and the operation of liquidity support and payment tools&mdash;could have been much more effective.</p>
<p>Therefore, the virtue of supervision as a proactive measure to support financial stability comes with a cautionary note. Ineffective supervision itself can compound financial stability risks by allowing the buildup of risk without commensurate risk-management measures or supervisory attention. One protective measure that we can take to support effective supervision is to ensure that focus on traditional risks is not lost or diluted. One example of a supervisory and regulatory distraction is from the Fed's recent focus on climate risk. Recently, the Federal Reserve conducted a pilot climate scenario exercise with a subset of the largest U.S. global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) and issued guidance to large institutions on managing climate-related financial risk. This regulatory attention and focus on one specific, non-core risk could reasonably call into question whether regulatory priorities are focused sufficiently on key risks. Firms are already required to manage all material risks, and prioritizing climate risk in this way could lead to the misallocation of risk-management resources.</p>
<p><strong>Regulatory Approaches to Promote Financial Stability</strong><br />Second, where regulation may create or exacerbate financial stability risks, we need to take a close look at whether those risks are justified by the safety and soundness benefits of the regulation.</p>
<p>For example, consider the threat to financial stability resulting from market illiquidity. Liquidity is essential to effective market functioning, and liquidity in the U.S. Treasury market is particularly important due to its critical role in the U.S. and global financial systems.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240510a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;This is an area that, in relative terms, has recently experienced stress events as in the September 2019 repo market stress, and the so-called "dash for cash" in March of 2020. These events raised concerns about the resiliency of U.S. Treasury markets. Even today, some indicators signal low market liquidity through market depth in U.S. Treasury cash markets, which have been at levels below historical norms.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240510a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a></p>
<p>Banks play an important role in providing liquidity, and there are clear signs that liquidity in Treasury markets is low.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240510a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;While there may be a number of reasons for reduced Treasury market liquidity, I would note two specific factors and ongoing risks: (1) concerns by banks about balance sheet capacity to engage in low-margin market activities, and (2) the cumulative regulatory burden on banks when they engage in market-making activities, which includes most recently the proposed increase in capital costs for market making activity proposed by the Basel III endgame rulemaking, and an apparent lack of interest in addressing the constraints on bank activities caused by bank leverage ratios. Ultimately, liquidity in the U.S. Treasury market has the potential to amplify or dampen shocks to the financial system.</p>
<p>Where we can take proactive regulatory measures to ensure that primary dealers have adequate balance sheet capacity to intermediate Treasury markets in times of stress, we should do so. This could include amending the leverage ratio and G-SIB surcharge for the largest U.S. banks. And where we can take into consideration the impact of regulatory reforms on financial stability, we must at least acknowledge the tradeoffs and the potential downside risks that regulatory changes could create. This is particularly important when considering significant increases to capital requirements, especially those of the scale contemplated by the Basel III proposal, including the market risk capital increases.</p>
<p>Adopting regulatory changes to mitigate these concerns may not be sufficient to promote market liquidity, but it would be an important step toward building resiliency in advance of future stress events. In my view, it would be better to fix the roof now, while the sun is shining, by addressing over-calibrated leverage ratio requirements and moderating capital increases for the Basel III proposal.</p>
<p><strong>Unintended Consequences of Overregulation and Disproportionate Supervision</strong><br />Finally, as we evaluate the merit of regulations and supervisory approaches, we must understand the broader implications beyond the regulatory perimeter. We have seen a migration of activity out of the regulated banking sector to a variety of alternative service providers and nonbank financial institutions and intermediaries. As the&nbsp;<em>Financial Stability Report</em>&nbsp;notes, hedge fund leverage reached 18 to 1 in the third quarter of 2023 for "average on-balance sheet leverage of the top 15 hedge funds by gross asset value."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240510a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a>&nbsp;Throughout 2023, bank&nbsp;<em>lending&nbsp;</em>to nonbank financial institutions&mdash;a category that includes hedge funds&mdash;also increased.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240510a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a>&nbsp;While this increase was accompanied by continued declines in delinquency rates for bank lending to nonbank financial institutions, I think it is worth considering how this activity could ultimately bleed back into the regulated banking system.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240510a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a></p>
<p>We should also consider structural shifts that have potential implications for financial stability. In shaping the bank regulatory framework, we must acknowledge that regulation and supervision already influence the location of activity and will continue to do so.</p>
<p>We also know that the cost of bank regulation, including bank capital requirements, influences&nbsp;<em>where</em>&nbsp;activities occur, either within the banking system or in nonbank entities outside of the regulatory perimeter. Absent other factors, over time the cost difference of providing a service between a bank and nonbank provider will lead activity to migrate to the lowest cost provider. Just as with the residential mortgage market, these shifts have real consequences for where activity occurs.</p>
<p>Therefore, the threshold question we need to ask is whether regulation and supervision are appropriately calibrated to risk over time. Ultimately, even if regulation and supervision are rigorous&mdash;imposing higher standards on banks than on nonbanks&mdash;this does not necessarily mean that the standards applied to banks are not appropriate. It may be that activity conducted by nonbanks lacks appropriate supervision and regulation.</p>
<p>Imposing the same level and type of regulation and oversight on activity that occurs outside of the banking system is beyond the scope of bank regulatory authority. However, we must be careful not to facilitate the transfer of activity and risk out of the banking system simply by imposing standards that are disproportionate to risk for the same activities that are conducted by banks. The same activity presenting the same risk should receive the same regulation. Same activity, same risk, same regulation.</p>
<p>Striking the right balance and calibration for the regulation of specific activities is not always a simple task, nor is the establishment of expectations that accompanies regulation and supervision always subject to scientific precision. That being said, one does not need to look any further than the proposed Basel III endgame capital rules to find reforms that are excessively calibrated and disproportionate to risk. This proposal contemplated a 20 percent increase in risk-weighted assets across bank holding companies subject to the rule. Public commenters raised significant concerns that the limited analysis included with the Basel III proposal may have significantly understated the scope of the capital increase. In response to this concern, the Board launched a data collection to gather more information from banks to better understand the impacts of the proposal, the results of which will hopefully be released soon.</p>
<p>As I have discussed in the past, if implemented as proposed, the effects are predictable: higher costs of capital for banks, higher costs of services for customers, less availability and narrower selection of services, and increased concentration in the providers of financial products and services.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240510a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a>&nbsp;Driving risk out of the regulated banking system could lead to marginal improvements in bank safety and soundness, but the consequences for financial stability could be severely adverse. As I noted above, we have already seen reduced market activity driven by the leverage ratio and other regulatory constraints on bank balance sheets. We have also seen banks tighten credit standards and reduce lending activity, which often leads to a credit "gap" left to be filled by nonbank lenders. As activity and risk migrates from the banking system to nonbanks, we should ask how these shifts will impact financial stability over the long run, even though we have less visibility and insight once they leave the banking system.</p>
<p>The Basel III capital rules are only a subset of regulatory proposals for change that involve the challenging task of achieving the right calibration to risk over time. A glut of new bank regulatory reforms and supervisory guidance raise this concern, including revisions to the G-SIB surcharge, new long-term debt requirements, amended resolution plan guidance, contemplated changes to the regulatory approval of merger and acquisition activity, and revisions to the interchange fee cap. The cumulative effects of these regulatory proposals are significant.</p>
<p>This cautionary note does not mean that I am opposed to appropriate reforms to bank regulation and supervision&mdash;both tools must adapt to changing conditions and risks. Last year we saw significant stress in the banking system due to a few bank failures and the persistence of higher inflation and interest rates in the U.S. and in many other countries around the world. But we should not assume that "more" is always better. More regulation and more supervision are only effective if the changes are targeted to address an existing problem and are appropriately focused and efficient.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240510a.htm#fn14" title="footnote 14"><span>14</span></a><a name="f14"></a>&nbsp;When they are targeted and efficient, they may result in a net positive both in bank safety and soundness, and in financial stability. The function of bank regulators is not to create a bank regulatory framework that eliminates risk. Banking is inherently about managing, not eliminating, risk.</p>
<p><strong>Closing</strong><br />My remarks today are not meant to be an exhaustive list of all the financial stability threats facing the U.S. banking system, but I would be remiss in concluding without briefly mentioning a few other key financial stability risks, all of which I expect are familiar to you.</p>
<p>First, monetary policy and the fight against inflation. This is a key risk identified in the&nbsp;<em>Financial Stability Report</em>, and in surveys of bankers. When effectively implemented, monetary policy promotes price stability and maximum employment. In the long run, achieving both of these objectives promotes the stability of the broader financial system. It is of utmost importance that we maintain credibility in pursuing our fight against inflation by proceeding carefully and deliberately to achieve our 2 percent goal.</p>
<p>But we cannot ignore the fact that monetary policy can present risks to the banking system and the broader financial system. Changes in interest rates can make it more difficult for banks to manage interest rate risk, particularly in the face of rapid rate increases like those from 2022 and 2023. We know that many banks have seen a significant increase in unrealized losses on their balance sheets, a trend that has led to pressure on liquidity, funding, and capital for some institutions.</p>
<p>While monetary policy mandates may support long-term financial stability, monetary policy is an independent function that may heighten short-term stresses in the banking system. Our supervisory activities should reflect an awareness of these effects on bank management decisionmaking as we rely on regulation and supervision to promote resilience in the regulated banking system, with the goal of helping banks as they navigate an evolving macroeconomic environment and adjust to major shifts in the stance of monetary policy.</p>
<p>Today's banking system has also been heavily shaped by the effects of COVID-related stimulus on deposit activity. Many banks saw a significant inflow of deposits as a direct result of COVID-related stimulus with excess savings accumulating due to lockdowns. This trend created challenges for banks, who may have lacked sufficient opportunities to invest or extend credit in a world affected by COVID lockdowns. The rapid increase in deposits in the banking system, and their subsequent drawdown, have pressure tested banks' abilities to manage funding and interest rate risks, and posed significant challenges for banks faced with few opportunities to put funding to productive use.</p>
<p>While there are important pockets of financial stability risk where the Federal Reserve lacks authority, there are meaningful improvements that can be made to our regulatory and supervisory approach that could enhance financial stability. Bank regulation and supervision can best accomplish their goals when guided by transparency, fairness, and efficiency. We must remember that there are always consequences to financial stability from miscalibrated regulatory and supervisory actions and the cumulative effects of regulatory proposals.</p>
<p>I hope my discussion today has helped to highlight the role of financial regulators in promoting financial stability, through (1) applying supervision to mitigate and promote resilience to financial system vulnerabilities, (2) adopting bank regulatory approaches that further financial stability goals, and (3) taking into account the unintended consequences and tradeoffs of overregulation and disproportionate supervision&mdash;particularly as they may result in negative consequences.</p>
<p>Of course, while these principles are helpful guides to how regulators can best promote financial stability, they are also insufficient. We must be thoughtful about the limits of regulatory authorities&mdash;and abide by those limits, even in the face of significant stress. The Federal Reserve and the bank regulatory framework do not hold the solution to every financial stability problem, and we must have confidence that other regulators, and other branches of government, will take appropriate steps to preserve financial stability when needed.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time today, and I look forward to our discussion.</p>

<div> initiative, financial literacy, investment, teachers, educational institutions
Summary:<br />SET's "INVESTORY Investment Learning Design Bootcamp" promotes financial literacy through teacher training and classroom activities, reaching 11,422 students in 66 institutions nationwide. <div>
<p>The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) is committed to promoting financial literacy among Thai youth. The recent educational initiative so called &nbsp;&ldquo;INVESTORY Investment Learning Design Bootcamp&rdquo; has been organized for two &nbsp;consecutive years. The initiative provides knowledge and skills for secondary school teachers to design active learning models on personal finance and investment knowledge for their students. SET aims to further develop an investment curriculum for secondary school students in national education. To date, there are learning facilitators of this initiative in 66 educational institutions nationwide.</p>
<p><b>SET President Pakorn Peetathawatchai </b>said that SET has continuously promoted financial literacy to the Thai people for over two decades, especially among youths. SET recognized that financial knowledge would lead to good money management skills that youths were able to apply in their daily lives and that teachers played a part in cultivating and transferring such knowledge, thanks to their rapport with deep understanding of their students. SET has therefore provided a learning space for teachers to apply knowledge gained from SET and design suitable investment learning activities to be used in schools with different environment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The INVESTORY Investment Learning Design Bootcamp initiative focuses on supporting and preparing secondary school teachers as the students from Grade 7- Grade 12 are interested in learning how to start investing. Laying the foundation from the very beginning is crucial. SET serves as a teacher's coach, providing knowledge, tools, and materials to enable teachers to become learning facilitators. The teachers, in turn, create an active learning process and tailor the teaching materials suitable for the context of each classroom to meet the needs of their students. Until now, this initiative has created investment-learning facilitators in 66 educational institutions across 24 provinces nationwide, reaching a total of 11,422 students. There are currently 19 investment classroom models. SET will continue to develop investment toolkits for teachers to use more easily and conveniently. With this unique opportunity, we are certain that the investment knowledge will be introduced into the Thai education system more broadly," added Pakorn.</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s &ldquo;Show &amp; Share&rdquo; event of INVESTORY Investment Learning Design Bootcamp initiative provides a platform for the teachers to showcase the activities and teaching processes that have been developed and successfully tested in their classrooms to other teachers and the general public. In addition, three investment-learning facilitators from two schools also share their experiences of creating successful investment classrooms.</p>
<p><b>A teacher at Chulalongkorn University Demonstration Secondary School, and the creator of "Classroom for Wealth&rdquo; Kamonchanok Sakondhawat</b> said that participating in the first batch of this initiative has given her a clearer understanding on previously misunderstood investment issues and more confidence to teach investment. In addition, she has learned a lot more by networking and exchanging ideas with teams from SET, BlackBox, and teachers from other schools. The teams from SET and BlackBox have provided advice and assistance continuously. Even after completing the first batch of training, there have also been a lot of opportunities to join and update knowledge with learning facilitators in other batches, emphasizing that the training ended but the spirit of the Bootcamp group would continue.</p>
<p><b>A teacher at Ban Maengonkilek School Chiang Mai Provincial Administrative Organization and a co-creator of "Lights in Highlands"</b> <b>Rattanachat Sarapo </b>said that personal finance and investment knowledge were challenging not only for students, but also for teachers. He has been in a process of trial and error himself to manage his money more appropriately. He believed it would be better for students and teachers to learn together in the classroom in order to change their lives and future using the knowledge from SET.</p>
<p><b>Another teacher at Ban Maengonkilek School Chiang Mai Provincial Administrative Organization and a co-creator of "Lights in Highlands"</b> <b>Chalermkwan Wongphanit</b> said that for her this initiative was like a sincere friend in designing investment classrooms for students. Knowledge, teaching ideas, and physical as well as mental support from the Bootcamp group brought personal finance and investment knowledge closer to students. Moreover, teachers&rsquo; attitude towards spending money has been changed after participating in this initiative.</p>

<div> charged, unlicensed, fund management, trial, offences
<br />
Pixelvest and Infinity Trustee Berhad (ITB) charged for unlicensed fund management. Individuals claimed trial for related offences. SC encourages caution.
<br /><br />Summary: Pixelvest and ITB charged for unlicensed fund management. Individuals claimed trial for related offences. SC advises caution. <div>
<p>The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) had charged two companies and one individual in the Kuala Lumpur Sessions Court with three offences relating to unlicensed capital market activities.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Pixelvest Sdn Bhd (Pixelvest) was charged today with one count under section 58(1) of the Capital Markets and Services Act 2007 (CMSA) for carrying on a fund management business without a licence. Pixelvest, represented by its director Ang Jen Chuen (Dexter Ang), claimed trial to the charge before Sessions Court judge Puan Norina binti Zainol Abidin.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This follows the charges filed by the SC against Infinity Trustee Berhad (ITB) on 30 April 2024, with two counts under section 58(1) read together with section 370(b) of the CMSA.&nbsp; &nbsp;The offence is in relation to ITB transferring funds amounting to RM116,292,904.15 to Pixelvest through two accounts in furtherance of the offence committed by Pixelvest.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>ITB company representative, Tan Boon Hoong, had claimed trial to both charges before Sessions Court judge Datin Fadzlin Suraya Mohd Suah.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Separately, former ITB director Chin Wai Lan (Sophia Chin) was also charged today with one count under section 58(1) read together with sections 370(b) and 367(1) of the CMSA.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The charge against Sophia Chin is in relation to ITB&rsquo;s act of transferring funds amounting to RM859,750.00 from ITB&rsquo;s account to Pixelvest in furtherance of Pixelvest&rsquo;s offence under section 58(1) of the CMSA. Sophia Chin was deemed to have committed the offence by virtue of her position as director of ITB at the material time.</p>
<p>Sophia Chin claimed trial to the charge before Sessions Court judge Tuan Azrul Darus. No bail sum was imposed by the judge in view of Sophia Chin&rsquo;s existing bail conditions in her other ongoing case before the Court.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The offences committed by Pixelvest and Sophia Chin took place in Petaling Jaya, Selangor between December 2020 and October 2022.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Fund management is a regulated activity that requires a licence by the SC under Schedule 2 of the CMSA. Any person carrying on this activity without a licence commits an offence under the CMSA which is punishable with a maximum fine of RM10 million or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years, or both.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The charges follow the SC&rsquo;s charging of Sophia Chin, Dexter Ang and Syaiful Riezal Ahmad, ITB&rsquo;s former Chief Executive Officer for related offences under section 58(1) of the CMSA and section 4(1)(b) of the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act 2001 (AMLATFPUAA).&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The SC views unlicensed activities seriously and remains committed in investor protection by continuous enforcement actions against those who contravene the law. When evaluating investment offers, investors are advised by the SC to exercise caution.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The public is encouraged to use the <a href="https://www.sc.com.my/investment-checker">SC Investment Checker</a><a href="https://www.sc.com.my/investment-checker">,</a> a one-stop portal available on the SC&rsquo;s website, to verify if an individual and/or entity is authorised by the SC to offer, promote, or sell any capital market products and services in Malaysia.</p>

Compliance with the guidelines is expected by 2025. The forum aims to enhance understanding and find effective solutions to strengthen resilience. The SC is proactive in preparing the industry for potential cyber threats through the Capital Market Cyber Simulation.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p align="left"><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Key Highlights:</span></b></p>
<p>In his welcoming remarks, SC Chairman, Dato&rsquo; Seri Dr. Awang Adek Hussin, stressed on the need for effective leadership to navigate the complexities of technological advancements.

<p>Here are highlights from his welcoming remarks:</p>
<ol>
<li>The SC's commitment to driving fintech development through upcoming initiatives like the Innopolicy Roundtables, Pitch and Match sessions, and the SCxSC Fintech Summit underscores the importance of collaboration between regulators and industry stakeholders in addressing emerging challenges.&nbsp; </li>
<li>Cyber hygiene practices are fundamental to an organisation&rsquo;s ability to defend itself from cyber-attack, ransomware, and even data loss events. </li>
<li>It is important to ensure a comprehensive technology risk management framework is in place for leaders of organisations.&nbsp; </li>
<li>The SC is preparing the industry to face challenges that may arise through intiatives such as the Guidelines on Technology Risk Management (GTRM) and the Capital Market Cyber Simulation (CMCS).&nbsp; </li>
<li>Guidelines on Technology Risk Management will take effect on 1 August 2024.&nbsp; </li>
<li>Entities are expected to submit a declaration of compliance to the GTRM to the SC by the first quarter of 2025. </li>
</ol>
<p align="left"><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Full Speech:</span> </b></p>
<p>Tuan-Tuan dan Puan-Puan Yang Dihormati Sekalian</p>
<p>Assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh, salam sejahtera dan selamat pagi.</p>
<ol>
<li>Welcome to today&rsquo;s SCxSC: C-Suite Forum on Managing Technology and Cyber Risks. </li>
<li>First and foremost, I wish to express my sincere apologies for not being able to join you in person this morning. </li>
<li>Despite my physical absence, I am truly honoured to address such an esteemed gathering and would like to express my heartfelt appreciation for your participation.&nbsp; </li>
<li>Your presence here this morning represents your strong commitment to managing the technology and cyber risks within the Malaysian capital market.&nbsp; </li>
<li>As such, I eagerly anticipate the invaluable insights and discussions that will unfold today.&nbsp; </li>
</ol>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>The pace of technological advancement, both globally and locally is unprecedented. Cloud computing, big data, blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) offer opportunities to redefine our market and optimise operations like never before. </li>
<li>Additionally, we have observed a growing reliance on third-party service providers, particularly in areas like Cloud Services and artificial intelligence, among others. </li>
<li>But with every advancement, there are inherent risks &ndash; from cybersecurity vulnerabilities to regulatory compliance concerns. </li>
<li>We need effective leadership to navigate the complexities of technological advancements.&nbsp; </li>
<li>Effective leadership sets the tone on technology governance and cybersecurity culture. This would also bridge conversations between business, IT, and security functions and ensure organisational alignment and adaptability. </li>
<li>Today&rsquo;s forum holds special significance. Against the backdrop of ever-evolving landscape of technology and cyber risks, it is crucial for us to come together to enhance our understanding and find effective solutions that can strengthen our resilience. </li>
<li><b>The SC&rsquo;s commitment to driving fintech development through upcoming initiatives like the Innopolicy Roundtables, Pitch and Match sessions, and the SCxSC Fintech Summit</b> underscores the importance of collaboration between regulators and industry stakeholders in addressing emerging challenges.&nbsp; </li>
<li>Similarly, this event aims to keep the industry abreast with the latest technology trends and shed light on prevalent industry technology audit findings and incidents that may impact business operations. The SC would also like to align leadership role expectations, reinforcing what is expected of the top brass regarding managing technology risk. </li>
<li>I have been informed that many industry players still fall short in their cyber hygiene practices even in terms of basic controls to critical systems. This is highly concerning because such basic hygiene is fundamental to an organisation&rsquo;s ability to defend itself and our analysis suggests that inadequacies lead to cyber-attacks, ransomware, and even data loss.&nbsp; </li>
<li>Many organisations also are not keeping up with key security practices like penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, hardening practice, privileged access management and regular review on user ID, to name a few. This is alarming especially with cyber incidents, such as ransomware and data breaches becoming more common. </li>
<li>In today&rsquo;s business landscape, use of third-party services such as cloud services is increasingly predominant. We find that organisations can do better in managing risks related to third-party service providers by putting proper frameworks in place. </li>
<li><b>For leaders of organisations such as yourselves, it is important to ensure a comprehensive technology risk management framework is in place.</b> This guides organisations to identify key risks and put the right controls in place. </li>
<li>Through initiatives like the <b>Guidelines on Technology Risk Management (GTRM)</b> and the <b>Capital Market Cyber Simulation (CMCS)</b>, we are preparing the industry to face any challenges that arise.&nbsp; </li>
<li><b>Please note that the Guidelines on Technology Risk Management will take effect on 1 August 2024.</b> It is designed to guide the market participants to establish a sound and robust technology risk governance and oversight. </li>
<li>In addition to that, <b>entities are expected to submit a declaration of compliance to the GTRM to the SC by quarter 1, 2025</b>. More information regarding this will follow closer to the Guidelines taking effect. </li>
<li>Meanwhile, the Capital Market Cyber Simulation serves as a testament to the SC&rsquo;s proactive approach in preparing the industry for cyber incidents. By simulating realworld scenarios, organisations can test their response and recovery strategies, thereby strengthening their resilience against potential cyber threats. </li>
</ol>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p>
<ol start="22">
<li>In conclusion, today&rsquo;s forum marks the beginning of an ongoing partnership aimed at shaping the future of our industry.&nbsp; </li>
<li>Your attendance here today underscores your commitment to fortifying our collective resilience in the face of technological challenges. </li>
<li>Together, let us embark on this journey towards a brighter future, defined by innovation and collaboration, with resilience. </li>
<li>Thank you. Sekian, terima kasih. </li>

<p class="sizeable">Examples of forward-looking information in this press release include, but are not limited to, the closing of the Offering and the benefits of the Offering, and the expected credit rating of the Debentures, all of which are subject to significant risks and uncertainties.

<p class="sizeable">We have attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially from those current expectations described in forward-looking information. However, there may be other factors that cause actions, events or results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended and that could cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially from current expectations.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday released a summary of the exploratory pilot Climate Scenario Analysis (CSA) exercise that it conducted with six of the nation's largest banks.</p>
<p>The summary describes how these banks are using climate scenario analysis to explore the resiliency of their business models to climate-related financial risks. Participating banks took a wide range of approaches in this exercise to consider the possible implications of different physical and transition risk scenarios. The exercise highlighted data gaps and modeling challenges that arise when estimating the financial impacts of highly complex and uncertain risks over various time horizons.</p>
<p>The banks that participated in the exercise were Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo.</p>
<p>The exercise was exploratory in nature and does not have capital consequences. Drawing on lessons learned from the exercise, the Board will continue to engage with participating banks regarding their capacity to measure and manage climate-related financial risks.</p>

<title>"Adam Smith, The SEC, Data, And the Public Good" Prepared Remarks Before The 11th Annual Conference On Financial Market Regulation, SEC Chair Gary Gensler, Washington D.C., May 9, 2024</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/adam-smith-the-sec-data-and-the-public-good-prepared-remarks-before-the-11t/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/adam-smith-the-sec-data-and-the-public-good-prepared-remarks-before-the-11t/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good afternoon. It&rsquo;s a pleasure to welcome you to the 11th Annual Conference on Financial Market Regulation. As is customary, I&rsquo;d like to note that my views are my own as Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and I am not speaking on behalf of my fellow Commissioners or the staff.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My thanks to the Center for Financial Services at Lehigh University, the Center for Financial Policy at the University of Maryland, and of course the staff of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Economic and Risk Analysis (DERA).</p>
<p>DERA&rsquo;s terrific team of more than 170 economists, statisticians, data scientists, engineers, attorneys, accountants, and other staff are at the heart of everything we do at the SEC.</p>
<p>The Division has a seat at the table for all of the SEC&rsquo;s decision-making, whether it&rsquo;s monitoring markets, enforcement, or policymaking. For all of this work, we depend on data.</p>
<h3>The Nature of Finance</h3>
<p>Since antiquity, finance has been about the pricing and allocation of money and risk throughout the economy. There are those who have money who want to invest it. Others need money to fund good ideas, buy a house, or help get through life&rsquo;s inevitable challenges. There are those who have risk but don&rsquo;t want to bear it, and others willing to take on that risk.</p>
<p>Finance sits in the middle, like the neck of an hourglass whose grains of sand are money and risk.</p>
<p>Finance depends on data.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s with data that investors and issuers on either side of the hourglass participate in markets. It&rsquo;s with data that the intermediaries who sit at the neck of the hourglass help price and allocate money and risk. Intermediaries don&rsquo;t just sit passively passing the sand through the hourglass. They become important market participants themselves. They retain and transform money and risk. They also accumulate significant amounts of data on markets, pricing, and risk.</p>
<p>In finance, there also is a tendency toward concentrated data sets with sometimes dominant influence.</p>
<p>This is the nature of finance.</p>
<h3>Data, a Public Good</h3>
<p>Adam Smith, known as the father of modern economics, noted in The Wealth of Nations more than 200 years ago that the whole economy benefits when the price of information is lowered, or information is free.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;Smith&rsquo;s maxim is relevant every day in our modern capital markets.</p>
<p>Reliable, accessible data benefits everyone. No one private entity, though, has the incentive to create a database with reliable, comparable, and accessible data, even if they themselves may benefit. Thus, data is a public good.</p>
<p>Relying solely on market-based incentives would lead to under-production of the public good of information about securities.</p>
<p>President Franklin Roosevelt and Congress understood this. Setting rules that determine what data is provided to the public is one of the most consequential things we do at the SEC. The basic bargain Roosevelt and Congress laid out 90 years ago was that investors get to decide which risks to take so long as those companies raising money from the public make what Roosevelt called &ldquo;complete and truthful disclosure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roosevelt and Congress set up the SEC in 1934 to oversee the markets&mdash;and the intermediaries at the neck of the hourglass&mdash;to promote fair, orderly, and efficient markets.</p>
<p>While Smith&rsquo;s maxim and the SEC&rsquo;s role in promoting data as a public good is a constant, technology, business models, and risks change. Thus, we have an obligation to continue to refresh rules with regard to data, disclosure, and transparency.</p>
<p>I think of the SEC&rsquo;s roles with regard to promoting data as a public good in at least four areas: issuer disclosure, disclosure by market participants, transparency of markets, and the SEC&rsquo;s role providing to the public economic research as well as aggregate statistics.</p>
<h3>Issuer Disclosure</h3>
<p>First, Congress embedded in our securities laws a role for the SEC to oversee disclosures from public companies and registered investment companies. Further, they recognized from the SEC&rsquo;s beginning the importance of guarding against insider trading where insiders abuse information that hasn&rsquo;t been disclosed.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;Few things undermine trust in the markets more than insiders abusing their positions for personal advantage, such as by trading using material nonpublic information.</p>
<p>The core benefits of a mandatory disclosure-based regime and guarding against insider trading haven&rsquo;t changed in the last nine decades. As I said, though, technology and business models do change. What investors find important to their investment decisions also changes over time.</p>
<p>For instance, under Chair Arthur Levitt, the SEC in 2000 implemented Regulation Fair Disclosure to prevent companies from disclosing material non-public information to only certain individuals and not everyone.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>More recently, the SEC has updated disclosure requirements underlying the basic bargain. These last two years we&rsquo;ve adopted rules providing investors with disclosures on emerging risks like climate<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;and cybersecurity;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;capital raising technologies, like special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs),<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;and an age-old topic&mdash;executive compensation.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p>The public has benefitted from the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval System (EDGAR) in the three decades since the Commission first required mandatory EDGAR filings in 1993. To keep pace with ever-evolving markets, technology, and business models, we&rsquo;ve updated EDGAR over the years. We recently made proposals that would enhance EDGAR&rsquo;s security and further improve filers&rsquo; access to the EDGAR system. We have also worked across our rulemaking agenda to increase the structuring of data filed with the Commission. Further, since 2021, the Commission has made available Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that facilitate public access to financial statements and other disclosures made by publicly traded companies. Studies show that machine-readable disclosures benefit investors, markets, and issuers, for example by decreasing information processing costs, making stock prices more informative,&nbsp;as well as reducing market inefficiencies and risks.</p>
<p>We are now working with other agencies to implement the Financial Data Transparency Act, which seeks to promote interoperability of financial regulatory data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also have an important job in reviewing thousands of company and fund disclosures each year.</p>
<p>The Division of Corporation Finance in FY 2023 reviewed offering documents and periodic reports from among the approximately 7,400 actively reporting issuers, including more than 4,000 companies listed on U.S. exchanges.</p>
<p>The Division of Investment Management in FY 2023 reviewed more than 1,900 filings related to more than 4,400 funds and insurance products as well as annual reports from more than 4,200 funds.</p>
<p>Essential to investors&rsquo; trust in the reliability of public companies&rsquo; financial information is an independent audit of issuers&rsquo; financial statements. Congress understood this when they gave the SEC authority over setting accounting standards for public companies. Congress further understood this when they passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in response to some of the largest accounting frauds and bankruptcies in the history of our country.</p>
<h3>Market Participant Disclosure</h3>
<p>Second, beyond issuer disclosure, the public benefits from data about market participants. Such data enhances price discovery, reduces information asymmetries, and promotes trust in the markets.</p>
<p>Such disclosures include institutional investment managers holdings,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;beneficial ownership reporting,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;and portions of broker-dealer annual audited financial statements.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p>Again, technology, business models, and risks change. To that end, the SEC has updated a number of these market participant disclosure requirement in the last few years. For instance, we recently adopted rule amendments governing beneficial ownership reporting under Sections 13(d) and 13(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;The rules shortened the deadlines by which certain beneficial owners of a company must inform the public of their position.</p>
<p>Further, as mandated by Congress, we adopted last year a rule to broaden the scope of short sale related data available to regulators as well as the investing public.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></p>
<h3>Market Transparency</h3>
<p>Third, the SEC has a role in promoting the transparency of the buying and selling of securities.</p>
<p>Such transparency matters, whether it&rsquo;s prior to the transaction (so-called pre-trade transparency) or after the transaction (so-called post-trade transparency). We see this in our daily lives, whether we&rsquo;re shopping for a car, a security, or a copy of Adam Smith&rsquo;s book. We benefit from knowing what others paid for a product or a security in a transaction that recently occurred.</p>
<p>Post-trade transparency promotes liquidity and helps investors. There is something about that sunshine. It gives everyone a sense of where the current market is. The public gets to see details of the last trade that two counterparties just negotiated in that market.</p>
<p>Last year, we adopted a rule mandated by Dodd-Frank to bring greater transparency and efficiency to the securities lending market.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></p>
<p>We also recently adopted final rules to require that large broker-dealers&mdash;those with more than 100,000 customers&mdash;disclose execution quality to the public.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></p>
<p>In terms of the National Market System, a great deal has changed since we adopted Regulation NMS in 2005. In particular, a large and growing amount of equity trading now occurs in what many call the dark markets, particularly off-exchange market centers such as wholesalers and dark pools.</p>
<p>In addition to proposing a rule to narrow the minimum tick size,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>&nbsp;the proposal would update the more than 120-year-old definition<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>&nbsp; of round lot<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a>&nbsp;by determining the size of round lots by the share price. The proposal also would add quotes on odd-lots to core data. Further, it would bring greater transparency to the access fees charged and related rebates paid by exchanges.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, we also approved a Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) rule change to enhance post-trade transparency in the Treasury markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a>&nbsp;The FINRA rule, for the first time, will provide the public with post-trade transparency in the Treasury markets on a trade-by-trade basis, rather than on an aggregated basis. The scope of what will be published to the public will include a trade&rsquo;s time, price, direction, venue, and volume.</p>
<h3>Economic Research and Aggregate Market Statistics</h3>
<p>Fourth, we have a role in publishing economic research. DERA provides impartial economic analyses that consider the costs and benefits of our rules as well as their effects on efficiency, competition, and capital formation.</p>
<p>We get feedback from the public on these economic analyses, which benefits our rulemaking. Our economic analyses also benefit the markets broadly because, as Smith said, making data available creates a public good. Our economists, from time to time, also publish research that&rsquo;s outside of rulemaking. Taken together, this economic research helps improve market transparency and promotes the public&rsquo;s understanding of markets.</p>
<p>The SEC also has had a history of publishing aggregate data with regard to the securities markets.</p>
<p>Since 2014, we have published quarterly aggregated trading information data, sourced from the Market Information Data Analytics System (MIDAS), as well as monthly money market fund statistics. In 2015, we began publishing quarterly private fund statistics. Since 2022, we have been publishing data on the security-based swaps market twice a year.</p>
<p>In addition, the SEC has made data more accessible and usable. Since 2015, DERA has published data sets aggregated from structured disclosures by individual registrants. Currently, it publishes 12 such data sets.</p>
<p>Such publications by the SEC helps the public better understand how our economy and securities markets function.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recently began publishing a new report, the Registered Fund Statistics report,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a>&nbsp;which aggregates data about the more than $25 trillion registered fund industry. This will give the public a view into the registered fund industry, which includes more than 12,000 mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and closed-end funds.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve asked staff to make recommendations about other areas where we might periodically publish aggregate market statistics.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Adam Smith&rsquo;s nearly 250-year-old notion&mdash;that the whole economy benefits when the price of information is lowered, or information is free&mdash;is as relevant today as it has ever been. The SEC, as mandated by Congress, has an important role to promote data as a public good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m proud to work with all of my colleagues at the SEC, including those of you from DERA, to ensure for the public good of data.</p>
