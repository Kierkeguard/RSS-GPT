<div> Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, Commodity Exchange Act, event contracts, CFTC regulation, public interest
Summary:<br />The Commodity Futures Trading Commission proposed to further specify event contracts that are contrary to the public interest, particularly those involving gaming activities. Comments accepted until July 9, 2024. <br /> <div>
<p><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to further specify types of event contracts that fall within the scope of Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) section 5c(c)(5)(C) and are contrary to the public interest. The Commission has recently observed an increase in the number and variety of event contracts listed for trading by CFTC-registered exchanges. In addition, the Commission has recently received applications for exchange registration, and expressions of interest regarding registration, from entities indicating that they are interested in listing event contracts for trading.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In light of these developments, the Commission proposes to amend CFTC regulation 40.11 to further specify types of event contracts that fall within the scope of CEA section 5c(c)(5)(C) and are contrary to the public interest. The proposal includes a determination that event contracts involving each of the activities enumerated in CEA section 5c(c)(5)(C) (gaming, war, terrorism, assassination, and activity that is unlawful under any Federal or State law) are, as a category, contrary to the public interest and therefore may not be listed for trading or accepted for clearing on or through a CFTC-registered entity.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Further, the proposal defines &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; in detail, and the proposal lists illustrative examples of gaming that include staking or risking something of value on the outcome of a political contest, an awards contest, or a game in which one or more athletes compete, or an occurrence or non-occurrence in connection with such a contest or game. Thus, event contracts involving these illustrative examples of gaming could not be listed for trading or accepted for clearing under the proposal.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Comments must be received on or before July 9, 2024 and will be published on&nbsp;<a href="https://comments.cftc.gov/PublicComments/ReleasesWithComments.aspx">CFTC.gov</a>.</span></span></p>

<title>Remarks By US Secretary Of The Treasury Janet L. Yellen At The Open Session Of The Meeting Of The US Financial Stability Oversight Council</title>

<div> Nonbank mortgage servicing, risks, vulnerabilities, recommendations, impact <br />
Nonbank mortgage servicing risks analyzed, vulnerabilities identified, recommendations for regulatory and Congressional action to address risks and ensure financial stability. <br /><br />Summary: Because of the risks associated with nonbank mortgage servicing, the report identifies vulnerabilities and makes recommendations for regulatory and Congressional action. <div>
<p>Today, the Financial Stability Oversight Council will vote on publishing a report on nonbank mortgage servicing. The Council has highlighted in its annual reports the risks associated with the growing share of mortgages serviced by nonbank mortgage companies. It has also promoted collaboration on this issue among regulators and federal agencies through its Nonbank Mortgage Servicing Task Force. Now, the Council is leveraging its Analytic Framework, published this past November, to undertake a comprehensive analysis of risks on a sector-wide basis and make concrete recommendations to address them.</p>
<p>Nonbank mortgage companies play a critical function in the mortgage market, helping ensure accurate and timely payments to investors and appropriate loss-mitigation options for borrowers. And over the past decade, this sector has only become more important. While no single nonbank mortgage servicer owned the servicing rights on more than 5 percent of outstanding mortgage balances as of the end of 2023, nonbanks collectively originate and service the majority of U.S. residential mortgages. In 2022, they originated approximately two-thirds of mortgages and serviced the majority of mortgage balances. This is a substantial increase from 2008, when they originated 39 percent and serviced 4 percent. The share of outstanding mortgages guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae has also increased. Together, these shifts mean that exposures to the nonbank mortgage sector have grown significantly.</p>
<p>As the report outlines, some of these nonbank mortgage companies have certain strengths, from greater efficiency due to adoption of technology to acting as key mortgage originators and servicers for groups that have historically been underserved.</p>
<p>But nonbank mortgage companies also present unique risks. The report finds that their specialized business model means they are especially susceptible to macroeconomic fluctuations in the housing market, such as changes in housing prices, interest rates, and delinquency rates. They are more reliant than depository institutions on the value of mortgage servicing rights, which may lose value in the event of a downturn in the housing market. And they are also vulnerable because they can have high leverage, short-term funding, and operational risks.</p>
<p>These vulnerabilities matter. If a nonbank mortgage company fails, it may be difficult for it to find funding to continue critical servicing operations, such as making required servicing advances or providing adequate loss mitigation for distressed borrowers. Suspending services can in turn harm borrowers and other stakeholders. Even transferring the portfolio of a distressed servicer is a resource-intensive and time-consuming process, and disorderly servicing transfers can cause additional harm to borrowers. And if a new servicer cannot be found, the federal government may be left to assume the servicing obligations itself. All of these outcomes could disrupt economic activity and the provision of financial services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because the risk profiles of nonbank mortgage companies are similar, stresses in the mortgage market can affect multiple nonbank mortgage companies simultaneously and can also spread throughout the sector. &nbsp;And sufficiently large and widespread disruption in the sector could lead to a temporary restriction of mortgage credit. This would make credit more expensive and difficult to obtain, particularly for borrowers who have been historically underserved by the mortgage market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Put simply, the vulnerabilities of nonbank mortgage companies can amplify shocks in the mortgage market and undermine financial stability, and the Council has now laid this out in detail for the first time.</p>
<p>This analysis also points to recommendations to address identified vulnerabilities. As the report finds, current state-based requirements and limited federal authorities mean risks have not been fully addressed. We need further action to promote safe and sound operations, address liquidity risks, and promote continuity of servicing operations when a servicer cannot perform its critical functions.</p>
<p>The Council encourages state regulators to strengthen prudential standards if they have not already done so and to require resolution and recovery planning by large nonbank mortgage servicers to enhance sector resilience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Council also makes recommendations for Congressional action. Congress should consider legislation to authorize and protect the sharing of confidential information, which would facilitate coordination among Council member agencies, state regulators, and Ginnie Mae. Congress should consider providing FHFA and Ginnie Mae with additional authorities to better manage nonbank mortgage company counterparty risk and for Ginnie Mae to expand its Pass-Through Assistance Program into a more effective liquidity backstop. And to facilitate continuity of servicing, the Council encourages Congress to establish a fund financed by the industry to provide liquidity to failing nonbank mortgage servicers to enable their critical servicing operations to continue until servicing obligations can be transferred in an orderly fashion.</p>
<p>Moving these recommendations forward is crucial to protecting borrowers and preventing disruptions to economic activity.</p>
<p>With that, I commend the Council for this important and timely work. And I will now turn to Sandra Lee, Treasury&rsquo;s Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Council.</p>

<div> meeting, Financial Stability Oversight Council, private credit market, nonbank mortgage servicing, report
<br />
The Financial Stability Oversight Council discussed FMUs, private credit market, and approved a report on nonbank mortgage servicing.
<br /><br />Summary: The Council discussed FMUs, private credit market, and approved a report on nonbank mortgage servicing. <div>
<p>Today, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen convened a meeting of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (Council) in executive and public sessions at the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury).&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the executive session, the Council received an update from member agency staff on recent and planned work of the Council&rsquo;s Financial Market Utilities (FMU) Committee, including the committee&rsquo;s review of the eight FMUs that the Council designated in 2012.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Council also received an update from staff of Treasury and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on market developments related to corporate credit, including private credit.&nbsp; While risks remain balanced in credit markets overall, the private credit market has grown substantially and is a relatively opaque segment of the broader financial market that warrants continued monitoring.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the public session, the Council received a presentation on the Council&rsquo;s Report on Nonbank Mortgage Servicing.&nbsp; The Council voted unanimously to approve the issuance of the report.</p>
<p>The Council also voted to approve the minutes of its previous meeting on February 23, 2024.&nbsp;</p>

<title>Dissenting Statement Of CFTC Commissioner Caroline D. Pham On Event Contracts Proposal</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Federalism, CFTC, Event Contracts, Gaming, State Regulation
Summary:
- Commissioner dissents from Event Contracts Proposal
- Emphasizes the importance of federalism and state regulation of gaming
- Raises concerns about the proposal's legal impact
- Criticizes the proposal for misunderstanding the law and overstepping the CFTC's role
- Highlights specific areas for public comment
- Raises concerns about new delegation of authority, missing comment letters, and misplaced election integrity concerns
Summary: <div>
<p><span><span><span><span>I respectfully dissent from the Event Contracts Proposal because it takes the CFTC&rsquo;s regulation of event contract markets backwards with its fundamental misunderstanding of how we regulate derivatives and the States regulate gaming. Instead of thoughtfully considering how to effectively regulate these markets while fostering innovation, the Event Contracts Proposal ties itself in knots over the bounds of gaming, which Congress has neither asked nor directed the Commission to regulate. I am simply disappointed in this wasted opportunity to regulate retail binary options, sidestepping our responsibility, and concerned about its legal impact.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The United States is built on a foundation of federalism. Federalism reflects the Founders&rsquo; understanding that a one-size-fits-all approach would not work for this country, and allows for States to govern in ways that best suit their residents.</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024b?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;The simple language of the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution (&ldquo;The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people&rdquo;) emphasizes that the Federal government is a government of limited and enumerated powers.</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024b?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;The Tenth Amendment, importantly, protects the American people from Federal encroachment.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>State regulation of gaming, ranging from betting to lotteries, is long-established in the U.S., and is clearly a power reserved to the States.</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024b?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;No one understands their local cultures, economies, and values better than the States,</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024b?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;which leads to State laws that have been crafted to reflect the needs of their residents. This approach has allowed some States to embrace gaming and leverage it as a source of revenue and tourism, while others take a more conservative approach.</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024b?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>When it comes to event contracts related to gaming, I have been clear that the CFTC should exercise caution, primarily because I believe the Commission fundamentally misunderstands the law in this area and Congressional intent.</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024b?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;That fear has proven well-founded with the Event Contracts Proposal.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The CFTC has a role in regulating event contracts as a market regulator, but it is essential that the CFTC does not encroach upon the prerogatives of States. An appropriate Event Contracts Proposal would have struck a balance between Federal oversight and State autonomy by focusing on the CFTC&rsquo;s core mandate of promoting market stability and protecting market participants from fraud and abusive practices.</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024b?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;In doing so, the CFTC could have maintained the integrity of event contracts without undermining the authority of State governments.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Instead, as I will explain below, the Event Contracts Proposal bigfoots into State regulation of gaming by drawing unintelligible lines in the sand that will either at best result in confusion for State gaming authorities, or at worst push event contracts into illegal, unregulated offshore markets.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The Event Contracts Proposal Ignores the Supreme Court&rsquo;s Preemption Doctrine</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The Constitution&rsquo;s Supremacy Clause provides that &ldquo;the Laws of the United States . . . shall be the Supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024b?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;This language is the basis for the doctrine of Federal preemption, according to which Federal law supersedes conflicting State laws.</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024b?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The Supreme Court has identified two general ways in which Federal law can preempt State law: expressly, when a Federal statute or regulation contains explicit preemptive language; and impliedly when its structure and purpose implicitly reflect Congress&rsquo;s preemptive intent.</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024b?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;But the Federal government cannot preempt traditional State powers that are the exclusive domain of States to regulate, recognizing the right to self-determination by the people.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The Event Contracts Proposal uniquely ignores the fact that the limits Congress placed on the Commission&rsquo;s regulation of event contracts&nbsp;<i>save</i>&nbsp;the Commission from becoming a gaming regulator. In other words, the Commission could have relied on implied preemption to regulate event contracts as derivatives in our markets separate and apart from State gaming regulation. Instead, the Commission&nbsp;<i>creates</i>&nbsp;preemption concerns by proposing a gaming definition that incomprehensibly relies so heavily on State law that I don&rsquo;t know how any exchange could understand where the Commission&rsquo;s rules begin and end for these contracts.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Together, under CEA Section 5c(c)(5)(C), Rule 40.11, and the preamble to the final rulemaking for Rule 40.11, whether an event contract is prohibited by Rule 40.11 depends on the underlying activity that the contract is based upon. When the Commission reviewed an exchange&rsquo;s political control contracts, I raised that the underlying activity was political control, which was neither terrorism, assassination, war, gaming, nor unlawful under any Federal or State law.</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024b?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;Therefore, Rule 40.11(a)(1) did not apply. Yet in disapproving the contracts, the Commission argued that &ldquo;<i>taking a position</i>&nbsp;in the Congressional Control Contracts&rdquo; (emphasis added) amounted to gaming.</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024b?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>When taking a position in a derivatives contract is gaming, the Commission starts to look like a gaming regulator. Congress may not compel a State to enact or enforce a regulatory regime,</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024b?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;and indeed, Congress has not here. Yet in doubling down on its logic in the Event Contracts Proposal, when the act of entering into a derivatives contract that meets the Proposal&rsquo;s overbroad definition of gaming, drawn from dozens of State laws, is now gaming under the Commission&rsquo;s jurisdiction, we begin encroaching on State gaming oversight. State-regulated sportsbooks, in trying to comprehend where the Commission&rsquo;s gaming derivatives begin and traditional bets end, will be captured in this confusion and question the need to register with the Commission as exchanges. I certainly don&rsquo;t want the Commission to be registering Las Vegas sportsbooks and other betting venues.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The Commodity Exchange Act is Clear that the Commission&nbsp;<i>Regulates</i>&nbsp;Event Contracts</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Congress has been clear in its direction for the CFTC.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>First, in relevant part, the purpose of the Commodity Exchange Act is to deter and prevent price manipulation or any other disruptions to market integrity; to ensure the financial integrity of all transactions; to protect all market participants from fraudulent or other abusive sales practices and misuses of customer assets; and to promote responsible innovation and fair competition among boards of trade, other markets and market participants.</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024b?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Second, the Commission is authorized to review event contracts if the underlying activity that the contract is based upon is terrorism, assassination, war, gaming, or unlawful under any Federal or State law.</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024b?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Read together, Congress intended that the Commission regulate event contracts within the bounds of the section 5(c) prohibitions. Instead of telling market participants how we will regulate the innovative contracts and exchanges that have appeared in recent years, the Commission has decided to &ldquo;identif[y] the types of event contracts that may&nbsp;<i>not</i>&nbsp;be listed for trading or accepted for clearing&rdquo; (emphasis added), seemingly primarily to avoid the work. If the number of contract reviews has increased, then the Commission should increase its resources and capacity&mdash;not to prohibit public activity.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>As referenced above, the Commission then embarks on a survey of state gaming definitions to insert the concept into the Commission&rsquo;s rules. The Commission even notes the approach &ldquo;reflects the similar approach taken in numerous state gambling statutes,&rdquo; and mentions 35 States. The word &ldquo;state&rdquo; appears in the 95 page release 133 times. The Event Contracts Proposal reads as a defense against becoming a gaming regulator while inserting State gaming into our rules, which is not only confusing but unnecessary because Congress has clearly defined our role with respect to the States.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>To make matters worse, the Commission then leaps from the overbroad, vague definition of gaming to provide examples of the types of event contracts that the Commission believes fall outside of the scope of CEA section 5c(c)(5)(C) and, by extension, Regulation 40.11. Given the fact that the Event Contracts Proposal repeatedly states that the broad range and volume of new contracts motivated this rulemaking, I find it stunning that the outer bounds provided are limited to contracts based on: (1)&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>economic indicators, (2) financial indicators, and (3) foreign exchange rates or currencies.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Instead of creating a framework, the Commission is creating a vast gray area for exchanges. Where gaming begins and the scope of Regulation 40.11 ends is anyone&rsquo;s guess now, and I fear State gaming authorities will be left to figure it out on their own.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Specific Areas for Public Comment</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>In addition to my concerns raised above, I highlight the following specific areas for public comment to aid in review of the Proposal:</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><i><span><span>New Delegation of Authority</span></span></i></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The Event Contracts Proposal contains an alarming new delegation of authority to let staff&mdash;rather than the Commission&mdash;decide when event contracts fall within a prohibited category under Rule 40.11.</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024b?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;Combined with an overbroad definition of gaming, this will exponentially increase the number of&nbsp;<i>self-certified</i>&nbsp;exchange contracts suspended from trading at the whim of staff with no check or oversight from the Commission.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>This stunning overreach flies in the face of the Commission&rsquo;s self-certification framework. I encourage commenters to review this new delegation and comment on whether it upends the self-certification processes exchanges currently employ.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><i><span><span>Missing Comment Letters</span></span></i></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The Event Contracts Proposal completely omits any discussion of the comment letters the Commission recently received on the definition of gaming, as well as Rule 40.11 and event contracts more broadly. All told, the Commission has received around 200 comments in response to requests for public comment on an exchange&rsquo;s political control contracts.</span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024b?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;These comments came from exchanges, academics, former CFTC officials, and other industry participants, and were directly on point on the issues raised in today&rsquo;s Proposal.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The Commission cannot selectively decide to tell one side of the story. It strains credulity that the Commission has selective amnesia and makes no mention of these letters in the Event Contracts Proposal.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><i><span><span>Misplaced Election Integrity Concerns</span></span></i></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The Commission gets hung up on the fact that &ldquo;it is not tasked with the protection of election integrity or enforcement of campaign finance laws&rdquo; in justifying prohibiting event contracts based on political contests. However, the Federal Election Commission polices campaigns. Congress has never asked, nor suggested, the CFTC should police elections, much like the Commission has not become the weather police for weather derivatives, or the crop yield police when we have the USDA, the changes to corporate officers or asset purchases police when we have the SEC, the regional insured property losses police when we have state insurance regulators, or the bankruptcy police when we have the courts, or the temperature police.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The Commission&rsquo;s concern over policing elections would be akin to worrying that the Commission might have to look over the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s shoulder to ensure rates increases are fair and become the Fed police.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Conclusion</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>I would like to thank Grey Tanzi, Andrew Stein, Lauren Bennett, Nora Flood, and Vince McGonagle in the Division of Market Oversight for their work on the Proposal.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>The contracts causing so much consternation for the Commission have not been, and are not, gaming. If the Commission could accept that and move on, we could have a healthy discussion over how to effectively regulate these markets as we do any other and protect against abusive trading in retail binary options contracts. Instead, we have muddled it and made a mess.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>I look forward to the comments.</span></span></span></span></p>

<title>Dissenting Statement Of CFTC Commissioner Summer K. Mersinger Regarding Proposed Rulemaking On Event Contracts</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Securities, Contracts, Prohibition, Economic purpose test, Rulemaking
<br />
The Commissioner dissents from the proposed rulemaking on event contracts, citing legal overreach, lack of justification, and inaccuracies.
<br /><br />Summary: The Commissioner argues against the proposed rulemaking due to legal overreach, lack of justification, and inaccuracies. <div>
<p>I support the Commission<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;undertaking a rulemaking on event contracts, which is long overdue.&nbsp; During my tenure on the Commission, I have consistently called for a rulemaking process to establish a framework for the Commission to exercise the discretionary authority with respect to event contracts that Congress granted to the agency in our governing statute, the Commodity Exchange Act (&ldquo;CEA&rdquo;).<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, though, I cannot support this particular proposed rulemaking (the &ldquo;Proposal&rdquo;).&nbsp; At first blush, it appears to be &ldquo;much ado about nothing,&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3">[3]</a>&nbsp;as it seems to do little more than rubber-stamp what the Commission has already said and done.&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon closer inspection, though, it is a &ldquo;wolf in sheep&rsquo;s clothing&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4">[4]</a>&nbsp;because where the Proposal departs from our past practice, it lays the foundation to prohibit entire categories of potential exchange-traded event contracts whose terms and conditions the Commission has never even seen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In planting the seeds of future bans of countless event contracts, sight unseen, the Proposal&mdash;</p>
<ul>
<li>Exceeds the legal authority that Congress granted the Commission in the CEA;</li>
<li>Relies heavily on a brief snippet of legislative history consisting of a colloquy between two Senators &ndash; cherry-picking parts of the colloquy it likes, while ignoring other parts of the same colloquy;</li>
<li>Resurrects an &ldquo;economic purpose test&rdquo; for evaluating the public interest that was based on a provision of the CEA that was repealed by Congress nearly a quarter-century ago;</li>
<li>Fails to do the hard work of analyzing the unique nature of event contracts, which are different in kind from traditional derivatives contracts more familiar to the agency;</li>
<li>Relies on unsupported conjecture, treats similar circumstances differently, and raises more questions than it answers; and</li>
<li>Flies in the face of the CFTC&rsquo;s mandate to promote responsible innovation as Congress directed in the CEA.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My dissent should not be taken as an indication that I am a fan of all event contracts.&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is hard not to conclude from the multitude of defects in this Proposal that its significant overreach is motivated more by a seemingly visceral antipathy to event contracts than by reasoned analysis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It does not matter whether we think event contracts are a good idea or a bad idea; the Commission must exercise its authority with respect to event contracts within the scope of the CFTC&rsquo;s legal authority, and must appropriately implement the authority that Congress has provided us.&nbsp;&nbsp;This Proposal fails both tests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Event Contracts in Brief<span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>CEA Section 5c(c)(5)(C), which was added to the CEA in 2010 by the Dodd-Frank Act,<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5">[5]</a>&nbsp;permits the Commission to prohibit an event contract from being listed for trading on an exchange<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6">[6]</a>&nbsp;if:&nbsp;&nbsp;1) the contract involves one of five enumerated activities&nbsp;<i>(i.e.,</i>&nbsp;activity that is unlawful under Federal or State law; terrorism; assassination; war; or gaming); and 2) the Commission determines that the contract is contrary to the public interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;CEA Section 5c(c)(5)(C) also provides that the Commission may determine, by rule or regulation, that an event contract involves &ldquo;other similar activity&rdquo; to the five enumerated activities, which would subject event contracts involving that similar activity to the &ldquo;contrary to the public interest&rdquo; standard.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7">[7]</a></p>
<p>Congress in CEA Section 5c(c)(5)(C) did not decree that event contracts involving enumerated activities are contrary to the public interest&nbsp;<i>per se</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather, if an event contract involves an enumerated activity, the Commission &ldquo;may&rdquo; determine that it is contrary to the public interest and prohibited from trading &ndash; which necessarily indicates that the Commission also has the discretion to determine that it is not.</p>
<p>A year after enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Commission adopted CFTC Rule 40.11<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8">[8]</a>&nbsp;to implement the CEA&rsquo;s new event contract provisions.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9">[9]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is Rule 40.11 that the Commission is now proposing to amend.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Proposed Definition of &ldquo;Gaming&rdquo; is Significantly Overbroad</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Neither the CEA nor the Commission&rsquo;s rules define the term &ldquo;gaming.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Rule 40.11 Adopting Release implementing CEA Section 5c(c)(5)(C), the Commission acknowledged that &ldquo;the term &lsquo;gaming&rsquo; requires further clarification,&rdquo; and said that the Commission may issue a future rulemaking concerning event contracts that involve &ldquo;gaming.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10">[10]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I agree that, 13 years later, it is long past time for the Commission to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp;But, the Proposal&rsquo;s definition of &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; is much too broad.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Proposal Sweeps in the Universe of Every &ldquo;Occurrence or Non-Occurrence in Connection With a Game</p>
<p>The proposed definition of &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; includes both the outcome of a game and the performance of one or more competitors in a game.&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, so good.</p>
<p>But it then tacks on an additional category of &ldquo;any other occurrence or non-occurrence in connection with&rdquo; a game.&nbsp;&nbsp;The all-encompassing nature of the phrase &ldquo;any other occurrence or non-occurrence&rdquo; is self-evident.&nbsp;&nbsp;And that universality is further reinforced by its attachment to the &ldquo;in connection with&rdquo; wording.</p>
<p>The motivation for this expansive wording in the Proposal is likely that, where the phrase &ldquo;in connection with&rdquo; appears in various enforcement provisions of the CEA, the Commission interprets it &ldquo;broadly, not technically or restrictively.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11">[11]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Proposal gives no indication that it should be interpreted any differently here.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the Proposal (at page 29) goes so far as to say that staking or risking something of value on a contingent event &ldquo;in connection with&rdquo; a game &ldquo;would be as much of a wager or a bet on the game . . . as staking or risking something of value on the outcome of the game . . . would be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under this incredibly far-reaching formulation, there are countless &ldquo;occurrence[s] or non-occurrence[s] in connection with&rdquo; a game that the Proposal would deem to be &ldquo;gaming.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obvious examples include event contracts involving the attendance at a baseball or football game, or whether a particular nation will be selected to host a soccer World Cup.&nbsp;&nbsp;These would clearly be &ldquo;in connection with&rdquo; the underlying baseball, football, or soccer games &ndash; but there is no reason why staking something of value on those contingent events should be treated the same as staking something of value on the outcome of those games.</p>
<p>Indeed, there is no better illustration of the overbreadth of the &ldquo;in connection with&rdquo; aspect of the proposed &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; definition than the Proposal&rsquo;s own example (at page 32) of &ldquo;whether a particular individual will attend a game.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult to fathom why an event contract involving whether Taylor Swift will attend a Kansas City Chiefs football game should constitute &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; &ndash; and impossible to understand why the Proposal treats similar things differently, since whether she attends a Beyonc&eacute; concert would not constitute &ldquo;gaming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I acknowledge that it might be appropriate to extend the definition of &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; to include events that can affect the outcome of a game or the performance of a competitor in a game.&nbsp;&nbsp;Event contracts involving, say, whether an injury to Shohei Ohtani would prevent him from playing in the World Series, or involving the score of a football game at halftime, might be examples of this.&nbsp;&nbsp;But to broadly define as &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; every &ldquo;occurrence or non-occurrences in connection with&rdquo; a game &ndash; regardless of whether it has any bearing on the outcome of the game or the performance of a competitor in the game &ndash; is wholly unwarranted.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; &nbsp;Elections and Awards are Not &ldquo;Gaming&rdquo;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The Proposal rubber-stamps two prior Commission Orders that found that event contracts involving political control or elections are &ldquo;gaming,&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12">[12]</a>&nbsp;essentially repeating the same discussion from those Orders &ndash; and then throwing awards into its &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; definition as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, this definition is inconsistent with the legislative history of CEA Section 5c(c)(5)(C) &ndash; legislative history on which, for other issues discussed below, the Proposal relies heavily.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That legislative history consists of a colloquy between Senators Blanche Lincoln and Dianne Feinstein.&nbsp;&nbsp;Senator Lincoln was then the Chair of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, which is the CFTC&rsquo;s authorizing committee.</p>
<p>In the colloquy, the Senators talked about &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; only in the limited context of sporting events.&nbsp;&nbsp;In responding to Senator Feinstein&rsquo;s question about the CFTC&rsquo;s authority under Section 5c(c)(5)(C) to determine that a contract is a &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; contract, Senator Lincoln said that &ldquo;[i]t would be quite easy to construct an &lsquo;event contract&rsquo; around sporting events such as the Super Bowl, the Kentucky Derby, and Masters Golf Tournament.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13">[13]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, Senator Lincoln clearly associated &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; with sporting events,&nbsp;<i>i.e.,</i>&nbsp;games.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14">[14]</a></p>
<p>But rather than remain true to the legislative history that equated &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; with only sporting events, the Proposal broadly sweeps all &ldquo;contests&rdquo; into its definition of &ldquo;gaming.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it then concludes that elections and awards are &ldquo;contests&rdquo; and, therefore, &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; &ndash; even though neither Senator Lincoln nor Senator Feinstein ever mentioned elections or awards (or &ldquo;contests,&rdquo; for that matter).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Proposal attempts to squeeze elections and awards into the &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; category through the following tortured chain of reasoning:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Gaming means gambling;</li>
<li>Some State statutes link gambling to betting or wagering on contests; therefore,</li>
<li>Contests (including elections and awards) constitute gaming.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet, one has to ask:&nbsp;&nbsp;If Congress had intended for elections and awards to be enumerated activities, is it more likely that Section 5c(c)(5)(C) would have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Included elections and awards in its list of enumerated activities; or</li>
<li>Enumerated &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; and hoped the Commission would&mdash;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Define &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; to include &ldquo;contests;&rdquo; and</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider &ldquo;contests&rdquo; to include elections and awards?</p>
<p>Congress easily could have included elections and awards as enumerated activities, but it did not.&nbsp;&nbsp;Confronted with this Congressional silence, I do not believe the Commission can simply decree that elections and awards are enumerated activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;And this is especially the case when Congress in CEA Section 5c(c)(5)(C) provided the Commission with&nbsp;a ready-made process for determining, through a rulemaking proceeding, whether contests, elections, and/or awards are similar to the enumerated activities, including &ldquo;gaming.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am baffled at why the Commission is tying itself into knots by trying to reason its way from &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; to &ldquo;gambling&rdquo; to &ldquo;contests&rdquo; to elections and awards, rather than simply do what Congress said it could do: consider whether elections and awards are similar to &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; (or another enumerated activity).&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a matter of form over substance.&nbsp;&nbsp;Approach matters when it comes to exercising our authority under the CEA, and I cannot support the Proposal&rsquo;s approach to stretch the statutory term &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; to include elections and awards.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission Lacks Legal Authority to Determine in Advance that Entire&nbsp;Categories of Event Contracts are Contrary to the Public Interest</p>
<p>The overbreadth of the Proposal&rsquo;s &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; definition would suffice for me to dissent.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Proposal&rsquo;s most brazen overreach is its determination, in advance, that every event contract that involves an enumerated activity is automatically contrary to the public interest &ndash; regardless of the terms and conditions of that contract.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Proposal would prohibit these contracts &ndash; sight unseen &ndash; through the shortcut of declaring entire categories of event contracts to be contrary to the public interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Commission lacks legal authority under the CEA to make public interest determinations by category.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Proposal&rsquo;s justification for its approach (at page 37) is that &ldquo;the statute does not require this public interest determination to be made on a contract-specific basis.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is backwards.&nbsp;&nbsp;The CFTC is a creature of statute, and has only the authorities granted to it by the CEA.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no provision in CEA Section 5c(c)(5)(C) for public interest determinations regarding event contracts involving enumerated activities to be made by category.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, the Commission cannot claim that authority through the&nbsp;<i>ipse dixit</i>&nbsp;of &ldquo;Congress didn&rsquo;t say we couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is not a mere question of what procedure to follow.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Proposal would allow the Commission to make the substantive policy determination that entire categories of event contracts, regardless of their terms and conditions, are contrary to the public interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;And the consequences of such a determination are severe &ndash; a complete prohibition on exchanges&rsquo; ability to list event contracts, and on market participants&rsquo; ability to trade them.&nbsp;&nbsp;If Congress had intended for the Commission to wield this immense authority, surely it would have said so.</p>
<p>In fact, in another CEA provision similar to CEA Section 5c(c)(5)(C) that also was added by the Dodd-Frank Act, Congress did say so.&nbsp;&nbsp;CEA Section 2(h)(2)(A)(i) specifically states that the Commission shall review &ldquo;each swap, or any group,&nbsp;<i>category</i>, type, or class of swaps to make a determination as to whether the swap or group,&nbsp;<i>category</i>, type, or class of swaps should be required to be cleared.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15">[15]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, when it enacted the Dodd-Frank Act, Congress knew how to tell the Commission that it could make a determination on either an individual or categorical basis when it wanted to do so.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16">[16]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, Congress did not say in CEA Section 5c(c)(5)(C) that the Commission could make public interest determinations for event contracts by category.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Proposal&rsquo;s premise is that a grant of authority to make a determination about one thing necessarily includes authority to make a determination about a category of such things &ndash;&nbsp;<i>unless&nbsp;</i>Congress says otherwise.&nbsp;&nbsp;But if that were the case, then there was no need for Congress to tell the Commission in CEA Section 2(h)(2)(A)(i) that it could make mandatory swap clearing determinations either by individual swap or by category.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17">[17]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Proposal&rsquo;s determination would render statutory text in CEA Section 2(h)(2)(A)(i) mere surplusage in violation of established canons of statutory construction.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn18">[18]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;It also would violate the canon of statutory construction that provisions enacted as part of the same statute (here, the Dodd-Frank Act) should be construed in a similar manner.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn19">[19]</a></p>
<p>In the absence of any statutory text in CEA Section 5c(c)(5)(C) like that in CEA Section 2(h)(2)(A)(i), I cannot accept that Congress silently authorized the CFTC to make life easier for itself through the shortcut of making impactful determinations that entire categories of event contracts are contrary to the public interest and thus are prohibited from trading on exchanges.</p>
<p>IV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if there is Legal Authority, the Proposal Fails to Justify Making Advance&nbsp;Public Interest Determinations by Category &ndash; For a Host of Reasons</p>
<p>Even if the Commission has legal authority to make public interest determinations for event contracts by category, the Proposal is wholly unpersuasive in its attempt to justify doing so.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a multitude of failings.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is No Basis to Resurrect the Repealed &ldquo;Economic Purpose Test,&rdquo;&nbsp;Which Shouldn&rsquo;t&nbsp;be Applied to Event Contracts in Any Event</p>
<p>The Proposal would ban entire categories of event contracts as being contrary to the public interest based largely on the proposition that they fail the &ldquo;economic purpose test.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are four significant problems with this approach.</p>
<p><i>Congressional Intent:</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Proposal relies on a single, ambiguous, passage in the legislative history to conclude that Congress intended, for purposes of a public interest review of an event contract, to resurrect the &ldquo;economic purpose test&rdquo; that the Commission once used to determine whether a futures contract was contrary to the public interest &ndash; until Congress repealed that public interest requirement in 2000.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn20">[20]</a></p>
<p>The Proposal&rsquo;s resurrection of the &ldquo;economic purposes test&rdquo; is based entirely on this one passage in the colloquy between Senator Dianne Feinstein and Senator Blanche Lincoln:</p>
<p>Mrs. Feinstein: . . . Will the CFTC have the power to determine that a contract is a gaming contract if the predominant use of the contract is speculative as opposed to hedging or economic use?</p>
<p>Mrs. Lincoln:&nbsp;&nbsp;That is our intent.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission needs the power to, and should, prevent derivatives contracts that are contrary to the public interest because they exist predominantly to enable gambling through supposed event contracts.&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be quite easy to construct an &lsquo;event contract&rsquo; around sporting events such as the Super Bowl, the Kentucky Derby, and Masters Golf Tournament.&nbsp;&nbsp;These types of contracts would not serve any real commercial purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather, they would be used solely for gambling.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn21">[21]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>To be clear, the Dodd-Frank Act did not codify the Commission&rsquo;s prior &ldquo;economic purpose test.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I cannot accept the Proposal&rsquo;s assertion that this isolated colloquy between two Senators establishes an intent by the whole of Congress that the Commission conduct its public interest reviews of event contracts based on an &ldquo;economic purpose test&rdquo; that the Commission had withdrawn as a result of the repeal (by the whole of Congress) of the statutory provision it implemented a decade earlier.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After all, neither Senator Feinstein nor Senator Lincoln used the term &ldquo;economic purpose test&rdquo; or referred to the Commission&rsquo;s Guideline No. 1 that set out that test.&nbsp;&nbsp;As someone who spent over a decade working in Congress, and who was present on the Senate floor for countless colloquies and even had a hand in preparing talking points for similar floor discussions, I am confident that if the Senators believed we should resurrect the &ldquo;economic purpose test,&rdquo; they would have said just that.&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Difference in Kind:</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the &ldquo;economic purpose test&rdquo; was designed for traditional futures contracts that have been listed and traded on exchanges for decades.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn22">[22]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;These contracts differ in kind from event contracts, which typically are structured as binary (yes/no) options.</p>
<p>The two prongs of the &ldquo;economic purpose test,&rdquo; which the Proposal adopts as a primary basis for prohibiting entire categories of event contracts as being contrary to the public interest, evaluate:&nbsp;&nbsp;1) the contract&rsquo;s utility for price basing; and 2) whether the contract can be used for hedging purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, the Commission itself has previously recognized the difference between event contracts and the traditional futures contracts for which the &ldquo;economic purpose test&rdquo; was developed.&nbsp;&nbsp;In a Concept Release issued in 2008, the Commission stated that &ldquo;[i]n general, event contracts are neither dependent on, nor do they necessarily relate to, market prices or broad-based measures of economic or commercial activity,&rdquo; and elaborated as follows:</p>
<p>Since 2005, the Commission&rsquo;s staff has received a substantial number of requests for guidance on the propriety of offering and trading financial agreements that may primarily function as information aggregation vehicles.&nbsp;&nbsp;These event contracts generally take the form of financial agreements linked to eventualities or measures that neither derive from, nor correlate with, market prices or broad economic or commercial measures.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn23">[23]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In other words, the Proposal would ban entire categories of event contracts largely on the basis of price basing and hedging requirements that event contracts (described in the Concept Release as &ldquo;information aggregation vehicles&rdquo;) likely &ndash; because of their very structure &ndash; have little chance of satisfying.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This problem is compounded by the fact that under the Proposal, some event contracts that fail to satisfy the &ldquo;economic purpose test&rdquo; would be banned, while other contracts failing the test would not.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the Proposal&rsquo;s statement (at page 52) that &ldquo;most contracts falling within the proposed definition of &lsquo;gaming&rsquo; would have no underlying cash market with bona fide economic transactions to provide directly correlated price forming information&rdquo; is equally true of weather-related event contracts &ndash; but those contracts would not be banned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the weather is not an enumerated activity, event contracts involving the weather can trade because they are not subject to a public interest review under CEA Section 5c(c)(5)(C).&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, the Proposal&rsquo;s reliance on the &ldquo;economic purpose test&rdquo; means that exchanges can list for trading event contracts (such as those involving weather) that the Commission believes are contrary to the public interest &ndash; which I find untenable.</p>
<p>These are the inevitable results of imposing an &ldquo;economic purpose test&rdquo; on event contracts that was not designed for event contracts.&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly, a rulemaking proceeding could be appropriate to fully explore the economic attributes of event contracts, and to consider how to incorporate such attributes into a public interest review that is tailored to the nature of event contracts.&nbsp;&nbsp;But, that is not this Proposal.</p>
<p><i>Government paternalism:</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the Proposal asserts (at page 50) that &ldquo;the economic impact of an occurrence (or non-occurrence) in connection with a contest of others, or a game of skill or chance . . . generally is too diffuse and unpredictable to correlate to direct and quantifiable changes in the price of commodities or other financial assets or instruments, limiting the hedging and price-basing utility of an event contract involving such an occurrence.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But to say that there are limits to the hedging utility of an event contract is simply a statement that the contract may not be a particularly good hedging vehicle.&nbsp;&nbsp;Market participants should be permitted to make their own choices about what financial products meet their hedging needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not the CFTC&rsquo;s role to deny them that choice altogether because we feel a given product&rsquo;s hedging value is &ldquo;limited.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>The &ldquo;Economic Purpose Test&rdquo; Was Not Applied to Categories of Contracts:</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, even assuming that the &ldquo;economic purpose test&rdquo; is an appropriate part of a public interest analysis for event contracts, it does not support making public interest determinations for event contracts by category &ndash; because the Commission applied its &ldquo;economic purpose test&rdquo; to the terms and conditions of individual contracts.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission&rsquo;s Guideline No. 1 provided that&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;[i]ndividual contract terms and conditions</i>&nbsp;must be justified&rdquo; in order for an exchange to demonstrate that it met the &ldquo;economic purpose test.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn24">[24]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Commission took no shortcuts in applying its subsequently withdrawn &ldquo;economic purpose test&rdquo; to futures contracts.&nbsp;&nbsp;It did not group contracts into categories (such as all futures contracts on wheat, corn, gold, or silver) in evaluating the public interest through its &ldquo;economic purpose test.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather, the Commission looked at each contract&rsquo;s &ldquo;individual contract terms and conditions&rdquo; to make that determination.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Proposal is going to (incorrectly) adopt that &ldquo;economic purpose test&rdquo; in determining whether an event contract is contrary to the public interest, then it should apply that test the same way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Proposal&rsquo;s Application of Other Factors Falls Far Short of Justifying its Prohibition&nbsp;Entire Categories of Event Contracts</p>
<p>Aside from the &ldquo;economic purpose test,&rdquo; the Proposal points to a hodgepodge of other factors to try to justify prohibiting entire categories of event contracts, whose terms and conditions the Commission has never seen, from being traded on exchanges.&nbsp;&nbsp;But its discussion of these factors is conjectural and without evidentiary support, calls into question other contracts that are trading on regulated exchanges, and raises more questions than it answers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Taken as a whole, the Proposal falls far short of justifying the shortcut of prohibiting entire categories of event contracts (even assuming the Commission has the legal authority to do so).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Examples of these defects in the Proposal abound, but I will focus here on just a few:</p>
<p><i>Hopelessly Impractical:&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>The category of activities illegal under State law demonstrates the type of problems inherent in determining that all event contracts in a category are contrary to the public interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some activities are illegal in some States, but not others.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, the Proposal does not provide any guidance on several obvious questions:&nbsp;&nbsp;Is an event contract automatically contrary to the public interest if it involves an activity that is illegal in only a single State &ndash; and if so, why?&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, if not, then how many States have to declare an activity illegal before the automatic prohibition on event contracts involving that activity is triggered?&nbsp;&nbsp;More than half?&nbsp;&nbsp;States comprising a certain percentage of the country&rsquo;s population?<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn25">[25]</a></p>
<p>The problem is exacerbated by the Proposal&rsquo;s suggestion that the prohibition of event contracts can hinge on decisions by judges.&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this reference limited to Supreme Courts of the States?&nbsp;&nbsp;Or would a ruling by a lower court of a State that a particular activity is illegal trigger an automatic determination that an event contract involving that activity is contrary to the public interest?&nbsp;&nbsp;What if that decision is appealed?</p>
<p>While I have focused here on the category of event contracts involving activities illegal under State law, these types of practical questions are a foreseeable and inevitable result of any determination that an entire category of event contracts is contrary to the public interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;I recognize that a contract-specific approach to making public interest determinations regarding event contracts may be difficult and resource-intensive for the CFTC.&nbsp;&nbsp;But aside from my view that a contract-specific approach is required by the CEA, it also is a better approach from a policy perspective precisely because it would permit the CFTC to consider these practical questions in the context of the specific circumstances applicable to a particular event contract.&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not get to override a requirement under the law because it will be hard or require more work for us.</p>
<p><i>Absolutism Based on Conjecture:&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>Another defect in the Proposal is illustrated by the following (at page 50): &ldquo;<i>Generally speaking</i>, the Commission believes that something of value is staked or risked upon an occurrence (or non-occurrence) in connection with a contest of others, or a game or [sic] skill or chance, for entertainment purposes &ndash; in order wager [sic] on the occurrence.&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, the Commission believes that contracts involving such occurrences are&nbsp;<i>likely</i>&nbsp;to be traded predominantly &lsquo;to enable gambling&rsquo; and &lsquo;used predominantly by speculators or participants not having a commercial or hedging interest&rsquo; . . .&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Emphasis added; footnote omitted)&nbsp;</p>
<p>These assertions are entirely conjectural, as the Proposal does not cite any support for these statements.&nbsp;&nbsp;One can readily envision an event contract involving whether a particular US city will be awarded the summer or winter Olympic games in a given year, which would be used by hotel and restaurant owners, as well as other businesses, that would make money if their city gets the Olympics but not if the Olympics are awarded elsewhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such an event contract would not necessarily be used predominantly for entertainment or speculative purposes.</p>
<p>Indeed, the quoted text itself uses wording like &ldquo;[g]enerally speaking&rdquo; and &ldquo;likely,&rdquo; which is an acknowledgement that its conclusions are not universally true.&nbsp;&nbsp;A belief for which no evidence is cited, and that is acknowledged not to be true across-the-board, cannot justify an absolutist determination that all event contracts involving an activity are automatically contrary to the public interest, nor can it justify a prohibition on trading all event contracts in that category.&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Calling into Question Traditional Futures Contracts:&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>I agree that an event contract involving the outcome of a sporting event, and that allows players or coaches to trade that contract, would be contrary to the public interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;But consistent with its overreach, the Proposal also concludes that even where the terms and conditions of such a contract prohibit such persons from trading, the contract is nonetheless contrary to the public interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Proposal&rsquo;s stated rationale (at page 51) is that &ldquo;the athlete or coach would potentially have a platform &ndash; for example, access to media, combined with public perception as an authoritative source of information regarding the team &ndash; that could be used to disseminate misinformation that could artificially impact the market in the contract for additional financial gain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The same can be said of many traditional exchange-traded futures contracts.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, oil companies (or companies in the agricultural or metals sectors, or other energy companies) also have &ldquo;access to media, combined with public perception as an authoritative source of information regarding&rdquo; the oil (or other) industry, &ldquo;that could be used to disseminate misinformation that could artificially impact the market in the contract for additional financial gain.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet, exchanges are permitted to list oil futures for trading (in fact, oil companies are permitted to trade them).</p>
<p>The Proposal offers no explanation for why a possible incentive to spread misinformation should render all event contracts involving sporting events (or occurrences or non-occurrences in connection with sporting events) contrary to the public interest when traditional futures contracts with the same incentive are not.&nbsp;&nbsp;A contract-specific public interest analysis, by contrast, could take into account the terms and conditions of a particular event contract &ndash; such as whether athletes and coaches can trade, or whether there are guardrails against the spread of misinformation &ndash; to determine whether the threat of misinformation in that contract is such that it is contrary to the public interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Fallacies Concerning the CFTC&rsquo;s Regulatory and Enforcement Roles</i><i>:&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>The Proposal raises in alarmist tones the red herring that sweeping public interest determinations are necessary so that the CFTC does not get drawn into a regulatory or enforcement role for which it is not well-equipped.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the Proposal says (at page 44) that one factor that may be relevant in evaluating whether event contracts are contrary to the public interest is the extent to which they &ldquo;would draw the Commission into areas outside of its primary regulatory remit.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn26">[26]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Other examples are:&nbsp;&nbsp;1) the statements (at page 55) relating to event contracts involving elections that the Commission &ldquo;is not tasked with the protection of election integrity or enforcement of campaign finance laws;&rdquo; and 2) the statement (in the first sentence of footnote no. 127) that &ldquo;the oversight function in this area [regarding elections] is best reserved for other expert bodies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To be clear:&nbsp;&nbsp;The CFTC does not administer, oversee, or regulate elections, sporting events, gambling, or any other activity or event discussed in the Proposal &ndash; and that will not change with respect to any event contract that is found not to be contrary to the public interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather, the CFTC would exercise its exact same authorities under the CEA that it does with respect to all other derivatives contracts.</p>
<p>Nor would the CFTC become some type of &ldquo;election cop.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, the CFTC has anti-fraud and anti-manipulation enforcement authority with respect to futures contracts on broad-based security indices, but that does not mean the CFTC regulates the securities markets or that it is tasked with the protection of the integrity of the securities markets or enforcement of securities laws &ndash; the Securities and Exchange Commission (&ldquo;SEC&rdquo;) does all that.&nbsp;&nbsp;The CFTC similarly has enforcement authority with respect to natural gas and electricity since there are futures contracts on those commodities, but that does not mean the CFTC regulates the transmission of natural gas or electricity or that it is tasked with the protection of the integrity of physical natural gas or power markets, or enforcement of the Natural Gas Act or the Federal Power Act &ndash; the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (&ldquo;FERC&rdquo;) does all that.</p>
<p>The same is true with respect to an event contract that is not contrary to the public interest and thus is permitted to trade on a regulated exchange.&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Supreme Court has stated:&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;This Court&rsquo;s cases have consistently held that the use of the words &lsquo;public interest&rsquo; in a regulatory statute is not a broad license to promote the general public welfare.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather, the words take meaning from the purposes of the regulatory legislation.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn27">[27]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;If a particular event contract involving elections were found not to be contrary to the public interest and thus permitted to trade, the CFTC would have absolutely no authority to administer, oversee, or regulate the elections that are the subject of that contract, or to enforce any campaign finance laws.&nbsp;&nbsp;Its authority would extend only so far as is the case with respect to all commodities underlying derivatives contracts within our jurisdiction, as provided by Congress in the CEA.&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Why This is Important:&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>I can understand why some might ask:&nbsp;&nbsp;You have been pleading for an event contracts rulemaking for some time now, and here it is &ndash; so what is the problem?&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is this:&nbsp;&nbsp;CFTC Rule 40.11(a)(1) already prohibits the listing and trading of any event contract involving an enumerated activity.&nbsp;&nbsp;As I explained in my Kalshi Dissenting Statement:</p>
<p>Rule 40.11 contradicts the statute.&nbsp;&nbsp;CEA Section 5c(c)(5)(C) grants the Commission discretion to determine&nbsp;<i>whether</i>&nbsp;[an exchange&rsquo;s] event contract that involves an enumerated activity is contrary to the public interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;CFTC Rule 40.11(a), by contrast, provides that [an exchange] &ldquo;<i>shall not</i>&nbsp;list for trading&rdquo; a contract that involves . . . an enumerated activity (emphasis added).&nbsp;&nbsp;Read literally, Rule 40.11(a) removes entirely the flexibility that Congress granted the Commission to evaluate [exchange] event contracts from a public interest perspective.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn28"></a><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn28">[28]</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn28"></a></p>
<p>Rather than fix this problem, though, the Proposal doubles down on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;By making categorical public interest determinations in advance, the Proposal would impermissibly transform the two-step analysis that Congress provided for event contracts into a single step.&nbsp;&nbsp;It would transmogrify the&nbsp;<i>discretion</i>&nbsp;that Congress gave the Commission to determine that an event contract involving an enumerated activity is contrary to the public interest into a&nbsp;<i>mandate</i>&nbsp;that it do so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Proposal actually is quite candid in acknowledging that it would re-write CEA Section 5c(c)(5)(C).&nbsp;&nbsp;It states (at page 38):&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;If, as proposed, [Rule 40.11] is amended to include a categorical public interest determination with respect to contracts involving each of the Enumerated Activities, the Commission would not, going forward, undertake a contract-specific public interest analysis as part of a review . . . Rather, the focus of any such review would be to evaluate whether the contract involves an Enumerated Activity, in which case, it may not be listed for trading . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Congress had intended that every event contract involving an enumerated activity is automatically contrary to the public interest and prohibited from trading, it could have provided for such a single-step process in CEA Section 5c(c)(5)(C).&nbsp;&nbsp;But it did not do that, and instead provided that even if an event contract involves an enumerated activity, the Commission cannot prohibit the contract without exercising its discretion in a second step of determining that the contract is contrary to the public interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission can&rsquo;t short-circuit the process that Congress established by determining that an event contract is contrary to the public interest &ndash; in advance and without knowing the contract&rsquo;s terms and conditions &ndash; simply because that makes things easier for the agency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Granted, the Proposal makes categorical public interest determinations only for the activities enumerated in CEA Section 5c(c)(5)(C).&nbsp;&nbsp;I admit that I am not going to lose sleep over a determination that all event contracts involving terrorism, assassination, and war are contrary to the public interest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But this is where the &ldquo;wolf in sheep&rsquo;s clothing&rdquo; arrives.&nbsp;&nbsp;While this Proposal only addresses event contracts involving enumerated activities, it sets the precedent for how the Commission can handle event contracts involving other activities that it determines are similar to enumerated activities, too.</p>
<p>If the Proposal is adopted as final, then at any time in the future, the Commission could determine that other activities are similar to enumerated activities &ndash; and could then determine that every event contract involving that activity is automatically contrary to the public interest (and therefore prohibited from trading) regardless of its particular terms and conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;And given all the deficiencies in this Proposal&rsquo;s categorical public interest determinations discussed above, that appears to be a low bar to clear.&nbsp;</p>
<p>V.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Portions of the Proposal are Inaccurate or Extremely Weak, or Make No Sense</p>
<p>The fact that certain portions of the Proposal are inaccurate, extremely weak, or simply make no sense suggests that it either was hastily prepared, or is motivated primarily by the sheer hatred that the Commission seems to bear towards event contracts.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are a few examples:&nbsp;</p>
<p>--The Proposal says (at page 44) that &ldquo;the public good&rdquo; is a relevant factor for consideration in an evaluation of whether an event contract is contrary to the public interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;It makes no sense that the Commission should consider &ldquo;the public good&rdquo; in evaluating whether a contract is contrary to &ldquo;the public interest.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is tautological &ndash; &ldquo;the public good&rdquo; and &ldquo;the public interest&rdquo; mean the same thing.</p>
<p>--The Proposal&rsquo;s statement (at pages 39-40) that in the colloquy, Senators Feinstein and Lincoln &ldquo;discussed the Commission&rsquo;s authority, prior to the enactment of the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 (&lsquo;CFMA&rsquo;), &lsquo;to prevent trading that is contrary to the public interest&rdquo; is incorrect.&nbsp;&nbsp;Senators Feinstein and Lincoln did not &ldquo;discuss&rdquo; the Commission&rsquo;s pre-CFMA authority.&nbsp;&nbsp;Senator Feinstein referenced it in asking a question, but Senator Lincoln (the Committee Chair) did not talk about it &ndash; in fact, she did not even mention the CFMA.</p>
<p>--Footnote no. 49 cites the CFTC Reauthorization Act of 2019 as support for the Proposal&rsquo;s view that an erroneous reference to a non-existent CEA Section 1a(2)(i) in CEA Section 5c(c)(5)(C) was intended by Congress to refer to CEA Section 1a(19)(i) instead, since the bill included a provision to replace the reference to Section 1a(2)(i) with a reference to Section 1a(19)(i).&nbsp;&nbsp;But an amendment in a bill introduced in a subsequent Congress (nine years later) sheds no light on what was intended by the Congress that enacted the statutory provision in question &ndash; especially when the referenced bill was not enacted and nothing has happened on it during the ensuing five years.</p>
<p>VI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain Implementation Timeline Provisions in the<span>&nbsp;</span>Proposal are Ill-Advised</p>
<p><i>Implementation Timeline:&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>As discussed above, I do not support the proposal to determine that all event contracts involving enumerated activities are contrary to the public interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;But if the Commission decides to do so, I oppose applying that determination to contracts that are already listed for trading as of the date of publication of final rule amendments in the Federal Register.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is my hope that there would be few such contracts.&nbsp;&nbsp;But for any contracts that would be impacted, the Proposal is pollyanaish in its rosy view that &ldquo;a 60-day implementation period for these contracts will minimize any market disruption that might be caused by the rule amendments.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;For one thing, given the Proposal&rsquo;s repeated emphasis (at pages 29, 33, and 54) that its examples of activities that constitute &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; under the proposed definition are non-exclusive, I am dubious that exchanges and traders necessarily will know exactly which existing event contracts the Commission believes are now suddenly prohibited.</p>
<p>Beyond that, this aspect of the Proposal is fundamentally unfair.&nbsp;&nbsp;At any time during the 13 years since its adoption of Rule 40.11, the Commission could have concluded that a given event contract involving an enumerated activity is contrary to the public interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;Exchanges and market participants that have listed and traded an event contract in good faith reliance on the fact that the Commission had not determined the contract to be contrary to the public interest should not pay the price (literally) for the Commission&rsquo;s inaction by having to halt trading in a fixed amount of time because the Commission has finally gotten around to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This would be the antithesis of &ldquo;good government.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, I do not believe that any rule amendments finalized as part of this rulemaking should apply to an event contract that is listed and available for trading as of the date of their publication in the Federal Register.</p>
<p>VII.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Conclusion</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Rather than undertake a rulemaking process to do the hard work of building a framework for evaluating event contracts pursuant to CEA Section 5c(c)(5)(C), the Commission squandered the 14 years since that provision was enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank Act.&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Commission is now proposing an event contract rulemaking, that hard work still has yet to be done.&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, the Commission is skipping right over building a proper framework &ndash; and simply proposing to prohibit contracts outright.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This result seems preordained, given the hostility that the Commission has displayed toward event contracts since the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act.&nbsp;&nbsp;This Proposal rubber-stamps the Commission&rsquo;s two prior Orders finding proposed event contracts to be contrary to the public interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, it continues the &ldquo;tradition&rdquo; of stretching a solitary, cryptic colloquy to form the basis for evaluating whether event contracts are contrary to the public interest through the &ldquo;economic purpose test&rdquo; that:&nbsp;&nbsp;1) is not mentioned in the statute; 2) had previously been withdrawn due to Congress&rsquo; repeal of the CEA provision it implemented; 3) was not designed for this type of contract; and 4) many event contracts, due to their structure, likely will be unable to meet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And now the Proposal goes even further, adopting an overly broad definition of &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; and declaring entire categories of event contracts to be contrary to the public interest, sight unseen.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission&rsquo;s legal authority to make such determinations by category is questionable, at best; that it is inappropriate from a policy perspective cannot reasonably be questioned.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Proposal flatly contravenes Congress&rsquo; direction in the CEA that the CFTC &ldquo;promote responsible innovation.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn29">[29]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The unmistakable take-away for exchanges is not to expend resources developing an innovative event contract because the Commission will go to great lengths to find that it is contrary to the public interest and prohibit it from trading.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/mersingerstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn30">[30]</a></p>
<p>I want to be very clear:&nbsp;&nbsp;My dissent should not be taken as an endorsement of the wisdom of event contracts generally, or of any event contract in particular.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather, it reflects my application of Congress&rsquo; direction to the Commission in CEA Section 5c(c)(5)(C).&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever we may think of event contracts, we cannot re-write the CEA to claim an authority that Congress did not give us because we have been derelict in applying the authority that Congress did give us.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor should we be prohibiting an event contract without a proper showing that it involves an enumerated activity and is contrary to the public interest based on the application of well-defined factors to the particular terms and conditions of that particular contract.</p>
<p>Because this wolf in sheep&rsquo;s clothing fails on many levels for the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>

<title>SEC Charges Pennsylvania Resident With Insider Trading In Dick’s Sporting Goods Securities</title>

<div> charged, insider trading, Dick's Sporting Goods, misappropriating, nonpublic information
<br />
Poerio charged with insider trading for misappropriating nonpublic info about Dick's Sporting Goods, making illegal profits. SEC and US Attorney's Office took action.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Gibsonia, PA resident Frank T. Poerio, Jr. with insider trading for misappropriating material, nonpublic information concerning Dick&rsquo;s Sporting Goods Inc. and trading on that information, realizing illegal profits of more than $800,000.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, between November 2019 and May 2021, Poerio knew a Dick&rsquo;s employee who had access to multiple internal sources of material nonpublic information about the company&rsquo;s financial results. The SEC alleges that Poerio frequently asked the employee for updates on the company&rsquo;s performance, and, at times, the employee responded with statements to the effect that the company was &ldquo;doing very well,&rdquo; coupled with requests that Poerio not trade in Dick&rsquo;s securities. The SEC alleges that Poerio understood that these statements were based on the employee&rsquo;s access to nonpublic financial information and previews of the company&rsquo;s upcoming quarterly revenue figures. Poerio used this information to trade in Dick&rsquo;s securities, in breach of his duty of trust and confidence to the employee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We allege that Poerio exploited the trust of someone close to him by pumping that person for information and then ignoring his repeated requests not to trade on that information,&rdquo; said Mark Cave, Associate Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s charges showcase the SEC&rsquo;s ability to detect and charge those who seek to profit off insider trading.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, charges Poerio with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without denying the allegations of the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Poerio agreed to a settlement that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil money penalty in amounts to be determined by the Court. The settlement is subject to the Court&rsquo;s approval.</p>
<p>In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania today announced criminal charges against Poerio.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Jason Litow, with assistance from Brian Shute, Max Clarke, Steve Rapkin, Derek Bentsen, and James Carlson, under the supervision of Kevin Guerrero, Stacy Bogert, and Mr. Cave. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania and the FBI.</p>

<div> Education, dedication, teamwork, humility, gratitude
Summary: Strive for continuous learning, work hard, collaborate, stay resilient, be humble, express gratitude. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>Congratulations, Class of 2024! Let me also congratulate your families, friends, teachers, mentors, and everyone else who believed in you and supported you on the path that brought you here today. Thank you, President Burwell, Provost Wilkins, and Dean Jacknowitz.</p>
<p>Before I came to the Federal Reserve, I led the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan for five years, so I am used to addressing public policy graduates in May, wearing a robe, and praying it won't rain for the afterparty. Or in Michigan, hail! It is an honor to be able to join in this celebration of you completing your studies and entering a new and exciting stage of your lives. This is particularly special to me, as later in life my mom went back to school at American University (AU) to earn her master's in education. Today, May 10, would have been her birthday&mdash;so I can celebrate your path forward and honor her memory.</p>
<p>I had a chance to speak with a few of your classmates last week, and they gave me a window into the passion and commitment that you bring to your work. It is easy right now for some to look at the world and be cynical about the possibility of making it a better place. But in so many ways, the world is a much better place than it was 50 or 100 years ago, in large part thanks to people like you who've gone into public policy. In my personal experience, I've seen many things get better over the course of my professional lifetime. I can see it now in the work that we do at the Federal Reserve. And most importantly, I can see it in each of you.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it's easy to look at the government or a large corporation or even the nonprofit sector and see some large, distant kind of entity. But the government is made up of individual human beings. You, your friends and your colleagues, your predecessors here at AU, and the people who will come after you. Those individuals make a big difference.</p>
<p>And that's true the moment you leave school. Early on, for example, I worked as a special assistant for Bob Rubin when he was the Secretary of the Treasury. And one of the first things I noticed when he hosted a meeting was that he didn't involve just the top people in the Treasury Department. He included the people who were closer to the issue, such as a research assistant or junior analyst. And he would ask them questions and engage them, and he cared what they thought about the issue. While they didn't necessarily have the same judgment or context as more senior people, they had a lot of knowledge and analytic chops and sometimes a new way of thinking about a problem.</p>
<p>And I've carried that approach to my job today. Many of the people in my meetings at the Federal Reserve are quite junior in the organization, but they speak up in a way that can change how I think about a problem. Please know that you can make a difference as a very junior person and in a very large organization.</p>
<p>Even if today marks the conclusion of your time in the classroom, it isn't the end of your education. The best career advice that I can offer is also the best advice for a happy life&mdash;whatever you do, try to put yourself in a position where you are always learning, every day. This is something my father&mdash;a labor lawyer by day and a poet by night&mdash;tried to live by. Seeking out a role where you are learning every day will guide you to work that stimulates and motivates you, making you a more knowledgeable and hopefully wiser person, even when the lessons imparted are hard ones. As they often are.</p>
<p>This striving to always be learning has guided me to fulfilling work and it has told me, at times, when I needed to take a risk and put myself out there. I was not anyone's first choice for the job I have now, or the job leading the Ford School, or running point on financial reform at Treasury. But I did all of those things. As you will in your lives, when opportunities come along that you never expected.</p>
<p>When I was graduating, I had no idea what I would eventually do in life. And that was scary. That is okay. That is normal. You don't need to know what you want to do for the rest of your life. None of us older people know that either. We're figuring it out as we go.</p>
<p>I've just mentioned one of the ingredients to doing your best&mdash;learning every day and being open to new opportunities even if they are scary&mdash;but another more obvious one is effort. It has become more common nowadays to recognize the costs of working too hard, and that is a good thing. But I hope that this emphasis on work-life balance does not deprive you of the satisfaction, and sometimes, joy, that can come from working incredibly hard toward a goal that you find meaningful. Most things worth doing in life are hard.</p>
<p>And if you do want to get anything done in the world, you need a team. There's a Michigan saying: "the team, the team, the team," and it's a good one. You can't do things alone. Certainly, the work that I have found most impactful, whether intellectually or to the world, has been with other people. The work I'm proudest of, as an academic, is work that I did with a psychologist and an economist on behaviorally informed financial regulation. In the process, we changed the way each of us thought about crucial questions we were considering. What an amazing gift to be able to do that with colleagues.</p>
<p>Along with working hard to achieve your goals, being open to new opportunities, and working as a team, I think it is also important to be tough. Partly, this means being resilient because life is not a continuous march to the top. I've failed many times. There will be criticism and setbacks, and it is how you respond, constructively, to those developments that will matter much more than the progress you make when things are going great. I use the word "tough" because, more than just resilience, sometimes it will be necessary for you to be tough with others. Sometimes you will have to tell colleagues, or even bosses, that they are wrong. Sometimes, you'll have to decide whether to take a stand.</p>
<p>And sometimes being tough requires you to be tough with yourself. When you are in jobs like mine, things go wrong all the time. And it's important to understand that when things go wrong, it is your responsibility. It's not somebody on your team's fault. Your team is giving you the best inputs they can. So having the ability to not point a finger at other people, and to point it at yourself, and understand that you are accountable and responsible, is an important part of being a leader.</p>
<p>Being tough doesn't mean being hard or insensitive. One can be resilient, make tough decisions, and stand up to pressure in ways that treat people with respect&mdash;the kind of respect that you hope others will show you. One of the primary ways that we show respect for others is to listen. If you are always learning, that means you are always listening, taking on board what you hear from others, even if it is very unwelcome, and perhaps, adjusting your views and gaining knowledge from that input. And it means talking in a way that others can hear.</p>
<p>One can make tough decisions and hold people to high standards while treating others well. Treating others well, for me, boils down to a simple rule&mdash;don't be a jerk. All of us have had enough experiences with others acting like jerks to understand this advice, but it's a bit harder when applied to yourself. At least for me it is.</p>
<p>Humility is an attribute that I consider essential to avoid being a jerk. Life often gives one the opportunity to learn and relearn the lesson of humility&mdash;and I am humbled every day. Humility is recognizing the limits of knowledge, confidence, and self-regard. It is the line between what we truly know and understand, and what we don't really know and cannot grasp.</p>
<p>Humility means being open to new information, to weighing information in an objective way, and being able to take on that input and sometimes change one's mind. In a practical way, it means being open to and seriously considering the views of others, and in that sense, it is often a vital way to connect with other people.</p>
<p>Let me leave you today with two words, the most important two words that you will ever know, or ever say. Those words are "thank you." "Thank you" means the recognition that someone has done something valuable for you. Gratitude binds us together. So please turn to your parents, your partners, your friends and other family, your teachers and mentors, your fellow students, and say, thank you.</p>
<p>Congratulations, Class of 2024, and thank you, for listening to me today.</p>

<div> Securities and Exchange Commission, economics, economic analysis, market resiliency, AI<br />
<br />
Summary: Securities and Exchange Commission Commissioner emphasizes the importance of economic analysis, clear communication, and pursuit of excellence in regulatory work. <div>
<p>Thank you, Vlad [Ivanov], for that introduction. To Jessica Wachter: thank you for your leadership as Director of the Commission&rsquo;s Division of Economic and Risk Analysis (&ldquo;DERA&rdquo;), and for inviting me to deliver these remarks today<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/lizarraga-remarks-conference-financial-market-regulation-051024#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>To DERA staff, Lehigh University&rsquo;s Center for Financial Services, and the University of Maryland&rsquo;s Center for Financial Policy: thank you for organizing this informative event.</p>
<p>It is a pleasure to be here in a room full of economists, whose contributions are so vital to the Commission&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>My 10-year-old daughter recently asked me a very basic but important question: what is economics? In the moment, the best response I could muster was that it&rsquo;s a social science focused on the study of markets.</p>
<p>It was a simple &ndash; many of you here might say simplistic &ndash; answer, but it seemed to satisfy her curiosity. The question made me reflect about one of the key challenges we face every day here at the Commission: how can we best communicate the value and relevance of our work to the public, in the most user-friendly way possible?</p>
<p>It is a theme that I&rsquo;ll return to later in my remarks. But I hope that you, too, will reflect on this in the context of your own discussions today and in your future work. In my mind, it is part of the pursuit of excellence that is central to our success.</p>
<p>Let me return to my basic definition of &ldquo;economics.&rdquo; Of course, it doesn&rsquo;t do justice to the wide scope of areas that you, as economists, study or the research you will discuss here today &ndash; on market microstructure, corporate finance, financial intermediaries, or asset management.</p>
<p>Economic analysis plays an essential role in the Commission&rsquo;s work &ndash; whether in rulemaking, or in calculating disgorgement or distributions to harmed investors in enforcement actions. Or in any other areas where expertise in economics contributes to fulfilling our mission.</p>
<p>In rulemaking, it serves the essential purpose of providing the public and all market participants with impartial analysis of a new or updated Commission rule, including its costs and benefits.</p>
<p>It allows the Commission to compare a proposed rulemaking against other reasonable alternatives.</p>
<p>It helps us describe the economic baseline as it exists today in the specific space affected by the rule, and how that baseline might change once the rule is implemented.</p>
<p>It provides a framework for understanding how a rulemaking addresses a specific problem or deficiency, and the rule&rsquo;s impact on affected stakeholders and our capital markets.</p>
<p>During my time here, the Commission has proposed and adopted a range of reforms aimed at strengthening market resiliency and investor protection. These rules depend, in no small part, on high quality economic analysis. That said, there&rsquo;s always room for improvement in all that we do.</p>
<p>The extensive knowledge and innovative ideas that experts like you bring to the table can benefit the Commission&rsquo;s approach to economic analysis. So, as you engage in your discussions today, I offer you a few thoughts for your consideration.</p>
<p>First, it is important to bear in mind that the investor base in our capital markets is diverse.</p>
<p>Retail investors are a significant segment of our capital markets &ndash; in the neighborhood of 150 million. These investors, who aspire to build wealth for themselves and their families, have varying levels of financial sophistication and investment horizons. They may process market information, or react to transaction costs, in ways that differ significantly from institutional investors.</p>
<p>Younger investors may prefer online trading platforms or robo-advisers. These younger investors may have higher risk tolerances compared to investors in other age groups, who may prefer to interact with our markets in more traditional ways.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurs in underserved or minority communities, or in rural areas, may encounter unique structural barriers when it comes to accessing investment capital.</p>
<p>In short, in the context of their own unique circumstances, all investors behave differently. Economic analysis that builds in and measures these unique differences where possible can be more useful.</p>
<p>Which leads me to my second point. Use of innovative AI, machine learning, and data analytics, with appropriate guardrails, may be worth exploring if it can yield improved and strengthened economic analysis. And provided it does not in any way undermine our statutory mission or the public interest.</p>
<p>Thankfully, DERA&rsquo;s Office of Data Science is already leading initiatives to develop and support cutting-edge data analytics powered by AI to support multiple functions across the Commission.</p>
<p>A rapidly evolving market landscape offers both challenges and opportunities: the challenge of keeping up, adapting to, and getting ahead of rapid change, but also the opportunity to harness technology and data to strengthen economic analysis and our rulemaking.</p>
<p>A unique challenge we face in economic analysis is quantifying costs and benefits. Generally, costs can be easier to quantify because discrete data from past experience is more readily available. But data on future benefits that might accrue to investors, our capital markets, or the broader economy is more diffuse and harder to come by.</p>
<p>More than three decades ago, my graduate school economics professor, mentor, and thesis adviser, James K. Galbraith, introduced me to the work of Nobel Prize-winning Swedish economist, Gunnar Myrdal. In particular, the principle of circular cumulative causation as applied to the analysis of economic disparities in 1940s Black America.</p>
<p>Myrdal&rsquo;s work in this area was funded by a prominent American foundation. His main researcher was Ralph Bunche, a scholar and diplomat who was awarded the 1950 Nobel Peace Prize &ndash; the first African American Nobel laureate. Their work was so influential that the U.S. Supreme Court cited it in&nbsp;<i>Brown v. Board of Education</i>.</p>
<p>Myrdal&rsquo;s thinking really captivated me. His framework offered a valuable tool to analyze how factors that exacerbate economic disparities can mutually reinforce each other in a vicious cycle that can persist over time. But the framework applied to the solution, too. Policy changes can interrupt the vicious cycle and turn it into a virtuous one, with beneficial multiplier effects.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a compelling logic to this framework. So, as economists, I ask you to consider this: leveraged with data analytics, and innovative AI tools used responsibly, could this framework enhance the quality of our economic analysis?</p>
<p>I see much potential in it to broaden our thinking in this area.</p>
<p>In an age where data analytics can unlock so many new possibilities, the optimist in me believes it can help us improve modeling and estimating of potential benefits. Benefits such as reducing asymmetric information and competitive barriers, fostering greater investor confidence and financial stability, and reducing unnecessary or excessive risk-taking.</p>
<p>Let me now return to what I raised at the outset: the imperative of clear and understandable communication with the public.</p>
<p>One-year ago this week, I had the special privilege of delivering a commencement address at my alma mater, the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas, Austin.</p>
<p>I urged the graduates to strive for clear and effective communication with the public. As policy professionals, articulating how their work benefits the public is essential for public support of their mission.</p>
<p>As researchers, your work can contribute so much to the effective fulfillment of our mission. But to maximize its impact, a non-technical audience should be able to understand it. I cannot emphasize this enough.</p>
<p>Yes, our work is necessarily technical and complex, but nothing that we do here should be out of reach to the public. If we fail to meet this most basic of tests, we are also failing the public that we have a duty to serve and whose interests we must protect above all others.</p>
<p>To me, this is a vital element in the pursuit of excellence.</p>
<p>We serve the public most effectively when the Commission&rsquo;s valuable work to protect our markets and investors meets the highest standards of excellence.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll close with a story about why the pursuit of excellence matters so much. It involves soccer, a sport that I follow closely and love.</p>
<p>Pep Guardiola, the Catalan manager of Manchester City Football Club, is probably the greatest football manager of all time. By any measure.</p>
<p>The most coveted achievement in European football is winning the Continental Treble in a single season, a feat that only eight clubs in Europe have achieved. Guardiola is the only manager to have won it twice, with two different clubs. In the last 14 seasons, he has won 11 league titles. And he&rsquo;s on the verge of leading his team to a fourth consecutive English Premier League title.</p>
<p>A documentary that has been running on one of the streaming services offers a glimpse into Guardiola&rsquo;s commitment to the pursuit of excellence. His players enter the locker room at half-time, giddy because they&rsquo;ve scored four goals against their cross-town rivals, Manchester United. But Guardiola tells his players: &ldquo;4-0. I cannot say it&rsquo;s bad, but it&rsquo;s not perfect&hellip;You were brilliant, but I push you to be more perfect&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lesson I draw from this vignette that applies to our work is that even in our peak moments we must not &ndash; and cannot &ndash; lose sight of the pursuit of excellence.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and for joining us here today. Best wishes to all of you in your upcoming discussions.</p>

<title>Statement Of CFTC Commissioner Caroline D. Pham: The CFTC Needs To Get Serious. A Strategic Plan For Reform</title>

<div> commodity futures trading commission, jurisdiction, expansion, GAO study, accountability
Summary:<br /><br />Commissioner Pham voices concern about CFTC's lack of procedures, judicial opinions, and enforcement. Urges for a GAO study and implementing reforms for effectiveness. <div>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Today, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) will take yet another step down a misguided path that encroaches so far onto States&rsquo; rights that it makes a mockery of the Tenth Amendment. &nbsp;It pains me to say that despite the road here being paved with good intentions, today&rsquo;s event contracts rulemaking is yet another example of how far the Commission has strayed from the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act and the Constitution, and how little the Commission seems to care for fairness and due process under the law.&nbsp; I have repeatedly raised troubling concerns that the breakdown of the Commission&rsquo;s internal procedures and processes I have observed in the past two years severely compromises the Commission&rsquo;s ability to fulfill our mission and statutory mandate set forth in the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), faithfully serve the public interest, and treat market participants fairly.&nbsp; That is why, before the Commission is granted or usurps any additional jurisdiction over products or asset classes, I believe that a Government Accountability Office (GAO) study is necessary of the Commission&rsquo;s procedures for rulemaking, examinations and compliance reviews, investigations and enforcement, adjudicatory proceedings, due process protections, and compliance with the CEA, APA, Good Accounting Obligation in Government Act, Government Management Reform Act of 1994, Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) Modernization Act of 2010, and other laws and requirements applicable to administrative agencies.&nbsp; A GAO study and recommendations for improvement will ensure that the Commission has the internal operations, structure, technology, expertise, personnel, and funding to be effective in our oversight of commodity derivatives markets.&nbsp; The Commission must be able to walk in a straight line before we run headlong into any expansion of jurisdiction.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>As Commissioners, it&rsquo;s our duty to ensure adequate governance of the CFTC. &nbsp;We must support our talented staff with the tools, training, and resources to be successful, and ensure that we are sticking to our mission, our authority, and our own rules. &nbsp;And it&rsquo;s our duty to take appropriate corrective action if we ever lose sight of those principles. &nbsp;The Commission must uphold the highest standards of integrity, diligence, and excellence to maintain the public&rsquo;s trust in the CFTC&rsquo;s ability to oversee our markets with fairness and in service to justice.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp; Unfortunately, in the last two years, there has been a disturbing number of judicial opinions and public reports that the Commission is failing to meet those standards.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp; This is a challenging time for all of us, and I thank Chairman Behnam for his leadership through it.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Identifying and Reporting the CFTC&rsquo;s Issues</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Six months into my term as a Commissioner, I gave a speech to leaders and practitioners in compliance and enforcement on the well-known maxim, &ldquo;If you see something, say something.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp; In my career as a senior Compliance officer in the private sector overseeing billion-dollar compliance programs, my job was to implement policies and procedures, controls, monitoring, testing, and assessment to achieve compliance with laws and regulations to ensure safety and soundness of the bank and market integrity and conduct. &nbsp;These efforts included processes to identify, escalate, and report issues, and ensure remediation and self-reporting to authorities as appropriate.&nbsp; These responsibilities might not always be popular&mdash;as anyone familiar with Compliance and Internal Audit are aware&mdash;but they&rsquo;re absolutely necessary. &nbsp;Not only did they keep the firm out of trouble, but they promoted trust with our regulators and clients and upheld the firm&rsquo;s reputation.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>As a public company, nothing less than the highest standard is owed to investors and other stakeholders. &nbsp;Well, the CFTC is a public institution, and I believe the Commission owes the American taxpayer that same high standard.&nbsp; At my last job, if I discovered the kind of issues that I&rsquo;ve seen here at the CFTC, I would escalate and report those issues so they could be fixed.&nbsp; Now that I&rsquo;m a Commissioner, it&rsquo;s still my job to say something if I see something wrong. And it&rsquo;s what the CFTC expects of its registrants.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>In the government, the public trust is paramount. &nbsp;Failing to adhere to the law and principles of fairness that are essential to U.S. democracy not only causes us to fail at our mission, but it ultimately hurts the Commission and its dedicated public servants.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve seen a recent cautionary tale at one of our sister agencies that resulted in the resignation of two members of staff.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s important that the Commission is proactive now and takes stock of our own approaches to rulemaking, enforcement, and other administrative actions, that we acknowledge our issues, and that we get help when we need it.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>I have consistently raised concerns both internally and publicly about the CFTC&rsquo;s lack of procedures,</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;improper expansion of jurisdiction,</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;incorrect application of the law,</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;increased delegation of authority,</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;dubious enforcement actions and unfair adjudicatory proceedings,</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;failure to comply with the APA,</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;and general disregard for due process.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span><span><span>Over the past several years, a concerning number of CFTC complaints filed in litigation in federal court have been dismissed for failure to state a claim (insufficient facts to support a charge or incorrect as a matter of law) or on summary judgment (incorrect as a matter of law), or overturned in appellate court, meaning that the CFTC does not understand and is wrong about the application of our&nbsp;<i>own</i>&nbsp;statute and our&nbsp;<i>own</i>&nbsp;regulations.</span></span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a><span><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am deeply disturbed that just a few weeks ago, a federal judge has called the CFTC&rsquo;s recent actions in another litigation matter &ldquo;troubling at best&rdquo; and ordered a hearing on sanctions against the CFTC for an alleged &ldquo;pattern of misconduct&rdquo; that includes knowingly submitting false statements to the court and attempting to intrude on attorney-client privilege.</span></span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a><span><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp; This is cause for alarm and the Commission must address this crisis.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The Commission&rsquo;s recent history with event contracts is another example of the CFTC&rsquo;s issues.</span></span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a><span><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp; The CFTC is currently a defendant in two litigation matters relating to event contracts that allege that the CFTC violated the Administrative Procedure Act, due process, and other Constitutional rights.&nbsp; In one of the lawsuits, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has called the CFTC the &ldquo;epitome of arbitrary and capricious,&rdquo; and found that the CFTC violated the Fifth Circuit&rsquo;s injunction.&nbsp; U.S. Senators and Members of Congress have sent letters to the Commission to express their concerns with the CFTC&rsquo;s conduct of the event contracts rulemaking.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>My concerns are informed by my decades of experience in both the public and private sectors.&nbsp; Not only did I have the privilege of serving at the CFTC between 2009 and 2014 during the response to the 2008 financial crisis, but I have also served at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC).&nbsp; I know the standards that the CFTC used to meet, and the standards expected at the SEC and the OCC, two of the preeminent U.S. financial regulators that are much larger and older than the CFTC.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>I&rsquo;ve had to use my voice not only because it&rsquo;s my job as a Commissioner, but out of true devotion to an agency that I have loved and cared about so much that I&rsquo;m back for the fourth time.&nbsp; The CFTC is where I started my career, and I believe deeply in our mission and our people.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>&nbsp;<span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;Like a mom who will always hold her kids to a high bar and push them to reach their potential, I want to see us all succeed.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp; That means not being afraid to look inward, seek guidance, and be honest with ourselves about our missteps. &nbsp;The most important leadership lessons I&rsquo;ve learned is to never be complacent, have a growth mindset, embrace diverse viewpoints, and focus on continuous improvement.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>GAO Study and Implementing Reforms to Ensure the CFTC&rsquo;s Effectiveness</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Sometimes fresh eyes are warranted, and that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m calling for a GAO study and recommendations.&nbsp; And, I&rsquo;m also calling for the Commission to adopt review and accountability measures to regularly assess the CFTC&rsquo;s effectiveness and identify areas of improvement. &nbsp;Absent these forward looking and proactive measures, I fear that the Commission will continue to lack the procedures and controls needed to be effective at our mission, making the CFTC susceptible to failure to protect our markets and the public.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>If this sounds like a surprising request, consider this: Subtitle F&mdash;Improvements to the Management of the Securities and Exchange Commission of the Investor Protection and Securities Reform Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act Title IX) required the SEC, which has existed nearly twice as long as the CFTC and has six times the amount of budget and employees, to hire an independent consultant to perform an organizational study and review of the SEC&rsquo;s internal operations, structure, funding, and the need for comprehensive reform, and for the SEC to report to Congress on the progress of its implementation of the consultant&rsquo;s organizational reform recommendations.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dodd-Frank also requires the SEC to submit annual reports and certifications to Congress with an assessment of the effectiveness of the SEC&rsquo;s internal supervisory controls and procedures applicable to staff performing examinations, enforcement investigations, and reviews of corporate financial securities filings,</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;and for the GAO to conduct regular reviews of the adequacy and effectiveness of the SEC&rsquo;s internal supervisory control structure and procedures. &nbsp;And, Dodd-Frank requires the GAO to regularly review and report to Congress on the quality of the SEC&rsquo;s personnel management, including effectiveness of supervisors, promotion criteria and fairness, competence of the professional staff, efficiency of communication between divisions and offices, staff turnover, excessive numbers of managers, initiatives to increase the competence of the staff, performance improvement and termination, and recommendations to use staff more effectively and efficiently to carry out the SEC&rsquo;s mission.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>At that time back in 2010, the SEC not only had greatly expanded jurisdiction over new products and categories of registrants, but was facing new challenges in securities markets from technological developments like high-frequency algorithmic trading.&nbsp; These Dodd-Frank studies, reviews, and reports were a sensible way to ensure the SEC would be well prepared to take on its new oversight responsibilities.&nbsp; The CFTC also had greatly expanded jurisdiction over new products and categories of registrants, including the swaps market and systemically important financial institutions, and the CFTC faced similar challenges from technological developments. &nbsp;But there was no similar Dodd-Frank mandate to improve management at the CFTC.&nbsp; Now in the present day, the CFTC may potentially have its jurisdiction expanded again, and is facing a new wave of technological developments like crypto assets and generative artificial intelligence (AI).&nbsp; It&rsquo;s time for the CFTC to finally have the benefit of comprehensive studies and recommendations to make sure we are prepared and able to carry out our mission.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>These accountability measures are not only standard practice for management at any organization and common sense, but they have already been proven at our peer agencies. &nbsp;I think we&rsquo;d all agree that the CFTC&rsquo;s mission is no less critical. Shouldn&rsquo;t we be just as accountable?</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>In addition, a GAO study would provide a roadmap for implementation of reforms. &nbsp;I have made a number of proposals to improve the CFTC&rsquo;s effectiveness to better serve the American people. &nbsp;These proposals have ranged from preserving our institutional knowledge by establishing a CFTC Historical Society,</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;to enhancing retail protection by establishing an Office of the Retail Advocate and considering a new registration category for direct clearing retail derivatives clearing organizations (DCO),</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;to promoting responsible innovation through market pilot programs, to creating executive champions for our employee resource groups, to launching leadership skills and professional development initiatives, to a transformation of the agency across five pillars: governance, culture, talent, operations, and excellence.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Most urgently, I have proposed that the Commission establish a CFTC examination program for systemically important swap dealers because the CFTC is an outlier and the only regulator in the world who directly oversees global systemically important banks (G-SIB) and lacks such an examination program to protect financial stability and mitigate systemic risk.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Demanding the CFTC&rsquo;s Accountability</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Government accountability is the cornerstone of the U.S. system of federalism and individual liberty.&nbsp; As public servants sworn to uphold the Constitution, we should embrace the opportunity to improve.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Nobody, and no regulator, gets it right all the time.&nbsp; This obvious fact is a good thing&mdash;it creates opportunities to address challenges, fix problems, and build for the future.&nbsp; Change is hard, and transformation is even harder.&nbsp; But as someone whose career has been to drive change and transformation, I know it&rsquo;s worth it.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Some of my statements and staff questions as a Commissioner haven&rsquo;t always been popular. &nbsp;Speaking truth can be uncomfortable to hear, but that&rsquo;s essential to governance and oversight to ensure accountability.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s been my job as a Compliance officer, and that&rsquo;s my job as a Commissioner.&nbsp; My objective has always been for the Commission to excel at its mission to promote market integrity, and to avoid embarrassment and the degradation of our reputation as a leading regulator. &nbsp;I believe at this point, a third-party review could help us get back to the basics and on track to do what we do best.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Thank you.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h4>Payment landscape in Europe</h4>
<div class="dombanner"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Declining use of cash: the proportion of cash payments fell from 72% to 59% (2019-2022); number of banknotes in circulation decreased for the first time in 2023.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Fragmentation: there is no single European payment solution for digital payments at the point of sale anywhere in the euro area.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Dependence on international providers: 13 out of 20 euro area countries don&rsquo;t have a national card scheme and rely instead on international schemes for digital payments. These schemes account for 64% of all electronically-initiated transactions with cards issued in the euro area.</li>
</ul>

<title>Statement Of CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam Regarding Proposed Event Contracts Rulemaking</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/statement-of-cftc-chairman-rostin-behnam-regarding-proposed-event-contracts-rule/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Proposed amendments, event contracts, CFTC, regulations, public interest<br />
Summary:<br />
Proposed amendments to CFTC rules on event contracts aim to clarify and restrict certain types of contracts to protect market integrity.<br /> <div>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>I support the proposed amendments to the Commission&rsquo;s rules concerning event contracts.&nbsp; Before further discussion, I would like to acknowledge the tremendous work by many CFTC colleagues.&nbsp; I particularly would like to thank Vince McGonagle, Nora Flood, and Grey Tanzi for all of their thorough and thoughtful work on the proposal.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Starting in 2021, there has been a significant uptick in the number of event contracts listed for trading by CFTC-registered exchanges.&nbsp; To put that increase into perspective, more event contracts were listed for trading in 2021 than had been listed in the prior 15 years combined.&nbsp; And that has continued to be true each year since.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Given this exponential increase, the Commission today proposes to further specify the types of event contracts that fall within the scope of CEA section 5c(c)(5)(C) and are contrary to the public interest.&nbsp; The amendments will support efforts by registered entities to comply with the CEA by more clearly identifying the types of event contracts that may not be listed for trading or accepted for clearing.&nbsp; These changes will support responsible and efficient market innovation, by helping registered entities and new applicants to make informed decisions with respect to product design.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Specifically, the Commission is proposing to amend&nbsp;</span></span><span>Commission Regulation<span>&nbsp;40.11 to, among other things, further specify types of event contracts that fall within the scope of CEA section 5c(c)(5)(C) and are contrary to the public interest, such that they may not be listed for trading or accepted for clearing on or through a registered entity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The proposal defines &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; and provides illustrative examples of gaming, including the outcome of a political contest, the outcome of an awards contest, the outcome of a game in which one or more athletes compete, or an occurrence or non-occurrence in connection with such a contest or game.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The proposal includes a determination that event contracts involving each of the Enumerated Activities in CEA section 5c(c)(5)(C) (gaming, war, terrorism, assassination, and activity that is unlawful under state law) are, as a category, contrary to the public interest and therefore may not be listed for trading or accepted for clearing through a registered entity.&nbsp; The illustrative examples of gaming that I just mentioned are therefore contrary to the public interest and cannot be listed for trading.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>To be clear, that means that even contracts on the outcome of a political contest such as an election could not be listed for trading or accepted for clearing under the proposed rule.&nbsp; Such contracts not only fail to serve the economic purpose of the futures markets&mdash;they are illegal in several states and could potentially and impermissibly preempt State responsibilities for overseeing federal elections.&nbsp; This is not a new phenomenon for the CFTC. Over the course of the last 20 years, the CFTC has remained steadfast&mdash;through many administrations&mdash;that election or political contracts should not be allowed on the US futures and options markets.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Contracts involving political events ultimately commoditize and degrade the integrity of the uniquely American experience of participating in the democratic electoral process. &nbsp;Allowing these contracts would push the CFTC, a financial market regulator, into a position far beyond its Congressional mandate and expertise.&nbsp; To be blunt, such contracts would put the CFTC in the role of an election cop.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The CFTC&rsquo;s jurisdiction as mandated by Congress and solidified in our statute, the Commodity Exchange Act, recognizes our expertise in markets for goods, services, rights, and interests&mdash;which can include events associated with financial, commercial, or economic consequences.&nbsp; We are tasked with upholding the public interest by ensuring that America&rsquo;s derivatives markets provide a means for managing and assuming price risks and providing for price discovery through liquid, fair, open, transparent, and financially secure trading facilities.&nbsp; Market integrity is featured so prominently within that mandate that the CFTC has civil enforcement authority when it comes to the potential for fraud, manipulation, and other abuses such as the dissemination of false information in the underlying or commodity cash markets.&nbsp; Political control contracts on CFTC-regulated exchanges would push the CFTC far beyond this historical expertise and jurisdiction, and potentially place the CFTC in the position of monitoring such markets for fraud and manipulation in elections themselves.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>I thank the staff for their hard work in producing this important proposal.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<div> Proposed International Ethics Standards for Sustainability Assurance, IOSCO, IESBA, sustainability information, transparency<br />
Summary:<br />
IOSCO congratulates IESBA on publishing Proposed International Ethics Standards for Sustainability Assurance. They aim for global consistency in sustainability-related disclosures. Ethical standards are a prerequisite for credible statements. <div>
<p>IOSCO today congratulated the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA) on achieving an important milestone by publishing for consultation their Proposed International Ethics Standards for Sustainability Assurance (IESSA) and Other Revisions to the Code Relating to Sustainability Assurance and Reporting (the Paper).</p>
<p>IOSCO also acknowledged IESBA&rsquo;s extensive outreach program conducted during the exposure draft development and during the consultation period.</p>
<p>Based on its review of the Paper and additional stakeholder engagement,&nbsp;<a href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iosco.org%2Flibrary%2Fpubdocs%2Fpdf%2FIOSCOPD765.pdf&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cmailing-lists%40iosco.org%7C82fca3c85d044d4bf65108dc70f6dfe0%7Cbcc6c66cdb3b48328af2cc363a097444%7C0%7C0%7C638509452839571606%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=wN8au3Q3jNz%2Bukh%2BNXgvE9tYEdNoYs6MWrJX%2BIfpKvQ%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank">IOSCO outlined its general observations and its six key priority areas for IESBA&rsquo;s consideration in developing its final standard</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Definition of sustainability information</li>
<li>Scope of International Independence Standards</li>
<li>Non-compliance with laws and regulations</li>
<li>Group Sustainability Assurance engagements</li>
<li>Value Chain</li>
<li>Transparency when reporting on PIEs</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Jean-Paul Servais, Chair of the Board of IOSCO</strong>, commented: &ldquo;I congratulate the IESBA Chair, the IESBA Board, and wider staff for this achievement, and for their excellent cooperation with the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) throughout. IESBA&rsquo;s work towards the development of profession-agnostic ethics and independence standards, combined with standards under development by the IAASB, means we are well placed to deliver a global assurance framework at the start of 2025, in accordance with IOSCO&rsquo;s preferred timetable.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Rodrigo Buenaventura, Chair of the Sustainable Finance Task Force said</strong>: &ldquo;When IOSCO endorsed the inaugural sustainability disclosure standards of the ISSB, we were very clear that having assurance (including ethical) standards in place was a prerequisite for achieving consistently prepared and independently assured sustainability disclosures by issuers of securities across the globe. Only through independent assurance will we have credible statements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>IOSCO will continue to play a key role in promoting global consistency in the assurance of sustainability-related disclosures by market issuers and support its members and other stakeholders as they work to enhance trust in corporate sustainability-related reporting.</p>

<title>Taheer Sardar Convicted For Providing A Forged Document To UK Financial Conduct Authority Investigators In A £1.3m Boiler Room Fraud Investigation</title>

<div> sentenced, perverting, FCA, fraud, forged<br />
Summary: Taheer Sardar sentenced to 18 months for perverting course of justice with forged document in FCA's investigation of fraud. <div>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>Taheer Sardar has today been sentenced to 18 months&rsquo; imprisonment for perverting the course of justice at Southwark Crown Court. Mr Sardar pleaded guilty on 7 May 2024.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>Mr Sardar was interviewed by the FCA as part of an investigation it was conducting into a sophisticated boiler room scam that had defrauded 120 investors of &pound;1.3m. Three individuals, Mr Mirza, Mr Solaja and Mr Vickers were subsequently convicted and sentenced to 23 years for that fraud following prosecution by the FCA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In his interview, Mr Sardar, acting with Mr Mirza, provided a forged document, which he claimed had been signed by 'Mohammed Khan'. Mr Sardar sought to use the document to bolster a defence raised by Raheel Mirza and Opeyemi Solaja, who had claimed &ndash; without evidence &ndash; that someone named 'Mohammed Khan' was the architect of the fraud they had been involved in.</p>
<p>The FCA did not find that Mr Sardar was involved in the fraud itself, but he provided the document in order to mislead the FCA. &nbsp;</p>
<p><span>At Mr Sardar&rsquo;s sentencing on 10 May 2024, the Judge, Mr Recorder Gavaghan, remarked that</span>:</p>
<p>'This was a sophisticated attempt using a forged document to undermine the course of justice&hellip;[it was] a very serious offence that strikes at the very core of the legal system.'&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Steve Smart, joint Executive Director, Enforcement and Market Oversight at the FCA, said</span>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>'Mr Sardar&rsquo;s conviction and sentence, is a strong warning to anyone who may be tempted to try to help others escape justice- there is no stone we will leave unturned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>'Perverting the course of justice is a serious offence, and the FCA will not hesitate to take action when it identifies this has taken place.'</p>
<h3>Background</h3>

<div> Financial stability, bank supervision, regulation, monetary policy, risk monitoring <br />
Summary: Financial stability is promoted through effective bank supervision, calibrated regulation to mitigate risks, and considering unintended consequences. Monetary policy impacts must also be addressed. <div>
<p>I would like to thank the Texas Bankers Association for the invitation to share my thoughts with you at this year's Annual Meeting.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240510a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;My remarks today focus on financial stability and the role of banking regulators in promoting financial stability and resiliency in the financial system.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240510a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;I will also describe principles that are complementary to promoting safety and soundness&mdash;to help inform the regulatory and supervisory agenda.</p>
<p>Of course, it would be difficult to provide an exhaustive list of the financial stability risks facing the financial system in the time we are together today. So, while I will highlight a few key risks, one must approach this topic with humility, acknowledging that there are limits to a regulator's ability to anticipate every possible financial stability risk in a dynamic and increasingly interconnected world.</p>
<p>Financial stability is an important function of the Federal Reserve. Our financial stability function is supported through appropriate monetary policy, bank supervision and regulation, and by monitoring risks in the U.S. and abroad. A stable financial system provides a solid foundation for a healthy banking system and a growing economy that facilitates maximum employment and stable prices. The Fed's recently published&nbsp;<em>Financial Stability Report</em>&nbsp;discusses financial stability risks in terms of interactions between shocks and vulnerabilities. A financial stability shock is an adverse event or series of events that often occur without warning and severely affect the financial system. A financial stability vulnerability includes a specific characteristic of, or activity conducted in, the financial system that can increase the severity of a stress event when a shock occurs.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240510a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;Since shocks are difficult to predict, the Federal Reserve's monitoring efforts primarily focus on vulnerabilities and the buildup of risks that can accrue over time potentially affecting the resiliency of the financial system.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<em>Financial Stability Report</em>&nbsp;is worth a read. And while I will not recite the many findings of that report today, I will highlight a few of the risks discussed in the report. It is important to keep in mind that the report provides only a snapshot of the current financial stability vulnerabilities and risks. Because the report treats cyberattacks and geopolitical events as shocks, it touches on them only in a cursory way, even though these are important financial stability risks. Instead, the report focuses on key vulnerabilities that are more easily monitored and provides insights into the financial stability outlook as it relates to these factors.</p>
<p>While the framing of the&nbsp;<em>Financial Stability Report</em>&mdash;in terms of shocks and vulnerabilities&mdash;can be a useful, structured approach to consider this topic, there are many ways to think about financial stability. Often the boundary between shocks and vulnerabilities is a permeable one, and the buildup of risk can become so severe that it becomes a shock. The Federal Reserve plays an important&mdash;but limited and non-exclusive&mdash;role in proactively addressing financial stability risks and responding to them once they manifest as stress across the system.</p>
<p>As I think about the tools we use to address financial stability concerns&mdash;and the tradeoffs we are often forced to make when exercising these powers&mdash;it is helpful to consider the lessons regulators have learned over time. While the end goal is the same&mdash;ensuring resiliency in the financial system to promote financial stability&mdash;there are a number of tools that can be used to address the unique characteristics of vulnerabilities and shocks.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve's financial stability monitoring does not operate in a vacuum. To the contrary, our other statutory authorities&mdash;including monetary policy or promoting safety and soundness in the banking system&mdash;can complement or conflict with the goal of promoting financial stability. Many of these authorities interact with banking activities and institutions that are subject to our supervisory or regulatory authority.</p>
<p>In light of this, I will begin by discussing how the use of traditional tools to support safety and soundness&mdash;both regulation and supervision&mdash;can help promote financial stability. I will then describe the limits of these tools, and then conclude with a brief discussion of some other key financial stability risks.</p>
<p><strong>Financial Stability and the Role of Regulators</strong><br />The Federal Reserve plays an important but limited role in promoting the stability of the financial system through resiliency to shocks, and by proactively addressing vulnerabilities. This responsibility can be complemented and supported, or in some cases weakened through the execution of the Federal Reserve's other responsibilities, including monetary policy or the exercise of our emergency authorities. At times, these objectives may appear to present tension or be in conflict.</p>
<p>For example, the banking stress last year resulted from a number of underlying causes. But it is clear that trends in the interest rate environment when the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) was rapidly tightening policy to combat inflation were an important factor that contributed to Silicon Valley Bank's (SVB's) failure. The Federal Reserve's documented supervisory shortcomings and the lack of SVB management attention to these risks were also key contributors to the firm's failure.</p>
<p>To be sure, the role of monetary policy in the demise of SVB does not excuse SVB's management from its inability to manage the firm's interest rate risk exposures or excuse the ineffective supervisory response that enabled the buildup of the firm's excessive risk. And I am not calling into question the FOMC's monetary policy decisions from that time, which were appropriately focused on our congressionally established mandates of maximum employment and stable prices. Instead, these issues highlight the challenging interrelationships of the various roles and functions of the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>This becomes more complicated when we consider the Federal Reserve's financial stability objectives in the context of its prudential mandates to promote the safe and sound operation of regulated financial institutions. The tools of bank regulation and supervision can promote the safety and soundness of individual financial institutions, but they can also be a positive force when it comes to financial stability. When regulators are successful in their task of ensuring the safe and sound operation of the banking system&mdash;one of the core mandates for banking regulators&mdash;often there is a corresponding benefit to financial stability. Put another way, if the individual parts of the banking system are healthy, this often promotes the health and stability of the broader financial system.</p>
<p>But the goal of promoting bank safety and soundness is narrowly focused within the regulatory perimeter&mdash;and the institutions and activities within our regulatory and supervisory authority. By contrast, financial stability must be concerned with the broader financial system, including the multitude of nonbank institutions that play an important role not only in delivering financial products and services, but also in the broader U.S. economy.</p>
<p>So today, I'd like to share three principles that can help frame a discussion of the role of banking regulators in promoting financial stability:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bank supervision can be an effective and efficient tool to promote financial stability. It is important that supervisors focus on core banking risks.</li>
<li>Where bank regulation may create or exacerbate financial stability risks, we need to take a hard look at whether those risks are justified by the safety-and-soundness benefits of the regulation.</li>
<li>As we evaluate the merits of bank regulation and supervision, we must consider how the Federal Reserve's regulatory proposals affect markets and institutions beyond the bank regulatory perimeter. This will enable us to better understand the potential unintended consequences.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is value in our current approach to addressing financial stability risks. We monitor risks and how they build up or manifest as stress in the financial system. And we react in a way that is informed by that monitoring, either to proactively address the buildup of risk, or to address the consequences of events that could threaten financial stability. A review of past events that presented stability concerns can help us evaluate our existing work and inform the direction of future investments.</p>
<p><strong>Effective Bank Supervision to Promote Financial Stability</strong><br />First, bank supervision can be an effective and efficient tool to promote financial stability. I think it is helpful to consider commercial real estate (CRE) as an example.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240510a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;Commercial real estate continues to be an area of focus for both banks and regulators. Some banks have experienced an increase in CRE loan delinquencies, although delinquency rates generally remain low. As we know, one of the factors that has led to CRE stress in certain property types, like office, is the post-pandemic changes in the demand for, and use of, these CRE properties. Should this trend continue, we could see declines in property values, reduced rental income cash flows, or other conditions that could lead to impairment of some banks' CRE loans or portfolios, especially if those loans mature and are refinanced at higher interest rates. I expect we will continue to see material differences in the performance of CRE across the various types of commercial property and in specific geographic regions. This will be due, in part, to variations in regional return-to-office patterns, and the shifting demand for different types of CRE properties.</p>
<p>So, what can we learn from this CRE experience? First, supervision can be an effective tool to mitigate vulnerabilities, like the increasing credit risk associated with certain kinds of lending. Underwriting standards and loan-to-value ratios have improved significantly since the 2008&ndash;09 financial crisis, and more recently we have seen credit conditions for CRE lending tighten, even as loan demand weakened. I see this as reflecting both better management of these loans and portfolios, and more proactive supervision of material risk.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240510a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;Banks are also well-equipped to work with their CRE borrowers to mitigate stress, including through loan accommodations and workouts.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240510a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;Supervision can be particularly effective at addressing well-known, core banking risks, especially when this supervisory work is conducted effectively and without being distracted by non-core risks.</p>
<p>Despite the promise of supervision as a tool to promote financial stability, supervision can sometimes fail to address the significant buildup of traditional risk. And supervision can be susceptible to being diverted from core risks to issues of less material concern. For example, take the dynamics that led to the failure of SVB. The buildup of interest rate risk in the banking system was a known vulnerability and material risk, not just for SVB, but for all financial institutions. The responsibility for managing this risk fell on the management team at SVB, just as it falls on every bank that has material exposure to interest rate risk. And yet, the failure of SVB created something of a "shock" event within the banking system, one that led to a vigorous response with the creation of the Bank Term Funding Program and invoking the systemic risk exemption to guarantee all depositors of SVB and Signature Bank.</p>
<p>I think it is an oversimplification to point to any one factor as the root cause of the failure of SVB. There were a number of issues that contributed to the firm's ultimate failure. These events included rapid growth, poor risk management, poor public communication, a lack of supervisory attention to core risks, and an insufficiently robust supervisory response to the buildup of interest rate and funding risk. These issues were exacerbated by operational and technological problems with FedWire and discount window lending. The cumulative effect of these issues likely accelerated the firm's failure and increased the scope of the resulting financial harm. But certainly, this is a clear example of where the Federal Reserve's proactive tools&mdash;supervision of risk management, and the operation of liquidity support and payment tools&mdash;could have been much more effective.</p>
<p>Therefore, the virtue of supervision as a proactive measure to support financial stability comes with a cautionary note. Ineffective supervision itself can compound financial stability risks by allowing the buildup of risk without commensurate risk-management measures or supervisory attention. One protective measure that we can take to support effective supervision is to ensure that focus on traditional risks is not lost or diluted. One example of a supervisory and regulatory distraction is from the Fed's recent focus on climate risk. Recently, the Federal Reserve conducted a pilot climate scenario exercise with a subset of the largest U.S. global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) and issued guidance to large institutions on managing climate-related financial risk. This regulatory attention and focus on one specific, non-core risk could reasonably call into question whether regulatory priorities are focused sufficiently on key risks. Firms are already required to manage all material risks, and prioritizing climate risk in this way could lead to the misallocation of risk-management resources.</p>
<p><strong>Regulatory Approaches to Promote Financial Stability</strong><br />Second, where regulation may create or exacerbate financial stability risks, we need to take a close look at whether those risks are justified by the safety and soundness benefits of the regulation.</p>
<p>For example, consider the threat to financial stability resulting from market illiquidity. Liquidity is essential to effective market functioning, and liquidity in the U.S. Treasury market is particularly important due to its critical role in the U.S. and global financial systems.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240510a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;This is an area that, in relative terms, has recently experienced stress events as in the September 2019 repo market stress, and the so-called "dash for cash" in March of 2020. These events raised concerns about the resiliency of U.S. Treasury markets. Even today, some indicators signal low market liquidity through market depth in U.S. Treasury cash markets, which have been at levels below historical norms.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240510a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a></p>
<p>Banks play an important role in providing liquidity, and there are clear signs that liquidity in Treasury markets is low.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240510a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;While there may be a number of reasons for reduced Treasury market liquidity, I would note two specific factors and ongoing risks: (1) concerns by banks about balance sheet capacity to engage in low-margin market activities, and (2) the cumulative regulatory burden on banks when they engage in market-making activities, which includes most recently the proposed increase in capital costs for market making activity proposed by the Basel III endgame rulemaking, and an apparent lack of interest in addressing the constraints on bank activities caused by bank leverage ratios. Ultimately, liquidity in the U.S. Treasury market has the potential to amplify or dampen shocks to the financial system.</p>
<p>Where we can take proactive regulatory measures to ensure that primary dealers have adequate balance sheet capacity to intermediate Treasury markets in times of stress, we should do so. This could include amending the leverage ratio and G-SIB surcharge for the largest U.S. banks. And where we can take into consideration the impact of regulatory reforms on financial stability, we must at least acknowledge the tradeoffs and the potential downside risks that regulatory changes could create. This is particularly important when considering significant increases to capital requirements, especially those of the scale contemplated by the Basel III proposal, including the market risk capital increases.</p>
<p>Adopting regulatory changes to mitigate these concerns may not be sufficient to promote market liquidity, but it would be an important step toward building resiliency in advance of future stress events. In my view, it would be better to fix the roof now, while the sun is shining, by addressing over-calibrated leverage ratio requirements and moderating capital increases for the Basel III proposal.</p>
<p><strong>Unintended Consequences of Overregulation and Disproportionate Supervision</strong><br />Finally, as we evaluate the merit of regulations and supervisory approaches, we must understand the broader implications beyond the regulatory perimeter. We have seen a migration of activity out of the regulated banking sector to a variety of alternative service providers and nonbank financial institutions and intermediaries. As the&nbsp;<em>Financial Stability Report</em>&nbsp;notes, hedge fund leverage reached 18 to 1 in the third quarter of 2023 for "average on-balance sheet leverage of the top 15 hedge funds by gross asset value."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240510a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a>&nbsp;Throughout 2023, bank&nbsp;<em>lending&nbsp;</em>to nonbank financial institutions&mdash;a category that includes hedge funds&mdash;also increased.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240510a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a>&nbsp;While this increase was accompanied by continued declines in delinquency rates for bank lending to nonbank financial institutions, I think it is worth considering how this activity could ultimately bleed back into the regulated banking system.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240510a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a></p>
<p>We should also consider structural shifts that have potential implications for financial stability. In shaping the bank regulatory framework, we must acknowledge that regulation and supervision already influence the location of activity and will continue to do so.</p>
<p>We also know that the cost of bank regulation, including bank capital requirements, influences&nbsp;<em>where</em>&nbsp;activities occur, either within the banking system or in nonbank entities outside of the regulatory perimeter. Absent other factors, over time the cost difference of providing a service between a bank and nonbank provider will lead activity to migrate to the lowest cost provider. Just as with the residential mortgage market, these shifts have real consequences for where activity occurs.</p>
<p>Therefore, the threshold question we need to ask is whether regulation and supervision are appropriately calibrated to risk over time. Ultimately, even if regulation and supervision are rigorous&mdash;imposing higher standards on banks than on nonbanks&mdash;this does not necessarily mean that the standards applied to banks are not appropriate. It may be that activity conducted by nonbanks lacks appropriate supervision and regulation.</p>
<p>Imposing the same level and type of regulation and oversight on activity that occurs outside of the banking system is beyond the scope of bank regulatory authority. However, we must be careful not to facilitate the transfer of activity and risk out of the banking system simply by imposing standards that are disproportionate to risk for the same activities that are conducted by banks. The same activity presenting the same risk should receive the same regulation. Same activity, same risk, same regulation.</p>
<p>Striking the right balance and calibration for the regulation of specific activities is not always a simple task, nor is the establishment of expectations that accompanies regulation and supervision always subject to scientific precision. That being said, one does not need to look any further than the proposed Basel III endgame capital rules to find reforms that are excessively calibrated and disproportionate to risk. This proposal contemplated a 20 percent increase in risk-weighted assets across bank holding companies subject to the rule. Public commenters raised significant concerns that the limited analysis included with the Basel III proposal may have significantly understated the scope of the capital increase. In response to this concern, the Board launched a data collection to gather more information from banks to better understand the impacts of the proposal, the results of which will hopefully be released soon.</p>
<p>As I have discussed in the past, if implemented as proposed, the effects are predictable: higher costs of capital for banks, higher costs of services for customers, less availability and narrower selection of services, and increased concentration in the providers of financial products and services.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240510a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a>&nbsp;Driving risk out of the regulated banking system could lead to marginal improvements in bank safety and soundness, but the consequences for financial stability could be severely adverse. As I noted above, we have already seen reduced market activity driven by the leverage ratio and other regulatory constraints on bank balance sheets. We have also seen banks tighten credit standards and reduce lending activity, which often leads to a credit "gap" left to be filled by nonbank lenders. As activity and risk migrates from the banking system to nonbanks, we should ask how these shifts will impact financial stability over the long run, even though we have less visibility and insight once they leave the banking system.</p>
<p>The Basel III capital rules are only a subset of regulatory proposals for change that involve the challenging task of achieving the right calibration to risk over time. A glut of new bank regulatory reforms and supervisory guidance raise this concern, including revisions to the G-SIB surcharge, new long-term debt requirements, amended resolution plan guidance, contemplated changes to the regulatory approval of merger and acquisition activity, and revisions to the interchange fee cap. The cumulative effects of these regulatory proposals are significant.</p>
<p>This cautionary note does not mean that I am opposed to appropriate reforms to bank regulation and supervision&mdash;both tools must adapt to changing conditions and risks. Last year we saw significant stress in the banking system due to a few bank failures and the persistence of higher inflation and interest rates in the U.S. and in many other countries around the world. But we should not assume that "more" is always better. More regulation and more supervision are only effective if the changes are targeted to address an existing problem and are appropriately focused and efficient.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240510a.htm#fn14" title="footnote 14"><span>14</span></a><a name="f14"></a>&nbsp;When they are targeted and efficient, they may result in a net positive both in bank safety and soundness, and in financial stability. The function of bank regulators is not to create a bank regulatory framework that eliminates risk. Banking is inherently about managing, not eliminating, risk.</p>
<p><strong>Closing</strong><br />My remarks today are not meant to be an exhaustive list of all the financial stability threats facing the U.S. banking system, but I would be remiss in concluding without briefly mentioning a few other key financial stability risks, all of which I expect are familiar to you.</p>
<p>First, monetary policy and the fight against inflation. This is a key risk identified in the&nbsp;<em>Financial Stability Report</em>, and in surveys of bankers. When effectively implemented, monetary policy promotes price stability and maximum employment. In the long run, achieving both of these objectives promotes the stability of the broader financial system. It is of utmost importance that we maintain credibility in pursuing our fight against inflation by proceeding carefully and deliberately to achieve our 2 percent goal.</p>
<p>But we cannot ignore the fact that monetary policy can present risks to the banking system and the broader financial system. Changes in interest rates can make it more difficult for banks to manage interest rate risk, particularly in the face of rapid rate increases like those from 2022 and 2023. We know that many banks have seen a significant increase in unrealized losses on their balance sheets, a trend that has led to pressure on liquidity, funding, and capital for some institutions.</p>
<p>While monetary policy mandates may support long-term financial stability, monetary policy is an independent function that may heighten short-term stresses in the banking system. Our supervisory activities should reflect an awareness of these effects on bank management decisionmaking as we rely on regulation and supervision to promote resilience in the regulated banking system, with the goal of helping banks as they navigate an evolving macroeconomic environment and adjust to major shifts in the stance of monetary policy.</p>
<p>Today's banking system has also been heavily shaped by the effects of COVID-related stimulus on deposit activity. Many banks saw a significant inflow of deposits as a direct result of COVID-related stimulus with excess savings accumulating due to lockdowns. This trend created challenges for banks, who may have lacked sufficient opportunities to invest or extend credit in a world affected by COVID lockdowns. The rapid increase in deposits in the banking system, and their subsequent drawdown, have pressure tested banks' abilities to manage funding and interest rate risks, and posed significant challenges for banks faced with few opportunities to put funding to productive use.</p>
<p>While there are important pockets of financial stability risk where the Federal Reserve lacks authority, there are meaningful improvements that can be made to our regulatory and supervisory approach that could enhance financial stability. Bank regulation and supervision can best accomplish their goals when guided by transparency, fairness, and efficiency. We must remember that there are always consequences to financial stability from miscalibrated regulatory and supervisory actions and the cumulative effects of regulatory proposals.</p>
<p>I hope my discussion today has helped to highlight the role of financial regulators in promoting financial stability, through (1) applying supervision to mitigate and promote resilience to financial system vulnerabilities, (2) adopting bank regulatory approaches that further financial stability goals, and (3) taking into account the unintended consequences and tradeoffs of overregulation and disproportionate supervision&mdash;particularly as they may result in negative consequences.</p>
<p>Of course, while these principles are helpful guides to how regulators can best promote financial stability, they are also insufficient. We must be thoughtful about the limits of regulatory authorities&mdash;and abide by those limits, even in the face of significant stress. The Federal Reserve and the bank regulatory framework do not hold the solution to every financial stability problem, and we must have confidence that other regulators, and other branches of government, will take appropriate steps to preserve financial stability when needed.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time today, and I look forward to our discussion.</p>

<div> initiative, financial literacy, investment, teachers, educational institutions
Summary:<br />SET's "INVESTORY Investment Learning Design Bootcamp" promotes financial literacy through teacher training and classroom activities, reaching 11,422 students in 66 institutions nationwide. <div>
<p>The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) is committed to promoting financial literacy among Thai youth. The recent educational initiative so called &nbsp;&ldquo;INVESTORY Investment Learning Design Bootcamp&rdquo; has been organized for two &nbsp;consecutive years. The initiative provides knowledge and skills for secondary school teachers to design active learning models on personal finance and investment knowledge for their students. SET aims to further develop an investment curriculum for secondary school students in national education. To date, there are learning facilitators of this initiative in 66 educational institutions nationwide.</p>
<p><b>SET President Pakorn Peetathawatchai </b>said that SET has continuously promoted financial literacy to the Thai people for over two decades, especially among youths. SET recognized that financial knowledge would lead to good money management skills that youths were able to apply in their daily lives and that teachers played a part in cultivating and transferring such knowledge, thanks to their rapport with deep understanding of their students. SET has therefore provided a learning space for teachers to apply knowledge gained from SET and design suitable investment learning activities to be used in schools with different environment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The INVESTORY Investment Learning Design Bootcamp initiative focuses on supporting and preparing secondary school teachers as the students from Grade 7- Grade 12 are interested in learning how to start investing. Laying the foundation from the very beginning is crucial. SET serves as a teacher's coach, providing knowledge, tools, and materials to enable teachers to become learning facilitators. The teachers, in turn, create an active learning process and tailor the teaching materials suitable for the context of each classroom to meet the needs of their students. Until now, this initiative has created investment-learning facilitators in 66 educational institutions across 24 provinces nationwide, reaching a total of 11,422 students. There are currently 19 investment classroom models. SET will continue to develop investment toolkits for teachers to use more easily and conveniently. With this unique opportunity, we are certain that the investment knowledge will be introduced into the Thai education system more broadly," added Pakorn.</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s &ldquo;Show &amp; Share&rdquo; event of INVESTORY Investment Learning Design Bootcamp initiative provides a platform for the teachers to showcase the activities and teaching processes that have been developed and successfully tested in their classrooms to other teachers and the general public. In addition, three investment-learning facilitators from two schools also share their experiences of creating successful investment classrooms.</p>
<p><b>A teacher at Chulalongkorn University Demonstration Secondary School, and the creator of "Classroom for Wealth&rdquo; Kamonchanok Sakondhawat</b> said that participating in the first batch of this initiative has given her a clearer understanding on previously misunderstood investment issues and more confidence to teach investment. In addition, she has learned a lot more by networking and exchanging ideas with teams from SET, BlackBox, and teachers from other schools. The teams from SET and BlackBox have provided advice and assistance continuously. Even after completing the first batch of training, there have also been a lot of opportunities to join and update knowledge with learning facilitators in other batches, emphasizing that the training ended but the spirit of the Bootcamp group would continue.</p>
<p><b>A teacher at Ban Maengonkilek School Chiang Mai Provincial Administrative Organization and a co-creator of "Lights in Highlands"</b> <b>Rattanachat Sarapo </b>said that personal finance and investment knowledge were challenging not only for students, but also for teachers. He has been in a process of trial and error himself to manage his money more appropriately. He believed it would be better for students and teachers to learn together in the classroom in order to change their lives and future using the knowledge from SET.</p>
<p><b>Another teacher at Ban Maengonkilek School Chiang Mai Provincial Administrative Organization and a co-creator of "Lights in Highlands"</b> <b>Chalermkwan Wongphanit</b> said that for her this initiative was like a sincere friend in designing investment classrooms for students. Knowledge, teaching ideas, and physical as well as mental support from the Bootcamp group brought personal finance and investment knowledge closer to students. Moreover, teachers&rsquo; attitude towards spending money has been changed after participating in this initiative.</p>

<div> charged, unlicensed, fund management, trial, offences
<br />
Pixelvest and Infinity Trustee Berhad (ITB) charged for unlicensed fund management. Individuals claimed trial for related offences. SC encourages caution.
<br /><br />Summary: Pixelvest and ITB charged for unlicensed fund management. Individuals claimed trial for related offences. SC advises caution. <div>
<p>The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) had charged two companies and one individual in the Kuala Lumpur Sessions Court with three offences relating to unlicensed capital market activities.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Pixelvest Sdn Bhd (Pixelvest) was charged today with one count under section 58(1) of the Capital Markets and Services Act 2007 (CMSA) for carrying on a fund management business without a licence. Pixelvest, represented by its director Ang Jen Chuen (Dexter Ang), claimed trial to the charge before Sessions Court judge Puan Norina binti Zainol Abidin.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This follows the charges filed by the SC against Infinity Trustee Berhad (ITB) on 30 April 2024, with two counts under section 58(1) read together with section 370(b) of the CMSA.&nbsp; &nbsp;The offence is in relation to ITB transferring funds amounting to RM116,292,904.15 to Pixelvest through two accounts in furtherance of the offence committed by Pixelvest.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>ITB company representative, Tan Boon Hoong, had claimed trial to both charges before Sessions Court judge Datin Fadzlin Suraya Mohd Suah.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Separately, former ITB director Chin Wai Lan (Sophia Chin) was also charged today with one count under section 58(1) read together with sections 370(b) and 367(1) of the CMSA.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The charge against Sophia Chin is in relation to ITB&rsquo;s act of transferring funds amounting to RM859,750.00 from ITB&rsquo;s account to Pixelvest in furtherance of Pixelvest&rsquo;s offence under section 58(1) of the CMSA. Sophia Chin was deemed to have committed the offence by virtue of her position as director of ITB at the material time.</p>
<p>Sophia Chin claimed trial to the charge before Sessions Court judge Tuan Azrul Darus. No bail sum was imposed by the judge in view of Sophia Chin&rsquo;s existing bail conditions in her other ongoing case before the Court.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The offences committed by Pixelvest and Sophia Chin took place in Petaling Jaya, Selangor between December 2020 and October 2022.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Fund management is a regulated activity that requires a licence by the SC under Schedule 2 of the CMSA. Any person carrying on this activity without a licence commits an offence under the CMSA which is punishable with a maximum fine of RM10 million or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years, or both.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The charges follow the SC&rsquo;s charging of Sophia Chin, Dexter Ang and Syaiful Riezal Ahmad, ITB&rsquo;s former Chief Executive Officer for related offences under section 58(1) of the CMSA and section 4(1)(b) of the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act 2001 (AMLATFPUAA).&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The SC views unlicensed activities seriously and remains committed in investor protection by continuous enforcement actions against those who contravene the law. When evaluating investment offers, investors are advised by the SC to exercise caution.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The public is encouraged to use the <a href="https://www.sc.com.my/investment-checker">SC Investment Checker</a><a href="https://www.sc.com.my/investment-checker">,</a> a one-stop portal available on the SC&rsquo;s website, to verify if an individual and/or entity is authorised by the SC to offer, promote, or sell any capital market products and services in Malaysia.</p>

<div> Chairman, technology, cyber risks, guidelines, collaboration
Summary: 
The SC Chairman emphasized the importance of effective leadership in managing technology and cyber risks. The SC is committed to driving fintech development and preparing the industry for challenges through initiatives such as the Guidelines on Technology Risk Management and the Capital Market Cyber Simulation. Compliance with the guidelines is expected by 2025. The forum aims to enhance understanding and find effective solutions to strengthen resilience. The SC is proactive in preparing the industry for potential cyber threats through the Capital Market Cyber Simulation.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p align="left"><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Key Highlights:</span></b></p>
<p>In his welcoming remarks, SC Chairman, Dato&rsquo; Seri Dr. Awang Adek Hussin, stressed on the need for effective leadership to navigate the complexities of technological advancements. He was deeply concerned that many industry players continue to fall short in their cyber hygiene practices. Many organisations are also failing to adhere with key security practices.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are highlights from his welcoming remarks:</p>
<ol>
<li>The SC's commitment to driving fintech development through upcoming initiatives like the Innopolicy Roundtables, Pitch and Match sessions, and the SCxSC Fintech Summit underscores the importance of collaboration between regulators and industry stakeholders in addressing emerging challenges.&nbsp; </li>
<li>Cyber hygiene practices are fundamental to an organisation&rsquo;s ability to defend itself from cyber-attack, ransomware, and even data loss events. </li>
<li>It is important to ensure a comprehensive technology risk management framework is in place for leaders of organisations.&nbsp; </li>
<li>The SC is preparing the industry to face challenges that may arise through intiatives such as the Guidelines on Technology Risk Management (GTRM) and the Capital Market Cyber Simulation (CMCS).&nbsp; </li>
<li>Guidelines on Technology Risk Management will take effect on 1 August 2024.&nbsp; </li>
<li>Entities are expected to submit a declaration of compliance to the GTRM to the SC by the first quarter of 2025. </li>
</ol>
<p align="left"><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Full Speech:</span> </b></p>
<p>Tuan-Tuan dan Puan-Puan Yang Dihormati Sekalian</p>
<p>Assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh, salam sejahtera dan selamat pagi.</p>
<ol>
<li>Welcome to today&rsquo;s SCxSC: C-Suite Forum on Managing Technology and Cyber Risks. </li>
<li>First and foremost, I wish to express my sincere apologies for not being able to join you in person this morning. </li>
<li>Despite my physical absence, I am truly honoured to address such an esteemed gathering and would like to express my heartfelt appreciation for your participation.&nbsp; </li>
<li>Your presence here this morning represents your strong commitment to managing the technology and cyber risks within the Malaysian capital market.&nbsp; </li>
<li>As such, I eagerly anticipate the invaluable insights and discussions that will unfold today.&nbsp; </li>
</ol>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>The pace of technological advancement, both globally and locally is unprecedented. Cloud computing, big data, blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) offer opportunities to redefine our market and optimise operations like never before. </li>
<li>Additionally, we have observed a growing reliance on third-party service providers, particularly in areas like Cloud Services and artificial intelligence, among others. </li>
<li>But with every advancement, there are inherent risks &ndash; from cybersecurity vulnerabilities to regulatory compliance concerns. </li>
<li>We need effective leadership to navigate the complexities of technological advancements.&nbsp; </li>
<li>Effective leadership sets the tone on technology governance and cybersecurity culture. This would also bridge conversations between business, IT, and security functions and ensure organisational alignment and adaptability. </li>
<li>Today&rsquo;s forum holds special significance. Against the backdrop of ever-evolving landscape of technology and cyber risks, it is crucial for us to come together to enhance our understanding and find effective solutions that can strengthen our resilience. </li>
<li><b>The SC&rsquo;s commitment to driving fintech development through upcoming initiatives like the Innopolicy Roundtables, Pitch and Match sessions, and the SCxSC Fintech Summit</b> underscores the importance of collaboration between regulators and industry stakeholders in addressing emerging challenges.&nbsp; </li>
<li>Similarly, this event aims to keep the industry abreast with the latest technology trends and shed light on prevalent industry technology audit findings and incidents that may impact business operations. The SC would also like to align leadership role expectations, reinforcing what is expected of the top brass regarding managing technology risk. </li>
<li>I have been informed that many industry players still fall short in their cyber hygiene practices even in terms of basic controls to critical systems. This is highly concerning because such basic hygiene is fundamental to an organisation&rsquo;s ability to defend itself and our analysis suggests that inadequacies lead to cyber-attacks, ransomware, and even data loss.&nbsp; </li>
<li>Many organisations also are not keeping up with key security practices like penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, hardening practice, privileged access management and regular review on user ID, to name a few. This is alarming especially with cyber incidents, such as ransomware and data breaches becoming more common. </li>
<li>In today&rsquo;s business landscape, use of third-party services such as cloud services is increasingly predominant. We find that organisations can do better in managing risks related to third-party service providers by putting proper frameworks in place. </li>
<li><b>For leaders of organisations such as yourselves, it is important to ensure a comprehensive technology risk management framework is in place.</b> This guides organisations to identify key risks and put the right controls in place. </li>
<li>Through initiatives like the <b>Guidelines on Technology Risk Management (GTRM)</b> and the <b>Capital Market Cyber Simulation (CMCS)</b>, we are preparing the industry to face any challenges that arise.&nbsp; </li>
<li><b>Please note that the Guidelines on Technology Risk Management will take effect on 1 August 2024.</b> It is designed to guide the market participants to establish a sound and robust technology risk governance and oversight. </li>
<li>In addition to that, <b>entities are expected to submit a declaration of compliance to the GTRM to the SC by quarter 1, 2025</b>. More information regarding this will follow closer to the Guidelines taking effect. </li>
<li>Meanwhile, the Capital Market Cyber Simulation serves as a testament to the SC&rsquo;s proactive approach in preparing the industry for cyber incidents. By simulating realworld scenarios, organisations can test their response and recovery strategies, thereby strengthening their resilience against potential cyber threats. </li>
</ol>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p>
<ol start="22">
<li>In conclusion, today&rsquo;s forum marks the beginning of an ongoing partnership aimed at shaping the future of our industry.&nbsp; </li>
<li>Your attendance here today underscores your commitment to fortifying our collective resilience in the face of technological challenges. </li>
<li>Together, let us embark on this journey towards a brighter future, defined by innovation and collaboration, with resilience. </li>
<li>Thank you. Sekian, terima kasih. </li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday released a summary of the exploratory pilot Climate Scenario Analysis (CSA) exercise that it conducted with six of the nation's largest banks.</p>
<p>The summary describes how these banks are using climate scenario analysis to explore the resiliency of their business models to climate-related financial risks. Participating banks took a wide range of approaches in this exercise to consider the possible implications of different physical and transition risk scenarios. The exercise highlighted data gaps and modeling challenges that arise when estimating the financial impacts of highly complex and uncertain risks over various time horizons.</p>
<p>The banks that participated in the exercise were Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo.</p>
<p>The exercise was exploratory in nature and does not have capital consequences. Drawing on lessons learned from the exercise, the Board will continue to engage with participating banks regarding their capacity to measure and manage climate-related financial risks.</p>

<title>"Adam Smith, The SEC, Data, And the Public Good" Prepared Remarks Before The 11th Annual Conference On Financial Market Regulation, SEC Chair Gary Gensler, Washington D.C., May 9, 2024</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/adam-smith-the-sec-data-and-the-public-good-prepared-remarks-before-the-11t/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good afternoon. It&rsquo;s a pleasure to welcome you to the 11th Annual Conference on Financial Market Regulation. As is customary, I&rsquo;d like to note that my views are my own as Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and I am not speaking on behalf of my fellow Commissioners or the staff.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My thanks to the Center for Financial Services at Lehigh University, the Center for Financial Policy at the University of Maryland, and of course the staff of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Economic and Risk Analysis (DERA).</p>
<p>DERA&rsquo;s terrific team of more than 170 economists, statisticians, data scientists, engineers, attorneys, accountants, and other staff are at the heart of everything we do at the SEC.</p>
<p>The Division has a seat at the table for all of the SEC&rsquo;s decision-making, whether it&rsquo;s monitoring markets, enforcement, or policymaking. For all of this work, we depend on data.</p>
<h3>The Nature of Finance</h3>
<p>Since antiquity, finance has been about the pricing and allocation of money and risk throughout the economy. There are those who have money who want to invest it. Others need money to fund good ideas, buy a house, or help get through life&rsquo;s inevitable challenges. There are those who have risk but don&rsquo;t want to bear it, and others willing to take on that risk.</p>
<p>Finance sits in the middle, like the neck of an hourglass whose grains of sand are money and risk.</p>
<p>Finance depends on data.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s with data that investors and issuers on either side of the hourglass participate in markets. It&rsquo;s with data that the intermediaries who sit at the neck of the hourglass help price and allocate money and risk. Intermediaries don&rsquo;t just sit passively passing the sand through the hourglass. They become important market participants themselves. They retain and transform money and risk. They also accumulate significant amounts of data on markets, pricing, and risk.</p>
<p>In finance, there also is a tendency toward concentrated data sets with sometimes dominant influence.</p>
<p>This is the nature of finance.</p>
<h3>Data, a Public Good</h3>
<p>Adam Smith, known as the father of modern economics, noted in The Wealth of Nations more than 200 years ago that the whole economy benefits when the price of information is lowered, or information is free.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;Smith&rsquo;s maxim is relevant every day in our modern capital markets.</p>
<p>Reliable, accessible data benefits everyone. No one private entity, though, has the incentive to create a database with reliable, comparable, and accessible data, even if they themselves may benefit. Thus, data is a public good.</p>
<p>Relying solely on market-based incentives would lead to under-production of the public good of information about securities.</p>
<p>President Franklin Roosevelt and Congress understood this. Setting rules that determine what data is provided to the public is one of the most consequential things we do at the SEC. The basic bargain Roosevelt and Congress laid out 90 years ago was that investors get to decide which risks to take so long as those companies raising money from the public make what Roosevelt called &ldquo;complete and truthful disclosure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roosevelt and Congress set up the SEC in 1934 to oversee the markets&mdash;and the intermediaries at the neck of the hourglass&mdash;to promote fair, orderly, and efficient markets.</p>
<p>While Smith&rsquo;s maxim and the SEC&rsquo;s role in promoting data as a public good is a constant, technology, business models, and risks change. Thus, we have an obligation to continue to refresh rules with regard to data, disclosure, and transparency.</p>
<p>I think of the SEC&rsquo;s roles with regard to promoting data as a public good in at least four areas: issuer disclosure, disclosure by market participants, transparency of markets, and the SEC&rsquo;s role providing to the public economic research as well as aggregate statistics.</p>
<h3>Issuer Disclosure</h3>
<p>First, Congress embedded in our securities laws a role for the SEC to oversee disclosures from public companies and registered investment companies. Further, they recognized from the SEC&rsquo;s beginning the importance of guarding against insider trading where insiders abuse information that hasn&rsquo;t been disclosed.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;Few things undermine trust in the markets more than insiders abusing their positions for personal advantage, such as by trading using material nonpublic information.</p>
<p>The core benefits of a mandatory disclosure-based regime and guarding against insider trading haven&rsquo;t changed in the last nine decades. As I said, though, technology and business models do change. What investors find important to their investment decisions also changes over time.</p>
<p>For instance, under Chair Arthur Levitt, the SEC in 2000 implemented Regulation Fair Disclosure to prevent companies from disclosing material non-public information to only certain individuals and not everyone.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>More recently, the SEC has updated disclosure requirements underlying the basic bargain. These last two years we&rsquo;ve adopted rules providing investors with disclosures on emerging risks like climate<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;and cybersecurity;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;capital raising technologies, like special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs),<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;and an age-old topic&mdash;executive compensation.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p>The public has benefitted from the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval System (EDGAR) in the three decades since the Commission first required mandatory EDGAR filings in 1993. To keep pace with ever-evolving markets, technology, and business models, we&rsquo;ve updated EDGAR over the years. We recently made proposals that would enhance EDGAR&rsquo;s security and further improve filers&rsquo; access to the EDGAR system. We have also worked across our rulemaking agenda to increase the structuring of data filed with the Commission. Further, since 2021, the Commission has made available Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that facilitate public access to financial statements and other disclosures made by publicly traded companies. Studies show that machine-readable disclosures benefit investors, markets, and issuers, for example by decreasing information processing costs, making stock prices more informative,&nbsp;as well as reducing market inefficiencies and risks.</p>
<p>We are now working with other agencies to implement the Financial Data Transparency Act, which seeks to promote interoperability of financial regulatory data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also have an important job in reviewing thousands of company and fund disclosures each year.</p>
<p>The Division of Corporation Finance in FY 2023 reviewed offering documents and periodic reports from among the approximately 7,400 actively reporting issuers, including more than 4,000 companies listed on U.S. exchanges.</p>
<p>The Division of Investment Management in FY 2023 reviewed more than 1,900 filings related to more than 4,400 funds and insurance products as well as annual reports from more than 4,200 funds.</p>
<p>Essential to investors&rsquo; trust in the reliability of public companies&rsquo; financial information is an independent audit of issuers&rsquo; financial statements. Congress understood this when they gave the SEC authority over setting accounting standards for public companies. Congress further understood this when they passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in response to some of the largest accounting frauds and bankruptcies in the history of our country.</p>
<h3>Market Participant Disclosure</h3>
<p>Second, beyond issuer disclosure, the public benefits from data about market participants. Such data enhances price discovery, reduces information asymmetries, and promotes trust in the markets.</p>
<p>Such disclosures include institutional investment managers holdings,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;beneficial ownership reporting,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;and portions of broker-dealer annual audited financial statements.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p>Again, technology, business models, and risks change. To that end, the SEC has updated a number of these market participant disclosure requirement in the last few years. For instance, we recently adopted rule amendments governing beneficial ownership reporting under Sections 13(d) and 13(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;The rules shortened the deadlines by which certain beneficial owners of a company must inform the public of their position.</p>
<p>Further, as mandated by Congress, we adopted last year a rule to broaden the scope of short sale related data available to regulators as well as the investing public.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></p>
<h3>Market Transparency</h3>
<p>Third, the SEC has a role in promoting the transparency of the buying and selling of securities.</p>
<p>Such transparency matters, whether it&rsquo;s prior to the transaction (so-called pre-trade transparency) or after the transaction (so-called post-trade transparency). We see this in our daily lives, whether we&rsquo;re shopping for a car, a security, or a copy of Adam Smith&rsquo;s book. We benefit from knowing what others paid for a product or a security in a transaction that recently occurred.</p>
<p>Post-trade transparency promotes liquidity and helps investors. There is something about that sunshine. It gives everyone a sense of where the current market is. The public gets to see details of the last trade that two counterparties just negotiated in that market.</p>
<p>Last year, we adopted a rule mandated by Dodd-Frank to bring greater transparency and efficiency to the securities lending market.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></p>
<p>We also recently adopted final rules to require that large broker-dealers&mdash;those with more than 100,000 customers&mdash;disclose execution quality to the public.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></p>
<p>In terms of the National Market System, a great deal has changed since we adopted Regulation NMS in 2005. In particular, a large and growing amount of equity trading now occurs in what many call the dark markets, particularly off-exchange market centers such as wholesalers and dark pools.</p>
<p>In addition to proposing a rule to narrow the minimum tick size,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>&nbsp;the proposal would update the more than 120-year-old definition<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>&nbsp; of round lot<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a>&nbsp;by determining the size of round lots by the share price. The proposal also would add quotes on odd-lots to core data. Further, it would bring greater transparency to the access fees charged and related rebates paid by exchanges.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, we also approved a Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) rule change to enhance post-trade transparency in the Treasury markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a>&nbsp;The FINRA rule, for the first time, will provide the public with post-trade transparency in the Treasury markets on a trade-by-trade basis, rather than on an aggregated basis. The scope of what will be published to the public will include a trade&rsquo;s time, price, direction, venue, and volume.</p>
<h3>Economic Research and Aggregate Market Statistics</h3>
<p>Fourth, we have a role in publishing economic research. DERA provides impartial economic analyses that consider the costs and benefits of our rules as well as their effects on efficiency, competition, and capital formation.</p>
<p>We get feedback from the public on these economic analyses, which benefits our rulemaking. Our economic analyses also benefit the markets broadly because, as Smith said, making data available creates a public good. Our economists, from time to time, also publish research that&rsquo;s outside of rulemaking. Taken together, this economic research helps improve market transparency and promotes the public&rsquo;s understanding of markets.</p>
<p>The SEC also has had a history of publishing aggregate data with regard to the securities markets.</p>
<p>Since 2014, we have published quarterly aggregated trading information data, sourced from the Market Information Data Analytics System (MIDAS), as well as monthly money market fund statistics. In 2015, we began publishing quarterly private fund statistics. Since 2022, we have been publishing data on the security-based swaps market twice a year.</p>
<p>In addition, the SEC has made data more accessible and usable. Since 2015, DERA has published data sets aggregated from structured disclosures by individual registrants. Currently, it publishes 12 such data sets.</p>
<p>Such publications by the SEC helps the public better understand how our economy and securities markets function.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recently began publishing a new report, the Registered Fund Statistics report,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a>&nbsp;which aggregates data about the more than $25 trillion registered fund industry. This will give the public a view into the registered fund industry, which includes more than 12,000 mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and closed-end funds.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve asked staff to make recommendations about other areas where we might periodically publish aggregate market statistics.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Adam Smith&rsquo;s nearly 250-year-old notion&mdash;that the whole economy benefits when the price of information is lowered, or information is free&mdash;is as relevant today as it has ever been. The SEC, as mandated by Congress, has an important role to promote data as a public good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m proud to work with all of my colleagues at the SEC, including those of you from DERA, to ensure for the public good of data.</p>
