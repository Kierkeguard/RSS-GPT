<div> charged, insider trading, Dick's Sporting Goods, misappropriating, nonpublic information
<br>
Poerio charged with insider trading for misappropriating nonpublic info about Dick's Sporting Goods, making illegal profits. SEC and US Attorney's Office took action.
<br><br>Summary: <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Gibsonia, PA resident Frank T. Poerio, Jr. with insider trading for misappropriating material, nonpublic information concerning Dick&rsquo;s Sporting Goods Inc. and trading on that information, realizing illegal profits of more than $800,000.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, between November 2019 and May 2021, Poerio knew a Dick&rsquo;s employee who had access to multiple internal sources of material nonpublic information about the company&rsquo;s financial results. The SEC alleges that Poerio frequently asked the employee for updates on the company&rsquo;s performance, and, at times, the employee responded with statements to the effect that the company was &ldquo;doing very well,&rdquo; coupled with requests that Poerio not trade in Dick&rsquo;s securities. The SEC alleges that Poerio understood that these statements were based on the employee&rsquo;s access to nonpublic financial information and previews of the company&rsquo;s upcoming quarterly revenue figures. Poerio used this information to trade in Dick&rsquo;s securities, in breach of his duty of trust and confidence to the employee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We allege that Poerio exploited the trust of someone close to him by pumping that person for information and then ignoring his repeated requests not to trade on that information,&rdquo; said Mark Cave, Associate Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement. &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s charges showcase the SEC&rsquo;s ability to detect and charge those who seek to profit off insider trading.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, charges Poerio with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without denying the allegations of the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Poerio agreed to a settlement that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil money penalty in amounts to be determined by the Court. The settlement is subject to the Court&rsquo;s approval.</p>
<p>In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania today announced criminal charges against Poerio.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Jason Litow, with assistance from Brian Shute, Max Clarke, Steve Rapkin, Derek Bentsen, and James Carlson, under the supervision of Kevin Guerrero, Stacy Bogert, and Mr. Cave. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania and the FBI.</p>

<div> Education, dedication, teamwork, humility, gratitude
Summary: Strive for continuous learning, work hard, collaborate, stay resilient, be humble, express gratitude. 
<br><br>Summary: <div>
<p>Congratulations, Class of 2024! Let me also congratulate your families, friends, teachers, mentors, and everyone else who believed in you and supported you on the path that brought you here today. Thank you, President Burwell, Provost Wilkins, and Dean Jacknowitz.</p>
<p>Before I came to the Federal Reserve, I led the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan for five years, so I am used to addressing public policy graduates in May, wearing a robe, and praying it won't rain for the afterparty. Or in Michigan, hail! It is an honor to be able to join in this celebration of you completing your studies and entering a new and exciting stage of your lives. This is particularly special to me, as later in life my mom went back to school at American University (AU) to earn her master's in education. Today, May 10, would have been her birthday&mdash;so I can celebrate your path forward and honor her memory.</p>
<p>I had a chance to speak with a few of your classmates last week, and they gave me a window into the passion and commitment that you bring to your work. It is easy right now for some to look at the world and be cynical about the possibility of making it a better place. But in so many ways, the world is a much better place than it was 50 or 100 years ago, in large part thanks to people like you who've gone into public policy. In my personal experience, I've seen many things get better over the course of my professional lifetime. I can see it now in the work that we do at the Federal Reserve. And most importantly, I can see it in each of you.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it's easy to look at the government or a large corporation or even the nonprofit sector and see some large, distant kind of entity. But the government is made up of individual human beings. You, your friends and your colleagues, your predecessors here at AU, and the people who will come after you. Those individuals make a big difference.</p>
<p>And that's true the moment you leave school. Early on, for example, I worked as a special assistant for Bob Rubin when he was the Secretary of the Treasury. And one of the first things I noticed when he hosted a meeting was that he didn't involve just the top people in the Treasury Department. He included the people who were closer to the issue, such as a research assistant or junior analyst. And he would ask them questions and engage them, and he cared what they thought about the issue. While they didn't necessarily have the same judgment or context as more senior people, they had a lot of knowledge and analytic chops and sometimes a new way of thinking about a problem.</p>
<p>And I've carried that approach to my job today. Many of the people in my meetings at the Federal Reserve are quite junior in the organization, but they speak up in a way that can change how I think about a problem. Please know that you can make a difference as a very junior person and in a very large organization.</p>
<p>Even if today marks the conclusion of your time in the classroom, it isn't the end of your education. The best career advice that I can offer is also the best advice for a happy life&mdash;whatever you do, try to put yourself in a position where you are always learning, every day. This is something my father&mdash;a labor lawyer by day and a poet by night&mdash;tried to live by. Seeking out a role where you are learning every day will guide you to work that stimulates and motivates you, making you a more knowledgeable and hopefully wiser person, even when the lessons imparted are hard ones. As they often are.</p>
<p>This striving to always be learning has guided me to fulfilling work and it has told me, at times, when I needed to take a risk and put myself out there. I was not anyone's first choice for the job I have now, or the job leading the Ford School, or running point on financial reform at Treasury. But I did all of those things. As you will in your lives, when opportunities come along that you never expected.</p>
<p>When I was graduating, I had no idea what I would eventually do in life. And that was scary. That is okay. That is normal. You don't need to know what you want to do for the rest of your life. None of us older people know that either. We're figuring it out as we go.</p>
<p>I've just mentioned one of the ingredients to doing your best&mdash;learning every day and being open to new opportunities even if they are scary&mdash;but another more obvious one is effort. It has become more common nowadays to recognize the costs of working too hard, and that is a good thing. But I hope that this emphasis on work-life balance does not deprive you of the satisfaction, and sometimes, joy, that can come from working incredibly hard toward a goal that you find meaningful. Most things worth doing in life are hard.</p>
<p>And if you do want to get anything done in the world, you need a team. There's a Michigan saying: "the team, the team, the team," and it's a good one. You can't do things alone. Certainly, the work that I have found most impactful, whether intellectually or to the world, has been with other people. The work I'm proudest of, as an academic, is work that I did with a psychologist and an economist on behaviorally informed financial regulation. In the process, we changed the way each of us thought about crucial questions we were considering. What an amazing gift to be able to do that with colleagues.</p>
<p>Along with working hard to achieve your goals, being open to new opportunities, and working as a team, I think it is also important to be tough. Partly, this means being resilient because life is not a continuous march to the top. I've failed many times. There will be criticism and setbacks, and it is how you respond, constructively, to those developments that will matter much more than the progress you make when things are going great. I use the word "tough" because, more than just resilience, sometimes it will be necessary for you to be tough with others. Sometimes you will have to tell colleagues, or even bosses, that they are wrong. Sometimes, you'll have to decide whether to take a stand.</p>
<p>And sometimes being tough requires you to be tough with yourself. When you are in jobs like mine, things go wrong all the time. And it's important to understand that when things go wrong, it is your responsibility. It's not somebody on your team's fault. Your team is giving you the best inputs they can. So having the ability to not point a finger at other people, and to point it at yourself, and understand that you are accountable and responsible, is an important part of being a leader.</p>
<p>Being tough doesn't mean being hard or insensitive. One can be resilient, make tough decisions, and stand up to pressure in ways that treat people with respect&mdash;the kind of respect that you hope others will show you. One of the primary ways that we show respect for others is to listen. If you are always learning, that means you are always listening, taking on board what you hear from others, even if it is very unwelcome, and perhaps, adjusting your views and gaining knowledge from that input. And it means talking in a way that others can hear.</p>
<p>One can make tough decisions and hold people to high standards while treating others well. Treating others well, for me, boils down to a simple rule&mdash;don't be a jerk. All of us have had enough experiences with others acting like jerks to understand this advice, but it's a bit harder when applied to yourself. At least for me it is.</p>
<p>Humility is an attribute that I consider essential to avoid being a jerk. Life often gives one the opportunity to learn and relearn the lesson of humility&mdash;and I am humbled every day. Humility is recognizing the limits of knowledge, confidence, and self-regard. It is the line between what we truly know and understand, and what we don't really know and cannot grasp.</p>
<p>Humility means being open to new information, to weighing information in an objective way, and being able to take on that input and sometimes change one's mind. In a practical way, it means being open to and seriously considering the views of others, and in that sense, it is often a vital way to connect with other people.</p>
<p>Let me leave you today with two words, the most important two words that you will ever know, or ever say. Those words are "thank you." "Thank you" means the recognition that someone has done something valuable for you. Gratitude binds us together. So please turn to your parents, your partners, your friends and other family, your teachers and mentors, your fellow students, and say, thank you.</p>
<p>Congratulations, Class of 2024, and thank you, for listening to me today.</p>

<title>The Pursuit Of Excellence; Opening Remarks Before Eleventh Annual Conference On Financial Market Regulation, CFTC Commissioner Jaime Lizárraga, Washington D.C., May 10, 2024</title>

<div> Securities and Exchange Commission, economics, economic analysis, market resiliency, AI<br>
<br>
Summary: Securities and Exchange Commission Commissioner emphasizes the importance of economic analysis, clear communication, and pursuit of excellence in regulatory work. <div>
<p>Thank you, Vlad [Ivanov], for that introduction. To Jessica Wachter: thank you for your leadership as Director of the Commission&rsquo;s Division of Economic and Risk Analysis (&ldquo;DERA&rdquo;), and for inviting me to deliver these remarks today<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/lizarraga-remarks-conference-financial-market-regulation-051024#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>To DERA staff, Lehigh University&rsquo;s Center for Financial Services, and the University of Maryland&rsquo;s Center for Financial Policy: thank you for organizing this informative event.</p>
<p>It is a pleasure to be here in a room full of economists, whose contributions are so vital to the Commission&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>My 10-year-old daughter recently asked me a very basic but important question: what is economics? In the moment, the best response I could muster was that it&rsquo;s a social science focused on the study of markets.</p>
<p>It was a simple &ndash; many of you here might say simplistic &ndash; answer, but it seemed to satisfy her curiosity. The question made me reflect about one of the key challenges we face every day here at the Commission: how can we best communicate the value and relevance of our work to the public, in the most user-friendly way possible?</p>
<p>It is a theme that I&rsquo;ll return to later in my remarks. But I hope that you, too, will reflect on this in the context of your own discussions today and in your future work. In my mind, it is part of the pursuit of excellence that is central to our success.</p>
<p>Let me return to my basic definition of &ldquo;economics.&rdquo; Of course, it doesn&rsquo;t do justice to the wide scope of areas that you, as economists, study or the research you will discuss here today &ndash; on market microstructure, corporate finance, financial intermediaries, or asset management.</p>
<p>Economic analysis plays an essential role in the Commission&rsquo;s work &ndash; whether in rulemaking, or in calculating disgorgement or distributions to harmed investors in enforcement actions. Or in any other areas where expertise in economics contributes to fulfilling our mission.</p>
<p>In rulemaking, it serves the essential purpose of providing the public and all market participants with impartial analysis of a new or updated Commission rule, including its costs and benefits.</p>
<p>It allows the Commission to compare a proposed rulemaking against other reasonable alternatives.</p>
<p>It helps us describe the economic baseline as it exists today in the specific space affected by the rule, and how that baseline might change once the rule is implemented.</p>
<p>It provides a framework for understanding how a rulemaking addresses a specific problem or deficiency, and the rule&rsquo;s impact on affected stakeholders and our capital markets.</p>
<p>During my time here, the Commission has proposed and adopted a range of reforms aimed at strengthening market resiliency and investor protection. These rules depend, in no small part, on high quality economic analysis. That said, there&rsquo;s always room for improvement in all that we do.</p>
<p>The extensive knowledge and innovative ideas that experts like you bring to the table can benefit the Commission&rsquo;s approach to economic analysis. So, as you engage in your discussions today, I offer you a few thoughts for your consideration.</p>
<p>First, it is important to bear in mind that the investor base in our capital markets is diverse.</p>
<p>Retail investors are a significant segment of our capital markets &ndash; in the neighborhood of 150 million. These investors, who aspire to build wealth for themselves and their families, have varying levels of financial sophistication and investment horizons. They may process market information, or react to transaction costs, in ways that differ significantly from institutional investors.</p>
<p>Younger investors may prefer online trading platforms or robo-advisers. These younger investors may have higher risk tolerances compared to investors in other age groups, who may prefer to interact with our markets in more traditional ways.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurs in underserved or minority communities, or in rural areas, may encounter unique structural barriers when it comes to accessing investment capital.</p>
<p>In short, in the context of their own unique circumstances, all investors behave differently. Economic analysis that builds in and measures these unique differences where possible can be more useful.</p>
<p>Which leads me to my second point. Use of innovative AI, machine learning, and data analytics, with appropriate guardrails, may be worth exploring if it can yield improved and strengthened economic analysis. And provided it does not in any way undermine our statutory mission or the public interest.</p>
<p>Thankfully, DERA&rsquo;s Office of Data Science is already leading initiatives to develop and support cutting-edge data analytics powered by AI to support multiple functions across the Commission.</p>
<p>A rapidly evolving market landscape offers both challenges and opportunities: the challenge of keeping up, adapting to, and getting ahead of rapid change, but also the opportunity to harness technology and data to strengthen economic analysis and our rulemaking.</p>
<p>A unique challenge we face in economic analysis is quantifying costs and benefits. Generally, costs can be easier to quantify because discrete data from past experience is more readily available. But data on future benefits that might accrue to investors, our capital markets, or the broader economy is more diffuse and harder to come by.</p>
<p>More than three decades ago, my graduate school economics professor, mentor, and thesis adviser, James K. Galbraith, introduced me to the work of Nobel Prize-winning Swedish economist, Gunnar Myrdal. In particular, the principle of circular cumulative causation as applied to the analysis of economic disparities in 1940s Black America.</p>
<p>Myrdal&rsquo;s work in this area was funded by a prominent American foundation. His main researcher was Ralph Bunche, a scholar and diplomat who was awarded the 1950 Nobel Peace Prize &ndash; the first African American Nobel laureate. Their work was so influential that the U.S. Supreme Court cited it in&nbsp;<i>Brown v. Board of Education</i>.</p>
<p>Myrdal&rsquo;s thinking really captivated me. His framework offered a valuable tool to analyze how factors that exacerbate economic disparities can mutually reinforce each other in a vicious cycle that can persist over time. But the framework applied to the solution, too. Policy changes can interrupt the vicious cycle and turn it into a virtuous one, with beneficial multiplier effects.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a compelling logic to this framework. So, as economists, I ask you to consider this: leveraged with data analytics, and innovative AI tools used responsibly, could this framework enhance the quality of our economic analysis?</p>
<p>I see much potential in it to broaden our thinking in this area.</p>
<p>In an age where data analytics can unlock so many new possibilities, the optimist in me believes it can help us improve modeling and estimating of potential benefits. Benefits such as reducing asymmetric information and competitive barriers, fostering greater investor confidence and financial stability, and reducing unnecessary or excessive risk-taking.</p>
<p>Let me now return to what I raised at the outset: the imperative of clear and understandable communication with the public.</p>
<p>One-year ago this week, I had the special privilege of delivering a commencement address at my alma mater, the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas, Austin.</p>
<p>I urged the graduates to strive for clear and effective communication with the public. As policy professionals, articulating how their work benefits the public is essential for public support of their mission.</p>
<p>As researchers, your work can contribute so much to the effective fulfillment of our mission. But to maximize its impact, a non-technical audience should be able to understand it. I cannot emphasize this enough.</p>
<p>Yes, our work is necessarily technical and complex, but nothing that we do here should be out of reach to the public. If we fail to meet this most basic of tests, we are also failing the public that we have a duty to serve and whose interests we must protect above all others.</p>
<p>To me, this is a vital element in the pursuit of excellence.</p>
<p>We serve the public most effectively when the Commission&rsquo;s valuable work to protect our markets and investors meets the highest standards of excellence.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll close with a story about why the pursuit of excellence matters so much. It involves soccer, a sport that I follow closely and love.</p>
<p>Pep Guardiola, the Catalan manager of Manchester City Football Club, is probably the greatest football manager of all time. By any measure.</p>
<p>The most coveted achievement in European football is winning the Continental Treble in a single season, a feat that only eight clubs in Europe have achieved. Guardiola is the only manager to have won it twice, with two different clubs. In the last 14 seasons, he has won 11 league titles. And he&rsquo;s on the verge of leading his team to a fourth consecutive English Premier League title.</p>
<p>A documentary that has been running on one of the streaming services offers a glimpse into Guardiola&rsquo;s commitment to the pursuit of excellence. His players enter the locker room at half-time, giddy because they&rsquo;ve scored four goals against their cross-town rivals, Manchester United. But Guardiola tells his players: &ldquo;4-0. I cannot say it&rsquo;s bad, but it&rsquo;s not perfect&hellip;You were brilliant, but I push you to be more perfect&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lesson I draw from this vignette that applies to our work is that even in our peak moments we must not &ndash; and cannot &ndash; lose sight of the pursuit of excellence.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and for joining us here today. Best wishes to all of you in your upcoming discussions.</p>

<title>Statement Of CFTC Commissioner Caroline D. Pham: The CFTC Needs To Get Serious. A Strategic Plan For Reform</title>

<div> commodity futures trading commission, jurisdiction, expansion, GAO study, accountability
Summary:<br><br>Commissioner Pham voices concern about CFTC's lack of procedures, judicial opinions, and enforcement. Urges for a GAO study and implementing reforms for effectiveness. <div>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Today, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) will take yet another step down a misguided path that encroaches so far onto States&rsquo; rights that it makes a mockery of the Tenth Amendment. &nbsp;It pains me to say that despite the road here being paved with good intentions, today&rsquo;s event contracts rulemaking is yet another example of how far the Commission has strayed from the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act and the Constitution, and how little the Commission seems to care for fairness and due process under the law.&nbsp; I have repeatedly raised troubling concerns that the breakdown of the Commission&rsquo;s internal procedures and processes I have observed in the past two years severely compromises the Commission&rsquo;s ability to fulfill our mission and statutory mandate set forth in the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), faithfully serve the public interest, and treat market participants fairly.&nbsp; That is why, before the Commission is granted or usurps any additional jurisdiction over products or asset classes, I believe that a Government Accountability Office (GAO) study is necessary of the Commission&rsquo;s procedures for rulemaking, examinations and compliance reviews, investigations and enforcement, adjudicatory proceedings, due process protections, and compliance with the CEA, APA, Good Accounting Obligation in Government Act, Government Management Reform Act of 1994, Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) Modernization Act of 2010, and other laws and requirements applicable to administrative agencies.&nbsp; A GAO study and recommendations for improvement will ensure that the Commission has the internal operations, structure, technology, expertise, personnel, and funding to be effective in our oversight of commodity derivatives markets.&nbsp; The Commission must be able to walk in a straight line before we run headlong into any expansion of jurisdiction.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>As Commissioners, it&rsquo;s our duty to ensure adequate governance of the CFTC. &nbsp;We must support our talented staff with the tools, training, and resources to be successful, and ensure that we are sticking to our mission, our authority, and our own rules. &nbsp;And it&rsquo;s our duty to take appropriate corrective action if we ever lose sight of those principles. &nbsp;The Commission must uphold the highest standards of integrity, diligence, and excellence to maintain the public&rsquo;s trust in the CFTC&rsquo;s ability to oversee our markets with fairness and in service to justice.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp; Unfortunately, in the last two years, there has been a disturbing number of judicial opinions and public reports that the Commission is failing to meet those standards.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp; This is a challenging time for all of us, and I thank Chairman Behnam for his leadership through it.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Identifying and Reporting the CFTC&rsquo;s Issues</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Six months into my term as a Commissioner, I gave a speech to leaders and practitioners in compliance and enforcement on the well-known maxim, &ldquo;If you see something, say something.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp; In my career as a senior Compliance officer in the private sector overseeing billion-dollar compliance programs, my job was to implement policies and procedures, controls, monitoring, testing, and assessment to achieve compliance with laws and regulations to ensure safety and soundness of the bank and market integrity and conduct. &nbsp;These efforts included processes to identify, escalate, and report issues, and ensure remediation and self-reporting to authorities as appropriate.&nbsp; These responsibilities might not always be popular&mdash;as anyone familiar with Compliance and Internal Audit are aware&mdash;but they&rsquo;re absolutely necessary. &nbsp;Not only did they keep the firm out of trouble, but they promoted trust with our regulators and clients and upheld the firm&rsquo;s reputation.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>As a public company, nothing less than the highest standard is owed to investors and other stakeholders. &nbsp;Well, the CFTC is a public institution, and I believe the Commission owes the American taxpayer that same high standard.&nbsp; At my last job, if I discovered the kind of issues that I&rsquo;ve seen here at the CFTC, I would escalate and report those issues so they could be fixed.&nbsp; Now that I&rsquo;m a Commissioner, it&rsquo;s still my job to say something if I see something wrong. And it&rsquo;s what the CFTC expects of its registrants.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>In the government, the public trust is paramount. &nbsp;Failing to adhere to the law and principles of fairness that are essential to U.S. democracy not only causes us to fail at our mission, but it ultimately hurts the Commission and its dedicated public servants.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve seen a recent cautionary tale at one of our sister agencies that resulted in the resignation of two members of staff.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s important that the Commission is proactive now and takes stock of our own approaches to rulemaking, enforcement, and other administrative actions, that we acknowledge our issues, and that we get help when we need it.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>I have consistently raised concerns both internally and publicly about the CFTC&rsquo;s lack of procedures,</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;improper expansion of jurisdiction,</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;incorrect application of the law,</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;increased delegation of authority,</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;dubious enforcement actions and unfair adjudicatory proceedings,</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;failure to comply with the APA,</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;and general disregard for due process.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span><span><span>Over the past several years, a concerning number of CFTC complaints filed in litigation in federal court have been dismissed for failure to state a claim (insufficient facts to support a charge or incorrect as a matter of law) or on summary judgment (incorrect as a matter of law), or overturned in appellate court, meaning that the CFTC does not understand and is wrong about the application of our&nbsp;<i>own</i>&nbsp;statute and our&nbsp;<i>own</i>&nbsp;regulations.</span></span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a><span><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am deeply disturbed that just a few weeks ago, a federal judge has called the CFTC&rsquo;s recent actions in another litigation matter &ldquo;troubling at best&rdquo; and ordered a hearing on sanctions against the CFTC for an alleged &ldquo;pattern of misconduct&rdquo; that includes knowingly submitting false statements to the court and attempting to intrude on attorney-client privilege.</span></span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a><span><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp; This is cause for alarm and the Commission must address this crisis.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The Commission&rsquo;s recent history with event contracts is another example of the CFTC&rsquo;s issues.</span></span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a><span><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp; The CFTC is currently a defendant in two litigation matters relating to event contracts that allege that the CFTC violated the Administrative Procedure Act, due process, and other Constitutional rights.&nbsp; In one of the lawsuits, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has called the CFTC the &ldquo;epitome of arbitrary and capricious,&rdquo; and found that the CFTC violated the Fifth Circuit&rsquo;s injunction.&nbsp; U.S. Senators and Members of Congress have sent letters to the Commission to express their concerns with the CFTC&rsquo;s conduct of the event contracts rulemaking.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>My concerns are informed by my decades of experience in both the public and private sectors.&nbsp; Not only did I have the privilege of serving at the CFTC between 2009 and 2014 during the response to the 2008 financial crisis, but I have also served at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC).&nbsp; I know the standards that the CFTC used to meet, and the standards expected at the SEC and the OCC, two of the preeminent U.S. financial regulators that are much larger and older than the CFTC.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>I&rsquo;ve had to use my voice not only because it&rsquo;s my job as a Commissioner, but out of true devotion to an agency that I have loved and cared about so much that I&rsquo;m back for the fourth time.&nbsp; The CFTC is where I started my career, and I believe deeply in our mission and our people.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>&nbsp;<span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;Like a mom who will always hold her kids to a high bar and push them to reach their potential, I want to see us all succeed.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp; That means not being afraid to look inward, seek guidance, and be honest with ourselves about our missteps. &nbsp;The most important leadership lessons I&rsquo;ve learned is to never be complacent, have a growth mindset, embrace diverse viewpoints, and focus on continuous improvement.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>GAO Study and Implementing Reforms to Ensure the CFTC&rsquo;s Effectiveness</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Sometimes fresh eyes are warranted, and that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m calling for a GAO study and recommendations.&nbsp; And, I&rsquo;m also calling for the Commission to adopt review and accountability measures to regularly assess the CFTC&rsquo;s effectiveness and identify areas of improvement. &nbsp;Absent these forward looking and proactive measures, I fear that the Commission will continue to lack the procedures and controls needed to be effective at our mission, making the CFTC susceptible to failure to protect our markets and the public.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>If this sounds like a surprising request, consider this: Subtitle F&mdash;Improvements to the Management of the Securities and Exchange Commission of the Investor Protection and Securities Reform Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act Title IX) required the SEC, which has existed nearly twice as long as the CFTC and has six times the amount of budget and employees, to hire an independent consultant to perform an organizational study and review of the SEC&rsquo;s internal operations, structure, funding, and the need for comprehensive reform, and for the SEC to report to Congress on the progress of its implementation of the consultant&rsquo;s organizational reform recommendations.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dodd-Frank also requires the SEC to submit annual reports and certifications to Congress with an assessment of the effectiveness of the SEC&rsquo;s internal supervisory controls and procedures applicable to staff performing examinations, enforcement investigations, and reviews of corporate financial securities filings,</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;and for the GAO to conduct regular reviews of the adequacy and effectiveness of the SEC&rsquo;s internal supervisory control structure and procedures. &nbsp;And, Dodd-Frank requires the GAO to regularly review and report to Congress on the quality of the SEC&rsquo;s personnel management, including effectiveness of supervisors, promotion criteria and fairness, competence of the professional staff, efficiency of communication between divisions and offices, staff turnover, excessive numbers of managers, initiatives to increase the competence of the staff, performance improvement and termination, and recommendations to use staff more effectively and efficiently to carry out the SEC&rsquo;s mission.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>At that time back in 2010, the SEC not only had greatly expanded jurisdiction over new products and categories of registrants, but was facing new challenges in securities markets from technological developments like high-frequency algorithmic trading.&nbsp; These Dodd-Frank studies, reviews, and reports were a sensible way to ensure the SEC would be well prepared to take on its new oversight responsibilities.&nbsp; The CFTC also had greatly expanded jurisdiction over new products and categories of registrants, including the swaps market and systemically important financial institutions, and the CFTC faced similar challenges from technological developments. &nbsp;But there was no similar Dodd-Frank mandate to improve management at the CFTC.&nbsp; Now in the present day, the CFTC may potentially have its jurisdiction expanded again, and is facing a new wave of technological developments like crypto assets and generative artificial intelligence (AI).&nbsp; It&rsquo;s time for the CFTC to finally have the benefit of comprehensive studies and recommendations to make sure we are prepared and able to carry out our mission.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>These accountability measures are not only standard practice for management at any organization and common sense, but they have already been proven at our peer agencies. &nbsp;I think we&rsquo;d all agree that the CFTC&rsquo;s mission is no less critical. Shouldn&rsquo;t we be just as accountable?</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>In addition, a GAO study would provide a roadmap for implementation of reforms. &nbsp;I have made a number of proposals to improve the CFTC&rsquo;s effectiveness to better serve the American people. &nbsp;These proposals have ranged from preserving our institutional knowledge by establishing a CFTC Historical Society,</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;to enhancing retail protection by establishing an Office of the Retail Advocate and considering a new registration category for direct clearing retail derivatives clearing organizations (DCO),</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;to promoting responsible innovation through market pilot programs, to creating executive champions for our employee resource groups, to launching leadership skills and professional development initiatives, to a transformation of the agency across five pillars: governance, culture, talent, operations, and excellence.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Most urgently, I have proposed that the Commission establish a CFTC examination program for systemically important swap dealers because the CFTC is an outlier and the only regulator in the world who directly oversees global systemically important banks (G-SIB) and lacks such an examination program to protect financial stability and mitigate systemic risk.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement051024?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Demanding the CFTC&rsquo;s Accountability</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Government accountability is the cornerstone of the U.S. system of federalism and individual liberty.&nbsp; As public servants sworn to uphold the Constitution, we should embrace the opportunity to improve.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Nobody, and no regulator, gets it right all the time.&nbsp; This obvious fact is a good thing&mdash;it creates opportunities to address challenges, fix problems, and build for the future.&nbsp; Change is hard, and transformation is even harder.&nbsp; But as someone whose career has been to drive change and transformation, I know it&rsquo;s worth it.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Some of my statements and staff questions as a Commissioner haven&rsquo;t always been popular. &nbsp;Speaking truth can be uncomfortable to hear, but that&rsquo;s essential to governance and oversight to ensure accountability.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s been my job as a Compliance officer, and that&rsquo;s my job as a Commissioner.&nbsp; My objective has always been for the Commission to excel at its mission to promote market integrity, and to avoid embarrassment and the degradation of our reputation as a leading regulator. &nbsp;I believe at this point, a third-party review could help us get back to the basics and on track to do what we do best.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h4>Payment landscape in Europe</h4>
<div class="dombanner"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Declining use of cash: the proportion of cash payments fell from 72% to 59% (2019-2022); number of banknotes in circulation decreased for the first time in 2023.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Fragmentation: there is no single European payment solution for digital payments at the point of sale anywhere in the euro area.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Dependence on international providers: 13 out of 20 euro area countries don&rsquo;t have a national card scheme and rely instead on international schemes for digital payments. These schemes account for 64% of all electronically-initiated transactions with cards issued in the euro area.</li>

<title>Statement Of CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam Regarding Proposed Event Contracts Rulemaking</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/statement-of-cftc-chairman-rostin-behnam-regarding-proposed-event-contracts-rule/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/statement-of-cftc-chairman-rostin-behnam-regarding-proposed-event-contracts-rule/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Proposed amendments, event contracts, CFTC, regulations, public interest<br />
Summary:<br />
Proposed amendments to CFTC rules on event contracts aim to clarify and restrict certain types of contracts to protect market integrity.<br /> <div>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>I support the proposed amendments to the Commission&rsquo;s rules concerning event contracts.&nbsp; Before further discussion, I would like to acknowledge the tremendous work by many CFTC colleagues.&nbsp; I particularly would like to thank Vince McGonagle, Nora Flood, and Grey Tanzi for all of their thorough and thoughtful work on the proposal.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Starting in 2021, there has been a significant uptick in the number of event contracts listed for trading by CFTC-registered exchanges.&nbsp; To put that increase into perspective, more event contracts were listed for trading in 2021 than had been listed in the prior 15 years combined.&nbsp; And that has continued to be true each year since.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Given this exponential increase, the Commission today proposes to further specify the types of event contracts that fall within the scope of CEA section 5c(c)(5)(C) and are contrary to the public interest.&nbsp; The amendments will support efforts by registered entities to comply with the CEA by more clearly identifying the types of event contracts that may not be listed for trading or accepted for clearing.&nbsp; These changes will support responsible and efficient market innovation, by helping registered entities and new applicants to make informed decisions with respect to product design.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Specifically, the Commission is proposing to amend&nbsp;</span></span><span>Commission Regulation<span>&nbsp;40.11 to, among other things, further specify types of event contracts that fall within the scope of CEA section 5c(c)(5)(C) and are contrary to the public interest, such that they may not be listed for trading or accepted for clearing on or through a registered entity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The proposal defines &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; and provides illustrative examples of gaming, including the outcome of a political contest, the outcome of an awards contest, the outcome of a game in which one or more athletes compete, or an occurrence or non-occurrence in connection with such a contest or game.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The proposal includes a determination that event contracts involving each of the Enumerated Activities in CEA section 5c(c)(5)(C) (gaming, war, terrorism, assassination, and activity that is unlawful under state law) are, as a category, contrary to the public interest and therefore may not be listed for trading or accepted for clearing through a registered entity.&nbsp; The illustrative examples of gaming that I just mentioned are therefore contrary to the public interest and cannot be listed for trading.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>To be clear, that means that even contracts on the outcome of a political contest such as an election could not be listed for trading or accepted for clearing under the proposed rule.&nbsp; Such contracts not only fail to serve the economic purpose of the futures markets&mdash;they are illegal in several states and could potentially and impermissibly preempt State responsibilities for overseeing federal elections.&nbsp; This is not a new phenomenon for the CFTC. Over the course of the last 20 years, the CFTC has remained steadfast&mdash;through many administrations&mdash;that election or political contracts should not be allowed on the US futures and options markets.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Contracts involving political events ultimately commoditize and degrade the integrity of the uniquely American experience of participating in the democratic electoral process. &nbsp;Allowing these contracts would push the CFTC, a financial market regulator, into a position far beyond its Congressional mandate and expertise.&nbsp; To be blunt, such contracts would put the CFTC in the role of an election cop.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The CFTC&rsquo;s jurisdiction as mandated by Congress and solidified in our statute, the Commodity Exchange Act, recognizes our expertise in markets for goods, services, rights, and interests&mdash;which can include events associated with financial, commercial, or economic consequences.&nbsp; We are tasked with upholding the public interest by ensuring that America&rsquo;s derivatives markets provide a means for managing and assuming price risks and providing for price discovery through liquid, fair, open, transparent, and financially secure trading facilities.&nbsp; Market integrity is featured so prominently within that mandate that the CFTC has civil enforcement authority when it comes to the potential for fraud, manipulation, and other abuses such as the dissemination of false information in the underlying or commodity cash markets.&nbsp; Political control contracts on CFTC-regulated exchanges would push the CFTC far beyond this historical expertise and jurisdiction, and potentially place the CFTC in the position of monitoring such markets for fraud and manipulation in elections themselves.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>I thank the staff for their hard work in producing this important proposal.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<div> Proposed International Ethics Standards for Sustainability Assurance, IOSCO, IESBA, sustainability information, transparency<br />
Summary:<br />
IOSCO congratulates IESBA on publishing Proposed International Ethics Standards for Sustainability Assurance. They aim for global consistency in sustainability-related disclosures. Ethical standards are a prerequisite for credible statements. <div>
<p>IOSCO today congratulated the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA) on achieving an important milestone by publishing for consultation their Proposed International Ethics Standards for Sustainability Assurance (IESSA) and Other Revisions to the Code Relating to Sustainability Assurance and Reporting (the Paper).</p>
<p>IOSCO also acknowledged IESBA&rsquo;s extensive outreach program conducted during the exposure draft development and during the consultation period.</p>
<p>Based on its review of the Paper and additional stakeholder engagement,&nbsp;<a href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iosco.org%2Flibrary%2Fpubdocs%2Fpdf%2FIOSCOPD765.pdf&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cmailing-lists%40iosco.org%7C82fca3c85d044d4bf65108dc70f6dfe0%7Cbcc6c66cdb3b48328af2cc363a097444%7C0%7C0%7C638509452839571606%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=wN8au3Q3jNz%2Bukh%2BNXgvE9tYEdNoYs6MWrJX%2BIfpKvQ%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank">IOSCO outlined its general observations and its six key priority areas for IESBA&rsquo;s consideration in developing its final standard</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Definition of sustainability information</li>
<li>Scope of International Independence Standards</li>
<li>Non-compliance with laws and regulations</li>
<li>Group Sustainability Assurance engagements</li>
<li>Value Chain</li>
<li>Transparency when reporting on PIEs</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Jean-Paul Servais, Chair of the Board of IOSCO</strong>, commented: &ldquo;I congratulate the IESBA Chair, the IESBA Board, and wider staff for this achievement, and for their excellent cooperation with the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) throughout. IESBA&rsquo;s work towards the development of profession-agnostic ethics and independence standards, combined with standards under development by the IAASB, means we are well placed to deliver a global assurance framework at the start of 2025, in accordance with IOSCO&rsquo;s preferred timetable.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Rodrigo Buenaventura, Chair of the Sustainable Finance Task Force said</strong>: &ldquo;When IOSCO endorsed the inaugural sustainability disclosure standards of the ISSB, we were very clear that having assurance (including ethical) standards in place was a prerequisite for achieving consistently prepared and independently assured sustainability disclosures by issuers of securities across the globe. Only through independent assurance will we have credible statements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>IOSCO will continue to play a key role in promoting global consistency in the assurance of sustainability-related disclosures by market issuers and support its members and other stakeholders as they work to enhance trust in corporate sustainability-related reporting.</p>

<div> sentenced, perverting, FCA, fraud, forged<br />
Summary: Taheer Sardar sentenced to 18 months for perverting course of justice with forged document in FCA's investigation of fraud. <div>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>Taheer Sardar has today been sentenced to 18 months&rsquo; imprisonment for perverting the course of justice at Southwark Crown Court. Mr Sardar pleaded guilty on 7 May 2024.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>Mr Sardar was interviewed by the FCA as part of an investigation it was conducting into a sophisticated boiler room scam that had defrauded 120 investors of &pound;1.3m. Three individuals, Mr Mirza, Mr Solaja and Mr Vickers were subsequently convicted and sentenced to 23 years for that fraud following prosecution by the FCA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In his interview, Mr Sardar, acting with Mr Mirza, provided a forged document, which he claimed had been signed by 'Mohammed Khan'. Mr Sardar sought to use the document to bolster a defence raised by Raheel Mirza and Opeyemi Solaja, who had claimed &ndash; without evidence &ndash; that someone named 'Mohammed Khan' was the architect of the fraud they had been involved in.</p>
<p>The FCA did not find that Mr Sardar was involved in the fraud itself, but he provided the document in order to mislead the FCA. &nbsp;</p>
<p><span>At Mr Sardar&rsquo;s sentencing on 10 May 2024, the Judge, Mr Recorder Gavaghan, remarked that</span>:</p>
<p>'This was a sophisticated attempt using a forged document to undermine the course of justice&hellip;[it was] a very serious offence that strikes at the very core of the legal system.'&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Steve Smart, joint Executive Director, Enforcement and Market Oversight at the FCA, said</span>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>'Mr Sardar&rsquo;s conviction and sentence, is a strong warning to anyone who may be tempted to try to help others escape justice- there is no stone we will leave unturned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>'Perverting the course of justice is a serious offence, and the FCA will not hesitate to take action when it identifies this has taken place.'</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<ol>
<li>Taheer Sardar is from East London, date of birth 16 June 1978.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Raheel Mirza was convicted of conspiracy to defraud and perverting the course of justice on 3 April 2023. He received an 18 month consecutive sentence for the perverting the course of justice offence (consecutive with the 8 years sentence for fraud).&nbsp;</li>
<li>The facts concerning the conviction of Raheel Mirza on 3 April 2023 for perverting the course of justice were subject to reporting restrictions until the conclusion of the trial of Taheer Sardar. Perverting the course of justice is a serious criminal offence with a maximum sentence up to life imprisonment.&nbsp;</li>

<title>Financial Stability Risks: Resiliency And The Role Of Regulators, Federal Reserve Governor Michelle W. Bowman, At The Texas Bankers Association 2024 Annual Meeting, Arlington, Texas</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Financial stability, bank supervision, regulation, monetary policy, risk monitoring <br />
Summary: Financial stability is promoted through effective bank supervision, calibrated regulation to mitigate risks, and considering unintended consequences. Monetary policy impacts must also be addressed. <div>
<p>I would like to thank the Texas Bankers Association for the invitation to share my thoughts with you at this year's Annual Meeting.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240510a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;My remarks today focus on financial stability and the role of banking regulators in promoting financial stability and resiliency in the financial system.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240510a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;I will also describe principles that are complementary to promoting safety and soundness&mdash;to help inform the regulatory and supervisory agenda.</p>
<p>Of course, it would be difficult to provide an exhaustive list of the financial stability risks facing the financial system in the time we are together today. So, while I will highlight a few key risks, one must approach this topic with humility, acknowledging that there are limits to a regulator's ability to anticipate every possible financial stability risk in a dynamic and increasingly interconnected world.</p>
<p>Financial stability is an important function of the Federal Reserve. Our financial stability function is supported through appropriate monetary policy, bank supervision and regulation, and by monitoring risks in the U.S. and abroad. A stable financial system provides a solid foundation for a healthy banking system and a growing economy that facilitates maximum employment and stable prices. The Fed's recently published&nbsp;<em>Financial Stability Report</em>&nbsp;discusses financial stability risks in terms of interactions between shocks and vulnerabilities. A financial stability shock is an adverse event or series of events that often occur without warning and severely affect the financial system. A financial stability vulnerability includes a specific characteristic of, or activity conducted in, the financial system that can increase the severity of a stress event when a shock occurs.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240510a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;Since shocks are difficult to predict, the Federal Reserve's monitoring efforts primarily focus on vulnerabilities and the buildup of risks that can accrue over time potentially affecting the resiliency of the financial system.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<em>Financial Stability Report</em>&nbsp;is worth a read. And while I will not recite the many findings of that report today, I will highlight a few of the risks discussed in the report. It is important to keep in mind that the report provides only a snapshot of the current financial stability vulnerabilities and risks. Because the report treats cyberattacks and geopolitical events as shocks, it touches on them only in a cursory way, even though these are important financial stability risks. Instead, the report focuses on key vulnerabilities that are more easily monitored and provides insights into the financial stability outlook as it relates to these factors.</p>
<p>While the framing of the&nbsp;<em>Financial Stability Report</em>&mdash;in terms of shocks and vulnerabilities&mdash;can be a useful, structured approach to consider this topic, there are many ways to think about financial stability. Often the boundary between shocks and vulnerabilities is a permeable one, and the buildup of risk can become so severe that it becomes a shock. The Federal Reserve plays an important&mdash;but limited and non-exclusive&mdash;role in proactively addressing financial stability risks and responding to them once they manifest as stress across the system.</p>
<p>As I think about the tools we use to address financial stability concerns&mdash;and the tradeoffs we are often forced to make when exercising these powers&mdash;it is helpful to consider the lessons regulators have learned over time. While the end goal is the same&mdash;ensuring resiliency in the financial system to promote financial stability&mdash;there are a number of tools that can be used to address the unique characteristics of vulnerabilities and shocks.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve's financial stability monitoring does not operate in a vacuum. To the contrary, our other statutory authorities&mdash;including monetary policy or promoting safety and soundness in the banking system&mdash;can complement or conflict with the goal of promoting financial stability. Many of these authorities interact with banking activities and institutions that are subject to our supervisory or regulatory authority.</p>
<p>In light of this, I will begin by discussing how the use of traditional tools to support safety and soundness&mdash;both regulation and supervision&mdash;can help promote financial stability. I will then describe the limits of these tools, and then conclude with a brief discussion of some other key financial stability risks.</p>
<p><strong>Financial Stability and the Role of Regulators</strong><br />The Federal Reserve plays an important but limited role in promoting the stability of the financial system through resiliency to shocks, and by proactively addressing vulnerabilities. This responsibility can be complemented and supported, or in some cases weakened through the execution of the Federal Reserve's other responsibilities, including monetary policy or the exercise of our emergency authorities. At times, these objectives may appear to present tension or be in conflict.</p>
<p>For example, the banking stress last year resulted from a number of underlying causes. But it is clear that trends in the interest rate environment when the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) was rapidly tightening policy to combat inflation were an important factor that contributed to Silicon Valley Bank's (SVB's) failure. The Federal Reserve's documented supervisory shortcomings and the lack of SVB management attention to these risks were also key contributors to the firm's failure.</p>
<p>To be sure, the role of monetary policy in the demise of SVB does not excuse SVB's management from its inability to manage the firm's interest rate risk exposures or excuse the ineffective supervisory response that enabled the buildup of the firm's excessive risk. And I am not calling into question the FOMC's monetary policy decisions from that time, which were appropriately focused on our congressionally established mandates of maximum employment and stable prices. Instead, these issues highlight the challenging interrelationships of the various roles and functions of the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>This becomes more complicated when we consider the Federal Reserve's financial stability objectives in the context of its prudential mandates to promote the safe and sound operation of regulated financial institutions. The tools of bank regulation and supervision can promote the safety and soundness of individual financial institutions, but they can also be a positive force when it comes to financial stability. When regulators are successful in their task of ensuring the safe and sound operation of the banking system&mdash;one of the core mandates for banking regulators&mdash;often there is a corresponding benefit to financial stability. Put another way, if the individual parts of the banking system are healthy, this often promotes the health and stability of the broader financial system.</p>
<p>But the goal of promoting bank safety and soundness is narrowly focused within the regulatory perimeter&mdash;and the institutions and activities within our regulatory and supervisory authority. By contrast, financial stability must be concerned with the broader financial system, including the multitude of nonbank institutions that play an important role not only in delivering financial products and services, but also in the broader U.S. economy.</p>
<p>So today, I'd like to share three principles that can help frame a discussion of the role of banking regulators in promoting financial stability:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bank supervision can be an effective and efficient tool to promote financial stability. It is important that supervisors focus on core banking risks.</li>
<li>Where bank regulation may create or exacerbate financial stability risks, we need to take a hard look at whether those risks are justified by the safety-and-soundness benefits of the regulation.</li>
<li>As we evaluate the merits of bank regulation and supervision, we must consider how the Federal Reserve's regulatory proposals affect markets and institutions beyond the bank regulatory perimeter. This will enable us to better understand the potential unintended consequences.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is value in our current approach to addressing financial stability risks. We monitor risks and how they build up or manifest as stress in the financial system. And we react in a way that is informed by that monitoring, either to proactively address the buildup of risk, or to address the consequences of events that could threaten financial stability. A review of past events that presented stability concerns can help us evaluate our existing work and inform the direction of future investments.</p>
<p><strong>Effective Bank Supervision to Promote Financial Stability</strong><br />First, bank supervision can be an effective and efficient tool to promote financial stability. I think it is helpful to consider commercial real estate (CRE) as an example.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240510a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;Commercial real estate continues to be an area of focus for both banks and regulators. Some banks have experienced an increase in CRE loan delinquencies, although delinquency rates generally remain low. As we know, one of the factors that has led to CRE stress in certain property types, like office, is the post-pandemic changes in the demand for, and use of, these CRE properties. Should this trend continue, we could see declines in property values, reduced rental income cash flows, or other conditions that could lead to impairment of some banks' CRE loans or portfolios, especially if those loans mature and are refinanced at higher interest rates. I expect we will continue to see material differences in the performance of CRE across the various types of commercial property and in specific geographic regions. This will be due, in part, to variations in regional return-to-office patterns, and the shifting demand for different types of CRE properties.</p>
<p>So, what can we learn from this CRE experience? First, supervision can be an effective tool to mitigate vulnerabilities, like the increasing credit risk associated with certain kinds of lending. Underwriting standards and loan-to-value ratios have improved significantly since the 2008&ndash;09 financial crisis, and more recently we have seen credit conditions for CRE lending tighten, even as loan demand weakened. I see this as reflecting both better management of these loans and portfolios, and more proactive supervision of material risk.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240510a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;Banks are also well-equipped to work with their CRE borrowers to mitigate stress, including through loan accommodations and workouts.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240510a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;Supervision can be particularly effective at addressing well-known, core banking risks, especially when this supervisory work is conducted effectively and without being distracted by non-core risks.</p>
<p>Despite the promise of supervision as a tool to promote financial stability, supervision can sometimes fail to address the significant buildup of traditional risk. And supervision can be susceptible to being diverted from core risks to issues of less material concern. For example, take the dynamics that led to the failure of SVB. The buildup of interest rate risk in the banking system was a known vulnerability and material risk, not just for SVB, but for all financial institutions. The responsibility for managing this risk fell on the management team at SVB, just as it falls on every bank that has material exposure to interest rate risk. And yet, the failure of SVB created something of a "shock" event within the banking system, one that led to a vigorous response with the creation of the Bank Term Funding Program and invoking the systemic risk exemption to guarantee all depositors of SVB and Signature Bank.</p>
<p>I think it is an oversimplification to point to any one factor as the root cause of the failure of SVB. There were a number of issues that contributed to the firm's ultimate failure. These events included rapid growth, poor risk management, poor public communication, a lack of supervisory attention to core risks, and an insufficiently robust supervisory response to the buildup of interest rate and funding risk. These issues were exacerbated by operational and technological problems with FedWire and discount window lending. The cumulative effect of these issues likely accelerated the firm's failure and increased the scope of the resulting financial harm. But certainly, this is a clear example of where the Federal Reserve's proactive tools&mdash;supervision of risk management, and the operation of liquidity support and payment tools&mdash;could have been much more effective.</p>
<p>Therefore, the virtue of supervision as a proactive measure to support financial stability comes with a cautionary note. Ineffective supervision itself can compound financial stability risks by allowing the buildup of risk without commensurate risk-management measures or supervisory attention. One protective measure that we can take to support effective supervision is to ensure that focus on traditional risks is not lost or diluted. One example of a supervisory and regulatory distraction is from the Fed's recent focus on climate risk. Recently, the Federal Reserve conducted a pilot climate scenario exercise with a subset of the largest U.S. global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) and issued guidance to large institutions on managing climate-related financial risk. This regulatory attention and focus on one specific, non-core risk could reasonably call into question whether regulatory priorities are focused sufficiently on key risks. Firms are already required to manage all material risks, and prioritizing climate risk in this way could lead to the misallocation of risk-management resources.</p>
<p><strong>Regulatory Approaches to Promote Financial Stability</strong><br />Second, where regulation may create or exacerbate financial stability risks, we need to take a close look at whether those risks are justified by the safety and soundness benefits of the regulation.</p>
<p>For example, consider the threat to financial stability resulting from market illiquidity. Liquidity is essential to effective market functioning, and liquidity in the U.S. Treasury market is particularly important due to its critical role in the U.S. and global financial systems.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240510a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;This is an area that, in relative terms, has recently experienced stress events as in the September 2019 repo market stress, and the so-called "dash for cash" in March of 2020. These events raised concerns about the resiliency of U.S. Treasury markets. Even today, some indicators signal low market liquidity through market depth in U.S. Treasury cash markets, which have been at levels below historical norms.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240510a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a></p>
<p>Banks play an important role in providing liquidity, and there are clear signs that liquidity in Treasury markets is low.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240510a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;While there may be a number of reasons for reduced Treasury market liquidity, I would note two specific factors and ongoing risks: (1) concerns by banks about balance sheet capacity to engage in low-margin market activities, and (2) the cumulative regulatory burden on banks when they engage in market-making activities, which includes most recently the proposed increase in capital costs for market making activity proposed by the Basel III endgame rulemaking, and an apparent lack of interest in addressing the constraints on bank activities caused by bank leverage ratios. Ultimately, liquidity in the U.S. Treasury market has the potential to amplify or dampen shocks to the financial system.</p>
<p>Where we can take proactive regulatory measures to ensure that primary dealers have adequate balance sheet capacity to intermediate Treasury markets in times of stress, we should do so. This could include amending the leverage ratio and G-SIB surcharge for the largest U.S. banks. And where we can take into consideration the impact of regulatory reforms on financial stability, we must at least acknowledge the tradeoffs and the potential downside risks that regulatory changes could create. This is particularly important when considering significant increases to capital requirements, especially those of the scale contemplated by the Basel III proposal, including the market risk capital increases.</p>
<p>Adopting regulatory changes to mitigate these concerns may not be sufficient to promote market liquidity, but it would be an important step toward building resiliency in advance of future stress events. In my view, it would be better to fix the roof now, while the sun is shining, by addressing over-calibrated leverage ratio requirements and moderating capital increases for the Basel III proposal.</p>
<p><strong>Unintended Consequences of Overregulation and Disproportionate Supervision</strong><br />Finally, as we evaluate the merit of regulations and supervisory approaches, we must understand the broader implications beyond the regulatory perimeter. We have seen a migration of activity out of the regulated banking sector to a variety of alternative service providers and nonbank financial institutions and intermediaries. As the&nbsp;<em>Financial Stability Report</em>&nbsp;notes, hedge fund leverage reached 18 to 1 in the third quarter of 2023 for "average on-balance sheet leverage of the top 15 hedge funds by gross asset value."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240510a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a>&nbsp;Throughout 2023, bank&nbsp;<em>lending&nbsp;</em>to nonbank financial institutions&mdash;a category that includes hedge funds&mdash;also increased.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240510a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a>&nbsp;While this increase was accompanied by continued declines in delinquency rates for bank lending to nonbank financial institutions, I think it is worth considering how this activity could ultimately bleed back into the regulated banking system.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240510a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a></p>
<p>We should also consider structural shifts that have potential implications for financial stability. In shaping the bank regulatory framework, we must acknowledge that regulation and supervision already influence the location of activity and will continue to do so.</p>
<p>We also know that the cost of bank regulation, including bank capital requirements, influences&nbsp;<em>where</em>&nbsp;activities occur, either within the banking system or in nonbank entities outside of the regulatory perimeter. Absent other factors, over time the cost difference of providing a service between a bank and nonbank provider will lead activity to migrate to the lowest cost provider. Just as with the residential mortgage market, these shifts have real consequences for where activity occurs.</p>
<p>Therefore, the threshold question we need to ask is whether regulation and supervision are appropriately calibrated to risk over time. Ultimately, even if regulation and supervision are rigorous&mdash;imposing higher standards on banks than on nonbanks&mdash;this does not necessarily mean that the standards applied to banks are not appropriate. It may be that activity conducted by nonbanks lacks appropriate supervision and regulation.</p>
<p>Imposing the same level and type of regulation and oversight on activity that occurs outside of the banking system is beyond the scope of bank regulatory authority. However, we must be careful not to facilitate the transfer of activity and risk out of the banking system simply by imposing standards that are disproportionate to risk for the same activities that are conducted by banks. The same activity presenting the same risk should receive the same regulation. Same activity, same risk, same regulation.</p>
<p>Striking the right balance and calibration for the regulation of specific activities is not always a simple task, nor is the establishment of expectations that accompanies regulation and supervision always subject to scientific precision. That being said, one does not need to look any further than the proposed Basel III endgame capital rules to find reforms that are excessively calibrated and disproportionate to risk. This proposal contemplated a 20 percent increase in risk-weighted assets across bank holding companies subject to the rule. Public commenters raised significant concerns that the limited analysis included with the Basel III proposal may have significantly understated the scope of the capital increase. In response to this concern, the Board launched a data collection to gather more information from banks to better understand the impacts of the proposal, the results of which will hopefully be released soon.</p>
<p>As I have discussed in the past, if implemented as proposed, the effects are predictable: higher costs of capital for banks, higher costs of services for customers, less availability and narrower selection of services, and increased concentration in the providers of financial products and services.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240510a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a>&nbsp;Driving risk out of the regulated banking system could lead to marginal improvements in bank safety and soundness, but the consequences for financial stability could be severely adverse. As I noted above, we have already seen reduced market activity driven by the leverage ratio and other regulatory constraints on bank balance sheets. We have also seen banks tighten credit standards and reduce lending activity, which often leads to a credit "gap" left to be filled by nonbank lenders. As activity and risk migrates from the banking system to nonbanks, we should ask how these shifts will impact financial stability over the long run, even though we have less visibility and insight once they leave the banking system.</p>
<p>The Basel III capital rules are only a subset of regulatory proposals for change that involve the challenging task of achieving the right calibration to risk over time. A glut of new bank regulatory reforms and supervisory guidance raise this concern, including revisions to the G-SIB surcharge, new long-term debt requirements, amended resolution plan guidance, contemplated changes to the regulatory approval of merger and acquisition activity, and revisions to the interchange fee cap. The cumulative effects of these regulatory proposals are significant.</p>
<p>This cautionary note does not mean that I am opposed to appropriate reforms to bank regulation and supervision&mdash;both tools must adapt to changing conditions and risks. Last year we saw significant stress in the banking system due to a few bank failures and the persistence of higher inflation and interest rates in the U.S. and in many other countries around the world. But we should not assume that "more" is always better. More regulation and more supervision are only effective if the changes are targeted to address an existing problem and are appropriately focused and efficient.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240510a.htm#fn14" title="footnote 14"><span>14</span></a><a name="f14"></a>&nbsp;When they are targeted and efficient, they may result in a net positive both in bank safety and soundness, and in financial stability. The function of bank regulators is not to create a bank regulatory framework that eliminates risk. Banking is inherently about managing, not eliminating, risk.</p>
<p><strong>Closing</strong><br />My remarks today are not meant to be an exhaustive list of all the financial stability threats facing the U.S. banking system, but I would be remiss in concluding without briefly mentioning a few other key financial stability risks, all of which I expect are familiar to you.</p>
<p>First, monetary policy and the fight against inflation. This is a key risk identified in the&nbsp;<em>Financial Stability Report</em>, and in surveys of bankers. When effectively implemented, monetary policy promotes price stability and maximum employment. In the long run, achieving both of these objectives promotes the stability of the broader financial system. It is of utmost importance that we maintain credibility in pursuing our fight against inflation by proceeding carefully and deliberately to achieve our 2 percent goal.</p>
<p>But we cannot ignore the fact that monetary policy can present risks to the banking system and the broader financial system. Changes in interest rates can make it more difficult for banks to manage interest rate risk, particularly in the face of rapid rate increases like those from 2022 and 2023. We know that many banks have seen a significant increase in unrealized losses on their balance sheets, a trend that has led to pressure on liquidity, funding, and capital for some institutions.</p>
<p>While monetary policy mandates may support long-term financial stability, monetary policy is an independent function that may heighten short-term stresses in the banking system. Our supervisory activities should reflect an awareness of these effects on bank management decisionmaking as we rely on regulation and supervision to promote resilience in the regulated banking system, with the goal of helping banks as they navigate an evolving macroeconomic environment and adjust to major shifts in the stance of monetary policy.</p>
<p>Today's banking system has also been heavily shaped by the effects of COVID-related stimulus on deposit activity. Many banks saw a significant inflow of deposits as a direct result of COVID-related stimulus with excess savings accumulating due to lockdowns. This trend created challenges for banks, who may have lacked sufficient opportunities to invest or extend credit in a world affected by COVID lockdowns. The rapid increase in deposits in the banking system, and their subsequent drawdown, have pressure tested banks' abilities to manage funding and interest rate risks, and posed significant challenges for banks faced with few opportunities to put funding to productive use.</p>
<p>While there are important pockets of financial stability risk where the Federal Reserve lacks authority, there are meaningful improvements that can be made to our regulatory and supervisory approach that could enhance financial stability. Bank regulation and supervision can best accomplish their goals when guided by transparency, fairness, and efficiency. We must remember that there are always consequences to financial stability from miscalibrated regulatory and supervisory actions and the cumulative effects of regulatory proposals.</p>
<p>I hope my discussion today has helped to highlight the role of financial regulators in promoting financial stability, through (1) applying supervision to mitigate and promote resilience to financial system vulnerabilities, (2) adopting bank regulatory approaches that further financial stability goals, and (3) taking into account the unintended consequences and tradeoffs of overregulation and disproportionate supervision&mdash;particularly as they may result in negative consequences.</p>
<p>Of course, while these principles are helpful guides to how regulators can best promote financial stability, they are also insufficient. We must be thoughtful about the limits of regulatory authorities&mdash;and abide by those limits, even in the face of significant stress. The Federal Reserve and the bank regulatory framework do not hold the solution to every financial stability problem, and we must have confidence that other regulators, and other branches of government, will take appropriate steps to preserve financial stability when needed.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time today, and I look forward to our discussion.</p>

<div> initiative, financial literacy, investment, teachers, educational institutions
Summary:<br />SET's "INVESTORY Investment Learning Design Bootcamp" promotes financial literacy through teacher training and classroom activities, reaching 11,422 students in 66 institutions nationwide. <div>
<p>The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) is committed to promoting financial literacy among Thai youth. The recent educational initiative so called &nbsp;&ldquo;INVESTORY Investment Learning Design Bootcamp&rdquo; has been organized for two &nbsp;consecutive years. The initiative provides knowledge and skills for secondary school teachers to design active learning models on personal finance and investment knowledge for their students. SET aims to further develop an investment curriculum for secondary school students in national education. To date, there are learning facilitators of this initiative in 66 educational institutions nationwide.</p>
<p><b>SET President Pakorn Peetathawatchai </b>said that SET has continuously promoted financial literacy to the Thai people for over two decades, especially among youths. SET recognized that financial knowledge would lead to good money management skills that youths were able to apply in their daily lives and that teachers played a part in cultivating and transferring such knowledge, thanks to their rapport with deep understanding of their students. SET has therefore provided a learning space for teachers to apply knowledge gained from SET and design suitable investment learning activities to be used in schools with different environment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The INVESTORY Investment Learning Design Bootcamp initiative focuses on supporting and preparing secondary school teachers as the students from Grade 7- Grade 12 are interested in learning how to start investing. Laying the foundation from the very beginning is crucial. SET serves as a teacher's coach, providing knowledge, tools, and materials to enable teachers to become learning facilitators. The teachers, in turn, create an active learning process and tailor the teaching materials suitable for the context of each classroom to meet the needs of their students. Until now, this initiative has created investment-learning facilitators in 66 educational institutions across 24 provinces nationwide, reaching a total of 11,422 students. There are currently 19 investment classroom models. SET will continue to develop investment toolkits for teachers to use more easily and conveniently. With this unique opportunity, we are certain that the investment knowledge will be introduced into the Thai education system more broadly," added Pakorn.</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s &ldquo;Show &amp; Share&rdquo; event of INVESTORY Investment Learning Design Bootcamp initiative provides a platform for the teachers to showcase the activities and teaching processes that have been developed and successfully tested in their classrooms to other teachers and the general public. In addition, three investment-learning facilitators from two schools also share their experiences of creating successful investment classrooms.</p>
<p><b>A teacher at Chulalongkorn University Demonstration Secondary School, and the creator of "Classroom for Wealth&rdquo; Kamonchanok Sakondhawat</b> said that participating in the first batch of this initiative has given her a clearer understanding on previously misunderstood investment issues and more confidence to teach investment. In addition, she has learned a lot more by networking and exchanging ideas with teams from SET, BlackBox, and teachers from other schools. The teams from SET and BlackBox have provided advice and assistance continuously. Even after completing the first batch of training, there have also been a lot of opportunities to join and update knowledge with learning facilitators in other batches, emphasizing that the training ended but the spirit of the Bootcamp group would continue.</p>
<p><b>A teacher at Ban Maengonkilek School Chiang Mai Provincial Administrative Organization and a co-creator of "Lights in Highlands"</b> <b>Rattanachat Sarapo </b>said that personal finance and investment knowledge were challenging not only for students, but also for teachers. He has been in a process of trial and error himself to manage his money more appropriately. He believed it would be better for students and teachers to learn together in the classroom in order to change their lives and future using the knowledge from SET.</p>
<p><b>Another teacher at Ban Maengonkilek School Chiang Mai Provincial Administrative Organization and a co-creator of "Lights in Highlands"</b> <b>Chalermkwan Wongphanit</b> said that for her this initiative was like a sincere friend in designing investment classrooms for students. Knowledge, teaching ideas, and physical as well as mental support from the Bootcamp group brought personal finance and investment knowledge closer to students. Moreover, teachers&rsquo; attitude towards spending money has been changed after participating in this initiative.</p>

<div> charged, unlicensed, fund management, trial, offences
<br />
Pixelvest and Infinity Trustee Berhad (ITB) charged for unlicensed fund management. Individuals claimed trial for related offences. SC encourages caution.
<br /><br />Summary: Pixelvest and ITB charged for unlicensed fund management. Individuals claimed trial for related offences. SC advises caution. <div>
<p>The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) had charged two companies and one individual in the Kuala Lumpur Sessions Court with three offences relating to unlicensed capital market activities.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Pixelvest Sdn Bhd (Pixelvest) was charged today with one count under section 58(1) of the Capital Markets and Services Act 2007 (CMSA) for carrying on a fund management business without a licence. Pixelvest, represented by its director Ang Jen Chuen (Dexter Ang), claimed trial to the charge before Sessions Court judge Puan Norina binti Zainol Abidin.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This follows the charges filed by the SC against Infinity Trustee Berhad (ITB) on 30 April 2024, with two counts under section 58(1) read together with section 370(b) of the CMSA.&nbsp; &nbsp;The offence is in relation to ITB transferring funds amounting to RM116,292,904.15 to Pixelvest through two accounts in furtherance of the offence committed by Pixelvest.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>ITB company representative, Tan Boon Hoong, had claimed trial to both charges before Sessions Court judge Datin Fadzlin Suraya Mohd Suah.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Separately, former ITB director Chin Wai Lan (Sophia Chin) was also charged today with one count under section 58(1) read together with sections 370(b) and 367(1) of the CMSA.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The charge against Sophia Chin is in relation to ITB&rsquo;s act of transferring funds amounting to RM859,750.00 from ITB&rsquo;s account to Pixelvest in furtherance of Pixelvest&rsquo;s offence under section 58(1) of the CMSA. Sophia Chin was deemed to have committed the offence by virtue of her position as director of ITB at the material time.</p>
<p>Sophia Chin claimed trial to the charge before Sessions Court judge Tuan Azrul Darus. No bail sum was imposed by the judge in view of Sophia Chin&rsquo;s existing bail conditions in her other ongoing case before the Court.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The offences committed by Pixelvest and Sophia Chin took place in Petaling Jaya, Selangor between December 2020 and October 2022.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Fund management is a regulated activity that requires a licence by the SC under Schedule 2 of the CMSA. Any person carrying on this activity without a licence commits an offence under the CMSA which is punishable with a maximum fine of RM10 million or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years, or both.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

The SC is proactive in preparing the industry for potential cyber threats through the Capital Market Cyber Simulation.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p align="left"><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Key Highlights:</span></b></p>
<p>In his welcoming remarks, SC Chairman, Dato&rsquo; Seri Dr. Awang Adek Hussin, stressed on the need for effective leadership to navigate the complexities of technological advancements.

<p>Here are highlights from his welcoming remarks:</p>
<ol>
<li>The SC's commitment to driving fintech development through upcoming initiatives like the Innopolicy Roundtables, Pitch and Match sessions, and the SCxSC Fintech Summit underscores the importance of collaboration between regulators and industry stakeholders in addressing emerging challenges.&nbsp; </li>
<li>Cyber hygiene practices are fundamental to an organisation&rsquo;s ability to defend itself from cyber-attack, ransomware, and even data loss events. </li>
<li>It is important to ensure a comprehensive technology risk management framework is in place for leaders of organisations.&nbsp; </li>
<li>The SC is preparing the industry to face challenges that may arise through intiatives such as the Guidelines on Technology Risk Management (GTRM) and the Capital Market Cyber Simulation (CMCS).&nbsp; </li>
<li>Guidelines on Technology Risk Management will take effect on 1 August 2024.&nbsp; </li>
<li>Entities are expected to submit a declaration of compliance to the GTRM to the SC by the first quarter of 2025. </li>
</ol>
<p align="left"><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Full Speech:</span> </b></p>
<p>Tuan-Tuan dan Puan-Puan Yang Dihormati Sekalian</p>
<p>Assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh, salam sejahtera dan selamat pagi.</p>
<ol>
<li>Welcome to today&rsquo;s SCxSC: C-Suite Forum on Managing Technology and Cyber Risks. </li>
<li>First and foremost, I wish to express my sincere apologies for not being able to join you in person this morning. </li>
<li>Despite my physical absence, I am truly honoured to address such an esteemed gathering and would like to express my heartfelt appreciation for your participation.&nbsp; </li>
<li>Your presence here this morning represents your strong commitment to managing the technology and cyber risks within the Malaysian capital market.&nbsp; </li>
<li>As such, I eagerly anticipate the invaluable insights and discussions that will unfold today.&nbsp; </li>
</ol>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>The pace of technological advancement, both globally and locally is unprecedented. Cloud computing, big data, blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) offer opportunities to redefine our market and optimise operations like never before. </li>
<li>Additionally, we have observed a growing reliance on third-party service providers, particularly in areas like Cloud Services and artificial intelligence, among others. </li>
<li>But with every advancement, there are inherent risks &ndash; from cybersecurity vulnerabilities to regulatory compliance concerns. </li>
<li>We need effective leadership to navigate the complexities of technological advancements.&nbsp; </li>
<li>Effective leadership sets the tone on technology governance and cybersecurity culture. This would also bridge conversations between business, IT, and security functions and ensure organisational alignment and adaptability. </li>
<li>Today&rsquo;s forum holds special significance. Against the backdrop of ever-evolving landscape of technology and cyber risks, it is crucial for us to come together to enhance our understanding and find effective solutions that can strengthen our resilience. </li>
<li><b>The SC&rsquo;s commitment to driving fintech development through upcoming initiatives like the Innopolicy Roundtables, Pitch and Match sessions, and the SCxSC Fintech Summit</b> underscores the importance of collaboration between regulators and industry stakeholders in addressing emerging challenges.&nbsp; </li>
<li>Similarly, this event aims to keep the industry abreast with the latest technology trends and shed light on prevalent industry technology audit findings and incidents that may impact business operations. The SC would also like to align leadership role expectations, reinforcing what is expected of the top brass regarding managing technology risk. </li>
<li>I have been informed that many industry players still fall short in their cyber hygiene practices even in terms of basic controls to critical systems. This is highly concerning because such basic hygiene is fundamental to an organisation&rsquo;s ability to defend itself and our analysis suggests that inadequacies lead to cyber-attacks, ransomware, and even data loss.&nbsp; </li>
<li>Many organisations also are not keeping up with key security practices like penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, hardening practice, privileged access management and regular review on user ID, to name a few. This is alarming especially with cyber incidents, such as ransomware and data breaches becoming more common. </li>
<li>In today&rsquo;s business landscape, use of third-party services such as cloud services is increasingly predominant. We find that organisations can do better in managing risks related to third-party service providers by putting proper frameworks in place. </li>
<li><b>For leaders of organisations such as yourselves, it is important to ensure a comprehensive technology risk management framework is in place.</b> This guides organisations to identify key risks and put the right controls in place. </li>
<li>Through initiatives like the <b>Guidelines on Technology Risk Management (GTRM)</b> and the <b>Capital Market Cyber Simulation (CMCS)</b>, we are preparing the industry to face any challenges that arise.&nbsp; </li>
<li><b>Please note that the Guidelines on Technology Risk Management will take effect on 1 August 2024.</b> It is designed to guide the market participants to establish a sound and robust technology risk governance and oversight. </li>
<li>In addition to that, <b>entities are expected to submit a declaration of compliance to the GTRM to the SC by quarter 1, 2025</b>. More information regarding this will follow closer to the Guidelines taking effect. </li>
<li>Meanwhile, the Capital Market Cyber Simulation serves as a testament to the SC&rsquo;s proactive approach in preparing the industry for cyber incidents. By simulating realworld scenarios, organisations can test their response and recovery strategies, thereby strengthening their resilience against potential cyber threats. </li>
</ol>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p>
<ol start="22">
<li>In conclusion, today&rsquo;s forum marks the beginning of an ongoing partnership aimed at shaping the future of our industry.&nbsp; </li>
<li>Your attendance here today underscores your commitment to fortifying our collective resilience in the face of technological challenges. </li>
<li>Together, let us embark on this journey towards a brighter future, defined by innovation and collaboration, with resilience. </li>
<li>Thank you. Sekian, terima kasih. </li>

<p class="sizeable"><span>Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Information&nbsp;</span>This press release of TMX Group contains "forward-looking information" (as defined in applicable Canadian securities legislation) that is based on expectations, assumptions, estimates, projections and other factors that management believes to be relevant as of the date of this press release. Often, but not always, such forward-looking information can be identified by the use of forward-looking words such as "plans," "expects," "is expected," "budget," "scheduled," "targeted," "estimates," "forecasts," "intends," "anticipates," "believes," or variations or the negatives of such words and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or results "may," "could," "would," "might," or "will" be taken, occur or be achieved or not be taken, occur or be achieved. Forward-looking information, by its nature, requires us to make assumptions and is subject to significant risks and uncertainties which may give rise to the possibility that our expectations or conclusions will not prove to be accurate and that our assumptions may not be correct.</p>
<p class="sizeable">Examples of forward-looking information in this press release include, but are not limited to, the closing of the Offering and the benefits of the Offering, and the expected credit rating of the Debentures, all of which are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. These risks include, but are not limited to: dependence on the economy of Canada; adverse effects on our results caused by global economic conditions (including geopolitical events, interest rate movements, threat of recession) or uncertainties including changes in business cycles that impact our sector; geopolitical and other factors which could cause business interruption); dependence on information technology; vulnerability of our networks and third party service providers to security risks, including cyber-attacks; regulatory constraints; constraints imposed by our level of indebtedness, risks of litigation or other proceedings; currency risk; dependence on third-party suppliers and service providers; adverse effect of a systemic market event on certain of our businesses; the regulatory constraints that apply to the business of TMX Group and its regulated subsidiaries.</p>
<p class="sizeable">Forward-looking information is based on a number of assumptions which may prove to be incorrect, including, but not limited to, business and economic conditions generally; exchange rates (including estimates of exchange rates from Canadian dollars to the U.S. dollar or GBP), commodities prices, the level of trading and activity on markets, and particularly the level of trading in TMX Group's key products; changes to interest rates and the timing thereof; the amount and timing of revenue and technology cost synergies resulting from the AST Canada acquisition; productivity at TMX Group, as well as that of TMX Group's competitors; market competition; research and development activities; the successful introduction and client acceptance of new products and services; successful introduction of various technology assets and capabilities; the impact on TMX Group and its customers of various regulations; TMX Group's ongoing relations with its employees; and the extent of any labour, equipment or other disruptions at any of its operations of any significance other than any planned maintenance or similar shutdowns.</p>
<p class="sizeable">We have attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially from those current expectations described in forward-looking information. However, there may be other factors that cause actions, events or results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended and that could cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially from current expectations. There can be no assurance that forward-looking information will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking information. These factors are not intended to represent a complete list of the factors that could affect us. A description of the above-mentioned items is contained in the section "Enterprise Risk Management" of our 2023 annual MD&amp;A.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday released a summary of the exploratory pilot Climate Scenario Analysis (CSA) exercise that it conducted with six of the nation's largest banks.</p>
<p>The summary describes how these banks are using climate scenario analysis to explore the resiliency of their business models to climate-related financial risks. Participating banks took a wide range of approaches in this exercise to consider the possible implications of different physical and transition risk scenarios. The exercise highlighted data gaps and modeling challenges that arise when estimating the financial impacts of highly complex and uncertain risks over various time horizons.</p>
<p>The banks that participated in the exercise were Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo.</p>
<p>The exercise was exploratory in nature and does not have capital consequences. Drawing on lessons learned from the exercise, the Board will continue to engage with participating banks regarding their capacity to measure and manage climate-related financial risks.</p>

<title>"Adam Smith, The SEC, Data, And the Public Good" Prepared Remarks Before The 11th Annual Conference On Financial Market Regulation, SEC Chair Gary Gensler, Washington D.C., May 9, 2024</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/adam-smith-the-sec-data-and-the-public-good-prepared-remarks-before-the-11t/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good afternoon. It&rsquo;s a pleasure to welcome you to the 11th Annual Conference on Financial Market Regulation. As is customary, I&rsquo;d like to note that my views are my own as Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and I am not speaking on behalf of my fellow Commissioners or the staff.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My thanks to the Center for Financial Services at Lehigh University, the Center for Financial Policy at the University of Maryland, and of course the staff of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Economic and Risk Analysis (DERA).</p>
<p>DERA&rsquo;s terrific team of more than 170 economists, statisticians, data scientists, engineers, attorneys, accountants, and other staff are at the heart of everything we do at the SEC.</p>
<p>The Division has a seat at the table for all of the SEC&rsquo;s decision-making, whether it&rsquo;s monitoring markets, enforcement, or policymaking. For all of this work, we depend on data.</p>
<h3>The Nature of Finance</h3>
<p>Since antiquity, finance has been about the pricing and allocation of money and risk throughout the economy. There are those who have money who want to invest it. Others need money to fund good ideas, buy a house, or help get through life&rsquo;s inevitable challenges. There are those who have risk but don&rsquo;t want to bear it, and others willing to take on that risk.</p>
<p>Finance sits in the middle, like the neck of an hourglass whose grains of sand are money and risk.</p>
<p>Finance depends on data.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s with data that investors and issuers on either side of the hourglass participate in markets. It&rsquo;s with data that the intermediaries who sit at the neck of the hourglass help price and allocate money and risk. Intermediaries don&rsquo;t just sit passively passing the sand through the hourglass. They become important market participants themselves. They retain and transform money and risk. They also accumulate significant amounts of data on markets, pricing, and risk.</p>
<p>In finance, there also is a tendency toward concentrated data sets with sometimes dominant influence.</p>
<p>This is the nature of finance.</p>
<h3>Data, a Public Good</h3>
<p>Adam Smith, known as the father of modern economics, noted in The Wealth of Nations more than 200 years ago that the whole economy benefits when the price of information is lowered, or information is free.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;Smith&rsquo;s maxim is relevant every day in our modern capital markets.</p>
<p>Reliable, accessible data benefits everyone. No one private entity, though, has the incentive to create a database with reliable, comparable, and accessible data, even if they themselves may benefit. Thus, data is a public good.</p>
<p>Relying solely on market-based incentives would lead to under-production of the public good of information about securities.</p>
<p>President Franklin Roosevelt and Congress understood this. Setting rules that determine what data is provided to the public is one of the most consequential things we do at the SEC. The basic bargain Roosevelt and Congress laid out 90 years ago was that investors get to decide which risks to take so long as those companies raising money from the public make what Roosevelt called &ldquo;complete and truthful disclosure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roosevelt and Congress set up the SEC in 1934 to oversee the markets&mdash;and the intermediaries at the neck of the hourglass&mdash;to promote fair, orderly, and efficient markets.</p>
<p>While Smith&rsquo;s maxim and the SEC&rsquo;s role in promoting data as a public good is a constant, technology, business models, and risks change. Thus, we have an obligation to continue to refresh rules with regard to data, disclosure, and transparency.</p>
<p>I think of the SEC&rsquo;s roles with regard to promoting data as a public good in at least four areas: issuer disclosure, disclosure by market participants, transparency of markets, and the SEC&rsquo;s role providing to the public economic research as well as aggregate statistics.</p>
<h3>Issuer Disclosure</h3>
<p>First, Congress embedded in our securities laws a role for the SEC to oversee disclosures from public companies and registered investment companies. Further, they recognized from the SEC&rsquo;s beginning the importance of guarding against insider trading where insiders abuse information that hasn&rsquo;t been disclosed.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;Few things undermine trust in the markets more than insiders abusing their positions for personal advantage, such as by trading using material nonpublic information.</p>
<p>The core benefits of a mandatory disclosure-based regime and guarding against insider trading haven&rsquo;t changed in the last nine decades. As I said, though, technology and business models do change. What investors find important to their investment decisions also changes over time.</p>
<p>For instance, under Chair Arthur Levitt, the SEC in 2000 implemented Regulation Fair Disclosure to prevent companies from disclosing material non-public information to only certain individuals and not everyone.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>More recently, the SEC has updated disclosure requirements underlying the basic bargain. These last two years we&rsquo;ve adopted rules providing investors with disclosures on emerging risks like climate<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;and cybersecurity;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;capital raising technologies, like special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs),<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;and an age-old topic&mdash;executive compensation.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p>The public has benefitted from the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval System (EDGAR) in the three decades since the Commission first required mandatory EDGAR filings in 1993. To keep pace with ever-evolving markets, technology, and business models, we&rsquo;ve updated EDGAR over the years. We recently made proposals that would enhance EDGAR&rsquo;s security and further improve filers&rsquo; access to the EDGAR system. We have also worked across our rulemaking agenda to increase the structuring of data filed with the Commission. Further, since 2021, the Commission has made available Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that facilitate public access to financial statements and other disclosures made by publicly traded companies. Studies show that machine-readable disclosures benefit investors, markets, and issuers, for example by decreasing information processing costs, making stock prices more informative,&nbsp;as well as reducing market inefficiencies and risks.</p>
<p>We are now working with other agencies to implement the Financial Data Transparency Act, which seeks to promote interoperability of financial regulatory data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also have an important job in reviewing thousands of company and fund disclosures each year.</p>
<p>The Division of Corporation Finance in FY 2023 reviewed offering documents and periodic reports from among the approximately 7,400 actively reporting issuers, including more than 4,000 companies listed on U.S. exchanges.</p>
<p>The Division of Investment Management in FY 2023 reviewed more than 1,900 filings related to more than 4,400 funds and insurance products as well as annual reports from more than 4,200 funds.</p>
<p>Essential to investors&rsquo; trust in the reliability of public companies&rsquo; financial information is an independent audit of issuers&rsquo; financial statements. Congress understood this when they gave the SEC authority over setting accounting standards for public companies. Congress further understood this when they passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in response to some of the largest accounting frauds and bankruptcies in the history of our country.</p>
<h3>Market Participant Disclosure</h3>
<p>Second, beyond issuer disclosure, the public benefits from data about market participants. Such data enhances price discovery, reduces information asymmetries, and promotes trust in the markets.</p>
<p>Such disclosures include institutional investment managers holdings,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;beneficial ownership reporting,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;and portions of broker-dealer annual audited financial statements.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p>Again, technology, business models, and risks change. To that end, the SEC has updated a number of these market participant disclosure requirement in the last few years. For instance, we recently adopted rule amendments governing beneficial ownership reporting under Sections 13(d) and 13(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;The rules shortened the deadlines by which certain beneficial owners of a company must inform the public of their position.</p>
<p>Further, as mandated by Congress, we adopted last year a rule to broaden the scope of short sale related data available to regulators as well as the investing public.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></p>
<h3>Market Transparency</h3>
<p>Third, the SEC has a role in promoting the transparency of the buying and selling of securities.</p>
<p>Such transparency matters, whether it&rsquo;s prior to the transaction (so-called pre-trade transparency) or after the transaction (so-called post-trade transparency). We see this in our daily lives, whether we&rsquo;re shopping for a car, a security, or a copy of Adam Smith&rsquo;s book. We benefit from knowing what others paid for a product or a security in a transaction that recently occurred.</p>
<p>Post-trade transparency promotes liquidity and helps investors. There is something about that sunshine. It gives everyone a sense of where the current market is. The public gets to see details of the last trade that two counterparties just negotiated in that market.</p>
<p>Last year, we adopted a rule mandated by Dodd-Frank to bring greater transparency and efficiency to the securities lending market.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></p>
<p>We also recently adopted final rules to require that large broker-dealers&mdash;those with more than 100,000 customers&mdash;disclose execution quality to the public.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></p>
<p>In terms of the National Market System, a great deal has changed since we adopted Regulation NMS in 2005. In particular, a large and growing amount of equity trading now occurs in what many call the dark markets, particularly off-exchange market centers such as wholesalers and dark pools.</p>
<p>In addition to proposing a rule to narrow the minimum tick size,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>&nbsp;the proposal would update the more than 120-year-old definition<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>&nbsp; of round lot<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a>&nbsp;by determining the size of round lots by the share price. The proposal also would add quotes on odd-lots to core data. Further, it would bring greater transparency to the access fees charged and related rebates paid by exchanges.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, we also approved a Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) rule change to enhance post-trade transparency in the Treasury markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a>&nbsp;The FINRA rule, for the first time, will provide the public with post-trade transparency in the Treasury markets on a trade-by-trade basis, rather than on an aggregated basis. The scope of what will be published to the public will include a trade&rsquo;s time, price, direction, venue, and volume.</p>
<h3>Economic Research and Aggregate Market Statistics</h3>
<p>Fourth, we have a role in publishing economic research. DERA provides impartial economic analyses that consider the costs and benefits of our rules as well as their effects on efficiency, competition, and capital formation.</p>
<p>We get feedback from the public on these economic analyses, which benefits our rulemaking. Our economic analyses also benefit the markets broadly because, as Smith said, making data available creates a public good. Our economists, from time to time, also publish research that&rsquo;s outside of rulemaking. Taken together, this economic research helps improve market transparency and promotes the public&rsquo;s understanding of markets.</p>
<p>The SEC also has had a history of publishing aggregate data with regard to the securities markets.</p>
<p>Since 2014, we have published quarterly aggregated trading information data, sourced from the Market Information Data Analytics System (MIDAS), as well as monthly money market fund statistics. In 2015, we began publishing quarterly private fund statistics. Since 2022, we have been publishing data on the security-based swaps market twice a year.</p>
<p>In addition, the SEC has made data more accessible and usable. Since 2015, DERA has published data sets aggregated from structured disclosures by individual registrants. Currently, it publishes 12 such data sets.</p>
<p>Such publications by the SEC helps the public better understand how our economy and securities markets function.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recently began publishing a new report, the Registered Fund Statistics report,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-11th-annual-conference-financial-market-regulation-0509240#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a>&nbsp;which aggregates data about the more than $25 trillion registered fund industry. This will give the public a view into the registered fund industry, which includes more than 12,000 mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and closed-end funds.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve asked staff to make recommendations about other areas where we might periodically publish aggregate market statistics.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Adam Smith&rsquo;s nearly 250-year-old notion&mdash;that the whole economy benefits when the price of information is lowered, or information is free&mdash;is as relevant today as it has ever been. The SEC, as mandated by Congress, has an important role to promote data as a public good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m proud to work with all of my colleagues at the SEC, including those of you from DERA, to ensure for the public good of data.</p>
