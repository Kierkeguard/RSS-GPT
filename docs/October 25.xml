<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-md-8">
<p>Thank you for the invitation to speak to you today.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20251008a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;I value the opportunity to spend time with community bankers and fellow federal and state bank regulators. This conference, now in its 13th year, is always a great forum for those interactions. All of us benefit from the research presented here, which helps us understand the opportunities for banks to strengthen communities, and the challenges that community banks face. So, I want to thank the researchers presenting. Thank you also to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS) for co-sponsoring this gathering, and to the Federal Reserve staff who each year do their part to bring it about. More broadly, I very much appreciate the close and longstanding collaboration between the Federal Reserve, the CSBS, and the FDIC.</p>
<p>Throughout my career, a major focus of my work has been building stronger communities. To do much of that building, households and small businesses need access to credit, and I have known for a long time that community banks and community bankers play an indispensable role in the towns, rural areas, and cities they serve. Stronger community banks mean stronger communities.</p>
<p>Community banks, sometimes the only banking option in a community, offer a consequential difference in customer experience. Even in communities that may also have local branches of larger banks, there is often a considerable, and I think meaningful, differentiation in the customer satisfaction at a community bank. At branches of larger banks, the customer experience can be subject to layers of authorizations involving phone calls and approvals (or denials) from people who are not part of the community and may lack a deep understanding of local industries and conditions. Much of this relates to the understandable need for larger institutions to adopt more standardized and centralized processes, powered by technology, to boost efficiency and lower costs. It is easier than ever before to apply for an increasing variety of loans online, and this is something that community banks are taking advantage of as well. But this is where the benefit that community banks provide really shows.</p>
<p>Community bankers are part of their communities. They know and care about their customers. They have an inherent advantage in understanding the needs and the challenges of local businesses and households. This is not just a matter of being friendly and welcoming to customers. Beyond the numbers on a loan application, what community bankers understand about their neighbors is "soft information" that can be used to make better credit decisions. Relationship banking, especially with local business owners, is critical for those businesses&mdash;but also for community banks&mdash;because it gives them an ongoing edge in the ever-intensifying competition from larger banks and nonbank lenders. Knowing your customer is also crucial in preventing crime, such as fraud, which remains a top concern for community bankers.</p>
<p>The pressure of competition is a very real challenge for community banks, but the advantages I speak of are real as well. I know you heard yesterday from several banks, including those that are modestly sized and have competed very effectively with much larger banks. Community banks have earned the trust and the business of people in their communities because of an understanding that the banks' successes depend on their communities succeeding. Those common interests are a powerful force that drives customer retention amid all the competition.</p>
<p>What is the future of community banking? I note that the session immediately after my remarks today is "Innovation and Technology in Small Business Lending." Indeed, technology is a big part of this year's conference, so you won't be surprised to hear me say that I believe it is a big part of what will determine the future of community banking. I know you've already gotten the results of this year's Annual Survey of Community Banks by CSBS, where "technology and related costs" ranked second as a concern, behind only cybersecurity, which is itself largely about technology. Most respondents said that the adoption of new or emerging technologies was very or extremely important, and not a single banker said it wasn't important at all.</p>
<p>Until fairly recently, the big technological disruption in banking came from fintech and an onslaught of new lending from nonbanks. This year's CSBS survey reported the largest-ever increase in respondents who saw heightened competition from nonbank payment services firms. Larger banks are also competing with community banks online. Increased choice for small businesses and consumers is a good thing, but community banks have had to continue to innovate to compete. Community banks often turn to third-party service providers to help them offer products and services to compete with larger banks and fintechs. Managing the risks related to these third-party arrangements has been a considerable job for community banks. The Fed and other regulators have offered guidance about this task, to serve as a resource and to make the supervisory implications of third-party risk management as predictable as possible.</p>
<p>As with many of the big questions facing community banking, technology represents risk and opportunity. It allows community banks to reach customers more effectively and to offer new products and services, but it also demands investment and vigilance. One of the challenges for community banks is to adopt technologies or form partnerships that allow them to deepen customer relationships but not attenuate or replace them. In interactions with Federal Reserve supervisors about third-party services, banks tell us that they hear a lot of sales pitches for algorithmic lending, outsourcing customer service, and the like, when what they are really looking for is an app that can enhance relationship banking: their natural advantage.</p>
<p>Any discussion about technological advances has to give prominent attention to artificial intelligence, and I note that later this morning a paper on the use of AI technology will be part of an upcoming session. Before I get into what AI might mean for community banking, let me say that AI has been of particular interest to me, and I have spoken about it several times this year, because of the technology's potential to transform both our economy, and in other fundamental ways, how we live and interact with each other in society.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20251008a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;While there is high uncertainty about these outcomes, I believe that the speed at which AI is being implemented means that we should all be thinking about the full range of possibilities and be prepared for any one of them to come to pass, perhaps sooner than we think.</p>
<p>AI was included for the first time in the CSBS survey in 2024, when AI for customer support was an important focus for 31 percent of respondents, a share that jumped to 47 percent in this year's survey. Of course, earlier forms of AI have been used by larger banks in customer service for many years, and the big development for community banks seems to be that newer forms of GenAI could be lowering costs and expanding access enough to make it cost-effective for smaller institutions.</p>
<p>Customer service is one obvious area where AI could change community banking, but there are others. Cybersecurity and fraud have been and continue to be leading concerns for community bankers, and AI represents new opportunities for addressing these concerns. It is my understanding that automated fraud detection, in particular, hasn't been cost effective for some community banks, which haven't been able to compete with larger banks that have the economies of scale to deploy these services. But the huge buildout in AI capacity now underway, along with the explosion in the number of firms seeking to get into AI-based services, may have the potential for driving down costs enough to make AI-based fraud detection more feasible for community banks.</p>
<p>Yet, AI represents new risks as well as new opportunities.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20251008a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;In addition to community banks worrying about criminals defrauding them or their customers with forgeries on checks or in credit card transactions, they face a new threat from entirely forged identities, with so-called "deepfakes." Deepfakes use GenAI to recreate voices and images of real people, allowing fraudsters to hold convincing conversations using simulated voices that sound like the individual they are impersonating, responding in ways that person might realistically respond. Using only a brief sample of audio and access to information about individuals on the internet, criminals employing GenAI can impersonate a close relative in a crisis or a high-value bank client seeking to complete a transaction at their bank. What was once the stuff of movies is now a reality, and a lot is at stake. The direct and indirect costs of all cybercrimes have already grown from 1 percent to 10 percent of global gross domestic product.<a name="f3"></a><a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20251008a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;The use of deepfakes in cybercrime is growing very quickly. According to one source, there has been a twentyfold increase in deepfake attacks over the last three years.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20251008a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a></p>
<p>Community bankers also need to be aware of the potential for AI to affect customers' livelihoods. I tend to be an optimist about the potential for AI to make workers more productive, raise living standards, and create more jobs in new industries, but I am realistic in my expectation that it could cause considerable dislocation of workers and businesses, at least in the short run.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20251008a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;Communities dependent on a small number of employers or a single industry that is significantly affected by AI could experience these dislocations. At the same time, the large investments underway in data centers, many of them in remote or rural areas where electricity is less expensive, could bring new business for community banks. For example, during the most recent Community Advisory Council (CAC) meeting, the Federal Reserve Board heard about a major data center built in Ellendale, North Dakota, a community of less than 1,500 people. The CAC member noted that the addition of a major data center had vastly increased the community's needs for services. At this point it is hard to tell how much AI will truly transform the economy and banking, but I think that community bankers will need to be prepared to change, as ever, if your communities are affected.</p>
<p>I have covered a couple topics so far today. I have spoken about the advent of fintech, and the way it is transforming banking and competition between community banks and larger banks&mdash;risks and opportunities. I have spoken about technology more generally, and specifically about how artificial intelligence may change the economy and banking. Many of these uncertainties echo those that most workers and businesses are facing in our fast-evolving economy. One group of people that I believe have dealt very effectively with a changing economy are community bankers. Considering the changes that have swept over our banking and financial system over the decades, if you are a community banker sitting here today, that itself is a testament to your ingenuity, resilience, and adaptability. But I would be remiss if I didn't discuss a further challenge to community banks in this regulatory environment&mdash;deregulation of large banks.</p>
<p>As community bankers well know, it was not community banks that fueled the 2008 financial crisis&mdash;it was the largest, most complex firms whose excessive risk-taking nearly brought down the system. In the years since, strong reforms&mdash;higher capital, tougher liquidity requirements, and rigorous stress testing&mdash;have helped to safeguard our economy. Yet recent proposed rollbacks in capital standards for the largest banks, in the supervisory framework for large financial institutions, and in the rigor of stress testing of large banks threaten to erode those protections. These shifts would not make the system safer; they would leave community banks once again exposed to the fallout if the largest players stumble. Because we cannot afford to repeat those mistakes, I have spoken out against weakening standards for large banks, and I will continue to do so.</p>
<p>In closing, I'll note my admiration for community bankers who know how to confront uncertainty, to sort out the risks and the opportunities, and make the decisions and investments that have allowed community banks to continue to play the indispensable role you serve for your customers and communities. We all share an interest in responsible regulation, which means promoting the safety and soundness of community banks and compliance with applicable law but also ensuring that regulation is appropriate to the size, business model, and risk profile of regulated institutions. We all want community banks to succeed and continue to play their important role in the communities they serve. One reason that I believe community banking has a bright future is that all the people here today recognize the unique and essential function of community banks in our financial system and are helping to support community banking.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<li><i>World&rsquo;s first Sustainability-Linked Financing Sukuk by Emirates Islamic successfully listed on Nasdaq Dubai</i></li>
<li><i>This listing drives the total value of outstanding Sukuk on Nasdaq Dubai past the USD 100 billion mark</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Nasdaq Dubai welcomed the successful listing of Emirates Islamic&rsquo;s USD 500 million Sustainability-Linked Financing Sukuk, marking the world's first Sukuk issuance of its kind.</p>
<p>Issued under Emirates Islamic&rsquo;s USD 4 billion Sukuk Programme, the landmark Sukuk underscores the bank&rsquo;s leadership in sustainable Islamic finance and its role in advancing the UAE&rsquo;s sustainability agenda.</p>
<p>The Sukuk attracted strong international investor demand, highlighting the increasing appeal of sustainable Islamic finance, with orders reaching USD 1.2 billion, an oversubscription of 2.4 times. This enabled the bank to tighten the profit rate to 4.540% per annum, at a spread of 95 basis points over 5-year US Treasuries.</p>
<p>To mark the successful listing, Hesham Abdulla Al Qassim, Chairman of Emirates Islamic and Vice Chairman and Managing Director of Emirates NBD, rang the bell at Nasdaq Dubai&rsquo;s market-opening ceremony alongside Hamed Ali, CEO of Nasdaq Dubai and Dubai Financial Market (DFM).</p>
<p><b>Hesham Abdulla Al Qassim, Chairman, Emirates Islamic and Vice Chairman and Managing Director of Emirates NBD</b>, said: "The listing of our pioneering Sustainability-Linked Financing Sukuk on Nasdaq Dubai underscores Emirates Islamic&rsquo;s financial strength and our commitment to achieving the UAE&rsquo;s Net Zero 2050 ambitions. This landmark transaction, a global first, demonstrates our ability to deliver advanced, Shari&rsquo;ah-compliant solutions that resonate with a diverse international investor base, reflecting the growing appetite for sustainable Islamic finance.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Hamed Ali, CEO of Nasdaq Dubai and DFM</b>, added: "The listing of Emirates Islamic&rsquo;s USD 500 million Sustainability-Linked Financing Sukuk represents a landmark moment for Nasdaq Dubai and the wider Islamic finance industry. It highlights Dubai&rsquo;s growing role as a leading global hub for Islamic and sustainable capital markets, while reinforcing our commitment to providing issuers and investors with innovative financing solutions that support the UAE&rsquo;s long-term economic development and climate ambitions."</p>
<p>Following this listing, Emirates Islamic Sukuk's total outstanding listings on Nasdaq Dubai have reached USD 2.77 billion. This brings the total value of all outstanding Sukuk listed on the exchange to over USD 100 billion, further cementing Nasdaq Dubai's position as a leading global hub for Islamic fixed-income products.</p>
<p>As a premier platform for both fixed income and ESG instruments, Nasdaq Dubai now hosts USD 140 billion in fixed income and USD 28.7 billion in ESG listings, including USD 1.55 billion in sustainability-linked issuances.</p>

<title>Eventus Launches Frank AI, New Technology Purpose-Built For Financial Compliance, Surveillance Analytics - Deterministic AI Approach Brings Secure, Repeatable, Transparent Results Critical To Regulatory Compliance</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/eventus-launches-frank-ai-new-technology-purpose-built-for-financial-compliance-2025108/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/eventus-launches-frank-ai-new-technology-purpose-built-for-financial-compliance-2025108/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4526828-1&amp;h=4224525151&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eventus.com%2F&amp;a=Eventus" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eventus</a>, a leading provider of comprehensive, at-scale trade surveillance and financial risk solutions, today announced the launch of Frank AI, its artificial intelligence solution purpose-built for financial compliance teams and surveillance analytics. Eventus' use of deterministic AI for the trade surveillance solution ensures that clients achieve secure, repeatable and transparent results &ndash; a necessity for regulatory inquiries and audits.</p>
<p>Harnessing technologies including natural language processing (NLP) and large language models (LLMs) and fully integrated into the firm's Validus platform, Frank includes a suite of AI tools and behavioral analytics to help clients automate complex processes, improve accuracy, dramatically reduce alert noise and enhance operational efficiency, as well as identify nuanced patterns of misconduct more effectively in their trade surveillance and risk monitoring programs. Frank is compatible with many public LLMs, including OpenAI, Anthropic and Google, enabling it to continually leverage updates from the world's foremost AI companies to remain at the cutting edge of performance and capability. Enterprise-grade security &ndash; including an on-premise deployment option &ndash; with comprehensive data protection is a fundamental part of the offering.</p>
<p>Travis Schwab, Eventus CEO, said: "We're excited about the groundbreaking nature of Frank AI and the power it puts into our clients' hands for compliance and risk analysis. It provides extreme flexibility, adapting to different analytical needs and user expertise levels. We've spent the past year investing significantly in processing infrastructure to provide us with much greater scale to handle the needs of the world's largest financial institutions. As we transition our clients to the new architecture, they can deploy Frank AI within hours, enjoy seamless integration with their existing technology infrastructure and leverage the full range of capabilities it will provide. Clients in beta testing have been enthusiastic about its effectiveness and potential."</p>
<p>Frank AI enables queries using conversational English as a chat interface into Validus data, allowing users to transform their daily workflow and interact on-demand with their real-time data intuitively without compromising on transparency, repeatability or security. They can ask free-form questions without needing advanced programming or coding expertise and generate reports as well as extract insights and deterministic results from their queries. Users can automate manual tasks, including report generation and query building.</p>
<p>For example, instead of navigating complex database queries or multiple system interfaces, an analyst can say: "Show me all cross-market wash trading patterns involving equity and futures for Client XYZ in the past 30 days, including related party analysis." Frank AI processes this request, analyzes the relevant data across multiple asset classes and presents comprehensive results with full audit trails &ndash; a task that previously required hours of manual investigation across multiple systems.</p>
<p>Unlike generic generative AI models which interpret existing text and provide probabilistic answers, Frank AI was designed specifically for financial compliance and surveillance analytics. Repeatable querying ensures accuracy, reducing the risk of AI "hallucinations," or incorrect, unpredictable or misleading responses common in generative AI. Data never leaves the secure host, enabling full compliance and protection of sensitive information. The AI is trained on Validus-specific data tables for contextual accuracy and relevant results, with users able to retrieve, analyze and interact with live data, returning precise, fact-based results. Frank AI assists users in generating reports with structured, actionable insights rather than open-ended text interpretation.</p>
<p>Martina Rejsj&ouml;, Eventus Vice President, Product Management, said: "Frank AI sets a new standard for AI in financial compliance by solving the fundamental challenge that has prevented widespread AI adoption in regulated environments &ndash; the need for deterministic, auditable and secure AI responses. Frank AI delivers consistent, traceable results that compliance teams can trust and regulators can verify. Our commitment to the need for explainability and regulatory readiness has defined our AI roadmap. This breakthrough enables our clients to harness the power of AI while maintaining full regulatory compliance and operational control."</p>
<p>Eventus has used machine learning for many years, primarily for alert remediation. No competitor combines advanced analytics with procedural automation, preserving supportable information and explainability that compliance professionals need to satisfy any audit or regulatory inquiry. Frank AI takes the firm's advanced intelligence capabilities to an entirely new level, Schwab said.</p>

<title>EEX’s Nordic Power Liquidity Programme Drives Volume Growth In First Month</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/eexs-nordic-power-liquidity-programme-drives-volume-growth-in-first-month-2025108/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/eexs-nordic-power-liquidity-programme-drives-volume-growth-in-first-month-2025108/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The European Energy Exchange (EEX) has seen a significant traded volume growth on its Nordic Power derivatives market following the start of the comprehensive liquidity programme on 1 September.</p>
<p>The total monthly volume exceeded 2 TWh, a 334% growth compared to the same period last year, which was the highest reported monthly volume in 2025. In September alone, trading volumes exceeded the volume level of the total first half of the year (January &ndash; June 2025; 1.8 TWh) The first month of the programme also saw the first trade in the Norwegian NO3 zone trade, in addition to several trades concluded with System Price and other Danish and Swedish Zonal futures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The EEX member base on the Nordic power derivatives market covers Scandinavian, continental European and US-based market participants. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Peter Reitz, CEO of EEX, comments: &ldquo;<em>While the market is just starting to kick off, it&rsquo;s positive to see that the Nordic trading community, including international and local trading participants, is ready to restore the volumes and thus liquidity on this market. We are delighted to see the significant growth over the first month of our initiatives and looking forward to working together to drive this trend forward.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>EEX&rsquo;s product offering for the region includes both Nordic System Price contracts, the so-called Zonal Futures with price determination for each Nordic delivery area, and Implied EPADs, a combination of Zonal Futures and the Nordic System Price Futures, which provide the benefit of the location spread effect. This setup reduces capital requirements through cross-margining effects.</p>

<title>Bank Of England: Financial Policy Committee Record – October 2025</title>

<p><span>The Financial Policy Committee (FPC) meets to identify risks to financial stability and agree policy actions aimed at safeguarding the resilience of the UK financial system.</span></p>
<div class="section-heading">
<h2 id="chapter-0">Record of the Financial Policy Committee meeting on 2 October 2025</h2>
<div class="box-highlight">
<h3><a id="_Hlk193965425"></a>Headline judgements and policy actions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Risks associated with geopolitical tensions, global fragmentation of trade and financial markets, and pressures on sovereign debt markets remain elevated. The risk of a sharp market correction has increased. A crystallisation of such global risks could have a material impact on the UK as an open economy and global financial centre.</li>
<li>Despite persistent material uncertainty around the global macroeconomic outlook, risky asset valuations have increased and credit spreads have compressed. Measures of risk premia across many risky asset classes have tightened further since the last FPC meeting in June 2025. On a number of measures, equity market valuations appear stretched, particularly for technology companies focused on Artificial Intelligence (AI). This, when combined with increasing concentration within market indices, leaves equity markets particularly exposed should expectations around the impact of AI become less optimistic.</li>
<li>There have been some notable credit defaults in the US automotive sector since the last meeting. These underscore some of the risks the FPC have previously highlighted around high leverage, weak underwriting standards, opacity, and complex structures.</li>
<li>Term premia in sovereign bond markets have increased in many advanced economies, driven in part by expectations of higher debt issuance. Some key jurisdictions have experienced political uncertainty over the level and pace of reforms to improve the fiscal outlooks (e.g. political deadlocks in France and Japan). This increases the vulnerability of sovereign debt markets and adds to pressure on governments&rsquo; capacity to respond to shocks.</li>
<li>In the US, there has been continued commentary about Federal Reserve independence. Central bank operational independence underpins monetary and financial stability &ndash; and therefore lowers borrowing costs for households and businesses. A sudden or significant change in perceptions of Federal Reserve credibility could result in a sharp re-pricing of US dollar assets, including in US sovereign debt markets, with the potential for increased volatility, risk premia, and global spillovers.</li>
<li>Uncertainty around the global risk environment increases the risk that markets have not fully priced in possible adverse outcomes, and a sudden correction could occur should any of these risks crystallise. A sharp correction could interact with vulnerabilities in the system of market-based finance, adversely affecting the cost and availability of finance for households and businesses. As an open economy with a global financial centre, the risk of spillovers to the UK financial system from such global shocks is material.</li>
<li>Domestically, the Committee judged that UK households and corporates have remained resilient but face continued pressure from higher costs of living and the continued adjustment to higher borrowing costs.</li>
<li>The FPC maintains its judgement that the UK banking system has the capacity to support households and businesses even if economic and financial conditions were to be substantially worse than expected.</li>
<li>The FPC decided to maintain the UK countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) rate at 2%.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>1: The Financial Policy Committee (FPC) seeks to ensure the UK financial system is prepared for, and resilient to, the wide range of risks it could face, so that it is able to absorb rather than amplify shocks, and serve UK households and businesses, thus supporting stability and long-term growth in the UK economy.</p>
<p>2: The Committee met on 2 October 2025 to agree its view on the outlook for UK financial stability. The FPC discussed the risks faced by the UK financial system and assessed the resilience of the system to those risks. On that basis, the Committee agreed its intended policy actions.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-0-0">The overall risk environment</h3>
<p>3: Risks associated with geopolitical tensions, global fragmentation of trade and financial markets, and pressures on sovereign debt markets remained elevated. The risk of a sharp market correction had increased. A crystallisation of such global risks could have a material impact on the UK as an open economy and global financial centre.</p>

<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-1">Global risk outlook and vulnerabilities in financial markets</h3>
<p>4: Measures of risk premia across many risky asset classes had further tightened since the last FPC meeting in June 2025, and credit spreads remained compressed despite high levels of uncertainty.</p>
<p>5: Equity market valuations had increased since Q2, to near all-time highs, partly driven by strong Q2 earnings of US technology firms. The price appreciation of the largest technology firms this year had increased the concentration within US equity indices to record levels. The market share of the top 5 members of the S&amp;P 500, at close to 30%, was higher than at any point in the past 50 years.</p>
<p>6: Equity valuations appeared stretched, particularly in backward-looking metrics in the US. For example, the earnings yield implied by the Cyclically-Adjusted Price-to-Earnings (CAPE) ratio was close to the lowest level in 25 years &ndash; comparable to the peak of the dot com bubble. Forward-looking valuation metrics and compression in US equity risk premia also remained elevated relative to historical levels, with the S&amp;P 500 at a one-year forward price-to-earnings ratio of 25 times, but remained below the levels reached during the dot com bubble. Some technology companies were trading at valuation ratios which implied high future earnings growth, and concentrations within US equity indices meant that any AI-led price adjustment would have a high level of pass-through into the returns for investors exposed to the aggregate index.</p>
<p>7: The Committee noted the future outlook for valuations was uncertain, with both downside and upside risks. Downside factors included disappointing AI capability/adoption progress or increased competition, which could drive a re-evaluation of currently high expected future earnings. Material bottlenecks to AI progress &ndash; from power, data, or commodity supply chains &ndash; as well as conceptual breakthroughs which change the anticipated AI infrastructure requirements for the development and utilisation of powerful AI models could also harm valuations, including for companies whose revenue expectations are derived from high levels of anticipated AI infrastructure investment.</p>
<p>8: Many measures of risk premia had compressed further since the Q2 meeting, with global credit spreads getting close to historically low levels and leveraged loan spreads remaining in the bottom quartile. The risk of sharp corrections in asset prices remained high. There had been some notable credit defaults since the last meeting. These involved two US corporates active in the automotive sector. While operating different business models, their financing appeared to display several common factors including high leverage, weak underwriting standards, opacity, complex structures, and the degree of reliance on credit rating agencies, illustrating how corporate defaults could impact bank resilience and credit markets simultaneously. These events highlighted some of the risks the FPC had previously set out.</p>
<p>9: Existing vulnerabilities in market-based finance set out in the July 2025 Financial Stability Report (FSR) remained, and could amplify price moves across markets, potentially affecting the availability and cost of credit in the UK.</p>
<p>10: The economic impacts of US tariffs, and reciprocal tariffs on US goods in other jurisdictions, had not yet been fully realised. The impact on businesses in heavily impacted industries &ndash; such as manufacturing, automotives and construction &ndash; remained unclear. Uncertainty around further developments in trade policy posed a risk to the global macroeconomic outlook. While measures of correlation between the dollar and US assets had returned to within historical norms, this could change as investors reassess their positions.</p>
<p>11: In the US, there had been continued commentary about Federal Reserve independence. Central bank operational independence underpins monetary and financial stability &ndash; and therefore lowers borrowing costs for households and businesses. A sudden or significant change in perceptions of Federal Reserve credibility could result in a sharp re-pricing of US dollar assets, including in US sovereign debt markets, with the potential for increased volatility, risk premia, and global spillovers. The consequences for other sovereign borrowing costs, which had tended to be correlated with US interest rates, would be a key uncertainty in such a scenario.</p>
<p>12: World and Advanced Economies Gross Debt to GDP ratios increased to 92.3% and 108.5%, respectively, in 2024 and were forecast to increase each year to 2030 &ndash; peaking at 99.6% and 113.3%, respectively.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financial-policy-committee-record/2025/october-2025#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[1]</a></sup>&nbsp;Term premia in sovereign bond markets had increased in many advanced economies, driven in part by higher real interest rates as the outlook for debt issuance was high. Some key jurisdictions had experienced political uncertainty over the level and pace of reforms to improve the fiscal outlook (e.g. political deadlocks in France and Japan). These challenges had been reflected in sovereign debt yields.</p>
<p>13: As highlighted in the July FSR, there were a number of risk channels through which pressures on sovereign debt globally could affect financial stability, including in the UK via cross-border spillovers. These channels included: higher interest rates leading to tighter global financial conditions; increased market volatility interacting with vulnerabilities in market-based-finance; the reduced ability of governments to respond to future shocks; and the potential for capital outflows from overseas investors. Correlations between movements in yields across sovereign issuers could act to transmit and amplify stress in government bond markets.</p>
<p>14: Global geopolitical risks remained elevated. Conflicts in Europe and the Middle East had raised concerns about global energy supply. There had been concerns that these conflicts might escalate and create supply chain volatility. However, oil prices and shipping costs had moderated since the Q2 meeting.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-2">UK Household and corporate debt vulnerabilities</h3>
<p>15: The Committee judged that UK households and corporates had remained resilient, but faced continued pressure from the adjustment to higher debt servicing costs and the cost of living.</p>
<p>16: The outlook for households was gradually improving as the share of households expected to refix at higher rates was falling. The aggregate household debt to income ratio was at its lowest level since 2001. Lenders had changed their behaviour following the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) statement on mortgage stress rates in March. A number of lenders had recently taken up the Prudential Regulatory Authority's (PRA) option to modify their loan-to-income (LTI) flow limit, following the FPC&rsquo;s updated Recommendation in Q2, but the full impact of these policy changes had not yet been felt in the mortgage market.</p>
<p>17: Aggregate measures of UK corporate debt remained significantly below their pandemic peaks. Some highly leveraged corporate borrowers relying on market-based finance remained particularly exposed to global shocks. But the share of vulnerable borrowers with low interest coverage ratios had remained steady since Q2. The FPC was considering the availability of finance for high growth potential SMEs as part of its work on supporting economic growth and welcomed the publication of a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/bank-overground/2025/unlocking-growth-what-can-the-literature-tell-us-about-whats-holding-back-high-growth-firms">staff literature review</a>. The FPC would present its conclusions on this work in Q4.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-3"><a id="_Hlk194308082"></a>Banking sector resilience</h3>
<p>18: The FPC maintained its judgement that the UK banking system had the capacity to support households and businesses, even if economic and financial conditions were to be substantially worse than expected.</p>
<p>19: The UK banking system remained appropriately capitalised, had high levels of liquidity and asset quality remained strong. Aggregate resilience for the major UK banks across the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) risk-weighted capital ratio, Tier 1 leverage ratio and the liquidity coverage ratio were broadly unchanged compared to Q1 results at 14.5%, 5.1% and 151%, respectively. Major UK banks continued to report robust earnings, with return on tangible equity above their cost of equity and the aggregate Price to Tangible Book ratio reaching 1.3 times.</p>
<p>20: The FPC discussed its setting of the UK CCyB rate. The Committee&rsquo;s principal aim in setting the UK CCyB rate was to help ensure that the UK banking system was better able to absorb shocks without an unwarranted restriction in essential services, such as the supply of credit, to the UK real economy. Setting the UK CCyB rate enabled the FPC to adjust the capital requirements of the UK banking system to the changing scale of risk of losses on banks&rsquo; UK exposures over the course of the financial cycle. The approach therefore included an assessment of financial vulnerabilities and banks' capacity to absorb such losses, including the potential impact of shocks.</p>
<p>21: In considering the appropriate setting of the UK CCyB rate, the FPC discussed its judgements around underlying vulnerabilities that could amplify economic shocks. The Committee noted that while the global risk environment remained elevated, UK households and corporates remained resilient in aggregate and credit conditions reflected the macroeconomic outlook. The UK banking system also remained resilient, maintaining appropriate levels of capital.</p>
<p>22: In view of these considerations, the FPC decided to maintain the UK CCyB rate at 2%. Maintaining a neutral setting of the UK CCyB rate in the region of 2% would help to ensure that banks continued to have capacity to absorb unexpected future shocks without an unwarranted restriction in essential services, such as the supply of credit, to the UK real economy.</p>
<p>23: The Committee would continue to monitor the evolution of financial conditions closely, as well as reviewing the results of the 2025 Bank Capital Stress Test, to ensure the setting of the CCyB remained appropriate.</p>
<p>24: In line with its statutory obligations, the FPC reviewed its Direction to the PRA on the leverage ratio, issued in September 2022.</p>
<p>25: The FPC continued to consider a leverage ratio to be an essential part of the framework for capital requirements for the UK banking system, and judged that the leverage ratio set out in the 2022 Direction should remain unchanged.</p>
<p>26: Having regard to the interaction between monetary and macroprudential policy, the Committee confirmed the appropriateness of continuing to exclude central bank reserves from the leverage ratio, and of not recalibrating the minimum leverage ratio requirement of 3.25% to reflect an increase in reserves since 2016. The FPC would keep this under review as part of future reviews of the leverage ratio framework.</p>
<p>27: More generally, as noted in the 2025 Q2 Record, the Committee would refresh its assessment of the overall level of capital requirements in the UK banking system and provide an update on progress and next steps in the December 2025 FSR. Given it is an important part of the capital framework, the leverage ratio would form part of the considerations. The Committee agreed that robust prudential standards and a resilient financial system supported growth and competitiveness by ensuring a continuous supply of financing to the real economy even in times of stress or high uncertainty, and by providing firms, customers, and counterparties with reassurance that they could do business in the UK safely and with confidence.</p>
<p>28: The FPC welcomed the commencement of the Bank Resolution (Recapitalisation) Act 2025 on 16 July. The Act introduced a new recapitalisation payment mechanism, primarily designed to facilitate UK small bank resolution if that was in the public interest. The FPC supported this targeted enhancement of the UK bank resolution regime which had helped to ensure the regime remains fit for purpose and ready for use.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-4">Resilience of the gilt repo market</h3>
<p>29: The FPC welcomed the publication of the Bank&rsquo;s Discussion Paper&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/paper/2025/discussion-paper/enhancing-the-resilience-of-the-gilt-repo-market">Enhancing the resilience of the gilt repo market</a>. The Discussion Paper seeks views from market participants on the effectiveness and impact of a range of potential reforms to enhance the resilience of the gilt repo market in stress. It focuses on greater central clearing of gilt repo and minimum haircuts on non-centrally cleared gilt repo transactions, as well as views on a broader range of other potential initiatives. The Committee noted that this work would help advance a finding of last year&rsquo;s System Wide Exploratory Scenario exercise that there was merit in exploring market structure reforms to improve resilience in this area.</p>
<p>The following members of the Committee were present at the 2 October Policy meeting:</p>

<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span lang="EN-GB">The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the financial markets regulator and supervisor for the EU, has announced the upcoming publication of SMS for equity and equity-like financial instruments. This announcement is intended to assist market participants with their preparations to apply the new quoting requirements, even though the official implementation date has not yet been specified.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<div>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span lang="EN-GB">The Markets in Financial Regulation Review (MIFIR) has introduced lower and upper limits to the new quoting obligations for SIs. The revised regulatory technical standard (RTS) 1, once published in the Official Journal (OJ) in the coming weeks, will introduce several provisions. Although the exact publication date is not yet known, ESMA is reminding some of these changes now to enable market participants to prepare in advance.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span lang="EN-GB">Among the provisions applicable 20 days after publication are:&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;- the minimum quoting size for SIs and</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span lang="EN-GB">- the threshold up to which transparency obligations apply to SIs.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span lang="EN-GB">Both thresholds depend on the standard market size (SMS), determined by the average value of transactions (AVT) liquidity bands which has been recalibrated in the RTS 1. The day before the application date of the revised RTS 1, ESMA will publish the SMS for liquid equity and equity-like financial instruments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span lang="EN-GB">The full list of new SMS will be available through&nbsp;</span><a href="https://registers.esma.europa.eu/publication/searchRegister?core=esma_registers_fitrs_files"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">FITRS in the XML</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;and through the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://registers.esma.europa.eu/publication/searchRegister?core=esma_registers_fitrs_nonequities"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Register web interface</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">. </span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span lang="EN-GB">Another important provision applying 20 days after the publication in the OJ is the exclusion of give-up and give-in transactions from post-trade transparency reporting when executed off venue.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span lang="EN-GB">The remaining RTS 1 provisions, including a new set of pre-trade transparency requirements and amended post-trade transparency details, will take effect on 2 March 2026.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<title>US Federal Agencies Issue Proposal To Focus Supervision On Material Financial Risks</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/us-federal-agencies-issue-proposal-to-focus-supervision-on-material-financial-ri-2025108/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the agencies) today issued a joint notice of proposed rulemaking that would continue their effort to focus supervision on material financial risks. Among other things, the proposal would define the term &ldquo;unsafe or unsound practice&rdquo; for purposes of section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and revise the supervisory framework for the issuance of matters requiring attention (MRAs) and other supervisory communications.</p>
<p>By establishing a uniform definition for the term &ldquo;unsafe or unsound practice&rdquo; for the purposes of the agencies&rsquo; enforcement and supervisory authority under 12 U.S.C. 1818, the proposed rule would promote greater clarity and certainty regarding certain enforcement and supervision standards and ensure bank supervisors prioritize concerns related to material financial risks over those regarding policies, process, documentation, and other nonfinancial risks. The proposed rule would also establish uniform standards for when and how the agencies may communicate MRAs and non-binding supervisory observations as part of the examination process. Finally, the proposal would provide for the tailoring of enforcement actions and MRAs.</p>
<p>Comments on the attached proposal are due 60 days after the date of publication in the&nbsp;<em>Federal Register</em>.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the agencies) today issued a joint notice of proposed rulemaking that would codify the elimination of reputation risk from their supervisory programs.</p>
<p>The proposed rule would define &ldquo;reputation risk&rdquo; and prohibit the agencies from criticizing or taking adverse action against an institution on the basis of reputation risk. The proposed rule would also prohibit the agencies from requiring, instructing, or encouraging an institution to close customer accounts or take other actions on the basis of a person or entity&rsquo;s political, social, cultural, or religious views or beliefs, constitutionally protected speech, or solely on the basis of politically disfavored but lawful business activities perceived to present reputation risk.</p>
<p>This proposed rulemaking would also respond to concerns expressed in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/08/12/2025-15341/guaranteeing-fair-banking-for-all-americans" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Executive Order 14331,&nbsp;<em>Guaranteeing Fair Banking for All Americans</em></a>, that the use of reputation risk can be a pretext for restricting law-abiding individuals&rsquo; and businesses&rsquo; access to financial services on the basis of political or religious beliefs or lawful business activities.</p>

<title>US Comptroller Of The Currency Issues Statement On Areas Of Focus As FDIC Board Member</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/us-comptroller-of-the-currency-issues-statement-on-areas-of-focus-as-fdic-board-2025107/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/us-comptroller-of-the-currency-issues-statement-on-areas-of-focus-as-fdic-board-2025107/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Comptroller of the Currency Jonathan V. Gould issued the following statement today at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation&rsquo;s (FDIC) board meeting about his areas of focus in his capacity as an FDIC board member:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for the warm welcome to the FDIC board. I am very excited to work with Acting FDIC Chairman Hill and Director Vought to advance the President&rsquo;s agenda on matters both interagency and FDIC-specific. With respect to the former, we will be considering several interagency initiatives today in which the OCC and FDIC teams worked collaboratively and that exemplify how the interagency process works best. With respect to FDIC-specific matters, I intend to focus on and look forward to working with the Acting Chairman on the following areas:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Rebuilding resolution execution capabilities. I want to distinguish specifically here between resolution &ldquo;execution&rdquo;&mdash;the ability to take actions that facilitate orderly resolution&mdash;and resolution &ldquo;planning&rdquo;&mdash;the hypothetical exercise of how an organization would or should fail. I am skeptical of the efficacy of the latter as well as, in some cases, the legality of related agency requirements and expectations. On the other hand, resolution execution is one of the FDIC&rsquo;s core functions, and I will be focused on ensuring that the FDIC has the capabilities to carry out these core functions effectively. Relatedly, and as I have previously said in Congressional testimony following the bank failures of 2023, I believe greater transparency into the FDIC&rsquo;s actions during that time should inform our efforts to improve its resolution execution in the future.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Clarifying the agency&rsquo;s approach to the management of the Deposit Insurance Fund. The methodologies employed by the agency to calculate insurance premiums or determine ratings that affect premiums, whether in the ordinary course or for special assessments, have, at times, lacked clarity and have spawned litigation, gaming or both. Insurance premiums should be clear, fair, and designed to limit market distortions.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Addressing remaining issues around agency culture. I know the FDIC has already taken a number of steps under Acting Chairman Hill&rsquo;s leadership to address these past abuses and restore a culture of accountability. I look forward to supporting his continued reform efforts.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;Reforming the FDIC&rsquo;s process for evaluating deposit insurance applications. The agency&rsquo;s approach since the Financial Crisis has been an impediment to the chartering of new banks in this country. This needs to change if we want to restore a dynamic banking system. As the statutory factors for granting deposit insurance are largely taken into account by the chartering authority, the FDIC should perform a circumscribed review, as it did in the years following the enactment of FDICIA. The OCC is committed to collaborating with the FDIC to align and improve upon our de novo bank application process. It is vitally important for all federal banking agencies to have clear and transparent application processes with established timeframes that are actually followed absent extraordinary circumstances, whether for chartering, deposit insurance, business combinations, or other applications.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;Supporting state bank preemption rights. Federal preemption is not the exclusive purview of the federal banking system. In the 1997 amendments to the Riegle-Neal Act, Congress put state banks on parity with national banks when it comes to preemption of state laws affecting host state branches. Similarly, state banks benefit from interest rate preemption under Section 27 of the FDI Act. State banks should get the benefit of this federal preemption, and I encourage the FDIC to take additional steps to support these Congressionally-granted rights.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;Updating our understanding of bank funding. The FDIC, like the OCC, still utilizes funding and deposit categories that do not have clear predictive value when it comes to managing liquidity risk. We should re-examine these antiquated notions and develop a more flexible predictive framework going forward, including for assessments.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;Supporting community banks. The FDIC supervises more community banks than any other federal banking agency. These institutions are vitally important to our economy and our local communities. For too long, regulation and supervision have been insufficiently tailored for community banks, which has hampered their ability to serve our communities and drive economic growth. The Acting Chairman is already taking steps to deliver relief on this front. I support these efforts, and the OCC is moving in similar fashion.</p>
<p>I thank the Acting Chairman for his indulgence in letting me outline my areas of focus, and I look forward to working with him and Director Vought on these and other matters. I am confident that the FDIC is now back on track under the Acting Chairman&rsquo;s leadership.</p>

<title>14m Unfair Motor Loans Due Compensation Under UK Financial Conduct Authority-Proposed Scheme</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/14m-unfair-motor-loans-due-compensation-under-uk-financial-conduct-authority-pro-2025107/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Payouts on an expected 14m unfair motor finance agreements could start next year, under an industry-wide compensation scheme proposed by the FCA.</p>
<div class="fca-about"><section class="copy-block fca-about">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA estimates people would receive around &pound;700 per agreement, on average. Based on the number of consumers the FCA estimates could take part in the scheme, lenders could pay out &pound;8.2 billion in compensation.</p>
<p>Motor finance companies broke laws and regulations in force at the time by failing to disclose important information. This led to unfairness, with consumers denied the chance to negotiate or find a better deal and, in some instances, paying more for their loan. &nbsp;</p>
<p>A compensation scheme is the best, most efficient way of getting compensation to those owed it and would make it simpler for those who would otherwise struggle to claim. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Research commissioned by the FCA shows almost half of those aware of possible compensation, but who had not yet made a claim, (46%) cite a lack of clarity on whether a claim would be eligible as a barrier, and nearly a quarter (24%) say uncertainty about the level of compensation makes it less likely they would seek compensation. However, 81% of those who were considering making a claim say a compensation scheme would give them the confidence to do so.</p>
<p>Nikhil Rathi, chief executive of the FCA, said:</p>
<p>'Many motor finance lenders did not comply with the law or the rules. Now we have legal clarity, it&rsquo;s time their customers get fair compensation. Our scheme aims to be simple for people to use and lenders to implement. &nbsp;</p>
<p>'We recognise that there will be a wide range of views on the scheme, its scope, timeframe and how compensation is calculated. On such a complex issue, not everyone will get everything they would like. But we want to work together on the best possible scheme and draw a line under this issue quickly. That certainty is vital, so a trusted motor finance market can continue to serve millions of families every year.'</p>
<p>The scheme would be free to access for consumers and cost-effective for firms. Without a scheme, many cases would go through the courts or the Financial Ombudsman Service, resulting in significantly higher legal and administrative costs for firms and consumers, lengthy delays and uncertain outcomes for all involved. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The FCA is now asking for feedback. It has sought to balance several principles to deliver an easy-to-access and simple-to-deliver scheme, providing fair compensation promptly while ensuring the continued integrity of the motor finance market. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>How the scheme would work</h2>
<p>The scheme would cover motor finance agreements taken out between 6 April 2007 and 1 November 2024 where commission was payable by the lender to the broker. &nbsp;Those who are concerned they weren&rsquo;t told key details about their motor finance arrangement &ndash; for example, about commission payments &ndash; should complain to their lender now if they haven&rsquo;t done so already. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Four in 10 (41%) of those who've had motor finance agreements and know about possible compensation are unaware they needn&rsquo;t use a claims management or law firm to make a claim. However, there&rsquo;s no need as people can&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/consumers/car-finance-complaints" title="Car finance claims">submit their own complaint</a>&nbsp;using a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/documents/template-motor-finance-complaint-letter.docx" title="template-motor-finance-complaint-letter.docx">template letter (DOCX)</a>&nbsp;on the FCA&rsquo;s website. Those who choose to use a claims manager or law firm could lose a significant amount of any compensation owed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the proposed scheme goes live, lenders will contact those who have already complained. If they don&rsquo;t hear back after 1 month, lenders will assume they should review the case. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Those who have already complained before the scheme gets up and running are likely to receive compensation faster. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Those who haven&rsquo;t complained will be contacted by their lender within 6 months of the scheme starting. People will be asked if they want to opt-in to the scheme to have their case reviewed. They&rsquo;ll have 6 months to decide. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Those motor finance borrowers who don&rsquo;t receive a letter &ndash; for example, because lenders no longer have their details and can&rsquo;t trace them - will have a year from the scheme starting to make a claim. They will be able to do so by making a claim to their lender directly. If consumers don&rsquo;t know who their lender was, there&rsquo;s information on how to check on the FCA website. The FCA will run an advertising campaign to raise awareness of the scheme. &nbsp;</p>
<p>People will only receive compensation under the scheme proposed if they weren&rsquo;t told details of at least one of 3 arrangements between the lender and the broker who sold the loan, often a car dealer, which are found in some motor finance agreements:</p>
<ol>
<li>A discretionary commission arrangement, which allowed the broker to adjust the interest rate the customer would pay to obtain a higher commission.</li>
<li>A high commission arrangement (35% of the total cost of credit and 10% of the loan).</li>
<li>A contractual arrangement or tie between the lender and broker, which provided exclusive or near exclusive rights to lenders to provide credit. &nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>There could be rare circumstances in which a lender may be able to show that even if one or more of these features was undisclosed, that there was no unfairness. Where evidence is missing about what was disclosed, lenders must presume that they didn&rsquo;t give borrowers enough information.</p>
<p>The FCA will monitor if firms are meeting the proposed scheme's rules and will act if they&rsquo;re not. If people disagree with their firm's decision, the Financial Ombudsman will be on hand to assess whether the scheme rules have been followed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Those with a motor finance complaint about inadequate disclosure of a commission or tie that doesn&rsquo;t fall within the 3 features above &ndash; and who are therefore not owed compensation under the proposed scheme &ndash;would only get a different outcome from the Financial Ombudsman if it decides the scheme rules weren&rsquo;t followed. People in this situation could still make a claim in court if they believed they had lost out. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Consumers can choose not to take part in the FCA's compensation scheme and instead go to court, where they may get more or less compensation, based on the facts of their case. However, the outcome of a court claim is uncertain and accounting for legal fees they may pay, many consumers could end up with less. The FCA's scheme is also likely to be faster and simpler than going to court.</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Consults On Motor Finance Compensation Scheme</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We are consulting on an industry-wide scheme to compensate motor finance customers who were treated unfairly between 2007 and 2024.</p>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-why-are-we-proposing-a-scheme-" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/consultation/cp25-27.pdf" title="CP25/27">compensation scheme</a>&nbsp;is the best way to ensure consumers who have lost out receive fair compensation in an orderly, consistent, quick, and efficient way, while ensuring a well-functioning and competitive motor finance market.</p>
<p>An alternative to a compensation scheme would require consumers to complain to firms, then to the Financial Ombudsman Service if dissatisfied with the firm&rsquo;s response, or through the courts. This would result in significantly higher administrative and legal costs for firms and consumers, lengthy delays and uncertain outcomes for all involved.</p>
<h2>Why are we proposing a scheme?</h2>
<p>Many firms broke laws and regulations in force at the time by failing to disclose important information. Our extensive review, covering data from 32m agreements, found widespread failures to adequately disclose the existence and nature of commission and contractual ties between lenders and brokers.</p>
<p>Of the agreements reviewed involving a discretionary commission arrangement (DCA) - where the broker could adjust the interest rate offered to a customer to obtain a higher commission - there was no evidence that the customer had been told about the DCA.</p>
<p>On 1 August 2025, the Supreme Court found a lender acted unfairly &ndash; and therefore unlawfully - because of the high, undisclosed commission paid to the broker and the failure to disclose a contractual tie. On 17 December 2024, the High Court ruled that the Financial Ombudsman was entitled to find that a dealer and lender did not adequately disclose a discretionary commission arrangement and that meant the relationship between the lender and the borrower was unfair.</p>
<p>Inadequate disclosure means consumers were unable to make informed decisions and less likely to negotiate or shop around. Consequently, many may have overpaid on car finance.</p>
<p>There is now sufficient legal clarity to move ahead with a compensation scheme.</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-scope-and-design-of-redress-scheme" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Scope and design of redress scheme</h2>
<p>The scheme would cover regulated motor finance agreements taken out between 6 April 2007 and 1 November 2024 where commission was payable by the lender to the broker.</p>
<p>The Financial Ombudsman and courts consider complaints from 6 April 2007 and therefore firms&rsquo; liabilities arising from their breaches of the law and regulation already exist. The end date is based on when we know firms moved to more transparent practices following the Court of Appeal judgment on 24th October 2024 that was subsequently appealed to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>The majority of motor finance agreements will not qualify for compensation. We estimate 14.2m agreements &ndash; 44% of all agreements made since 2007 &ndash; will be considered unfair because they involve inadequate disclosure of one or more of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>a discretionary commission arrangement</li>
<li>high commission (where the commission is equal to or greater than 35% of the total cost of credit and 10% of the loan)</li>
<li>contractual ties that gave a lender exclusivity or a right of first refusal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our 35%/10% threshold is the point at which our analysis best indicates that borrowing costs may have been more strongly affected by the commission, such that its size would likely to have been a major consideration in the consumer's mind had they been aware of it when they took out the loan. We are inviting feedback on the proposed definition of high commission for the scheme and providing data on alternative thresholds.</p>
<p>We make clear that these thresholds are solely for the purpose of the design of this redress scheme and should not be read across to any other retail financial services market.</p>
<p>We propose enabling lenders to rebut the presumption of unfairness in some limited circumstances. For example, lenders would be entitled to determine there was no unfair relationship under the scheme if:</p>
<ul>
<li>there is evidence of adequate disclosure of the relevant arrangement in question, or</li>
<li>in cases only featuring a DCA, the lender can provide evidence that the broker selected the lowest interest rate at which they would not have made any additional commission, or</li>
<li>disclosure of the relevant arrangement in question was inadequate, but the lender can provide evidence that the consumer was sufficiently sophisticated to have nonetheless been aware of the relevant feature(s).</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, those with a motor finance complaint about inadequate disclosure of a commission or tie that doesn&rsquo;t involve one of the three features above would therefore not receive compensation under the scheme. They would have the right to test this with the Financial Ombudsman, but would only get a different outcome if it decides the scheme rules weren&rsquo;t followed. They could still make a claim in court.</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-opt-in-opt-out" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Opt in / opt out</h2>
<p>We estimate there are already just over 4 million complaints with firms. We propose lenders contact consumers who complained before the scheme starts within 3 months. They will be included in the scheme unless they opt out. If consumers opt out of the scheme, they cannot opt back in.</p>
<p>Consumers who have not complained when the scheme starts would be contacted within 6 months, where lenders can identify them, and asked if they would like to opt-in.</p>
<p>Any consumers who have not been contacted can ask their firm to review their case at any time within one year of the scheme start date. We will run an advertising campaign to raise awareness of the scheme.</p>
<p>Consumers who have already been compensated for complaints covered by the scheme would be excluded. The Financial Ombudsman will resolve complaints they have already received and not through the scheme. Consumers who have had their complaints rejected and not taken them to the Financial Ombudsman will be contacted by lenders and invited to opt in.</p>
<p>While many complaints have been paused since 11 January 2024, and others from December 2024, firms have still been required to progress investigations of complaints. When the scheme goes live, we expect firms to resolve promptly those complaints they already have &ndash; so customers who have already complained are likely to have their case dealt with sooner.</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-redress-calculation" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Redress calculation</h2>
<p>We propose that compensation is calculated in a way which balances the Supreme Court&rsquo;s approach and our evidence of consumer loss, to provide fairness and consistency.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<em>Johnson&nbsp;</em>case considered by the Supreme Court was a very serious case and we do not think that courts would necessarily award the same high level of compensation in all motor finance cases. But consumers whose cases align closely with the&nbsp;<em>Johnson&nbsp;</em>case would under the scheme receive the commission plus interest. We define these as cases involving an undisclosed contractual tie and commission equal to, or greater than, 50% of the total cost of credit and 22.5% of the loan. These serious cases will be relatively rare.</p>
<p>For all other cases, we propose consumers are compensated the average of what we estimate they have overpaid, or lost, and the commission paid, plus interest.</p>
<p>Our estimation of loss is based on economic analysis, drawing on independent statistical advice, that there was a difference in the interest rate charged on loans with discretionary commission arrangements compared to those with flat fee arrangements. For example, it is estimated that a loan with an interest rate of 10% charged to the consumer should have carried a market-adjusted interest rate of 8.3% (an adjustment of 17%). We believe we can also use this estimation as a reasonable proxy for losses in the relatively small number of non DCA cases covered by our scheme that do not align closely with the&nbsp;<em>Johnson&nbsp;</em>case.</p>
<p>We consider the average of the two approaches as the fairest way to reflect the Courts&rsquo; judgments and our legal obligation to consider evidence of loss. We welcome feedback on our proposed approach and provide data on alternative approaches in the consultation.</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-interest" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Interest</h2>
<p>We propose that simple interest should be paid on the compensation, based on the annual average Bank of England base rate per year plus 1% from the date of overpayment to the date compensation is paid. Consumers will be able to challenge this with evidence if they feel this is unfair. We now estimate the weighted average interest rate payable will be 2.09% and have used this for modelling purposes.</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-total-cost-of-redress" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Total cost of redress</h2>
<p>We estimate around 85% of eligible consumers would take part in the scheme, which would mean estimated redress of &pound;8.2bn (including interest). This estimate of 85% is based on participation rates in past redress schemes and our consumer research which shows 14% of past and current motor finance holders do not intend to make a claim. In the very unlikely event of 100% take-up, firms would owe up to &pound;9.7bn in redress. And if there was a lower 70% take up, the redress owed would be &pound;6.8bn. If there is 85% take-up of the scheme, the estimated costs to firms of implementing and operationalising the scheme would be &pound;2.8bn, taking the total cost to &pound;11bn.</p>
<p>We estimate that this would result in consumers being compensated an average of around &pound;700 per agreement.</p>
<p>Inevitably, given the scale and complexity of such a scheme and limitations in the data we have spanning such a long time period, the estimates remain highly indicative and susceptible to change. The consultation sets out the details underpinning these estimates and an accompanying cost-benefit analysis (CBA), reviewed by our independent CBA panel, as well as sensitivity analysis which means estimates could in some circumstances be either higher or lower.</p>
<p>Many firms have raised the possibility of highly automated approaches to paying compensation and we will work closely with them on these and this may help reduce estimated non-redress costs. We will continue to refine all our estimates during the consultation as we receive more precise data and will publish updated estimates alongside our final rules.</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-market-impact" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Market impact</h2>
<p>The motor finance market continues to function well, including after the Supreme Court judgment and our announcement of an intention to consult on a scheme on 3 August 2025. Our detailed analysis concludes there will continue to be good product availability and competition among lenders in the finance market for new and used vehicles. While we cannot rule out some modest impacts on product availability and prices, we estimate the cost of dealing with complaints would be several billion pounds higher in the absence of a redress scheme. In that scenario, impacts on access to motor finance and prices for consumers could be significantly higher with uncertainty continuing for many more years.</p>
<p>We have heard concerns about the impact of paying redress on non-bank, non-captive lenders focused on non-prime markets. Some of these lenders are smaller and have less access to funding than larger motor finance firms focused on other parts of the market. Access to funding for such non-prime lenders had been a challenge even before the motor finance commissions issue became prominent.</p>
<p>Some non-prime lenders have told us they did not engage in discretionary commission or tied arrangements. If that is the case, they are less likely to have to pay redress under the scheme.</p>
<p>These lenders may also be able to rebut the presumption of loss or&nbsp;damage proposed at the liability assessment stage if they have clear evidence that the consumer would not have secured a better offer from any other lender the broker had arrangements with at the time of the transaction. If the presumption of loss or damage is rebutted, the lender would not have to pay any redress to the consumer.</p>
<p>While these non-prime lenders represent a small share of the overall motor finance market, we will remain vigilant to the effect on them as the consultation progresses and as we make final rules.</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-complaints-deadline" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Complaints deadline</h2>
<p>We are also consulting on extending the deadline for firms to send a final response to certain motor finance complaints to 31 July 2026. This will help ensure consistent and orderly outcomes for consumers and minimise disruption to firms and the market. We may shorten the period to align with the timetable of our compensation scheme if confirmed.</p>
<p>We propose no extension to handling complaints about leasing agreements as they are not caught by the legislation relating to unfair relationships and so are not covered by the scheme. Firms need to start sending final responses to any motor leasing complaint from 5 December 2025.</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-our-expectations-of-firms" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Our expectations of firms</h2>
<p>We propose that lenders deliver the scheme, rather than brokers. This will be simpler and ensure more timely and comprehensive redress, given there are many more brokers than lenders. Brokers played a part in the failings and will have to cooperate, providing information lenders need to operate the scheme promptly.</p>
<p>We have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/dear-ceo-letters/motor-finance-action-lenders-brokers.pdf" title="Dear CEO letter">written to motor finance lender and broker CEOs</a>, outlining the preparatory steps we expect them to take now, as well as when the scheme starts.&nbsp;<br />We would expect firms to:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>accurately identify and effectively contact impacted consumers (with support from third parties where required)</li>
<li>gather information to assess whether cases are in scope of the scheme and liability (with support from brokers as required) and reach appropriate decisions</li>
<li>ensure compensation calculations are accurate, and payments are made quickly</li>
<li>ensure no undue delay at any stage of the proposed redress scheme.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-the-principles-underpinning-a-redress-scheme" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>The principles underpinning a redress scheme</h2>
<p>In designing this proposed scheme, we have sought to balance key principles so that the scheme would:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be simpler for consumers than bringing an individual complaint, meaning more consumers, particularly vulnerable ones, receive compensation they are owed.</li>
<li>Provide timely and fair compensation to consumers, with clear communication about how their claim is being dealt with, as we will set rules firms must follow and will act if they don&rsquo;t.</li>
<li>Be comprehensive so consumers do not need to go through the courts to secure compensation.</li>
<li>Be free to access for consumers and cost effective for firms. Without a scheme, many cases would go through the courts or the Financial Ombudsman, resulting in significantly higher administrative costs for firms and lengthy delays. Consumers do not need to use a claims management company or law firm to make a claim. We set out on 6 October 2025 how we have joined forces with other regulators to deal with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/regulators-join-forces-tackle-poor-claims-management-practices" title="Regulators join forces to tackle poor claims management practices">some poor claims management practices</a>.</li>
<li>Protect the integrity of the market. Our analysis shows the motor finance market will continue to function well, as it has been since we announced our intention to propose a scheme, and will continue to attract investment, with limited disruption to competition. We continue to monitor securities and funding markets for motor finance firms, and these remain orderly and functioning.</li>
<li>Give affected consumers certainty that they have had the opportunity to secure compensation, and firms and investors finality by drawing a line under this issue.</li>
</ul>
<p>To achieve this balance on such a complex issue has required us to make regulatory judgments on trade-offs. We recognise that not everyone will get everything they would like from a scheme. We welcome views on our proposals and potential alternatives. This feedback will enable us to further enhance our evidence base, assumptions and estimates to ensure a robust and operationally effective scheme. Our aim is to resolve this matter as quickly as possible, in the interest of consumers, firms, the long-term health of the market and investors.</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-next-steps" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>We are seeking comments on extending the complaint handling rules by 4 November 2025.</p>
<p>The consultation on the proposed redress scheme closes on 18 November 2025.</p>
<p>If we introduce a redress scheme, we expect to publish our policy statement and final rules by early 2026. This timetable depends on the feedback we receive and firms and other parties working constructively together and with us. The scheme would launch at the same time, with consumers starting to receive compensation later in 2026.</p>

<title>FINRA Foundation Releases Findings On Fraud Awareness Among Investors - Half Of Investors Do Not Recognize Warning Signs Of Fraud; Findings Released In Light Of World Investor Week</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In light of World Investor Week (Oct. 6-12), the FINRA Investor Education Foundation (FINRA Foundation) released today first-look findings from its forthcoming report, &ldquo;Investors in the United States: A Report of the National Financial Capability Study,&rdquo; which will be published in December. The report provides an in-depth exploration of the attitudes, behaviors, knowledge and experiences of retail investors in the United States.</p>
<p>As part of the study, researchers asked a sample of investors across the United States a question about investment fraud:</p>
<p class="indentItem"><em><strong>If you heard about an investment opportunity that promises a guaranteed, risk-free 25% annual return every year for the next 5 years, would you invest in it?</strong></em><br /><em><span class="indentItem"><strong>1. Yes</strong></span></em><br /><em><span class="indentItem"><strong>2. No</strong></span></em><br /><em><span class="indentItem"><strong>3. Don&rsquo;t know</strong></span></em><span class="indentItem">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Despite describing guaranteed and very high investment returns, two hallmarks of investment fraud, half of respondents (50%) indicated they would invest in the hypothetical offer, indicating a lack of recognition about the warning signs of fraud. Investors who are younger, less experienced and less knowledgeable about investing are even more likely to say they would invest in the &ldquo;opportunity.&rdquo; The data further reveals that investors who engage with investments that can carry greater risk, such as cryptocurrencies and meme stocks, as well as those who rely on social media for financial information, are particularly open to a hypothetical investment that promises much more than it can deliver.</p>
<p class="text-align-center"><strong>Would invest in a &ldquo;guaranteed high-return&rdquo; opportunity</strong></p>
<p class="text-align-center"><img alt="Examples of Would invest in a &ldquo;guaranteed high-return&rdquo; opportunity" height="249" src="https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/2025-10/nfcs-news-img1-100625.png" width="678" /></p>
<p>Notably, the differences by income in the proportion of investors willing to invest in the hypothetical offer were less pronounced, with only four percentage-points separating those earning under $50,000 and those earning $100,000 or more. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-center"><strong>Would invest in a &ldquo;guaranteed high-return&rdquo; opportunity</strong></p>
<p class="text-align-center"><img alt="Example of Would invest in a &ldquo;guaranteed high-return&rdquo; opportunity" height="226" src="https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/2025-10/nfcs-news-img2-100625.png" width="383" /></p>
<p>&ldquo;These findings reveal that a concerning number of investors might be vulnerable to investment fraud,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/about/executives/gerri-walsh">Gerri Walsh, President of the FINRA Foundation</a>. &ldquo;All investments involve some level of risk, and investors must understand their own risk tolerance to make informed decisions. At the same time, investors must learn to spot the red flags of investment fraud&mdash;including the promise of little to no risk with unusually high returns,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>The full report, part of the FINRA Foundation&rsquo;s triennial&nbsp;<a href="https://finrafoundation.org/national-financial-capability-study" target="_blank">National Financial Capability Study</a>, will provide comprehensive insights to help financial professionals, educators, regulators and others serve and protect investors of all backgrounds and experience levels.</p>
<p><strong>Additional findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investing knowledge:</strong>&nbsp;Investors with high investing knowledge were less likely to invest in the hypothetical opportunity than those with low investing knowledge. Thirty-six percent of those with high investing knowledge report they would invest, compared to 49% of those with low investing knowledge.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto and meme stock investors:</strong>&nbsp;More crypto investors report they would invest in this &ldquo;opportunity&rdquo; than non-crypto investors (65% vs. 44%, respectively), while those who have purchased a meme-stock or viral investment are even more likely to look favorably upon the hypothetical investment than those who have not purchased a meme stock (77% vs. 45%, respectively).</li>
<li><strong>Influenced by social media personalities:</strong>&nbsp;Almost three-quarters (72%) of study respondents who at least sometimes make investing decisions based on the advice of a social media personality said they would invest in the hypothetical opportunity. The survey found those relying on social media would be much more likely to invest than those who don&rsquo;t (69% vs. 42%, respectively).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About the National Financial Capability Study</strong></p>
<p>In 2009, the FINRA Investor Education Foundation launched the first national study of financial capability of adults in the United States. Since its start, the National Financial Capability Study has provided data on multiple indicators of capability&mdash;including financial behaviors, attitudes and knowledge.</p>
<p>National Financial Capability Study survey data is collected every three years. The Investor Survey is an online survey of 2,861 U.S. adults who have investments outside of retirement accounts. The data provides detailed information on a wide range of investing topics, such as attitudes towards risk and investing, investor knowledge, and reliance on so-called &ldquo;finfluencers.&rdquo;</p>

<p><section class="page-section">
<div class="section-heading">
<h2 id="chapter-0">Minutes</h2>
<p>Date: 11 June 2025</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-0">Item 1: Welcome</h3>
<p>Nick McLaren (chair) welcomed members to the fifth meeting of the CBDC Academic Advisory Group. He gave a brief update on the upcoming&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/events/2025/september/boe-innovation-money-and-payments">Innovation in Money and Payments Conference</a>&nbsp;highlighting the aim was to bring together academics, central bankers, and industry participants. He noted that the call for papers was open and encouraged members to consider participating and to share amongst their networks.</p>
<p>The chair highlighted recent Bank publications: a design note focusing on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/report/2025/intermediary-roles-and-scheme-rulebook-design-note">digital pound intermediaries</a>&nbsp;and an experiment report on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/report/2025/digital-pound-experiment-report-offline-payments">offline payments</a>.</p>
<p>The chair outlined the agenda for the meeting where each of the five subgroups would give presentations updating the group on their work since the last meeting.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-1">Item 2: Subgroup presentation &ndash; Financial &amp; Monetary Stability</h3>
<p class="span text-highlight">Subgroup headline question: Is a digital pound consistent with the BoE&rsquo;s statutory objectives?</p>
<p>The subgroup explained that a key theme from their work has been considering the risks of low adoption and around a failure to incentivise enough intermediaries to offer digital pound services. But set against that, there are also considerable risks around inaction and not developing a digital pound. In their view it was, therefore, right for the Bank to take a proactive but cautious approach to the design phase. They introduced insights from existing surveys and models, particularly focusing on the topic of adoption and disintermediation of the banking sector.</p>
<p>On adoption, the subgroup highlighted challenges in CBDC-related modelling. Some approaches in the literature rely on theoretical assumptions based on other forms of money, or they use existing banking data. However, the subgroup proposed conducting surveys of households and businesses to improve the accuracy of models of CBDC adoption.</p>
<p>It was noted that early adopters of CBDC are likely to be individuals already using digital assets. This is reflected by some responses to consumer research summarised in the Annex of the digital pound Consultation Paper. They also cited findings from a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bundesbank.de/en/bundesbank/research/survey-on-consumer-expectations-bop-hh/survey-on-consumer-expectations-794568" target="_blank">survey by The Bundesbank<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external">&nbsp;</span></a>, which suggested adoption would vary across the population, influenced by factors such as inflation expectations, demographics, and trust. Bank for International Settlements&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/work1147.pdf" target="_blank">research<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external"></span></a>&nbsp;highlighted that privacy expectations could also be a key determinant of adoption.</p>
<p>Turning to bank disintermediation, the subgroup noted an emerging consensus that CBDC could be welfare-enhancing, though it may also pose risks to financial stability. Two types of disintermediation were identified in the existing literature: slow (linked to CBDC substituting for bank deposits in normal times) and fast (associated with increased withdrawal risks during financial stress). The latter would pose greater risks to financial stability.</p>
<p>To explore these dynamics in greater detail, the subgroup presented a UK-focused agent-based model, aiming to identify likely CBDC adopters, estimate expected adoption, and therefore support an assessment of systemic risk implications.</p>
<p>The model does not include interoperability costs between different forms of money, as they are assumed to be zero. The model adopts Myerson&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s001820050079" target="_blank">binomial framework<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external"></span></a>, where individuals make a binary choice whether to adopt CBDC or not based on an initial probability of successful adoption. Therefore, there is a need to reach a critical mass of adoption before network effects can take over in driving further adoption.</p>
<p>The subgroup summarised their suggestions for further considerations. These included exploring whether limits and remuneration of a digital pound could be tailored to support financial inclusion. They emphasised a need to balance the trade-off between mitigating disintermediation risks through the use of limits and not remunerating a digital pound, versus the public good benefits from universal provision of a new risk-free form of retail money. The group also suggested collaboration between central banks to ensure research and analysis are shared.</p>
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>Members<span>&nbsp;</span>questioned the model&rsquo;s assumption that CBDC is primarily a store of wealth and not a means of payment, as this framing could overstate the risk of bank disintermediation. Members also discussed the differences between switching an account into a digital pound wallet versus the choice of whether to make an individual payment in a digital pound or alternative form of payment.</p>
<p>They also discussed the impact a digital pound would have on existing digital asset markets, and the likelihood of secondary market pricing. Members determined that without full knowledge of banks&rsquo; liquidity positions, it is not possible to fully determine the financial stability risks of CBDC adoption.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-0-2">Item 3: Subgroup discussion &ndash; Security</h3>
<p class="span text-highlight">Subgroup headline question: Does the digital pound design proposition meet best practice for a secure provision?</p>
<p>The subgroup presented an overview of privacy and governance considerations for a digital pound, raising questions around benchmarks, safeguards, and the Bank&rsquo;s role in protecting both individual and collective privacy.</p>
<p>One member challenged the assumption that current UK bank accounts and payment systems are the appropriate benchmark for a digital pound. The subgroup proposed that cash, particularly for everyday transactions, may offer a more meaningful standard, given its anonymity and public trust. They introduced a framework distinguishing between personal privacy (control over one&rsquo;s own data), third-party privacy (where one person&rsquo;s data may reveal information about others), and collective privacy (where aggregated data can shape societal or political outcomes). The subgroup highlighted that even though the Bank and HMT will not have access to personal information, there may still be implications to privacy due to data aggregation by private intermediaries.</p>
<p>The subgroup questioned whether PIPs and ESIPs would be held to equivalent privacy standards and called for stronger safeguards on how these entities collect, use, and monetise data. They emphasised the need for users to be empowered to make informed choices, while also underlining the limitations of individual consent-based models. Instead, they supported structural protections, such as default privacy-preserving settings and regulatory mechanisms, to address the broader externalities of data sharing.</p>
<p>The subgroup supported the Bank&rsquo;s proposal for full anonymity at the core ledger level. They noted that pseudo-anonymity, seen in some blockchain systems, would not be sufficient. Examples from OpenCBDC and Project Hamilton were referenced to illustrate how transaction data can be anonymised effectively. The subgroup also highlighted challenges related to the UK&rsquo;s lack of a national digital ID infrastructure, contrasting it with the EU&rsquo;s progress on EUID.</p>
<p>The subgroup raised concerns about the effectiveness in PIPs being able to carry out sufficient KYC and AML checks in the case where users can hold multiple wallets at different PIPs &ndash; although it was noted banks face similar challenges today. They encouraged the Bank to consider this as part of the design phase and consider the benefits of system-wide fraud analysis.</p>
<p>Finally, the subgroup addressed the challenges and opportunities of offline and cross-border payments. They supported the introduction of offline payments for resilience and privacy, with the potential to replicate the anonymity of cash. However, cross-border use cases were flagged as complex, involving regulatory, enforcement, and data protection challenges. While the Bank&rsquo;s consultation proposed that non-UK residents would be able to hold digital pounds, the subgroup called for greater clarity on the role of non-UK intermediaries and the need for international coordination to manage associated risks.</p>
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>One member asked whether there was a tension between regulatory KYC requirements and the use of privacy-enhancing technologies such as zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). It was clarified that while a user&rsquo;s PIPs would know their customers&rsquo; identities, ZKPs could be used to validate transactions without exposing personal data to the core ledger, maintaining a balance between compliance and privacy.</p>
<p>A discussion followed on whether the system should aim for perfection from the outset. One view stressed the importance of pragmatism &ndash; arguing that the current system already fails to protect privacy and that a &lsquo;good enough&rsquo; solution could still offer meaningful improvements. Others cautioned that launching with an imperfect model could embed foundational flaws that are difficult to correct later.</p>
<p>Concerns were raised about how restrictions on data use and monetisation might affect the competitiveness of PIPs, particularly in comparison to traditional payment systems. The potential impact on innovation and market dynamics was noted. Additionally, the balance of privacy for low-value transactions was questioned, with one member suggesting low value prepaid cards may be warranted.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-3">Item 4: Sarah Breeden Q&amp;A session</h3>
<p>Sarah Breeden, Deputy Governor for Financial Stability, joined the meeting to provide members with her perspective on the Bank&rsquo;s work on a digital pound and how this related to broader work on the future of retail and wholesale payments. She opened the session by expressing her appreciation for the work of the group, highlighting the value of its multidisciplinary expertise and diverse perspectives. She emphasised that the Bank deeply values the AAG&rsquo;s contributions, particularly in areas outside our core areas of expertise, such as privacy, AML/KYC, and behavioural economics.</p>
<p>The AAG&rsquo;s work informs the Bank and HM Treasury&rsquo;s assessment of the case for a digital pound. This includes evaluating the digital pound within the broader payments ecosystem. Sarah noted that the digital pound design phase is part of the Bank&rsquo;s work across the payments landscape, including work on new forms of money such as retail and wholesale CBDC, tokenised deposits and stablecoins, as well as innovation in existing domestic and cross-border payment infrastructure. Sarah noted that the Bank&rsquo;s work aligns with global developments and is being coordinated with other UK authorities, notably HM Treasury. She stressed the importance of supporting innovation, resilience, and effective governance across the financial system.</p>
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>One member asked whether the digital pound should be considered in isolation or as part of a wider account-to-account payments strategy. Sarah agreed that the Bank&rsquo;s work is considering the full payments ecosystem, including improvements to account-to-account infrastructure, tokenised deposits, and stablecoins. A key area of focus was how to achieve interoperability across these different forms of money and infrastructures.</p>
<p>Members also raised concerns about public understanding and the implications for adoption of a digital pound. Anecdotal evidence illustrated the high cost of current payment methods and the need for simpler, more affordable alternatives. The importance of early public education was emphasised, with examples showing how informed debate can shift public opinion. Sarah agreed that public engagement was an important part of the digital pound work, noting citizen panels and academic outreach are being used to gather public perspectives. At this stage engagement was focused on payments industry and more expert audiences, but if a decision were made to progress with a digital pound, then further engagement with the broader public would be necessary.</p>
<p>Questions were also raised about the benefits and costs of disintermediation of the banking sector. One member argued that a digital pound could enhance stability by offering the public a risk-free alternative to commercial bank money and reducing systemic risk. Sarah noted it&rsquo;s also important to consider the impact on lending and the cost of credit.</p>
<p>Members asked about the sequencing of payments innovation, and how the Bank would define success or failure. Sarah responded that the Bank&rsquo;s focus was on achieving public policy objectives such as stability, innovation, and resilience.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-4">Item 5: Subgroup discussion &ndash; Innovation</h3>
<p class="span text-highlight">Subgroup headline question: Is a digital pound likely to meet the core objective of payments innovation?</p>
<p>The subgroup presented findings from their literature review to explore whether a digital pound could catalyse innovation in the UK. The presentation focused on two key themes: payment system efficiency and financial inclusion. Kyeyoung Shin (Sa&iuml;d Business School, University of Oxford) was invited to join this session, reflecting his contribution to research conducted for the subgroup.</p>
<p>In terms of payment system efficiency, the subgroup highlighted that CBDCs could streamline payments by reducing intermediation, enabling faster settlement, supporting 24/7 availability, and fostering competition and innovation. They also offer potential for improved cross-border functionality and user driven programmability. However, challenges include high development costs, the presence of existing digital payment systems, private sector inertia, and risks related to interoperability and cybersecurity.</p>
<p>The subgroup observed that while CBDCs have potential to improve financial inclusion, they are not a universal solution. Their impact depends heavily on design and implementation. Opportunities identified include enabling offline functionality, tiered KYC to reach unbanked populations, reducing merchant acceptance costs, and using smart contracts to support inclusive financial tools. CBDCs could also serve as gateways to broader financial services such as credit, savings, and insurance. However, barriers remain which may limit adoption, particularly among marginalised groups.</p>
<p>The subgroup discussed which potential use cases for a digital pound might prove of most unique value. In particular, they noted that offline capabilities could support digital resilience. It recommended evaluating innovations based on their time to impact, and their alignment with public policy goals.</p>
<p>The presentation also included a case study on China&rsquo;s retail CBDC, e-CNY, which launched in 2020 and has since expanded to 28 cities. Despite promotion &ndash; including salary payments, discounts, and giveaways &ndash; adoption remains relatively limited, with e-CNY accounting for just 0.16% of China&rsquo;s cash-equivalent money supply. Platforms like AliPay and WeChat Pay, which already offer low transaction fees, have limited the incentive to use e-CNY.</p>
<p>The subgroup also raised&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/othp59.htm" target="_blank">Project mBridge<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external"></span></a>, where cross-border CBDC transactions have demonstrated significant efficiency gains compared to SWIFT. These developments were presented as valuable international lessons for the UK&rsquo;s own exploration of cross-border functionality.</p>
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>Members discussed &lsquo;multi-homing&rsquo;, referring to consumers using multiple digital payment platforms simultaneously. It was noted that merchants are generally open to accepting multiple forms of payment, especially when integration is seamless. While platforms like AliPay and WeChat Pay charge fees, these are often lower than other forms of payment system, making them attractive to merchants.</p>
<p>One member questioned the relevance of China&rsquo;s experience for countries like the UK, where debit cards are more common. The issue of interoperability between e-CNY and private platforms was also discussed. It was confirmed that transfers between platforms are now possible. Greater transferability is seen as key to driving adoption and reducing platform dominance. It was suggested that mBridge&rsquo;s effectiveness may be limited without broader CBDC adoption.</p>
<p>Members also discussed tiered wallet access, particularly for foreign users. It was explained that KYC requirements for lower-value wallets may be lower, though a fixed mobile number is typically required. This requirement may be a constraint on foreign users, who often rely on disposable numbers.</p>
<p>The discussion concluded with broad agreement that a digital pound has strong potential to support payments innovation in the UK. However, its success will depend on thoughtful design, ecosystem readiness, and overcoming barriers such as public trust and the dominance of existing platforms. It was also noted that there may be other ways to achieve these goals, through existing or other new digital payments platforms and infrastructure.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-5">Item 6: Bank presentation on the Digital Pound Lab</h3>
<p>The Bank presented an update on the newly launched Digital Pound Lab, a significant step in its practical experimentation phase. The Lab is designed to test real-world use cases in a controlled environment and is intended to inform, but not determine, the final design of a digital pound.</p>
<p>It was emphasised that the Lab is not a pilot and does not involve real money or users. Instead, it serves as an experimental platform for industry participants to explore potential use cases and business models. The Lab&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a id="_Int_teTgiRHV"></a>objectives include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Co-creating and testing use cases with industry</li>
<li>Assessing the viability of emerging business models</li>
<li>Identifying features that support or hinder innovation</li>
<li>Informing the Bank&rsquo;s broader thinking on digital currency technology</li>
</ul>
<p>The infrastructure of the Lab is based on the platform model. The Lab will&nbsp;<a id="_Int_CclOVBym"></a>operate in two phases. The first phase will last up to three months and involve up to six firms. Phase one will test predefined use cases, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Point-of-sale payments</li>
<li>Micro-merchant acceptance</li>
<li>Omnichannel payments</li>
<li>Tourist wallets</li>
<li>Salary payments</li>
<li>Business-to-business conditional payments</li>
<li>Tiered wallets</li>
</ul>
<p>The second phase is a broader call for participation, inviting firms to propose their own innovative use cases. Applications for this phase will open in July, and the second phase is expected to last around 9 months. Findings from the Lab will be shared through demo events, experiment reports, and public statements from participating firms.</p>
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>Members asked whether data generated in the Lab could be shared with academics. The Bank confirmed that only synthetic data would be used, but noted the potential for academic collaboration with participants in the Lab.</p>
<p>Clarification was sought on the distinction between third-party initiation and smart contracts, particularly given the instant nature of digital pound payments. It was explained that the Lab will include functionality to support atomic settlement between tokenised assets in a smart contract platform and digital pound payments in the core system.</p>
<p>The role of software development kits (SDKs) was also discussed. The Bank noted that the Lab would help assess how easily firms can innovate using the infrastructure, and feedback from participants may inform future SDK development.</p>
<p>One member asked whether participants in the Lab are incentivised to participate. The Bank confirmed that participants would not be paid but that the Bank is interested in understanding their business perspectives and motivations.</p>
<p>The potential for the Lab&rsquo;s infrastructure to support broader account-to-account payments was also discussed. It was suggested that, even if a digital pound is some way off, the Lab could help inform improvements to the wider payments system. The Bank agreed that while the architecture may differ, lessons from the Lab could support broader payments innovation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-6">Item 7: Subgroup discussion &ndash; Uniformity &amp; Alternatives</h3>
<p class="span text-highlight">Subgroup headline question: Is a digital pound likely to meet the core objective of money uniformity, and is it the best option?</p>
<p>The subgroup first set out their working definition of uniformity, defined as a fixed 1:1 exchange rate between different forms of money. It was clarified that, in their definition, uniformity does not imply identical features across money types, but rather equal valuation at the margin.</p>
<p>The group noted that full uniformity requires at least one side of the market (supply or demand) to be highly elastic. This has implications for proposed design features such as holding limits, which may restrict elasticity and undermine uniformity, in extremis. In contrast, remuneration was suggested as a tool that could help maintain indifference between forms of money.</p>
<p>The subgroup argued that uniformity is desirable because it reduces transaction costs, supports the public good function of the unit of account, and reinforces the central bank&rsquo;s role in maintaining monetary sovereignty.</p>
<p>They explored the trade-offs involved in pursuing uniformity. While some view it as an all-or-nothing concept, the group noted that economists typically consider marginal trade-offs and that there are some historical monetary regimes where uniformity did not hold at all times and across all forms of money. A key question raised was whether the acceptable trade-off should be determined by the market or by government policy.</p>
<p>The group also examined whether retail access to central bank money is necessary to support uniformity. While the academic literature is not conclusive on whether it plays an essential role in underpinning public trust e, it may play a role in reinforcing the unit of account and monetary sovereignty. The subgroup concluded that the more channels available for converting between different forms of money, the stronger the reinforcement of uniformity.</p>
<p>In closing, the subgroup stated that while they do not believe a digital pound is not strictly necessary to achieve uniformity, it could significantly support it. They proposed three areas for further research:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the critical margins needed to safeguard a fixed exchange rate?</li>
<li>Does retail access to central bank money foster trust in the monetary system?</li>
<li>What are the indirect effects of a digital pound on uniformity?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>One member suggested that uniformity should be considered in both normal and stressed conditions. In times of stress, differences in the attributes of various forms of money could amplify instability, particularly for less-informed users who may struggle to distinguish between them.</p>
<p>The role of a digital pound in enhancing monetary and financial stability was discussed, particularly in contrast to emerging non-bank payment solutions like stablecoins. Members discussed how limits and the existence of deposit insurance may influence how a digital pound was viewed. The chair suggested members consider a state of the world where a broader range of new digital monies emerge.</p>
<p>Members agreed on the importance of a stable and trusted unit of account. It was argued that the long-term case for a digital pound lies in providing a simple, reliable unit of account without relying on a complex network of regulated institutions. The Bank has a role to ensure public access to a trusted benchmark to anchor the monetary system. Others noted that while a digital pound could support growth as a base settlement asset, near-term priorities should focus on solving practical issues, such as high transaction costs for small businesses.</p>
<p>The discussion also touched on international comparisons. It was noted that India&rsquo;s UPI system has achieved significant digitisation without a CBDC, although the Reserve Bank of India was still considering the adoption of a retail CBDC as part of the UPI. The session concluded with reflections on the broader implications of uniformity. Some members questioned whether the existing system was the right benchmark. Current approaches may not be optimal, and the future may demand new solutions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-7">Item 8: Subgroup discussion &ndash; Public and Private</h3>
<p class="span text-highlight">Subgroup headline question: Can a digital pound be financially viable for the public sector and private sector participants?</p>
<p>The subgroup presented their analysis on the financial viability of a digital pound, reframing the question beyond infrastructure costs and revenue models to focus on adoption dynamics, market competition, and incentive structures from both public and private sector perspectives.</p>
<p>The presentation was structured around eight key themes:</p>
<p><span>Adoption and scalability</span>&nbsp;&ndash; it was emphasised that widespread adoption by both consumers and merchants is essential for a digital pound to achieve the scale necessary to justify investment. The interdependence between consumer and merchant uptake was identified as a central challenge, with demand-side behaviours playing a critical role.</p>
<p><span>Current and future payments landscape&nbsp;</span>&ndash; the group highlighted the growing complexity of the payments ecosystem, driven by mobile wallets, buy-now-pay-later services, peer-to-peer platforms, and embedded payments. Large platforms create lock-in effects that pose challenges for new entrants like a digital pound.</p>
<p><span>Geopolitical and regulatory drivers</span>&nbsp;&ndash; communications by policymakers on the digital euro have emphasised the importance of maintaining monetary sovereignty and reducing reliance on non-European payment providers. Initiatives like the digital euro and regulatory frameworks such as the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) are shaping the future of digital payments infrastructure in the EU.</p>
<p><span>Consumer behaviour and preferences</span>&nbsp;&ndash; research suggests UK consumers value real-time payments, cross-device accessibility, simplicity, and customisation. Trust and privacy remain essential. While transactional use of cash is declining, it remains very important for certain groups and continues to be held by a large portion of the population. Data-driven services, such as budgeting tools and loyalty programmes, are becoming standard expectations and should be considered in the digital pound&rsquo;s design.</p>
<p><span>Merchant incentives and barriers to adoption</span>&nbsp;&ndash; research suggests merchants are motivated by lower transaction fees, reduced chargebacks, and operational efficiency. However, integration costs, technical complexity, and lack of interoperability with existing systems remain significant barriers. Adoption is likely to vary by sector, with retail and hospitality showing higher potential.</p>
<p><span>Design and communication&nbsp;</span>&ndash; design features such as privacy, user defined programmability, settlement speed, and budgeting tools were identified as key levers for adoption. Communication strategies, particularly short educational videos, can improve consumer understanding and willingness to adopt. Behavioural economics suggests that awareness, trust, and perceived utility often outweigh rational cost-benefit analysis.</p>
<p><span>Chicken-and-egg problem&nbsp;</span>&ndash; the group addressed the two-sided market dilemma: consumers won&rsquo;t adopt without merchant acceptance, and vice versa. Three potential solutions were proposed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interoperability with existing payment systems</li>
<li>Incentives for early adopters</li>
<li>Strategic partnerships with incumbent players</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Policy and strategic considerations&nbsp;</span>&ndash; the subgroup suggested a digital pound should be positioned as a strategic asset for the UK&rsquo;s financial infrastructure. Delays in developing a digital pound could risk entrenching private alternatives and weakening public control over digital money ecosystems. Financial viability will depend on clear purpose, robust ecosystem design, and targeted adoption strategies.</p>
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>Members discussed that merchant service charges in the UK vary significantly by merchant size. Additional fees from facilitators can often increase costs for small businesses. One member noted the potentially regressive nature of the current system, where high-income consumers often benefit more from credit card rewards which are paid for through merchant fees, and ultimately consumers. This dynamic may partly reinforce a payment structure that favours cards over lower-cost alternatives such as a digital pound.</p>
<p>Concerns were raised about the business model for PIPs. Without clear revenue streams, participation may be unattractive for both incumbents and new entrants. The failure of PayM in the UK was cited as a cautionary example.</p>
<p>The importance of a balanced value proposition across consumers, merchants, and intermediaries was emphasised. It was noted that achieving lower fees for merchants, value-added services for consumers, and commercial viability for intermediaries is essential. The challenge of the Day 1 proposition, when user numbers and features could be limited, was also highlighted.</p>
<p>Members discussed the timeline for the potential launch of a digital pound. It was argued that too long a timeline risks entrenching private digital money solutions and weakening the UK&rsquo;s strategic position. Some members felt a digital pound should be seen as a response to global competition and a tool for monetary sovereignty, not merely a technical upgrade.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-8">Item 9: Closing remarks</h3>
<p>The chair thanked all presenters and participants for their contributions throughout the day, noting the ability to draw connections across the different subgroups had been especially valuable.</p>
<p>The chair noted the forthcoming Innovation in Money and Payments conference in September and said the group would likely meet again towards the end of the year to summarise the work.</p>

<title>Welcome Remarks, Federal Reserve Vice Chair For Supervision Michelle W. Bowman, At The 2025 Community Banking Research Conference, St. Louis, Missouri (Via Pre-Recorded Video)</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/welcome-remarks-federal-reserve-vice-chair-for-supervision-michelle-w-bowman-2025107/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Welcome to the 2025 community banking research conference.&nbsp;While I regret that I cannot join you in person this year, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge the contributions this conference has made and continues to make in promoting research on community banking and related issues.</p>
<p>Since 2013, this conference has synthesized insights and perspectives from research and regulatory and banking communities with a single goal: deepening our understanding of the community bank business model in order to better inform future policy decisions.</p>
<p>We share this goal, and the sponsorship of this event with the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). We are proud of this ongoing partnership with CSBS and FDIC and the effort to further actionable bank industry research.</p>
<p>As the former Kansas state bank commissioner and a community banker, I very much appreciate the goals of this conference. And again this year, the organizers have included valuable research and created a conference program that includes a wide range of perspectives that create an opportunity for discussion and debate.</p>
<p>Ensuring the future and viability of the community banking industry continues to be a top priority, especially as the President appointed me to serve as the Vice Chair for Supervision of the Federal Reserve Board.</p>
<p>This position, which was created under the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010, requires the Vice Chair to "develop policy recommendations for the Board regarding supervision and regulation of depository institution holding companies and other financial firms supervised by the Board" and to also "oversee the supervision and regulation" of these firms.</p>
<p>It is an honor and an absolute privilege to be entrusted with these important responsibilities, and I look forward to working with all of our stakeholders in the financial industry to modernize supervision and regulation that allows for continued economic growth and innovation in the banking system and that enhances the critical role of community banks.</p>
<p>Community banks are the cornerstone of local economies, providing credit to local customers and businesses with few alternatives for accessing financial services. The community bank relationship model requires just that relationship. Direct knowledge of and a connection with the community, which makes this banking model truly unique and even more valuable.</p>
<p>But this model continues to face challenges&mdash;challenges that I am confident this conference will explore in greater detail that will help us to inform future policy developments.</p>
<p>When I spoke at this conference last year, I described a framework for community banking regulation for the future.</p>
<p>In those remarks, I discussed the necessary building blocks for building an effective framework, which include</p>
<ul>
<li>reviewing, reconsidering, and indexing the asset size thresholds that are used throughout our current supervisory and regulatory framework;</li>
<li>gaining a better understanding of the tradeoffs of regulation;</li>
<li>identifying the hidden costs of supervision and supervisory guidance;</li>
<li>streamlining the mergers and acquisitions review and approval process; and</li>
<li>identifying ways to promote new bank formation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since that time, the Federal Reserve has already launched several initiatives to advance these goals, but there's more work ahead.</p>
<p>We are refocusing supervisory efforts on core material financial risks, reviewing the CAMELS ratings framework, revising the community bank leverage ratio, and considering ways to improve the treatment of mutual banks. We are also prioritizing work to assist in the fight against fraud.</p>
<p>In the coming years, this conference will be an important mechanism for continuing to explore challenges facing the banking industry, and especially community banks. And with the work we are undertaking, we will continue to prioritize changes to the community bank regulatory and supervisory framework that will allow community banks to continue to thrive.</p>
<p>Over the years, this conference has highlighted the important role community banks play in our economy, the impacts of regulation on our banks, the disproportionate cost burden from regulation on our nation's smallest banks, and the importance of having a strong diversified network of community banks. It is critical that our regulatory and supervisory framework continues to support a network of these banks across and throughout the country so that they are positioned to support the economy and to meet the credit needs of their communities.</p>
<p>As I work with staff across the Federal Reserve to enhance the Fed's supervision of banks, I'm reminded how the research presented at this conference over the years, along with the findings from the CSBS annual survey of community banks, has consistently demonstrated the need for regulatory tailoring. This has given us a better perspective to understand and measure the cost of compliance.</p>
<p>In short, this conference truly matters.</p>
<p>Each year, the research presented here moves us forward; improves our understanding; and, combined with other insights from key stakeholders and our own experiences, enables us to make better regulatory and supervisory decisions.</p>
<p>From the first year of the conference in 2013, we've seen a number of changes in the banking and financial systems, in our economy, and in our supervisory and regulatory structures. The research presented here each year has evolved with these changes and has delivered critical and timely insights.</p>
<p>I'm so pleased that this conference has not strayed from its original mission and continues to provide a forum for the discussion of thoughtful, timely research into our country's unique community banking business model.</p>
<p>Community banks are vital to the U.S. economy and to the thousands of smaller local economies they serve across the country. It's important that we continue to study and understand the important role they play.</p>
<p>This conference helps to increase this understanding.</p>
<p>In addition to presenting thoughtful research, it provides an opportunity for open dialogue between community bankers, academics, regulators, and policymakers.</p>
<p>In these ever-changing times, the unique combination of research presented in combination with real-world perspectives provides insights that help to ensure that the community banking model endures well into the future.</p>
<p>This conference is just one aspect of the Federal Reserve System's engagement on issues affecting community banks. Outreach to banks of all sizes, including community banks, has been a top priority for my work because your voices must be a part of the conversation in Washington. In a few days, the Board will host a Community Bank Conference in D.C., bringing together bankers, industry experts, and other stakeholders to discuss and identify the most relevant issues facing the industry.</p>
<p>This event will be live-streamed on the Board's website and will include several unique and exciting speakers and panelists, covering a number of current issues.</p>
<p>Thank you for your continued interest and engagement in supporting this conference.</p>
<hr align="left" size="1" width="33%" />
<p>1. The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today, ACER initiates the review of its&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsOAg4JBVJQBkxaVANWHVYNDAcdUw8IAxoEB1JTBVcMVlAJAwgdUlNSAFpTA1AdBghQDx0GAVJVGg1cAgEZCgBVAlMFVFFTAltZRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Decision 30/2020</a>&nbsp;on the electricity redispatching and countertrading cost sharing methodology for the Core capacity calculation region. &nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is a capacity calculation region?</span></p>
<p>A capacity calculation region is a set of electrically interdependent bidding zone borders, where capacity calculation, regional operational security, redispatching and countertrading costs sharing tasks are coordinated by that region&rsquo;s transmission system operators (TSOs).</p>
<p>The Core capacity calculation region involves the TSOs and bidding zone borders of Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia. It is the biggest European region, involving 13 Member States, 16 TSOs and 19 bidding zone borders.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is the methodology about?</span></p>
<p>The cost sharing methodology allocates the costs from redispatching and countertrading remedial actions within a capacity calculation region. These actions are triggered to solve network congestions occurring within the region.</p>
<p>Specifically, this methodology tracks how each action affects congested network elements and assigns the related costs to the responsible TSOs, based on the order of flow types (loop, internal, allocated&nbsp;and power-shifting transformer flows). Loop flows are charged first, however according to the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsECQ5XWQNcV0wPVwxUHVYJBVMdUFgJUBpTBAMDUAYNBVMJBAkdUlNSAFpTA1AdBghQDx0GAVJVGg1cAgEZCgBVAlMFVFFTAltZRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Electricity Regulation</a>, its portion below a given threshold is exempted.</p>

<title>CME: Farmers Say Current Conditions On U.S. Farms Are Weakening</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Farmer sentiment held steady in September, as the&nbsp;<a href="https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4525552-1&amp;h=124970029&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fageconomybarometer%2F&amp;a=Purdue+University%2FCME+Group+Ag+Economy+Barometer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span class="xn-org">Purdue University</span>/CME Group Ag Economy Barometer</a>&nbsp;rose just 1 point to a reading of 126. However, there was a shift in producers' perceptions of current conditions and their expectations for the future. The Index of Current Conditions fell 7 points to 122, while the Index of Future Expectations climbed 5 points to 128. The survey was conducted following the U.S. Department of Agriculture's release of the September Crop Production report and the World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates&nbsp;report. These reflected farmers' concerns about current conditions, particularly over record-high corn and soybean yields, which were pressuring crop prices. At the same time, optimism about the future was supported by farmers' belief that U.S. policy is "headed in the right direction" and by expectations that potential government support, like the 2019 Market Facilitation Program (MFP), will provide payments to farmers in compensation for lower commodity prices. The barometer survey took place&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">Sept. 15-19</span>.</p>
<p>The September Farm Financial Performance Index dropped 3 points to a reading of 88, marking the third consecutive month farmers have lowered their expectations for 2025 compared with 2024. Consistent with this more cautious outlook, fewer producers said now is a good time to make major investments in their operations, pushing the Farm Capital Investment Index down 8 points to 53.</p>
<p>Producers' short-term outlook for farmland values weakened for the fourth month in a row, as the Short-Term Farmland Values Expectations Index fell 6 points to 106. The index now stands 18 points below its 2025 peak from May of 124. The shift was driven by fewer producers expecting farmland values to rise and more anticipating farmland values to remain about the same, with 58% of respondents saying they expect farmland values to hold steady over the next year, up from 54% in August.</p>
<p>Policy changes appear to continue to shape farmers' perspectives in September. A substantial majority (71%) of farmers in this month's survey reported that things in the U.S. are "headed in the right direction," similar to the July and August survey results. However, confidence in the long-run impact of tariffs has weakened. Just over half of respondents (51%) said they expect tariffs to strengthen the U.S. agricultural economy, down from 63% of June's survey respondents and 70% of respondents in both the April and May surveys who said they expect the use of tariffs to have a long-term positive impact. At the same time, 30% now believe tariffs will weaken the agricultural economy, and 19% are uncertain &mdash; more than double the number of respondents who were uncertain in the spring.</p>
<p>Amidst growing concerns about tariffs, most farmers expect potential government support to help cushion the impact. In September, 83% of producers said a program similar to the 2019 MFP is likely if a trade war drives commodity prices lower, with 62% calling it "very likely" and another 21% saying it is "likely."</p>
<p>Each September since 2021, the Ag Economy Barometer survey has included several questions focused on cover crop usage by corn and soybean farmers, and just over half (53%) of farmers surveyed this month reported using cover crops on at least some of their acreage, a share that has ranged between 52% and 57% over the past five years. Among cover crop users, 40% said they adopted the practice within the last five years, while 9% have used cover crops for more than two decades. Survey trends also point to broader adoption across acreage: This year, 57% of cover crop users planted them on 26-50% of their acres, compared to only 25% in 2021 who reported planting cover crops on more than one-fourth of their acreage.</p>
<p>"High production costs and weak crop prices are pressuring farm incomes on U.S. crop farms," said&nbsp;<a href="https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4525552-1&amp;h=2349699818&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fhome%2Fteam%2Fmichael-langemeier%2F&amp;a=Michael+Langemeier" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span class="xn-person">Michael Langemeier</span></a>, the barometer's principal investigator and director of&nbsp;<span class="xn-org">Purdue's</span>&nbsp;<a href="https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4525552-1&amp;h=2473468075&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fhome%2F&amp;a=Center+for+Commercial+Agriculture" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Center for Commercial Agriculture</a>. "A large majority of U.S. farmers expect government support to bolster farm incomes if crop prices remain weak."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Under the terms of the agreement, ICE will invest up to $2 billion in Polymarket, reflecting a valuation of approximately $8 billion pre-investment.</p>
<p>Alongside its investment, ICE will become a global distributor of Polymarket&rsquo;s event-driven data, providing customers with sentiment indicators on topics of market relevance. Additionally, ICE and Polymarket have also agreed to partner on future tokenization initiatives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our investment blends ICE, the owner of the New York Stock Exchange, which was founded in 1792, with a forward-thinking, revolutionary company pioneering change within the Decentralized Finance space,&rdquo; said Jeffrey C.

<p>Polymarket allows users to express their views on events by buying and selling shares of potential outcomes, with every trade matched peer-to-peer through smart contracts. Markets grow in size and scale based on the number of users participating. Founded by Shayne Coplan in 2020, Polymarket has gained momentum from users globally interested in expressing their opinions on current events, politics, business moves, culture and sports. The platform has gained prominence for the accuracy of its markets and is now the Official Prediction Market Partner of X, and Stocktwits, among others.</p>
<p>The investment consideration will be in cash and is not expected to have a material impact on ICE&rsquo;s 2025 financial results or expected capital return plans.

<title>SET Market Report For September 2025</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/set-market-report-for-september-2025-2025107/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/set-market-report-for-september-2025-2025107/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) Index closed at 1,274.17 points in September 2025, up 3.0% from the previous month, driven by investor expectations of government economic stimulus measures that bolstered the Thai stock market. Meanwhile, concerns over the U.S. economy and its monetary and fiscal policies led global investors to increase their holdings in safe-haven assets, particularly gold, the price of which surged to record highs in global markets. Regarding the U.S. government shutdown, which has occurred multiple times in the past and typically been short-lived, investors remained largely unfazed by the situation. This was reflected in the resilience of the U.S. stock market, which did not decline significantly during the period.</p>
<p><b>SET Senior Executive Vice President Soraphol Tulayasathien</b> said that the U.S. government shutdown is expected to have limited impact on the SET Index, as investors largely perceive it as a temporary external factor that may create short-term volatility in capital flow. More significant factors to watch include the new government's policy execution focused on "short-term stimulus, long-term gains, broad distribution" through the "Big Quick Win" initiative, alongside multi-stakeholder cooperation in economic and capital market reforms. The SET Index is expected to continue its recovery through the remainder of 2025, supported by a resurgence in fundraising activities among listed companies in both debt and equity markets over the past two months, while strong first-day performance of newly listed securities reflects improving investor sentiment and selling pressure from Long-term equity funds (LTF) has begun to ease.</p>
<p><b>Key highlights for September 2025</b><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<ul>
<li>At the end of September 2025, the SET Index increased 3.0 percent MoM to close at 1,274.17 points, narrowing the YTD decrease to 9.0 percent. Compared to the end of 2024, industry groups that outperformed the SET Index were Technology, Financials, Industrials, Resources, and Property &amp; Construction.</li>
<li>SET&rsquo;s and Market for Alternative Investment (mai)&rsquo;s average daily trading value dropped 31.0 percent YoY to THB 43.16 billion (approx. USD 1.34 billion), with the first nine months average daily trading value of THB 43.03 billion, </li>
<li>Foreign investors sold a net THB 11.86 billion, with THB 96.24 billion in net selling for the January-September period of 2025. </li>
<li>Foreign investors continued to dominate trading activity, accounting for 47.06 percent of the month&rsquo;s total trading value. Retail investors represented 37.63 percent, up from 33.98 percent in the preceding month. </li>
<li>There was one newly listed company on SET: Ngernturbo Plc (TURBO) and another one on mai: SKIN Laboratory&nbsp;Pcl (SKIN).</li>
<li>SET&rsquo;s forward P/E ratio at the end of September 2025 was 13.9 times, below the Asian stock markets&rsquo; average of 14.1 times. The historical P/E ratio stood at 14.7 times, lower than the Asian stock markets&rsquo; average of 16.0 times.</li>
<li>Dividend yield ratio at the end of September 2025 was 3.86 percent, higher than the Asian stock markets&rsquo; average of 3.02 percent.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Derivatives Market</b></p>
<ul>
<li>At the end of September 2025, Thailand Futures Exchange (TFEX)&rsquo;s daily trading volume averaged 457,290 contracts, up 23.7 percent from the previous month largely due to the higher trading volume of Single Stock Futures, Gold Online Futures, and Currency Futures. The YTD average daily trading volume in 2025 was 423,887 contracts, down 12.4 percent due to the decline in trading volume of Single Stock Futures and Gold Online Futures.</li>

<title>ASIC Approves Cboe’s Listing Application To Bolster Competition In Public Markets</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC has approved Cboe Australia&rsquo;s (Cboe) listing market application. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Cboe will now be able to list new companies on its platform in direct competition with existing market operators, including the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX).</p>
<p>As a result, Australian investors will have access to more investment options, initial public offerings (IPOs) and dual listed foreign entities.</p>
<p>This decision reinforces ASIC&rsquo;s commitment to promote&nbsp;a vibrant and attractive local listing market.</p>
<p>ASIC Chair Joe Longo said, &lsquo;Australia&rsquo;s capital markets are strong and resilient, but they must continue to adapt to evolving global market dynamics and meet the future needs of our economy. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This move will provide more choice for companies to list in Australia, build more links to offshore markets and create more options for investors, which is good news for the Australian economy.'&nbsp;</p>
<p>Competition in Australian equities markets to date has resulted in trading costs and access to more investment products, particularly exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which are already available under Cboe&rsquo;s existing Australian Market licence.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>ASIC announced it was considering Cboe&rsquo;s application in August&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-154mr-enhancing-competition-and-innovation-in-australia-s-evolving-capital-markets/" title="25-154MR Enhancing competition and innovation in Australia&rsquo;s evolving capital markets">Enhancing competition and innovation in Australia&rsquo;s evolving capital markets (25-154MR).</a></p>
<p>Formerly known as Chi-X Australia, Cboe was launched in Australia in 2011 as a competitor to the ASX, introducing an alternative trading venue for ASX-listed securities and contributing to increased competition and innovation in the Australian equities market. It was acquired by&nbsp;Cboe Global Markets&nbsp;in&nbsp;2021, becoming&nbsp;Cboe Australia.</p>
<p>Cboe Australia currently has 20% of Australia&rsquo;s equity market turnover, representing almost $2 billion of trades each day.</p>
<p>On 22 September,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/news-items/advancing-australia-s-public-and-private-markets-progress-update/">ASIC shared its progress update on Advancing Australia&rsquo;s public and private markets.</a>&nbsp;This followed on from ASIC&rsquo;s discussion paper in February which explored the changing dynamics in capital markets in Australia and abroad.</p>
<p>ASIC called for actionable ideas to enhance the operation of Australia&rsquo;s capital markets and announced in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-096mr-asic-clears-path-for-faster-ipos/">June an initiative to fast track IPOs (25-096MR)</a>.</p>
<p>On 25 February 2025,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-019mr-asic-makes-new-clearing-and-settlement-rules-to-promote-competition/">ASIC used its new powers under the Competition in Clearing and Settlement (CiCS) (25-019MR)</a>&nbsp;services reforms to promote competitive outcomes in clearing and settlement (CS), requiring the ASX to provide its CS services on a transparent and fair basis, with a requirement to publish a comparison of fees against international providers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On 11 September 2024, ASIC granted an Australian clearing and settlement facility license to FinClear Pty Ltd (trading as FCX) which connects buyers and sellers of shares in private companies during intermittent trading events.</p>
<p>There are now four markets, including Cboe, licensed to list securities in Australia, ASX, National Stock Exchange of Australia (NSX) and Sydney Stock Exchange (SSX).</p>

<title>ASIC Finds Many Auditors Failing To Demonstrate Compliance With Auditor Independence Obligations</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-finds-many-auditors-failing-to-demonstrate-compliance-with-auditor-independ-2025107/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Multiple auditors from audit firms of all sizes were unable to effectively demonstrate compliance with independence and conflict of interest obligations, a new ASIC review has revealed.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The findings, outlined in</span>&nbsp;<span>Report 817</span><em>&nbsp;<span>Building trust: Auditor compliance with independence and conflict of interest obligations&nbsp;</span></em><span>(REP 817), follow ASIC action against several auditors and audit firm identified as in likely breach of their obligations through this review.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>ASIC Commissioner Kate O'Rourke said that the audit sector directly contributes to the quality and integrity of financial reporting by companies and that it needs to observe independence requirements.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>'Auditor independence underpins stakeholder trust and confidence in the audit process and the reliability of the financial information being audited.&nbsp; Unfortunately, our review found that many auditors failed to meet the basic independence requirements, and others failed to identify and critically evaluate potential threats to their independence.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&lsquo;It is not enough for auditors to adopt a tick-a-box approach to complying with these important obligations. They must think more critically about whether they are independent and be alive to even the perception that their independence is compromised,' said Ms O'Rourke.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>ASIC&rsquo;s review found a disappointing number of likely breaches of prescriptive independence requirements. Fifteen auditors were found to be in likely breach of rotation requirements, relationship prohibitions or providing a prohibited non-audit service.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Nine auditors failed to demonstrate how they complied with mandatory rotation requirements that prevent auditors from auditing a listed client for more than five consecutive years.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Five auditors appeared to hold prohibited relationships with clients, including one auditor who was also an officeholder of their client.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>None of the 15 auditors flagged by ASIC as having breached their obligations had proactively reported the potential breaches to ASIC, despite receiving a reminder from&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-240mr-asic-releases-fy-2023-24-financial-reporting-and-audit-report-and-launches-auditor-independence-surveillance/" title="24-240MR ASIC releases FY 2023&ndash;24 financial reporting and audit report and launches auditor independence surveillance"><span>ASIC in October last year</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>'The failure of these auditors to report breaches to ASIC, including of the longstanding prescriptive independence obligations, is concerning,' said Ms O'Rourke.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>As a result of this review, ASIC accepted the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-195mr-asic-accepts-cancellation-of-company-auditor-registration-for-independence-failures/" title="25-195MR ASIC accepts cancellation of company auditor registration for independence failures"><span>cancellation of a company auditor&rsquo;s registration</span></a>&nbsp;<span>for independence failures,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-221mr-nexia-perth-audit-pays-penalty-because-of-alleged-prohibited-non-assurance-services-provided-by-firm/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Nexia%20Perth%20Audit%20pays%20penalty%20because%20of%20alleged%20prohibited%20non-assurance%20services%20provided%20by%20firm&amp;utm_content=Nexia%20Perth%20Audit%20pays%20penalty%20because%20of%20alleged%20prohibited%20non-assurance%20services%20provided%20by%20firm+CID_68c13cebe75749c6d0795bf938636187&amp;utm_source=CampaignMonitor&amp;utm_term=View%20the%20full%20media%20release" title="25-221MR Nexia Perth Audit pays penalty because of alleged prohibited non-assurance services provided by firm"><span>issued a $78,250 infringement notice to Nexia Perth</span></a><span>&nbsp;over prohibited services, and&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-223mr-asic-accepts-three-court-enforceable-undertakings-for-auditor-rotation-failures-at-hall-chadwick-nsw/" title="25-223MR ASIC accepts three court enforceable undertakings for auditor rotation failures at Hall Chadwick (NSW)"><span>entered into three court enforceable undertakings</span></a><span>&nbsp;with auditors associated with Hall Chadwick (NSW)and the firm over audit rotation failures.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>ASIC is conducting additional inquiries into potential breaches identified during this review.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&lsquo;Auditor independence is fundamental to audit quality and integrity. A strong focus on independence not only builds trust, it also fosters more rigorous challenge in the audit process thereby enhancing the preparation of high-quality financial information.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&lsquo;We expect auditors to carefully consider this report and use its findings to address gaps in their compliance,&rsquo; Ms O&rsquo;Rourke said.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span>Background</span></h2>
<h3><span>How ASIC selected its review cohort</span></h3>
<p><span>The 48 auditors and 19 audit firms that were the subject of ASIC&rsquo;s review were selected using a risk based, data driven methodology. This involved reviewing data relating to 2,900 auditors for indicators of potential threats to independence arising from: </span>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span>the provision of non-audit services to audit clients </span>&nbsp;</li>
<li><span>long association with clients (including rotation), and </span>&nbsp;</li>
<li><span>relationships between auditors and clients or their officeholders (including explicitly prohibited relationships). </span>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><span>The final review cohort of 48 auditors included individual auditors as well as auditors from the following firms:&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span>BDO Audit Pty Ltd&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>BDO Audit (WA) Pty Ltd&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Connect National Audit Pty Ltd&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Ernst &amp; Young&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Grant Thornton Audit Pty Ltd&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Hall Chadwick (NSW)&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Hall Chadwick WA Audit Pty Ltd&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Kelly Partners (Sydney) Audit Partnership&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>KPMG Australia&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Pitcher Partners&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Nexia Perth Audit Services Pty Ltd&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>PKF Melbourne Audit &amp; Assurance Pty Ltd&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>PricewaterhouseCoopers&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>RSM Australia Partners&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Stantons International Audit and Consulting Pty Ltd&nbsp;</span></li>

<li><span>William Buck (QLD) Pty Ltd&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>William Buck Audit (WA) Pty Ltd&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>REP 817 is the second report from ASIC&rsquo;s expanded program of work to improve financial report and audit quality. It follows&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-816-accounting-for-your-super-asic-s-review-into-the-financial-reporting-and-audit-of-super-funds/" title="REP 816 Accounting for your super: ASIC&rsquo;s review into the financial reporting and audit of super funds"><span>Report 816</span></a>&nbsp;<em>Accounting for your super: ASIC's review into the financial reporting and audit of super funds.&nbsp;</em><span>It highlights that</span>&nbsp;<span>ASIC is particularly concerned to ensure auditors are vigorously testing information on investments including asset valuations, especially when those assets are impaired or valuations are under pressure.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>An annual report on our financial reporting and audit surveillance of companies and auditors will be published later in October. </span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>ASIC announced this expanded program of work to support financial report and audit quality last year (</span><a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-101mr-asic-announces-30-june-2024-focus-areas-and-expanded-program-to-support-financial-reporting-and-audit-quality/" title="24-101MR ASIC announces 30 June 2024 focus areas and expanded program to support financial reporting and audit quality"><span>24-101MR</span></a><span>). </span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>For 2025-26, ASIC&rsquo;s financial reporting and audit program will increase the number of audit surveillances and include audit files where there are potential independence concerns.</span>&nbsp;</p>

<title>US Office Of The Comptroller Of The Currency Announces Actions To Reduce Regulatory Burden For Community Banks</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/us-office-of-the-comptroller-of-the-currency-announces-actions-to-reduce-regulat-2025106/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) today announced guidance to banks and proposed rulemakings to reduce regulatory burden for community banks.</p>
<p>These actions build upon the OCC&rsquo;s continued efforts to tailor its regulatory and supervisory frameworks to minimize burden for its regulated institutions and promote economic growth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Community banks have an outsized impact on lending and are vital to the strength of the U.S. economy. Today&rsquo;s actions relieve these banks of regulatory burden and unproductive reporting requirements, so they are better positioned to support their communities and drive economic growth,&rdquo; said Comptroller of the Currency Jonathan V. Gould. &ldquo;The OCC will continue to tailor our risk-based supervision to focus on material financial risk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In two bulletins, the OCC clarified examination procedures for community banks. The OCC announced it is removing fixed examination requirements for community banks and instead tailoring the examination scope and frequency to be consistent with risk-based supervision. This approach reduces supervisory burden, maintains the value of the federal charter and preserves banks&rsquo; safety and soundness while ensuring regulatory oversight does not distract banks from serving their communities. The OCC also announced that it will only use the core assessment standards in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.occ.treas.gov/publications-and-resources/publications/comptrollers-handbook/files/community-bank-supervision/index-community-bank-supervision.html" title="Community Bank Supervision">Community Bank Supervision booklet</a>&nbsp;of the Comptroller&rsquo;s Handbook to examine for retail nondeposit investment products.</p>
<p>In a separate bulletin, the OCC clarified its expectations that community banks should tailor model risk management practices commensurate with the bank&rsquo;s risk exposures, its business activities, and the complexity and extent of its model use. In particular, the bulletin highlights that the OCC&rsquo;s model risk management guidance does not impose prescriptive requirements, such as annual model validations. The OCC is also considering additional steps to enhance flexibility and reduce burden related to model risk management. This bulletin is just the first step in refining model risk management guidance for all of the OCC&rsquo;s regulated institutions.</p>
<p>The OCC also requested comments on two proposed rules. The OCC proposed rescinding its Fair Housing Home Loan Data System regulation, removing largely duplicative data collection requirements for national banks. The proposal would eliminate regulatory burden for banks without having a material impact on the availability of data necessary for the OCC to conduct its fair housing-related supervisory activities. The OCC also proposed broadening eligibility for expedited or reduced licensing procedures to community banks. This proposal would reduce the burden for community banks and tailor requirements to the size and risk profile of an institution. These proposed changes are intended to facilitate an increase in corporate activities and transactions by community banks.</p>
<p>The OCC will continue to prioritize reforms targeted to community banks ahead of broader reforms for the industry. Ongoing work includes adjusting the community bank leverage ratio framework and a simplified strategic plan process for community banks to comply with the Community Reinvestment Act.</p>

<title>Finansinspektionen Reciprocates The Norwegian Risk Weight Floors</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/finansinspektionen-reciprocates-the-norwegian-risk-weight-floors-2025106/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Finansinspektionen (FI) has passed a decision to reciprocate the Norwegian Ministry of Finance&rsquo;s decision of risk weight floors of 25 per cent for retail exposures collateralised by real estate in Norway and of 35 per cent for corporate exposures collateralised by real estate in Norway.</span></p>
<div class="editor-content">
<p>Through national measures pursuant to Article 458 of the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR), Norway has since 2020 introduced risk weight floors for real estate exposures in Norway. The Norwegian Ministry of Finance has decided to extend the risk weight floor of 35 per cent for corporate exposures collateralised by real estate and to adjust the level of the risk weight floor applicable to residential real estate from 20 per cent to 25 per cent. The risk weight floors applies for institutions that are authorized to use an internal ratings-based approach for the calculation of their capital requirements for credit risks.</p>
<p>FI will apply the threshold of NOK 37.8 billion for retail exposures collateralised by real estate and NOK 9.3 billion for corporate exposures collateralised by real estate, as stated by the Norwegian Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>FI:s decision means that Swedish credit institutions with permission to use the internal ratings-based approach, and which have exposures in Norway that exceed the specified thresholds, are covered by the Norwegian risk weight floors.</p>
<p>FI:s decision applies from the 31st of December 2025 to the 31st of December 2026.</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority: Daniel Pugh Sentenced To 7 And A Half Years In Prison For £1.3m Ponzi Scheme</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-financial-conduct-authority-daniel-pugh-sentenced-to-7-and-a-half-years-in-p-2025106/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-financial-conduct-authority-daniel-pugh-sentenced-to-7-and-a-half-years-in-p-2025106/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Daniel Pugh has been sentenced to 7 years and 6 months in prison for running a &pound;1.3m Ponzi scheme, following a prosecution brought by the FCA.</p>
<p>Pugh, aged 35, set up a Ponzi scheme with another individual that netted over &pound;1m. Run from his bedroom in Devon, the fraudulent Imperial Investment Fund (IIF) took money from 238 investors Pugh targeted largely through Facebook adverts. Investors were offered impossibly high returns of 1.4% a day, 7% a week or 350% a year.</p>
<p>Pugh received &pound;96,000 from the scheme. He used the money to support his lifestyle, including designer clothes, restaurants and withdrawing &pound;18,000 in cash.</p>
<p>The returns investors were promised did not materialise. Pugh duped investors into believing he was successfully trading and their money was safe. Even at the point he knew the scheme was collapsing, Pugh continued to try to attract more investors into the scheme.</p>
<p>Steve Smart, executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said:</p>
<p>'Pugh made outlandish claims to hook in victims but in reality this was nothing more than a massive fraud. Fighting financial crime is a priority for the FCA. We will take action to ensure criminals face repercussions for their actions, including being denied access to any ill-gotten gains.</p>
<p>'People&rsquo;s online personas are often at odds with reality, as was the case with Pugh. Claims that sound too good to be true, are usually just that. Check the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/consumers/check-if-firm-fca-authorised" title="FCA Firm Checker">FCA Firm Checker</a>&nbsp;before you invest.'</p>
<p>In sentencing, His Honour Judge Weekes said there were 'persistent and knowing breaches of the regulatory framework' by Pugh and that any remorse for his actions came 'woefully late'.</p>
<p>He added: 'The consequences for them [the victims] are marked and apart from financial loss they feel embarrassment.'</p>
<p>The FCA is pursuing confiscation proceedings to deprive Pugh of the proceeds of his crimes and compensate the victims.</p>
<p>Pugh was disqualified from being a Director of a company for 8 years, effective upon release from custody.</p>
<p>A further individual is wanted in relation to the same offences.</p>
<p>In the last 6 months alone, the FCA has secured criminal convictions in relation to 6 individuals for a range of financial crime offences including money laundering, insider dealing, and fraud.</p>
<p>Unauthorised investment schemes pose a huge risk to consumers, and can offer little or no protection. Many will not realise their investments are at risk until it is too late. Use our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/consumers/check-if-firm-fca-authorised" title="FCA Firm Checker">FCA Firm Checker</a>&nbsp;to see whether a firm is authorised by us.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ol>
<li>Daniel Pugh&rsquo;s date of birth is 19 April 1990.</li>
<li>The FCA has attempted to contact investors who lost out. Anyone who was scammed by IIF and has not heard from the FCA should email&nbsp;<a href="mailto: ophainesconsumercontact@fca.org.uk">ophainesconsumercontact@fca.org.uk</a>.</li>

<li>The sentencing was made up as follows:<ol>
<li>Seven years and 6 months of imprisonment for conspiracy to defraud.</li>
<li>Twenty four months of imprisonment for 2 offences of carrying on a regulated activity in the UK without FCA authorisation or an exemption, to be served concurrently.</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>TRG Screen, the leading provider of market data management solutions, today announced the acquisition of Crizit, a New York-based fintech company specializing in reference data optimization. The acquisition unites monitoring and real-time automation to transform how the financial services industry addresses one of its biggest market data management challenges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Financial institutions incur significant avoidable costs on reference data through redundant requests, suboptimal vendor routing, and lack of real-time visibility and cost optimization capabilities. TRG Screen tools give firms visibility into data consumption, but until now they haven&rsquo;t been able to automatically implement cost saving measures without disrupting operations.<br /><br />&ldquo;Financial institutions have long recognized the gap between visibility into their data and the ability to act on it in real time. Crizit&rsquo;s capabilities accelerate our product roadmap and deliver what our clients have been asking for - the ability to go beyond monitoring and achieve real-time optimization of their reference data spend,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span>Leigh Walters, Chief Executive Officer of TRG Screen.</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not just showing clients where inefficiencies occur, we&rsquo;re enabling them to act on those insights automatically.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.crizit.com/" rel="noopener">Crizit's</a>&nbsp;solutions provide intelligent data caching that eliminates redundant requests and optimizes vendor routing, delivering measurable cost reductions for market data consumption.&nbsp;<br /><br />Integrated with TRG Screen's monitoring and analytics engine, the combination delivers the industry's only comprehensive reference data optimization platform, enabling clients to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove duplicate requests automatically</li>
<li>Optimize routing and retrieving data from the most cost-efficient source</li>
<li>Lower costs with minimal disruption to operations</li>
</ul>
<p>"Crizit has spent four years building trust with top-tier clients by delivering exceptional software, deep expertise, and measurable ROI," said Ethan Shen, Crizit Managing Partner. "Teaming up with TRG Screen is an ideal complement to our innovation-driven approach. Their reach, scale&nbsp;and reputation will supercharge our mission to set new standards for the industry. We're excited about what we can accomplish together."<br /><br />With Crizit now part of TRG Screen, the company strengthens its leadership in supporting financial institutions to control costs, enhance efficiency, and innovate in data management. This move underscores TRG Screen&rsquo;s commitment to delivering solutions that set a new benchmark for how reference data is managed and optimized.</p>

<p>Today, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury and Acting Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service Scott Bessent announced that Commissioner of the Social Security Administration Frank Bisignano will serve as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the IRS.

<p>&ldquo;Frank is a businessman with an exceptional track record of driving growth and efficiency in the private and now public sector,&rdquo; said Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent. The IRS and SSA &ndash; two of the most public-facing and broadly impactful federal agencies &ndash; also share many of the same technological and customer service goals. This makes Mr. Bisignano a natural choice for this role. &ldquo;Under his leadership at the SSA, he has already made important and substantial progress, and we are pleased that he will bring this expertise to the IRS as we sharpen our focus on collections, privacy, and customer service in order to deliver better outcomes for hardworking Americans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frank J. Bisignano, the 18th Senate-confirmed Commissioner of the U.S. Social Security Administration, is a proven leader with more than four decades of experience guiding some of the world&rsquo;s largest financial institutions and technology companies through transformation and growth. Prior to leading SSA, Bisignano served as Chairman and CEO of Fiserv, the world&rsquo;s largest financial services and payment technology company. In 2019, he led the merger of Fiserv and First Data while he was serving as CEO of the latter company. While at J.P. Morgan Chase in the 2000&rsquo;s, Bisignano was the co-Chief Operating Officer and served as the CEO of its Mortgage Banking unit. He also previously held several roles at Citigroup, including Chief Administrative Officer and CEO of the company&rsquo;s Global Transaction Services unit.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Tradeweb Markets Inc. (Nasdaq: TW), a leading, global operator of electronic marketplaces for rates, credit, equities and money markets, today reported record total trading volume for the month of September 2025 of $63.7 trillion (tn)<a href="https://www.tradeweb.com/newsroom/media-center/news-releases/tradeweb-reports-record-september-2025-total-trading-volume-of-$63.7-trillion-and-record-average-daily-volume-of-$2.9-trillion#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span>[1]</span></a>. Average daily volume (ADV) for the month was a record $2.9tn, an increase of 10.0 percent (%) year-over-year (YoY). For the third quarter of 2025, total trading volume was a record $172.8tn and ADV was a record $2.6tn, an increase of 11.8% YoY (14.5% YoY excluding the impact of ICD), with preliminary average variable fees per million dollars of volume traded of $2.16 and total preliminary fixed fees for rates, credit, equities and money markets of $95.5 million (mm)<a href="https://www.tradeweb.com/newsroom/media-center/news-releases/tradeweb-reports-record-september-2025-total-trading-volume-of-$63.7-trillion-and-record-average-daily-volume-of-$2.9-trillion#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><span>[2]</span></a>.</p>
<p>Tradeweb CEO Billy Hult said: &ldquo;Tradeweb reported record ADV for both September and the third quarter, with double-digit growth in each over the year-ago period. September was active across all asset classes, helping us finish the quarter with strong momentum. Our markets remained resilient despite depressed rate volatility, with strong client engagement across various tools and protocols including RFQ and our automated solution AiEX.&rdquo;</p>

<ul>
<li>U.S. government bond ADV was up 3.5% YoY to $240.2 billion (bn). European government bond ADV was up 27.3% YoY to $63.0bn. 
<ul>
<li>U.S. government bond ADV was led by growth in the institutional client channel, which achieved its second highest month ever. Robust European government bond ADV was driven by strong volumes across our institutional and wholesale client channels. Strong activity in the U.S. and Europe was supported by an increased number of clients trading across a diverse set of trading protocols.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Mortgage ADV was up 21.5% YoY to $291.9bn.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> 
<ul>
<li>Record To-Be-Announced (TBA) activity was primarily driven by elevated trading from real-money accounts and a sharp increase in dollar-roll activity YoY. Tradeweb&rsquo;s specified pool platform reported strong volumes supported by higher origination activity and broader client adoption.</li>

<ul>
<li>Fully electronic U.S. credit ADV was down 0.9% YoY to $8.6bn and European credit ADV was up 4.2% YoY to $2.9bn. 
<ul>
<li>U.S. credit volumes were driven by continued client adoption of Tradeweb protocols, most notably in Tradeweb AllTrade&reg; and request-for-quote (RFQ), which were offset by a decline in Portfolio Trading (PT). Tradeweb captured 18.0% and 7.2% share of fully electronic U.S high grade and U.S. high yield TRACE, respectively, as measured by Tradeweb. We also reported 25.2% total share of U.S. high grade TRACE and 9.5% total share of U.S. high yield TRACE. European credit volumes were driven by record Tradeweb Automated Intelligent Execution (AiEX) activity. Cash credit PT ADV decreased by 12.6% YoY, with non-comp PT ADV down 35.9% YoY. PT carries a relatively lower FPM as compared to the broader cash credit average, with non-comp PT carrying a lower FPM than PT overall.</li>

<li>Municipal bonds ADV was up 35.3% YoY to $521 mm.

<li>U.S. ETF ADV was up 34.4% YoY to $10.2bn and European ETF ADV was up 22.2% YoY to $3.7bn. 
<ul>
<li>Strong global ETF volumes were driven by robust activity in our institutional and wholesale channels, as more clients continued to embrace the RFQ protocol, as well as our Tradeweb AiEX solution, which reached a record in adoption in the U.S.</li>

<ul>
<li>Repo ADV was up 19.2% YoY to $811.7bn. 
<ul>
<li>Record global repo trading activity was supported by increased client participation across the platform. In the U.S., strong growth was driven by the effects of the Fed&rsquo;s balance sheet unwind. Additionally, balances in the Fed&rsquo;s reverse repo facility (RRP) remained at relatively low levels throughout most of the month, despite a small increase into month-end. In Europe, central banks deployed repo operations more aggressively to provide liquidity amid tightening macro conditions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other Money Markets ADV was down 11.5% YoY to $267.7bn. 
<ul>
<li>Other money markets activity was lower YoY, driven by certain ICD clients continuing to rebuild their money market fund balances following share buyback activity in the market and increased business-related spend earlier this year. This decline was partially offset by the addition of new clients.</li>

<p>On 26 September 2025, ACER received a&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsPCQ4DA1hRVUxYV1FSHVYNAgEdC10DUxoDUQtUVQEGUlVXAgUdVFNaU19SBFEdUFxTDx0GD1AFGgxcUQ8ZAgUPBlUHBVRXV1RXRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">proposal</a>&nbsp;from the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) to amend the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsHBwEJWQMCAExcAVUAHVYABlUdUA4FURoHBAJVAgFXA1AHUgUdVFNaU19SBFEdUFxTDx0GD1AFGgxcUQ8ZAgUPBlUHBVRXV1RXRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">methodology for the regional procurement of balancing capacity</a>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is the methodology about?</span></p>
<p>Transmission system operators (TSOs) must always keep the power system in balance. TSOs usually procure the balancing capacity needed at national level, but to lower procurement costs, they may opt for utilising available voluntary balancing bids from other countries (e.g. made available when local capacity exceeds national needs). &nbsp;If transmission capacity is expected to be available across bidding zones during balancing, these bids can also be used to reduce balancing capacity needs.</p>
<p>The methodology for the regional procurement of balancing capacity enables regional coordination centres (RCCs) to evaluate how voluntary balancing bids can be utilised effectively across borders. Following this evaluation, regional coordination centres provide TSOs with recommendations to reduce the volume of procured balancing capacity, hence utilising the flexibility of the EU electricity system.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why amend the methodology?</span></p>
<p>As&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtXAgEJAlRcVkxfVFUHHVZcBQQdClxQBRoDAFcADVEBVQ5XBgAdVFNaU19SBFEdUFxTDx0GD1AFGgxcUQ8ZAgUPBlUHBVRXV1RXRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">requested by ACER</a>, European TSOs propose to update the reliability parameters used by regional coordination centres to assess the availability of cross-zonal capacity and voluntary balancing bids. This is important as reliability parameters need to reflect the most relevant data, enabling TSOs to procure balancing capacity efficiently, and at the same time managing their operational risks. This change should foster a more transparent and coordinated process and improve the balancing of EU power system.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the next steps?</span></p>
<p>ACER will decide by 5 January 2026.</p>
<p>Interested parties may submit comments or questions to&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">ACER-ELE-2025-009@acer.europa.eu</a>&nbsp;by 31 October 2025.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>IOSCO&rsquo;s World Investor Week (WIW) is a week-long global campaign to raise awareness of the importance of investor education and protection, and to highlight the various initiatives of securities regulators in these two critical areas.</p>
<p>Kicking off on 6 October 2025, and with the support of the G20 Presidency, WIW2025 brings together organizations from over 100 jurisdictions to drive awareness around trending issues which impact investors around the world.</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s main themes include&nbsp;<strong>Digital Finance</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Crypto Assets</strong>, the impact of&nbsp;<strong>new Technologies and AI</strong>, prevention from&nbsp;<strong>Fraud &amp; Scam</strong>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<strong>Basics of Investing</strong>. They align with IOSCO&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iosco.org%2F%3FIOSCO-Roadmap-to-Retail-Investor-Online-Safety&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cmailing-lists%40iosco.org%7C9b7e7a0b017444d1eb6508de04c36994%7Cbcc6c66cdb3b48328af2cc363a097444%7C0%7C0%7C638953434481893895%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=3P7w%2B4p5awlfEOnZalG7DLNAiLNd03gYfU%2F6GUjCyOo%3D&amp;reserved=0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Roadmap for Retail Investor Online Safety</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In today&acute;s fast-paced markets, technology is transforming how people invest. For students and young investors, digital platforms are now often the gateway into the world of investing, and very convenient. But convenience is not enough. Smart investors stick to the basics: doing careful research, staying diversified, and being prepared for unexpected events.&rdquo; -&nbsp;<em>IOSCO Board Chair&nbsp;<strong>Jean-Paul Servais</strong>, who also serves as Chair of the Belgium Financial Services &amp; Markets Authority</em></p>
<p>Mr&nbsp;<strong>Camille Beaudoin</strong>, Director, Financial Education Expertise and Partnerships, AMF Qu&eacute;bec and Chair of IOSCO&rsquo;s Committee leading this year&rsquo;s campaign, added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where scams are concerned, relationship investment scams in particular are estimated to have caused people to lose tens of billions of dollars globally. WIW 2025&rsquo;s anti-fraud relationship investment scams campaign, made possible by the support of many well-established organisations around the globe, aims to inform investors about the warning signs of these scams and help empower them with information to protect themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As in previous years, WIW2025 will be supported by a number of partner organizations including the Financial Standards Planning Board&rsquo;s (FSPB) bespoke &lsquo;World Financial Planning Day&rsquo; (October 8) and the World Federation of Exchanges who encourage members to &lsquo;Ring the Bell&rsquo; for WIW2025.</p>

<title>ICE Mortgage Monitor: Falling Rates Lead To Best Homebuying Affordability In 2.5 Years - Home Prices Begin To Firm As Affordability Improves And Inventory Tightens</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ice-mortgage-monitor-falling-rates-lead-to-best-homebuying-affordability-in-25-2025106/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ICE Mortgage Technology, neutral provider of a robust end-to-end mortgage platform and part of Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE: ICE), today released its October 2025 ICE Mortgage Monitor Report. ICE data reveals that home affordability has reached its best level in 2.5 years, driven by easing mortgage rates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The recent pullback in rates has created a tailwind for both homebuyers and existing borrowers,&rdquo; said Andy Walden, Head of Mortgage and Housing Market Research at ICE. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re seeing affordability at a 2.5-year high, which is beginning to bolster purchase demand, while creating more opportunities for homeowners to lower their monthly payments with a rate-and-term refinance loan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Key findings from the October Mortgage Monitor include:</p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li><span>Affordability reaches best level since early 2023</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="bwmarginl1">With 30-year mortgage rates averaging 6.26% in mid-September, the monthly principal and interest (P&amp;I) payment on an average-priced home has fallen to $2,148, or 30% of the median U.S. household income. Though still more than five percentage points above its long-run average, P&amp;I costs have declined from 32% earlier this summer and significantly improved from their 35% peak in late 2023.</p>
<p class="bwmarginl1">While roughly a dozen of the nation&rsquo;s 100 largest housing markets &mdash; primarily in the Midwest &mdash; are near long-term average affordability levels, coastal markets remain significantly stretched. For example, in Los Angeles, 62% of the median income is required to afford an average-priced home, underscoring the disparity in markets.</p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li><span>Home prices firm as affordability improves and inventory tightens</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="bwmarginl1">Annual home price growth rose to +1.2% in September after eight months of slowing, driven by falling inventory and improved affordability. Nationally, listings remain 17&ndash;19% below 2017&ndash;2019 norms, as sellers in previously oversupplied markets delay sales to avoid price cuts.</p>
<p class="bwmarginl1">The Northeast and Midwest lead in annual price gains, fueled by low inventory and stronger affordability. In September, 80% of markets saw price increases &mdash; the highest share in nine months &mdash; while only 20% declined, down from 55% two months ago. Still, nearly half of major markets remain below recent peaks, with 25% over 2% off and 10% more than 5% below their highs.</p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li><span>Borrower profiles reflect improved financial stability</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="bwmarginl1">The average credit score for purchase locks has climbed above 736, the highest recorded in the six-year history of ICE&rsquo;s origination dataset, indicating a shift toward a more credit-qualified borrower mix. At the same time, debt-to-income (DTI) ratios for purchase rate locks have dropped to 38.5%, marking their lowest level in 2.5 years as affordability continues to improve. For rate-and-term refinances, the average DTI has fallen to 34.1%, a 3.5-year low, while the average credit score has risen to 722, a nine-month high.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As affordability improves and homeowners gain the ability to refinance, lenders and servicers need to be ready to act quickly,&rdquo; said Tim Bowler, President of ICE Mortgage Technology. &ldquo;Our integrated MSP&reg; servicing and Encompass&reg; loan origination systems, combined with robust data and analytics, enable our customers to identify and engage borrowers at the right moment &mdash; whether they&rsquo;re looking to purchase, refinance or tap into their equity. By leveraging ICE&rsquo;s technology, our clients can deliver a modern experience and capture opportunities as market dynamics shift.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The full October Mortgage Monitor report contains a deeper analysis of August mortgage payment performance, mortgage origination trends, and housing market trends featuring September ICE Home Price Index (HPI) data.</p>
<p>Further detail, including charts, can be found in<i>&nbsp;</i><a href="https://mortgagetech.ice.com/publicdocs/mortgage/imt-october-2025-mortgage-monitor-report-7tZGfFsYkUxV.pdf" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">this month&rsquo;s Mortgage Monitor report</a>.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ACER encourages European associations of energy market participants to engage in stakeholder activities supporting REMIT implementation from 2026 to 2028.</p>
<p>We welcome associations with expertise in the areas of electricity, natural gas, liquified natural gas (LNG) and hydrogen, dealing with supply, transportation and storage, including energy derivatives (where relevant for REMIT reporting framework). &nbsp;</p>
<p>Deadline to apply is 31 October 2025.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What&rsquo;s behind this?</span></p>
<p>The Regulation on Wholesale Energy Market Integrity and Transparency (<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsDUAcDAlQGUkwABAVTHVYBVAMdUFhXAxoGUQoGVwJTAVNUAQcdVQdUUF0FUVodUVsAVR0GDlAHGgxcAVYZBgAGBFQCAQUDBwFXRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">REMIT</a>) is the EU framework that aims to prevent wholesale energy market abuse and support fair competition. The Regulation was&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsEUgZVBwddVUxaUARXHVZcDA8dCwkEAhoMBlZUBQIFUw4HDwMdVQdUUF0FUVodUVsAVR0GDlAHGgxcAVYZBgAGBFQCAQUDBwFXRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">revised</a>&nbsp;in 2024 to keep pace with evolving market dynamics.</p>
<p>To ensure the revised Regulation is implemented effectively and consistently, ACER works closely with different stakeholders across the EU. European associations of energy market participants are key to bringing practical experience and sector-wide perspectives that help align implementation with real market practices.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;will associations contribute?</span></p>
<p>Associations participating in ACER&rsquo;s stakeholder activities will:</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The European Supervisory Authorities (EBA, EIOPA and ESMA &ndash; the ESAs) today issued a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2025-10/Joint_ESAs_revised_warning_on_crypto-assets.pdf">warning</a>&nbsp;to consumers, reminding that crypto-assets can be risky and that legal protection, if any, may be limited depending on which crypto-assets they invest in. This warning is accompanied by a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2025-10/Joint_ESAs_Factsheet_on_crypto-assets.pdf">factsheet</a>&nbsp;explaining what the new EU regulation on Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) means for consumers. The ESAs recommend concrete steps consumers can take to make informed decisions before investing in crypto-assets, such as checking if the provider is authorised in the EU.</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>Since December 2024, MiCA applies to certain types of crypto-assets and establishes a consistent supervisory regime at both national and European level for issuers and providers of crypto-assets services across the EU.</span></p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>While innovative financial products, including crypto-assets, may enhance the efficiency, resilience, and competitiveness of the EU&rsquo;s financial system, consumers should be mindful that not all crypto-assets are the same. They should also be warned that their consumer protection (if any) might be limited depending on the types of crypto-assets and crypto-asset services they are using (e.g. lack of access to comprehensive information or a transparent and uniform claims handling procedure).</span></p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>Consumers are recommended to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>learn about the product or service and evaluate the risk before investing,</span></li>
<li><span>check the provider of crypto-asset services is authorised in the EU and,</span></li>
<li><span>make sure any wallets used to store their crypto-assets are sufficiently secured.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>Those steps are particularly important at a time when consumers&rsquo; interest in such products and services is on the rise, in part due to aggressive promotion on social media by finfluencers.</span></p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>The Joint ESAs factsheet &ndash; also available in all EU languages &ndash; provides an overview of what crypto assets are, which ones are regulated under MiCA and which ones are not, and the providers consumers may encounter.</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul class="rte--list">
<li>Eurex trading volumes down 4 percent in September reflecting calmer market conditions.&nbsp;</li>
<li>OTC Clearing posted strong momentum, with notional outstanding volumes climbing 37 percent.</li>
<li>Eurex Repo reported solid growth, fueled by a 56 percent surge in GC Pooling transactions.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Eurex &mdash; Europe&rsquo;s leading derivatives exchange and, together with Eurex Clearing, one of the world&rsquo;s leading central counterparties &mdash; reported lower trading volumes in September as market activity cooled. The exchange handled 188.3 million contracts during the month, down 4 percent from the 196.0 million contracts recorded a year earlier. Interest rate derivatives stood out, rising 10 percent year-on-year to 104.2 million contracts. By contrast, equity derivatives fell 14 percent to 23.5 million contracts, while index derivatives dropped 16 percent to 60.2 million contracts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>OTC Clearing posted strong growth in September, with notional outstanding volumes up 37 percent year-on-year to EUR 46,699 billion, compared with EUR 34,115 billion in the same month of 2024. The surge was driven largely by overnight index swaps, which leapt 52 percent to EUR 6,084 billion. Interest rate swaps also contributed significantly, rising 29 percent to EUR 19,814 billion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eurex Repo, Eurex&rsquo;s leading electronic market for secured funding and financing, posted another strong month in September 2025, with average term-adjusted volumes climbing 52 percent year-on-year to EUR 462.2 billion. Growth was led by the GC Pooling segment, which jumped 56 percent, while the Repo Market segment also advanced, rising 48 percent. The results underline Eurex Repo&rsquo;s continued upward momentum in secured funding and financing.&nbsp;</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority: Regulators Join Forces To Tackle Poor Claims Management Practices</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA, Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA), Information Commissioner&rsquo;s Office (ICO) and the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) are joining together to tackle misleading advertising and inadequate information provided by some claims management companies (CMCs) and law firms working on motor finance claims, and the risk that excessive fees are charged to clients.</p>
</div>
</section></p>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>Alison Walters, director, consumer finance, at the FCA, said:</p>
<p>'Misleading advertising and inadequate disclosure have meant that people are signing contracts with some firms without the facts. When they try to exit, they face high fees. We&rsquo;re acting where we see bad practice and, through our own advertising, we&rsquo;re ensuring consumers can make informed choices.'</p>
<p>Paul Philip, chief executive of the SRA, said:</p>
<p>'The risks and issues facing consumers in this area of the market are unprecedented, and we are using all the levers at our disposal to protect consumers, identify poor practices and hold law firms to account.'</p>
<p>Using&nbsp;powers under the Consumer Rights Act 2015 and, for the first time, under the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024,&nbsp;the FCA, working closely with the SRA, has required 9 law firms to provide information about their exit fees. Two FCA regulated CMCs have agreed to change their exit fee policies.</p>
<p>Two others have agreed not to take on clients or to advertise until they&rsquo;re able to show the FCA they comply with FCA rules. We&rsquo;re expecting to write to FCA regulated CMCs involved in motor finance claims this week to reiterate our expectations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FCA&rsquo;s increased proactive monitoring has led to the removal or amendment of more than 740 misleading adverts by FCA regulated CMCs since January 2024.&nbsp;This number increased significantly following the Johnson judgment. Concerns include unrealistic claims about success rates and the value of potential compensation.</p>
<p>The FCA has launched a &pound;1m ad campaign to make people aware they don&rsquo;t need to use a CMC or law firm to seek motor finance compensation, and that they stand to lose a chunk of any compensation they&rsquo;re owed if they choose to. Research shows 4 in 10 people don&rsquo;t know they can receive motor finance compensation without using a CMC or law firm. The campaign will run online and on radio.</p>
<p>The SRA is investigating 76 law firms involved in high-volume claims and has closed five firms to protect the public.&nbsp;Its recent Thematic Review set out the key issues,&nbsp;and it has made clear its expectations on termination fees. The FCA and SRA continue to work closely, given that many FCA regulated CMCs refer motor finance claims to law firms.</p>
<p>Since January 2025, the ICO has received over 230,000 complaints via the spam reporting service regarding unsolicited and unlawful direct marketing practices linked to motor finance claims. In response, the ICO has multiple investigations ongoing and is actively considering further regulatory action against several organisations.</p>
<p>The ASA is also reviewing advertising practices in this sector.</p>
<h2>Consumer guidance</h2>
<p>Consumers who believe they have been misled by advertising, signed up without their consent, charged unreasonable fees, had their data mishandled, or otherwise feel they have been treated unfairly by a CMC or law firm should first complain to the firm. If dissatisfied with the response, they should take their complaint to the&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://cmc.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/consumers/complain" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)">Claims Management Ombudsman<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.legalombudsman.org.uk/how-to-complain/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)">Legal Ombudsman<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>.</p>
<p>To support the public, the SRA has also published guidance on&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.sra.org.uk/consumers/choosing/motor-finance-compensation-claims/__;!!NpgLxcn0NwQP6K3JyhKAL1gv!qnbNLx_J8aorAaWvn718rSD-gmHHWRMiakudb7alvvRcedWsXAHwQIOEy3qc1gVuN-ZDDT3iZyLyPi0aaQWOkWDXJn7s$" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)">motor finance claims<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>, and on&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.sra.org.uk/consumers/choosing/no-win-no-fee/__;!!NpgLxcn0NwQP6K3JyhKAL1gv!qnbNLx_J8aorAaWvn718rSD-gmHHWRMiakudb7alvvRcedWsXAHwQIOEy3qc1gVuN-ZDDT3iZyLyPi0aaQWOkSW_9CDn$" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)">no-win, no-fee agreements<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>.</p>

They can also report spam text messages to the ICO by forwarding the message for free to 7726 (which spells out SPAM).</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ol>
<li>To require information from law firms it does not regulate, the FCA is using its powers under the Consumer Rights Act 2015. This is the first time the FCA has used these powers as a public designated enforcer under the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024.</li>

<title>Spanish Stock Exchange Opens The Session With A Bell Ringing For Financial Literacy - The Event Took Place At The Barcelona Stock Exchange</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>BME joins the celebration of Financial Education Day with a&nbsp;<span>Bell Ringing</span>&nbsp;at the Barcelona Stock Exchange. The event is part of the &ldquo;Ring the Bell for Financial Literacy&rdquo; initiative, a project promoted by the&nbsp;<span>World Federation of Exchanges (WFE)</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span>IOSCO&nbsp;</span>as part of World Investor Week, in which stock exchanges around the world participate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Bell Ringing was led by&nbsp;<span>Al&iacute;cia Romero,</span>&nbsp;Minister of Economy and Finance of the Generalitat of Catalonia, accompanied by<span>&nbsp;Juan Flames</span>, Chief Executive Officer of BME.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Minister of Economy and Finance of the Generalitat of Catalonia,&nbsp;<span>Al&iacute;cia Romero</span>, has stressed the importance of providing tools that enable citizens to achieve good financial literacy. In this regard, she warned that a lack of such training can leave families in a vulnerable position when it comes to making financial decisions. She also defended the culture of hard work at a time when the prevailing discourse on social media promotes the idea of &ldquo;easy and immediate money.&rdquo; &ldquo;We must provide the tools to be able to invest,&rdquo; she concluded.</p>
<p>For his part, Juan Flames stated that fostering financial literacy is a priority to encourage retail investors to return to the stock market. &ldquo;BME is working intensively with regulators and the broader financial industry to support the creation of the pan-European account. This new savings or investment product with tax incentives seeks to make it easier for citizens of the European Union to save and invest cross-border in the single market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition to the Bell Ringing, BME complements the activities for Financial Education Day with a series of webinars organized by Instituto BME, as a collaborating entity of &ldquo;Finanzas para Todos.&rdquo; This initiative is driven by the CNMV, the Bank of Spain, and the Ministry of Economy, Industry and Enterprise. This year&rsquo;s motto is &ldquo;Get informed. Plan. Decide.&rdquo; The program reaches its eleventh edition and it is the second time that the day&rsquo;s central event is held in Barcelona.</p>

<p>My aim today is to explain the conduct of monetary policy in the euro area.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251006~0adce2b3d4.en.html#footnote.1" id="fn1">1</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;I will first outline the approach to monetary policy that is embedded in our monetary policy strategy statement.

</p>
<h2>The monetary policy strategy of the ECB</h2>
<p>Our recently-updated monetary policy strategy statement provides a comprehensive strategic framework for many dimensions of monetary policy.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251006~0adce2b3d4.en.html#footnote.2" id="fn2">2</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;Here, I will focus on the elements that are most directly relevant for monetary policy decision making.</p>
<p>Paragraph five of our monetary policy strategy statement states:</p>
<p><em>The Governing Council considers that price stability is best maintained by aiming for two per cent inflation over the medium term. The Governing Council&rsquo;s commitment to this target is symmetric. Symmetry means that the Governing Council considers negative and positive deviations from this target as equally undesirable. The two per cent inflation target provides a clear anchor for inflation expectations, which is essential for maintaining price stability.</em></p>
<p>The point target of 2.0 per cent provides valuable clarity; the symmetric commitment reinforces this clarity by treating positive and negative deviations as equally undesirable. Such clarity would not be provided by a zonal inflation target, which would require households, firms and market participants to continuously re-assess which part of the zone constituted the de facto current operational target for monetary policy.</p>
<p>Of course, a clear target does not mean that the ECB seeks to deliver inflation at two per cent at all times. In particular, paragraph seven explains:</p>
<p><em>The Governing Council confirms the medium-term orientation of its monetary policy strategy. This allows for inevitable short-term deviations of inflation from the target, as well as lags and uncertainty in the transmission of monetary policy to the economy and to inflation. The flexibility of the medium-term orientation takes into account that the appropriate monetary policy response to a deviation of inflation from the target is context-specific and depends on the origin, magnitude and persistence of the deviation. Subject to maintaining anchored inflation expectations, it also allows the Governing Council in its monetary policy decisions to cater for other considerations relevant to the pursuit of price stability.</em></p>
<p>In terms of origin, different types of shock may move inflation and real economic activity in the same direction (as in the case of demand shocks) or create a temporary trade-off (as in the case of supply shocks): the medium-term orientation provides flexibility to look through temporary shocks to inflation that may dissipate on their own accord, thus avoiding unnecessary volatility in activity and employment.<sup></sup><span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251006~0adce2b3d4.en.html#footnote.3" id="fn3">3</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;In terms of magnitude and persistence, a small, transitory shock clearly poses less risk to the medium-term anchor than a larger, more persistent shock. In any event, the lags in the transmission of monetary policy mean that it would not be practical to respond to inflation shocks that are expected to dissipate quickly.</p>
<p>In turn, paragraph eight ties the setting of monetary policy to delivering the two per cent target over the medium-term:</p>
<p><em>The Governing Council is committed to setting monetary policy to ensure that inflation stabilises at the two per cent target in the medium term.</em></p>
<p>That is, the ECB follows an inflation targeting regime, but with substantial flexibility provided by the medium-term orientation. This means that monetary policy decisions are firmly grounded by the commitment to stabilise inflation at two per cent over the medium term, with due regard for the value of flexibility under the circumstances that prevail at any given point in time.</p>
<p>Paragraph nine&nbsp;<a class="link-inline" id="_Hlk210550846"></a>elaborates on the inputs into these monetary policy decisions:</p>
<p><em>The Governing Council bases its monetary policy decisions, including the evaluation of the proportionality of its decisions and potential side effects, on an integrated assessment of all relevant factors. In particular, it takes into account not only the most likely path for inflation and the economy but also surrounding risks and uncertainty, including through the appropriate use of scenario and sensitivity analyses.</em></p>
<p>The second sentence in paragraph nine is new and is an important articulation that monetary policy decisions are made under uncertainty, such that it is essential to take a wide-angled perspective that incorporates not only the baseline path but also the surrounding risks and uncertainty. This sentence also reflects the reality that much of the policy debate is about risk management, especially under current conditions of elevated uncertainty.</p>
<p>Indeed, an important conclusion of the 2025 update of our monetary policy strategy is that an array of structural changes is likely to make uncertainty a defining characteristic of inflation environment for the rest of this decade. In particular, paragraph one states:</p>
<p><em>Ongoing structural shifts related to geopolitics, digitalisation, artificial intelligence, demography, the threat to environmental sustainability and changes in the international financial system suggest that the inflation environment will remain uncertain and potentially more volatile, with larger target deviations in both directions, posing challenges for the conduct of monetary policy.</em></p>
<p>Finally, paragraph six highlights that the biggest threat to the medium-term inflation target comes from large, sustained deviations from the target. In particular, paragraph six states:</p>
<p><em>To maintain the symmetry of its inflation target, the Governing Council recognises the importance of appropriately forceful or persistent monetary policy action in response to large, sustained deviations of inflation from the target in either direction, to avoid deviations becoming entrenched through de-anchored inflation expectations. In the event of significant disinflationary shocks, the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates needs to be taken into account. In the event of significant inflationary shocks, possible non-linearities in price and wage setting need to be taken into account.</em></p>
<p>Taken together, these elements of the monetary policy strategy statement provide essential foundations for the conduct of monetary policy. Still, at any given point in time, these strategic principles have to be converted into an operational approach to making monetary policy decisions.</p>
<p>In particular, there is a clear difference between &ldquo;standard&rdquo; phases in which there may be inflation shocks but not to the degree that would constitute &ldquo;large, sustained deviations of inflation from the target&rdquo; and &ldquo;acute&rdquo; phases in which the central bank must act with appropriate force or persistence to avoid deviations becoming entrenched through de-anchored inflation expectations. If a deviation of inflation from the target is in the intermediate range that is neither &ldquo;small and transitory&rdquo; nor &ldquo;large and sustained&rdquo;, the appropriate monetary policy response will be nonzero but will also necessarily be more restrained than the scale that constitutes &ldquo;appropriately forceful or persistent&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In this range, the optimal calibration of monetary policy is a question of cyclical adjustment within a more narrow interval for the policy rate. By and large, the monetary policy literature has primarily focused on such cyclical adjustments, with many models examining the optimal monetary policy response to relatively &ldquo;small&rdquo; shocks that can be captured by linearised treatments of the dynamic adjustment of the economy and inflation.</p>
<p>In contrast, the frequency of &ldquo;large, sustained&rdquo; deviations of inflation from the target is relatively rare. Indeed, in the absence of an extraordinary constellation of shocks (such as the combination of the pandemic&nbsp;<a class="link-inline" id="_Hlk210551005"></a>and Russia&rsquo;s unjustified invasion of Ukraine), a large and sustained deviation of inflation from the target would most likely result from a persistent failure in the conduct of monetary policy, with an insufficient response to cyclical shocks fostering an incremental, cumulative drift away from the target that de-anchored inflation expectations through a lack of policy responsiveness to material inflation shocks.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251006~0adce2b3d4.en.html#footnote.4" id="fn4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>In what follows, I turn to analysing the current inflation outlook before outlining some considerations for the conduct of monetary policy in the near term.</p>
<h2>The baseline inflation outlook</h2>
<p>In this section, I discuss some features of the baseline in the&nbsp;<a class="link-inline" id="_Hlk210551306"></a>September 2025 staff macroeconomic projections. I turn to the surrounding risks in the final section.</p>
<p>As a preliminary caveat, the baseline is conditioned on the prevailing economic and financial data at the time the projections are constructed, including the expected path for short-term policy rates that is embedded in the market curve. Since the projection exercises are comprehensive in scope, it is only of limited value to attempt &ldquo;real-time updates&rdquo; in between projection exercises that are based on the mechanical impact of shifts in individual variables, since a shift in any given variable may reflect a broader underlying dynamic process that jointly affects many variables. For this reason, I focus on the September projections rather than attempting to comment on the subsequent data flows.</p>
<p>Under the baseline, inflation is projected to average 2.1 per cent in 2025, 1.7 per cent in 2026 and 1.9 per cent in 2027. Compared to the 2021-2024 inflation rates of 2.6 per cent, 8.4 per cent, 5.4 per cent and 2.4 per cent respectively, the current inflation outlook is much more benign. At the same time, the projected downward deviations from the 2.0 per cent medium-term target warrant close examination.</p>
<p>It is analytically helpful to differentiate between energy inflation and non-energy inflation (the aggregate of food, goods and services inflation).<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251006~0adce2b3d4.en.html#footnote.5" id="fn5">5</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;Under the baseline, non-energy inflation is projected to stand at 2.5 per cent in 2025, 2.0 per cent in 2026 and 1.9 per cent in 2027 (see Chart 1). Relative to the 2021-2024 non-energy inflation rates of 1.5 per cent, 5.1 per cent, 6.3 per cent and 2.9 per cent, we can interpret the baseline as indicating that further non-energy disinflation will take place in the coming quarters before stabilising at around two per cent.</p>
<p>Within the non-energy category, Chart 2 shows that further disinflation is projected both for the food and services categories. Food inflation is projected at 2.9 per cent in 2025, 2.3 per cent in 2026 and 2.3 percent in 2027; services inflation is projected at 3.4 per cent in 2025, 2.7 per cent in 2026 and 2.3 per cent in 2027. The inflation rate for non-energy industrial goods (the NEIG category) is relatively flat at 0.6 per cent in 2025, 0.4 per cent in 2026 and 0.8 per cent in 2027.</p>
<p>The projected further ongoing disinflation in non-energy inflation can primarily be connected to the anticipated further deceleration in wage growth: growth in compensation per employee is expected to decelerate from 3.4 per cent in 2025 to 2.7 per cent in 2026 and 2027. This profile of wage growth deceleration is cross-validated by the ECB wage tracker and an array of survey evidence. In turn, wage deceleration reflects the recovery in real wage levels after several years of above-average nominal wage increases and the softening in labour market conditions.</p>
<p>Ongoing disinflation also reflects euro appreciation, the spillover from energy deflation, and the deflationary impact of lower export prices from China. Furthermore, the 2024-2025 inflation rates were also pushed up as governments reversed the array of fiscal subsidies that were introduced to mitigate the surge in the cost of living in 2022-2023; these effects wash out of the inflation data in 2026. The lagged impact of our past phase of a restrictive monetary policy stance contributed to disinflation by moderating domestic demand, which&nbsp;<a class="link-inline" id="_Hlk210551558"></a>put downward pressure on both wage growth and profit growth.</p>
<p>In combination, these forces are projected to level out in 2026-2027, such that non-energy inflation is projected to stabilise at around two per cent. The switch from a disinflation dynamic to a projected stable inflation rate around the target has been supported by the 200 basis points in rate reductions since June 2024 and, of course, is conditional on delivering a target-consistent monetary policy stance over the projection horizon.</p>
<p>The baseline for energy inflation presents quite a different profile. Energy inflation is projected at -1.6 per cent in 2025, -1.1 per cent in 2026 and 2.4 per cent in 2027. The projected 3.5 per centage point jump in energy inflation in 2027 is in part related to the impact of the scheduled introduction of&nbsp;<a class="link-inline" id="_Hlk210551830"></a>the EU Emissions Trading System 2 (ETS2) in 2027, which should have a one-off impact on the energy price level.</p>
<p>This profile for energy inflation should be understood in the context of the extraordinary surge in energy inflation during 2021-2022 (Chart 3). Having initially declined during the first year of the pandemic to -6.8 per cent in 2020, energy inflation rose to 13.0 per cent in 2021 and 37.0 per cent in 2022. Subsequently, there has been a mild deflation pattern, with energy inflation at -2.0 per cent in 2023 and -2.2 per cent in 2024. Accordingly, we can interpret the energy inflation projections for 2025 and 2026 as reflecting ongoing-albeit-weaker energy deflation in the aftermath of the extraordinary surge in the relative price of energy during 2021-2022.</p>
<p>An important open question is whether the projected jump in energy inflation in 2027 reflects the end of this energy deflation episode or is rather just a one-time deviation from an ongoing correction process by which the relative price of energy re-attaches to its trend line after the extraordinary 2021-2022 surge. In turn, the level and direction of energy inflation has spillover implications for food, goods and services inflation rates: a material departure from the baseline energy inflation path would also trigger a material departure from the baseline non-energy inflation path.</p>
<p>I will return to the discussion of energy inflation in the context of the risk assessment in the next section.</p>

<h2><a id="_Hlk210552444"></a>The near-term conduct of monetary policy</h2>
<p>Striking the balance between the baseline assessment and the risk assessment in determining the monetary policy decision at any given meeting is not straightforward and the guidance from the research literature on the setting of monetary policy under uncertainty is highly nuanced, with no universal results. In particular, it is highly&nbsp;<a class="link-inline" id="_Hlk210552520"></a>context-specific as to: (i) whether the risk assessment should call for a &ldquo;wait and see&rdquo; approach or, alternatively, trigger an immediate response due to insurance-type risk management considerations; and (ii) whether a rate move should be attenuated or amplified by risk considerations.</p>
<p>In the coming weeks and months, it makes sense to follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate monetary policy stance, with no-precommitment to a particular rate path. In particular, our interest rate decisions will be based on our assessment of the inflation outlook and the risks surrounding it, in light of the incoming economic and financial data, as well as the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. In addition to the evolution of the baseline inflation outlook, shifts in the risk distribution will also matter for our rate decisions: an increase in the likelihood or intensity of downside risk factors would strengthen the case that a slightly-lower policy rate might better protect the medium-term inflation target; alternatively, an increase in the likelihood or intensity of upside risk factors would indicate that maintaining the current policy rate would be appropriate in the near term.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251006~0adce2b3d4.en.html#footnote.6" id="fn6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>The downside risks highlighted in our September 2025 inflation risk assessment include: a stronger euro; the risk that higher tariffs could lead to lower demand for euro area exports and induce countries with overcapacity to further increase their exports to the euro area; the risk that trade tensions lead to greater volatility and risk aversion in financial markets, which would weigh on domestic demand and would thereby also lower inflation.</p>
<p>By contrast, inflation could turn out to be higher under some upside scenarios: a fragmentation of global supply chains could push up import prices and add to capacity constraints in the domestic economy; a boost in defence and infrastructure spending could also raise inflation over the medium term; extreme weather events, and the unfolding climate crisis more broadly, could drive up food prices by more than expected.</p>
<p>More broadly, we also assess the risks to economic growth, in view of the relation between economic slack and medium-term inflation pressures and, especially if inflation is close to target and subject to maintaining anchored inflation expectations, the consideration that the flexibility of our medium-term orientation also allows us in our monetary policy decisions to cater for other considerations relevant to the pursuit of price stability.</p>
<p>In September, we assessed that risks to economic growth have become more balanced, especially relative to the downside risks of more severe configurations of policy-induced trade and financial fragmentation that were much debated in the April-May period. While recent trade agreements have reduced uncertainty somewhat, the overall impact of the change in the global policy environment will only become clear over time. Moreover, a renewed worsening of trade relations could further dampen exports and drag down investment and consumption. A deterioration in financial market sentiment could lead to tighter financing conditions, greater risk aversion and weaker growth. Geopolitical tensions, such as Russia&rsquo;s unjustified war against Ukraine and the tragic conflict in the Middle East, remain a major source of uncertainty.</p>
<p>By contrast, higher than expected defence and infrastructure spending, together with productivity-enhancing reforms, would add to growth. An improvement in business confidence could stimulate private investment. Sentiment could also be lifted and activity spurred if geopolitical tensions diminished, or if the remaining trade disputes were resolved faster than expected.</p>
<p>In thinking about these risk factors, two important considerations are the impact on energy prices and the impact on the euro. In relation to the former, the&nbsp;<a class="link-inline" id="_Hlk210552605"></a>above analysis of recent energy inflation serves to underline the high amplitude of energy prices and the possible spillovers from energy inflation to food inflation, goods inflation and services inflation. At the same time, it is clear that the sensitivity of overall inflation to energy inflation is state dependent and will be lower under subdued demand conditions than if demand were buoyant. In the current context, a further open question is the extent to which the substantial increase in the relative price of energy during 2021-2022 will bear down on energy inflation in the coming years due to the &ldquo;error correction&rdquo; mechanism by which deviations from the long-term trend relative price are reversed over time.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251006~0adce2b3d4.en.html#footnote.7" id="fn7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>Similarly, in relation to the exchange rate, a persistent movement in the euro on average has a multi-year impact on economic activity and inflation. However, these effects will be larger than the average if euro appreciation is more due to external factors (such as weakness in main trading partners or portfolio rebalancing due to an increase in the risk premium in overseas financial markets) and smaller than the average if more due to domestic factors (such as a surge in domestic demand or a decline in the domestic risk premium). In particular, the pricing power of domestic firms will be lower in the former case (such that euro appreciation induces firms to cut prices in an attempt to protect market share) than in the latter case (such that euro appreciation might be taken as an opportunity to boost profits).</p>
<p>In addition to the inflation outlook and the risk assessment, monetary policy decisions also turn on the strength of the transmission mechanism and, more broadly, overall financial conditions. In this context, ongoing assessments of the strength of monetary transmission remains of central importance, especially in view of shifts in the structure of the financial system and the complex relation between aggregate credit dynamics and aggregate demand conditions.<sup></sup><span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251006~0adce2b3d4.en.html#footnote.8" id="fn8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>The incoming data flow will help us assess the relative likelihoods, timing and impact of these alternative risks, in addition to providing guidance on possible future revisions to the staff baseline projections. In addition to the financial and macroeconomic data, we will also learn from the latest editions of an array of internal and external surveys. In relation to our internal surveys, these include: the Corporate Telephone Survey (CTS); the Bank Lending Survey (BLS); the Survey on Access to Finance (SAFE); the Consumer Expectations Survey (CES); the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF); and the Survey of Monetary Analysts (SMA).</p>
<p>Procedurally, our approach to monetary policy must remain open-minded if we are to properly incorporate the evolving information on the inflation outlook and the surrounding risks. In particular, as stated by President Lagarde at the Bank of Finland conference last week: &ldquo;<span>For our part, we cannot pre-commit to any future rate path, whether one of action or inaction. We must remain agile, and ready to respond to the data as they come in</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Listing the Schroder ETFs ICAV Global Equity Active UCITS ETF USD ACC on SIX Swiss Exchange enables Schroders to leverage the distribution network of the Swiss stock exchange to access the Swiss market with its unique combination of domestic and international, institutional and private investors. As one of the first in Europe to launch an ETF segment in the year 2000 and having admitted the first active ETFs in 2011, SIX has an extensive track record of fostering ETF growth through innovation and its commitment to diversity and quality in its ETF marketplace.</p>
<p>By entering the Swiss market, Schroders is expanding its active ETF capability in Europe, demonstrating its ability to develop and offer clients actively managed and relevant products which meet their evolving needs. Their launch builds on Schroders&rsquo; existing ETF capabilities in the US and Australia, providing wider global access to its market-leading active management expertise. Schroders launched its first active ETFs in Australia in 2016, before launching its first active ETF with its US partner Hartford Funds in 2018.</p>
<p>Johanna Kyrklund, Group Chief Investment Officer, Schroders, said: &ldquo;Schroders is bringing more than 220 years of active investment expertise into European active ETFs for the first time. In today&rsquo;s dynamic market environment, access to market-leading active management expertise is crucial. This launch will ensure our clients can benefit from the potential returns delivered by our active investing edge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meagen Burnett, Chief Financial Officer, Schroders, said: &ldquo;This key milestone demonstrates our ability to harness the scale of Schroders&rsquo; investment and operating platforms to enhance the distribution access points for existing and new clients. Our European active ETF launches will enable us to reach more investors and further reinforce our commitment to moving at pace and offering the variety of investment tools and differentiated returns our clients increasingly expect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David Smith, Head ETF Sales, Exchanges, SIX commented: &ldquo;A very warm welcome to Schroders and their first ETF on our exchange. We're keen to support their growth ambitions in Europe and are looking forward to further listings which will broaden the investment opportunities of investors trading on SIX Swiss Exchange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this launch, SIX now hosts 34 ETF issuers offering a total of 2,098 ETFs &ndash; making it one of Europe&rsquo;s most dynamic and diverse ETF marketplaces. So far this year, 246 new ETFs have been listed at SIX Swiss Exchange of which 1/3 are actively managed products. ETF trading turnover has reached CHF 94.4 billion year-to-date (per 30 September 2025), marking an 65.8% increase over the first nine months of the previous year.&nbsp;</p>

<title>Thai Fiscal Policy Office, Thai Securities And Exchange Commission , SET And Federation Of Thai Capital Market Organizations Launch Initiative To Boost Thai Capital Market Attractiveness With Four Key Measures</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/thai-fiscal-policy-office-thai-securities-and-exchange-commission-set-and-fed-2025106/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><b>The Fiscal Policy Office (FPO), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET), and the Federation of Thai Capital Market Organizations (FETCO) have jointly announced the launch of the "Thai Capital Market Attractiveness Initiative," featuring four key measures: Quality Demand, Attractive Supply, Trusted Market and Supportive Ecosystem, to strengthen investor confidence, enhance competitiveness, and increase the attractiveness of the Thai capital market on the global stage.</b></p>
<p>The Taskforce for a Competitive and Attractive Market (Taskforce), which consists of representatives <br /> from the FPO, the SEC, the SET, and the FETCO, has recently convened a joint meeting to gather opinions, analyze issues, and seek approaches to enhance the capabilities of the Thai capital market so that it remains competitive and resilient in the face of challenges, while continuing to play an important role in supporting the Thai economy. The Taskforce reached a consensus and proposed the &ldquo;Thai Capital Market Attractiveness Initiatives,&rdquo; highlighting four main measures along with key urgent action plans for each measure, as follows:</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Quality Demand</span></b>: (1) Cultivate long-term investment culture through individual investment accounts to enable investors to convert their savings into long-term investments and diversify their portfolios across various assets, and expand new investor base, enhance investment services in the stock market and securities company products, as well as create a wealth aggregator for investors&rsquo; portfolios, and (2) Enhance domestic institutional investors&rsquo; role to increase Thai equity allocation;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Attractive Supply</span></b> (1) Attract quality listing to drive new growth into the Thai capital market, (2) Scale up listed firms&rsquo; quality to enhance value through the Jump+ and Value Up Program, (3) Streamline IPO and foreign listing process to boost fundraising and competitiveness in the regional markets, (4) Facilitate funding and strengthen the potential of SMEs and the new economy, and (5) Drive ESG performance disclosure in accordance with ISSB standard, focusing on actual implementation to attract investors who prioritize ESG responsibility at the international level;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Trusted Market:</span></b> (1) Strengthen corporate governance of listed firms and law enforcement, (2) Elevate standards for the supervision of gatekeepers to prevent inappropriate conduct, and (3) Leverage technology to broaden access to financial information of small-and medium-sized listed firms;<b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Supportive Ecosystem</span></b>: (1) Enhance capacities of domestic capital market participants in creating diverse investment products, (2) Utilize technology to increase retail investors&rsquo; access to investment and a transition of a digital capital market, (3) Review market microstructure to align with trading behaviors and ensure fairness across investor types, and (4) Facilitate foreign investors&rsquo; more convenient use of e-proxy voting rights.<b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></b></p>
<p><b>Warothai Kosolpisitkul, Ph.D. International Economic Advisor, FPO, said:</b> &ldquo;This set of measures to enhance the attractiveness of Thailand&rsquo;s capital market not only aims at strengthening the market&rsquo;s capabilities, but also at laying a solid foundation for the country&rsquo;s long-term economic growth. By attracting high-potential businesses to raise funds, the market creates greater opportunities to drive growth across various sectors and broaden the investor base. This will make the Thai capital market a more efficient fundraising platform for national development. These measures are also in line with the 4<sup>th</sup> Capital Market Development Plan (2022&ndash;2027), which capital market agencies have been consistently implementing. At the same time, the measures serve as &lsquo;Quick Win&rsquo; initiatives that will generate tangible short-term results while catalyzing long-term economic restructuring. As the agency responsible for national economic policy and overall capital market development, the FPO stands ready to cooperate with and support all sectors in advancing and sustaining these measures to deliver concrete benefits for the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Pornanong Budsaratragoon, Ph.D., SEC Secretary-General, said: </b>"The SEC has initiated the establishment of the Taskforce, which is a collaboration between government agencies and private sector organizations, to jointly drive concrete measures for developing the Thai capital market, promote sustainable long-term competitiveness aligned with the changing economic conditions and global context, and enhance confidence in the Thai capital market. We believe that driving systematic change requires collaborative efforts from all sectors in the capital market. The Thai Capital Market Attractiveness Initiative proposed by the Taskforce covers both the demand and supply sides, and working groups will be established to monitor and continuously advance the measures to accelerate tangible short-term results. Concurrently, in the next phase, the SEC will proceed with developing other areas of the capital market, including the bond market, investment units, as well as the transition toward a digital capital market, with additional taskforces to be established. The SEC stands ready to serve as a key mechanism in creating concrete cooperation among various agencies."<b></b></p>
<p><b>Mr. Asadej Kongsiri, SET President, </b>said: &ldquo;This Taskforce collaboration marks a significant turning point in elevating the potential, competitiveness, and attractiveness of Thailand&rsquo;s capital market. The SET is fully committed to driving forward the Capital Market Attractiveness Initiative to enhance market appeal &mdash;from attracting high-potential New Economy businesses to list on the exchange, and upgrading the quality of listed companies through the Jump+ program, to leveraging technology to improve investor access to information, diversifying investment products to serve all investor segments, and developing essential infrastructure. SET is determined to position Thailand&rsquo;s capital market as a vital engine for robust economic growth, equipped to weather global economic volatility and regional competition. We will focus on enhancing market quality, building credibility, and elevating governance standards to ensure that Thailand&rsquo;s capital market serves as an efficient fundraising platform.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kobsak Pootrakool, FETCO Chairman, </b>said: &ldquo;Driving the Thai Capital Market Attractiveness Initiative is an important collaboration among all sectors within the capital market. This collective effort will strengthen Thailand&rsquo;s stock market competitiveness, enabling it to address emerging challenges while maintaining its pivotal role in supporting the Thai economy. In particular, the strategic focus on establishing tangible Quality Demand will serve as a key foundation for cultivating a long-term investment culture. This includes the development of individual investment accounts which will empower investors to transform their savings into sustainable long-term investments, preparing for the country&rsquo;s transition toward an aging society. Additionally, an investor data hub will provide comprehensive wealth management tools, functioning as a wealth aggregator for investors. Moreover, strengthening the role of domestic institutional investors will help drive stable and sustainable investments in the Thai capital market. These measures will ensure Thailand&rsquo;s stock market remains fundamental to the nation&rsquo;s sustainable economic growth.&rdquo;<br /> <br /></p>

<li><span>Euronext has received regulatory approval to launch a voluntary exchange offer to acquire all common registered ATHEX shares</span></li>
<li><span>Acceptance Period commences on 6 October 2025 and will end on 17 November 2025</span></li>
<li><span>A significant step towards a more integrated and more competitive capital market in Europe, establishing ATHEX as a financial hub in the Southeast Europe region</span></li>
<li><span>ATHEX to join Euronext&rsquo;s best-in-class trading and post-trade technology, boosting the visibility and attractiveness of the Greek market on an international scale</span></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify"><span>Euronext, the leading European capital market infrastructure, announces that all required regulatory approvals have been received for the commencement of the voluntary share exchange tender offer (&ldquo;</span><span>Tender Offer</span><span>&rdquo;) to acquire all common registered shares of HELLENIC EXCHANGES-ATHEX STOCK EXCHANGE S.A. (&ldquo;</span><span>ATHEX</span><span>&rdquo;) in consideration for ordinary shares newly issued by Euronext (&ldquo;</span><span>Consideration Shares</span><span>&rdquo;) at an exchange ratio of one (1) Consideration Share for twenty (20) ATHEX shares in accordance with Greek Law 3461/2006 (&ldquo;</span><span>Law</span><span>&rdquo;).</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>Strategic rationale for the Tender Offer</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>ATHEX&rsquo;s integration into Euronext&rsquo;s Group would allow Greek financial market participants to join a network of over 1,800 listed companies with a combined market capitalisation exceeding &euro;6 trillion. The interest of Euronext in ATHEX reflects Euronext&rsquo;s strong confidence in the positive development of the Greek economy and the growth potential resulting from further integration of Greek capital markets into the Eurozone and improved access to international investors. The combination would:</span></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><span>Embed ATHEX within Europe&rsquo;s largest liquidity pool:&nbsp;</span><span>Euronext aims to roll out its single liquidity pool, enabled by a single order book and empowered by its single trading platform &ldquo;Optiq&reg;&rdquo; to deepen the efficiency of the Greek financial market through access to the largest European pool of liquidity.</span> 
<ul type="disc">
<li><span>Strengthen access to financing for Greek corporates:&nbsp;</span><span>Greece will become a key hub for listings under a harmonised framework, offering greater scale, visibility, and access to European liquidity. Euronext will bolster financing of Greek SMEs through the pan-European pre-IPO educational programme &ldquo;IPOready&rdquo; and provide a platform for Greek companies to list debt, diversifying their financing sources.</span></li>
<li><span>Position ATHEX as the cornerstone of Euronext in Southeast Europe:&nbsp;</span><span>As part of the Euronext Group, ATHEX will be the cornerstone to lead Euronext&rsquo;s growth in the region, creating a hub for listing South-Eastern European companies in Athens.</span></li>
<li><span>Create a unified post-trade infrastructure</span><span>: Euronext relies on a single clearing house, clearing all of its European market flows across cash and derivatives products. As part of the combined Group, Euronext intends to expand Euronext Clearing, to cover Greek securities and to position Euronext Securities as the CSD of choice for Europe. With the acquisition of ATHEX, Euronext will expand its CSD platform and further consolidate the European post-trade market.</span></li>
<li><span>Unlock long-term value for shareholders</span><span>:</span><span>&nbsp;Euronext&rsquo;s offer provides a compelling opportunity for ATHEX shareholders to become investors in a leading pan-European business, benefitting from the integration of ATHEX within the Euronext ecosystem. Euronext's unique and proven track record in delivering significant benefits to every of the market infrastructures it has acquired over the past years is reflected in its impressive share price performance, which has increased by more than 600% since its IPO in 2014. Euronext shares furthermore provide additional liquidity benefits following the integration in the CAC 40&reg; index.</span><br /><br /></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p align="justify"><span>Unanimous support from ATHEX Board of Directors</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>The Board of Directors of ATHEX stated to ATHEX shareholders its unanimous support for the Tender Offer, and entered into a cooperation agreement with Euronext on 30 July 2025. All Directors of the Board owning shares, including the CEO of ATHEX, have signed undertakings to tender their shares, subject to the issuance of a reasoned opinion by the Board in favour of the Tender Offer as mandated by Greek law.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>St&eacute;phane Boujnah, CEO and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext, said:&nbsp;</span><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Europe is entering a new strategic phase in building more integrated European capital markets that serve local economies within the framework of a Savings and Investments Union. Greece&rsquo;s robust economic growth, supported by rising investment, growing international confidence, and solid fundamentals, makes this the right moment to strengthen its market. Through the integration of ATHEX into Euronext&rsquo;s ecosystem, Greece will play a key role in this European project.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>This move will enhance the visibility and international appeal of the Greek market, supporting the shared European goal of stronger, integrated and more efficient capital markets. The initiative has received strong and positive feedback from leading stakeholders who recognise the value of combining best-in-class infrastructures, technologies, and practices across Europe to convey investments to the real economy.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>Details of the Tender Offer</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>Commencing on&nbsp;</span><span>6 October 2025, at 08:00 (EEST) and ending on 17 November 2025, at 14:00 (EEST)</span><span>&nbsp;(&ldquo;</span><span>Acceptance Period</span><span>&rdquo;), holders of ATHEX Shares may accept the Tender Offer by submitting a relevant written declaration of acceptance to the participant or their intermediary that is a certified member of the Greek Dematerialised Securities System (the &ldquo;</span><span>DSS Participant</span><span>&rdquo; and the &ldquo;</span><span>DSS</span><span>&rdquo;, respectively) with which their ATHEX Shares are registered.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>The closing of the Tender Offer is subject to the prerequisite that, as at the end of the Acceptance Period, at least a minimum number of shares must have been lawfully and validly tendered to Euronext, namely 38,759,500 ATHEX Shares, corresponding to 67.0% of ATHEX&rsquo;s total voting rights whose exercise is not subject to suspension (the &ldquo;</span><span>Minimum Number of Shares</span><span>&rdquo;). This condition may be amended in accordance with the provisions of the Law.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>The completion of the Tender Offer is also subject to the customary regulatory approvals linked to the change of control of ATHEX and its subsidiaries.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>If, at the end of the Acceptance Period and subject to the fulfilment of the conditions, the relevant threshold is reached and, consequently, at closing, Euronext holds at least 52,065,000 ATHEX Shares representing at least 90.0% of ATHEX&rsquo;s voting rights, Euronext will exercise its squeeze-out right by filing an application to the Hellenic Capital Market Commission (&ldquo;</span><span>HCMC</span><span>&rdquo;) in accordance with the Law. Those shareholders who have not accepted the Tender Offer will, in such scenario, have the right to exercise their sell-out rights in accordance with the Law.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>The Consideration Shares carry the right to dividends, capital returns, distributions from distributable reserves or other distributions that may be made by Euronext after the date on which settlement of the Tender Offer is completed. Detailed information in relation to, among other matters, Consideration Shares and the rights of the holders of Consideration Shares is included in the Information Circular (</span><span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://connect-eu.notified.com/Tracker?data=nIykxSMjCgfoGAQGjmsp1NsPh7zi8aq_VUTiV04ewZNx-QPxjX5m7of3ZzYlZ_SpDchleCr1gGhzwDWREG9J4nalBR-zoQ4AvxKVJu2Ur3rpEIwt9i8XJZ4Jb60KVH7YSdd-16x2P10ILYddwLt5xA==000343557921" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">www.euronext.com/en/athex-offer</a></span><span>).</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>Financial impact and integration plan</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>Euronext expects to deliver significant synergies from the integration of ATHEX into its European market infrastructure. Annual run-rate cash synergies of &euro;12 million are targeted by the end of 2028, notably through (i) the migration of Greek trading to Optiq, and (ii) the harmonisation of central functions. Implementation costs to deliver those synergies are expected to amount to &euro;25 million. The transaction is expected to be accretive for Euronext shareholders after the delivery of synergies in year 1.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>The transaction is in line with Euronext&rsquo;s investment criteria of ROCE above WACC in years 3 to 5 after the acquisition. The proposed Tender Offer enables Euronext to preserve spare debt capacity to finance further diversification deals and to enhance the free float liquidity of the stock.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>In line with Euronext&rsquo;s federal model, the CEO of ATHEX would be proposed to join the Managing Board of Euronext N.V., and an independent representative from the Greek financial ecosystem would be proposed for the Supervisory Board of Euronext at the 2026 annual general meeting, replacing one of the current independent members of the Supervisory Board. The HCMC would remain the primary supervisory authority for Greek markets and would be invited to join Euronext&rsquo;s College of Regulators, becoming part of the supervision of the Euronext Group.</span></p>

<title>New Zealand Financial Markets Authority: IAG To Make Pecuniary Penalty Payment Of $19.5 Million For Widespread Failures</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Insurance company IAG New Zealand Limited has admitted to fair dealing breaches and the Court has imposed a final pecuniary penalty of $19,500,000.</p>
<p>Following an investigation by the Financial Markets Authority (FMA) &ndash; Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko - IAG has admitted making false and/or misleading representations in relation to its insurance products. &nbsp;</p>
<p>FMA Executive Director, Response and Enforcement Louise Unger said: &ldquo;The nature and scale of IAG&rsquo;s contraventions was greater than those present in any other fair dealing case the FMA has to date taken to Court, and the judgment confirms they warrant a significant penalty. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;IAG is New Zealand&rsquo;s largest insurer. It is a large and sophisticated market leader and accordingly plays a vital role in upholding market standards, yet its significant underinvestment led to widespread failures of its systems and processes, to the detriment of its customers. &nbsp;It also failed to respond to and report many of the issues in an appropriate timeframe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Justice Andrew found that &ldquo;nature and extent of IAG&rsquo;s contraventions to be the most aggravating feature of its conduct&rdquo; and that the &ldquo;penalty must be set at a level that sends a clear message to the financial market &ndash; and particularly similarly large and well-resourced institutions &ndash; as to the importance of investing in robust systems and making good on the promises to customers&rdquo;. &nbsp;His Honour also observed that &ldquo;IAG&rsquo;s knowledge of the breaches and the delay in reporting them to the FMA, particularly following the culture and conduct review, is an aggravating factor&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The penalty reflects discounts for IAG&rsquo;s self-reporting, its early offer of admissions, its exemplary cooperation with the FMA&rsquo;s investigation, and the steps taken to remediate its customers.</p>
<p>IAG breached the Financial Markets Conduct Act (FMCA) by failing to correctly price the premiums charged to customers, and by failing to correctly apply important discounts to its insurance products sold via its business divisions and distribution partners.</p>
<p>Between September 2021 and December 2024, IAG self-reported 41 issues to the FMA. of which ten of the most significant (and earlier reported) issues were pleaded as eight causes of action against IAG.</p>
<p>The breaches to which IAG has admitted affected approximately 269,000 customers and resulted in overcharges of approximately $35,000,000. The remaining 31 issues, which involve an estimated total remediation of $21 million, did not form part of the pleaded claim, however, they are recorded in a schedule to it and provide crucial context to IAG&rsquo;s conduct. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The penalty has been set at a level that sends a clear message to the financial market &ndash; and particularly similarly large and well-resourced institutions &ndash; as to the importance of investing in robust systems and making good on the promises made to customers,&rdquo; said Louise Unger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will continue to respond to misleading practices to ensure New Zealand has a fair financial system.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<title>New Zealand Financial Markets Authority: Pump And Dump Scam Nets Kiwi Investors</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/financial-markets-authority-pump-and-dump-scam-nets-kiwi-investors-2025106/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/financial-markets-authority-pump-and-dump-scam-nets-kiwi-investors-2025106/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Kiwi investors are being caught by a new &ldquo;pump and dump&rdquo; scam, says the Financial Markets Authority (FMA) &ndash; Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko. &nbsp;</p>
<p>FMA Director of Markets, Investors and Reporting, John Horner says: &ldquo;As we start World Investor Week, aimed at educating and protecting investors, it is timely to remind Kiwi investors about this latest version of the deepfake impersonation scam. We have issued a new warning.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This current scam uses social media scam advertisements featuring an impersonated business leader, encouraging investors to join a fake investor chat group. The FMA first raised its concerns about the impersonations in a public warning issued 19 August 2025, and has received further information showing the scam is part of a global network of scams aimed at market manipulation.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A pump and dump occurs when a person buys shares in a company and starts an organised campaign to increase (or 'pump') the share price. They then sell (or 'dump') their shares and make a profit, while the other shareholders suffer financial losses as the share price falls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Often those running a 'pump and dump' use social media and online forums to create a sense of excitement about buying a company&rsquo;s shares by spreading false information about the company's prospects. This excitement and interest artificially drives the share price up as they lure investors. &nbsp;This is considered a form of market manipulation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The pump and dump scam uses Facebook and Instagram ads impersonating a variety of well known Kiwi business leaders to target Kiwi investors, inviting them to join a chat group on a messaging platform such as WhatsApp. There, they are encouraged to use reputable trading platforms to buy low-value shares in companies listed on overseas exchanges, to artificially inflate the share price. The scammers sell their own shares at the inflated price and, when the price later drops, the victims are left bearing the loss. &nbsp;</p>
<p>After a victim suffers a loss, the scammers often claim, falsely, that the victim is entitled to compensation or reimbursement. The scammers then collect personal information and further payments from the victims. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have received a number of complaints, with multiple victims having lost significant amounts,&rdquo; said John Horner.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These complaints are likely only the tip of the iceberg. Because these impersonation pump and dump scams play out over days and weeks, it&rsquo;s possible there are others happening in New Zealand right now, with the scammers potentially pivoting to another company&rsquo;s shares. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We encourage New Zealanders to take extra care when considering investment decisions and seeking out investment advice. If an organisation is offering investment tips through social media, be cautious. Report any suspicious activity to the social media channel, to the company involved and to the FMA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We urge extreme caution to investors impacted by this or other scams which may include &lsquo;opportunities&rsquo; to trade out of this position or support to recover funds lost, these are also likely to be scams.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the FMA&rsquo;s functions is to promote the confident and informed participation of businesses, investors, and consumers in the financial markets. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have therefore taken steps to urgently issue an updated public warning to raise awareness of how this scam impacts investors and educate the general public on how to avoid being scammed.</p>
<p><span class="button-link--green-dark"><a href="https://www.fma.govt.nz/library/warnings-and-alerts/suspected-pump-and-dump-schemes/" title="Link to Warnings and alerts page">Investment advice group chats used in suspected pump-and-dump schemes</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Our aim is to make New Zealand an unattractive place for scammers to operate, by raising awareness of scam methods and encouraging investors to stop and think carefully before making investment decisions that might be driven by a scam.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMA is also sharing case details with the relevant overseas financial regulators, given some of the pumped shares are listed on a US exchange (NASDAQ) and some of the pumped companies are based in China.  &ldquo;There are currently similar scams operating overseas, with a warning recently issued by the FBI</p>

<p>The FMA has also alerted New Zealand banks and businesses being impersonated to let them know the impersonation scam has pivoted and is using new tactics, and is encouraging them to share the FMA warning.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>How the scam works</h3>
<ul>
<li>Scammers promote investment club group chats through social media. Often, the scammers will publish ads impersonating business leaders or financial commentators to promote the group chats. In some cases, the scammers send unsolicited invitations to the group chats through messaging platforms like WhatsApp.&nbsp;</li>
<li>In the group chats, an &lsquo;investment mentor&rsquo; provides trade recommendations to group members. The group chats appear to have dozens of members, but they are populated primarily with bot accounts controlled by the scammers.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The scammers may initially recommend purchasing shares of a large, well-known company such as Nvidia or Tesla. This is a tactic to build trust before drawing potential victims into the pump-and-dump scheme.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Eventually, the scammers will recommend shares in a smaller company. Members are often encouraged to message the investment mentor or their assistant directly, who will guide them through the investing process.</li>
<li>Over several weeks or months, the victims&rsquo; investments artificially inflate (or &lsquo;pump&rsquo;) the company&rsquo;s share price. The scammers then sell (or &lsquo;dump&rsquo;) their holdings at the inflated price. When the share price collapses, victims are left bearing the loss.&nbsp;</li>
<li>After the share price drops and the victims suffer a loss, the scammers may tell investors they are entitled to compensation or reimbursement. The scammers may ask victims to complete an online form, provide copies of their ID, or pay an application fees in order to gain access to the funds. This is a recovery scam, and is an attempt to harvest victims&rsquo; personal information or extract further funds.&nbsp;</li>

<title>New Zealand Financial Markets Authority: Former Financial Adviser Sentenced For “Gross Breach Of Trust”</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-former-financial-adviser-sentenced-for-2025106/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-former-financial-adviser-sentenced-for-2025106/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Murray McClune, a former financial adviser, has been sentenced to three years and seven months&rsquo; imprisonment for two charges of theft by person in a special relationship. The charges followed an investigation by the Financial Markets Authority (FMA) &ndash; Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Judge also permanently banned Mr McClune from holding directorships, management positions, and providing financial advice and client money and property services under ss 517-518 of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 (<span>FMCA</span>), which Mr McClune did not oppose. No reparation order was made because the Judge considered to do so would be futile.</p>
<p>Mr McClune&rsquo;s sentence arises out of his theft of approximately $1.7m from elderly advice clients over the course of two years starting in 2016.</p>
<p>FMA Head of Enforcement Margot Gatland said Mr McClune had committed serious offences. &ldquo;His conduct was both deliberate and dishonest, and involved a gross breach of trust. The conduct arose in the course of his role as a financial adviser, a position he used to take advantage of his clients.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Banning Mr McClune ensures protection of the public and deters others from committing breaches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Between 2016 and 2018, while working as a registered financial adviser, Mr McClune offered investment opportunities to two couples who had known him for over 40 years, and were in their retirement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rather than invest the funds he had received, he spent them on various personal and business expenses, including purchasing a home in his and his wife&rsquo;s name. Funds were also spent on food and entertainment, travel and overseas expenses, wills and funeral planning and cash withdrawals. While much of the funds were eventually returned to the investors, in one case the investors had to pursue court action to secure the return of some of their funds, and both investors were left with some money owing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr McClune was a trusted financial adviser of over 40 years&rsquo; experience and his clients were entitled to trust their adviser, particularly considering his long-standing experience, his profession, and his registration on the Financial Service Provider Register,&rdquo; said Margot Gatland.</p>
<p>Mr McClune has a previous conviction for a charge of obtaining by deception. His victim in that case was well-known to him as a good family friend, and Mr McClune was a financial adviser to her and her late husband for over 40 years. Her husband died in 2007, and Mr McClune advised her that he could make an increased gain on her superannuation savings which would be ready for her when she turned 65 in 2015. Between 2009 and 2010, Mr McClune made withdrawals from his victim&rsquo;s investment funds. The total amount taken over an eight-month period was $203,500. Mr McClune used those funds for his and his wife&rsquo;s personal expenses, and to pay other business associates.</p>
<p>The current offending occurred before he was charged and convicted for the previous offending.&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Mr McClune was registered on the Financial Service Providers Register as an insurance broker from 26 March 2011 to 2 November 2016. He was registered as a financial adviser between 26 March 2011 and 26 April 2022. Mr McClune offered his services primarily through his business Insurance Plus Ltd.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Highlighting the company&rsquo;s strategic role in Iran&rsquo;s industrial and economic development, the CEO stated: &ldquo;Kaveh South Kish Steel Company is currently one of the largest producers of steel and sponge iron in the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He added, &ldquo;Fortunately, KSK successfully implemented its &ldquo;continuous production&rdquo; plan in the current year, achieving higher output levels and enhanced productivity across its steel production cycle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hatami emphasized that the company&rsquo;s integrated strategies and cohesive planning in production and sales have significantly enhanced Kaveh&rsquo;s standing in the Iran Mercantile Exchange (IME), so that KSK secured the top rank in IME this year according to the key indicators, including supply, demand, and trading value.</p>
<p>Established in 2007 in Hormozgan Province, KSK benefits from a strategic geographic location, easy access to southern ports, efficient North-South rail transit capabilities, reliable water resources, and proximity to valuable metallic mines - and ensures collectively strong economic viability.</p>
<p>The company listed at TSE in 2017 and currently holds a market capitalization around IRR 180 trillion.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Dean Madan. I appreciate the opportunity to speak here at Drexel University and to visit Philadelphia, an area where I have spent much of my personal and professional life.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20251003a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;I will not go on too much about the City of Brotherly Love other than to say I am considering jogging up the steps of the art museum before I catch my train home.</p>
<p>It is an honor to take part in the inaugural Drexel Economic Forum and to meet some of the students, researchers, and business leaders who are here. It is an important time for these groups to hold this event because there is much to discuss about the quickly evolving economy. For my part, as a Federal Reserve policymaker, I am committed to achieving the dual mandate given to us by Congress of promoting maximum employment and stable prices. Delivering on these goals matters to communities, families, and businesses across the country, including right here in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>To inform our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-20251003-slide2.jpg" id="fig2">discussion</a>&nbsp;today, I will share with you my economic outlook and offer my current view of monetary policy before sharing with you some highlights from the Federal Reserve's newly revised monetary policy framework. After my remarks I look forward to answering a few questions.</p>
<p><span>Economic Outlook</span><br />Looking broadly across the U.S. economy, I see that growth has moderated this year, and the risks to both sides of our dual mandate have shifted. Employment growth has slowed because of weaker growth in labor supply and a softening in labor demand. The uptick in the unemployment rate relative to the start of the year suggests that demand has fallen by a bit more than supply and that the downside risks to employment are rising. Meanwhile, higher tariffs are showing through to higher inflation for some goods. I expect that the effects of tariffs on inflation, employment, and economic activity will further show through in coming months.</p>
<p>In the first half of 2025, U.S.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-20251003-slide3.jpg" id="fig3">GDP</a>&nbsp;grew at a 1.6 percent annual rate, which reflects a marked cooling from last year's 2.4 percent growth rate. The slowdown in economic activity in the first half of this year was primarily driven by weaker consumer spending. That said, U.S. retail spending picked up over the summer. Overall, I expect the U.S. economy to maintain the first half's rate of growth through the remainder of the year.</p>
<p>In terms of the labor market, we did not receive the September jobs report this morning because of a lapse in federal government funding. While this is less than ideal, I never focus on a single report; rather, I look across an array of indicators to assess the labor market and the economy.</p>
<p>The available data from both government and private-sector sources point out that labor supply and demand are slowing together, as reflected in the ratio of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-20251003-slide4.jpg" id="fig4">job openings to unemployed</a>&nbsp;Americans seeking work. A few years ago, available jobs well exceeded the unemployment level. That came back into balance over the past year or so. Data released earlier this week showed the unemployment level slightly exceeded openings this summer, but what economists call the V/U ratio remains near 1. Similarly, last week the Labor Department reported that initial jobless claims continue to mostly trend sideways. Net immigration into the U.S., an important contributor to workforce growth, has dropped sharply, and that is a factor restraining a more significant increase in unemployment.</p>
<p>Turning to the other side of our dual mandate, it is notable that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-20251003-slide5.jpg" id="fig5">inflation</a>&nbsp;has slowed considerably from the highs that occurred when the economy reopened after pandemic disruptions. Inflation, however, remains somewhat above our 2 percent target, and the tariffs that have been announced and implemented so far are showing up in some goods prices. Overall, personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices rose 2.7 percent over the 12 months ending in August. Core PCE inflation&mdash;which removes volatile food and energy prices&mdash;was 2.9 percent in August.</p>
<p>Often, it is helpful to study the three major&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-20251003-slide6.jpg" id="fig6">components of core PCE inflation</a>&nbsp;to better understand what is driving overall price measures. Currently, core goods prices, which declined modestly last year, have been rising, reflecting tariff effects, although it is also notable that the increase so far has been smaller than what many forecasters predicted this spring. Meanwhile, core services inflation, outside of housing, has generally trended sideways this year, while housing inflation appears to be on a gradual downward trend.</p>
<p>I view the uncertainty around my baseline outlook as especially high, mainly due to the changes in government policies and the challenges around assessing their net effects on employment and inflation. As the changes in these policies are finalized and we have more time to judge how they are affecting the economy, I expect some of the broader uncertainty around the U.S. economy to diminish.</p>
<p><span>Monetary Policy</span><br />Considering the outlook I described, I see the risks to employment as tilted to the downside and risks to inflation to the upside. It follows that both sides of our mandate are under pressure.</p>
<p>While tariff-related inflation is apparent in the prices of goods, tariff increases typically represent a one-time change in the price level. The scope and persistence of the related rise in inflation will be determined by several factors&mdash;including the final tariff rates, the extent of pass-through to consumer prices, the effects on supply chains, overall economic conditions, and what happens to longer-run inflation expectations. Short-term inflation expectations have come down from the peaks reached in the second quarter, and most measures of longer-term inflation expectations have been largely stable, suggesting that the American people understand our commitment to returning inflation to our 2 percent target. As such, I expect the disinflation process to resume after this year and inflation to return to the 2 percent target in the coming years.</p>
<p>As I noted above, trends across several data series indicate that the labor market is softening, which suggests that, left unsupported, it could experience stress. To balance the risk of persistent above-target inflation and the risk of a deteriorating labor market, I supported a 25 basis point cut in our target range at the last FOMC meeting. This change moved our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-20251003-slide7.jpg" id="fig7">policy rate</a>&nbsp;closer to a more neutral stance while maintaining a balanced approach to promoting our dual-mandate objectives.</p>
<p>With respect to the path of the policy rate going forward, I will continue to evaluate the appropriate stance of monetary policy based on the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.  I will also consider and assess information about government policies and their effects on the economy.</p>
<p><span>The Fed's Revised Framework</span><br />Now that I have discussed my outlook and the latest policy decision, I want to turn to an important document that I use to guide those decisions: the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-20251003-slide8.jpg" id="fig8">Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy</a>. This statement is designed to give the public a clear sense of how we think about monetary policy. As Chair Powell discussed at his Jackson Hole speech, a revised version of that document was issued in August.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20251003a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a></p>
<p>The framework document, often called the consensus statement, was first issued in 2012, under Chair Ben Bernanke's leadership. The Fed's dual mandate, established by Congress, to foster maximum employment and stable prices underpins this framework. Our commitment to delivering on our dual mandate is unwavering. The revisions to our framework will support that mission across a broad range of economic conditions.</p>
<p>The FOMC revised its consensus statement after conducting a public review. That review consisted of three elements: first, Reserve Banks hosted&nbsp;<em>Fed Listens</em>&nbsp;events; second, the Board hosted a research conference; and third, we convened a series of policymaker discussions at FOMC meetings this year, supported by staff analysis. The changes implemented as a result of this review were a logical progression, not a change in course, grounded in our ever-evolving understanding of our economy. I will make note of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-20251003-slide9.jpg" id="fig9">four adjustments</a>&nbsp;to the consensus statement and discuss each in turn.</p>
<p>First, the revised consensus statement removed language emphasizing the effective lower bound (ELB) as a defining feature of the economic landscape. Instead, it states that our monetary policy strategy is designed to promote maximum employment and stable prices across a broad range of economic conditions. This revision, reflecting a move away from the post&ndash;financial crisis era of historically low interest rates, makes our framework more robust. It is useful to recall that at the time of the FOMC's previous framework review, during 2019 and 2020, policymakers were considering an economy that had for many years demonstrated low growth, low inflation, and a very flat Phillips curve&mdash;meaning that inflation was not very responsive to slack in the economy. The overarching concern for central bankers at that time was how to operate when short-term interest rates are near the ELB. Today, of course, we are operating in a very different environment, at least in part brought on by the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Second, the revised framework embraces a flexible inflation-targeting approach at all times and eliminates a "makeup" strategy that would be employed in certain circumstances. The experience of the U.S. economy since the pandemic highlights different challenges to achieving our inflation mandate&mdash;such as supply shocks, sectoral developments, and nonlinear inflation dynamics. The flexible inflation-targeting strategy outlined in our revised framework allows us to take a balanced approach in promoting our goals by considering the extent of departures from them. The revised framework appropriately emphasizes the Committee's commitment to ensuring that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.</p>
<p>Third, the revised consensus statement provides clarity on how the Committee thinks about its legislated goal of maximum employment. The 2020 version of the statement indicated that the Fed would mitigate "shortfalls" from maximum employment. This shortfalls strategy was partly motivated by our recognition that real-time assessments of the natural rate of unemployment&mdash;and hence of "maximum employment"&mdash;are highly uncertain. However, the use of the word "shortfalls" created some communications challenges, as it was not intended to be a commitment that the Committee would never follow preemptive policy actions or ignore tight labor market conditions. As a result, we have removed it from the consensus statement. Instead, the revised document more precisely states that "the Committee recognizes that employment may at times run above real-time assessments of maximum employment without necessarily creating risks to price stability."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20251003a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;As Chair Powell pointed out, preemptive action could well be warranted if tightness in the labor market or other factors pose risks to price stability. The revised statement defines maximum employment as "the highest level of employment that can be achieved on a sustained basis in a context of price stability."</p>
<p>Fourth, and closely aligned with the change I just discussed, the FOMC clarified the approach that it would take to monetary policy in times when the employment and inflation sides of our mandate may be at odds. The revised statement says that, in such periods, the Committee will follow "a balanced approach in promoting them, taking into account the extent of departures from its goals and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with its mandate." The revised language more closely aligns with the original 2012 statement. It is also consistent with the Committee's actions during the 2022&ndash;24 period, when the departure from our 2 percent inflation target was the overriding concern.</p>
<p>I have just highlighted a series of changes that we made to the framework statement, but it is also important to note the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-20251003-slide10.jpg" id="fig10">continuity</a>&nbsp;with past versions of our statement. The document continues to explain how we interpret the mandate Congress has given us and describes the policy framework that we believe will best promote maximum employment and price stability. We also continue to believe that monetary policy must be forward looking and consider the lags in its effects on the economy. We have never set a numerical goal for employment because the maximum level of employment is not directly measurable and changes over time for reasons unrelated to policy. Likewise, we maintained our commitment to a 2 percent inflation objective because that is a key factor helping keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored, thus supporting both sides of our dual mandate. And we remain committed to conducting a public review roughly every five years.</p>
<p><span>Conclusion</span><br />The FOMC remains fully committed to fulfilling its statutory mandate, and the revisions to the framework will support that mission across a broad range of economic conditions. Thank you for allowing me to share with you details of the revised monetary policy framework and my views on the current economic outlook. I hope both will serve as jumping-off points for your discussions over the rest of the afternoon. Once again, I am honored to take part in this inaugural event and look forward to our conversation.</p>

<p>Following the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dfs.ny.gov/reports_and_publications/press_releases/pr250929" id="menurra1" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" title="https://www.dfs.ny.gov/reports_and_publications/press_releases/pr250929">announcement</a>&nbsp;on Monday, September 29, that Superintendent Harris has decided to leave DFS, external stakeholders have reached out to congratulate the Superintendent and recognize the work of the Department in improving the lives of New Yorkers over the last four years.</p>
<p><span>Congressman Gregory Meeks:&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Superintendent Harris has led DFS with vision, integrity, and an unwavering commitment to protecting consumers while fostering innovation in the financial services sector. By championing Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) and expanding minority banking access, she has opened doors for small businesses, families, and communities that have long been underserved. I thank her for her service and lasting contributions to New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Congressman Ritchie Torres:&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Superintendent Harris has been a true partner in protecting consumers and strengthening New York&rsquo;s financial system. Under her leadership, DFS pushed for innovation, expanded access to financial services, and worked to make our markets fair. I&rsquo;m grateful for her service and proud of what we&rsquo;ve been able to accomplish together for New Yorkers. I wish her nothing but the best in what comes next.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>State Senator Liz Krueger,&nbsp;Chair of the New York State Senate Finance Committee</span>:&nbsp;&ldquo;It has been an honor working together with Superintendent Harris throughout her tenure at DFS. She has been a champion for the needs of New Yorkers, whether through safeguarding access to the full spectrum of reproductive care, standing up for older New Yorkers in the face of insurance company malfeasance, or, most recently, protecting New Yorkers' access to that COVID vaccine. I wish her the best of luck in her next role.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>State Senator James Sanders Jr., Chair of the New York State Senate Banks Committee:&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;I want to heartily congratulate New York State Department of Financial Services Superintendent Adrienne Harris for serving honorably and professionally during her tenure as the chief regulator of the State that is a global leader in banking. Superintendent Harris&rsquo; leadership has addressed many emerging issues including cryptocurrency, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, climate change, as well as the long-term issues of banking discrimination, a sound banking system, and many others. I wish Superintendent Harris well on her future endeavors. As Chair of the Senate Banks Committee, I look forward to working with the incoming Acting Superintendent Kaitlin Asrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>State Senator Zellnor Myrie,&nbsp;Chair of the New York State Senate Codes Committee</span>: &ldquo;As Superintendent, Adrienne Harris has fought to ensure financial services work for all New Yorkers. In a moment when consumers are especially vulnerable to fraud and manipulation,&nbsp;Superintendent Harris and DFS have worked to build an equitable, fair and transparent financial system. I'm grateful for her service to our state and look forward to continuing the work of keeping more money in New Yorkers' pockets.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>State Assembly Majority Leader Crystal Peoples-Stokes:</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;I want to thank Superintendent Harris for her steadfast commitment to the people of the State of New York during her tenure leading the Department of Financial Services. Superintendent Harris&rsquo; many notable accomplishments ensured New York remained the trusted financial capital of the world while always looking out for the consumers&rsquo; best interests. She will be missed, and I wish her all the best in her future endeavors.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>State&nbsp;Assemblymember David Weprin, Chair of the New York State Assembly Insurance Committee:</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;I want to thank Superintendent Adrienne Harris for her partnership and her dedication to protecting consumers and strengthening New York&rsquo;s insurance market.

<p><span>State Assemblymember John T. McDonald</span>&nbsp;<span>III, RPh,&nbsp;Chair of the New York State Assembly Governmental Operations Committee</span>: &ldquo;Superintendent Harris has been a true breath of fresh air during her four years as Superintendent of the Department of Financial Services (DFS).&nbsp; We immediately connected on the issue of governing Pharmaceutical Benefit Managers (PBMs) and we have had a strong start in regulating this area which is important to consumers, providers, and payors.&nbsp; That being said, I do not believe many people understand the full breadth and depth of the range of topics DFS covers and I have been with Adrienne in many different forums over the past four years and am amazed at the depth of her knowledge on even the most minor of issues.&nbsp; This is a reflection of her commitment to the people of New York and the close working relationship with the team and staff she has worked hard to develop over her time as Superintendent. Her presences and expertise will be missed, but I am comforted by the fact that she leaves DFS in a much better place than she found it.&nbsp; I wish her the best in her next chapter.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>State Assemblymember Clyde Vanel,&nbsp;Chair of the New York State Assembly Banks Committee:&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Protecting consumers and safeguarding the stability of our financial system are at the very heart of the Department of Financial Services&rsquo; mission, and under Superintendent Adrienne Harris&rsquo;s leadership, those priorities were elevated to new heights. From day one, she demonstrated a bold vision for what responsible and forward-looking regulation should look like in an age of rapid technological and economic change. During her tenure, she drove significant progress in areas such as cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence, advanced cybersecurity protections, and championed efforts to secure restitution for victims harmed by financial institutions.<span>&nbsp;</span>I am confident that the strong foundation she built will continue to benefit both consumers and the financial services industry for years to come. I wish her nothing but success as she takes the next steps in her remarkable career, and I have no doubt Acting Superintendent Kaitlin Asrow will make a fantastic successor.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Assemblymember Alex Bores</span>: "I am sad to see Superintendent Harris leave her role at DFS, where she has been invaluable to the protection of New York&rsquo;s consumers. Leading from the front, when a constituent of mine was affected by a specific DFS stance, Superintendent Harris gave the issue her personal attention to resolve the matter and changed DFS policy to properly accommodate. I look forward to working with the new superintendent, who will be tasked with filling the shoes of one of the most capable public servants I have had the pleasure of working with."</p>
<p><span>Elisabeth R. Benjamin, Vice President of Health Initiatives at the Community Service Society of New York, leader of the statewide #EndMedicalDebt campaign, and member of the DFS Consumer Protection Advisory Council</span>: &ldquo;Under Superintendent Adrienne Harris&rsquo; tremendous leadership, New York was able to achieve important strides for health care affordability. The Hochul Administration and Superintendent Harris led the way on abolishing co-payments for insulin and expunging medical debt from tens of thousands of credit reports.&nbsp; These policies help tens of thousands of New York healthcare consumers maintain their economic security in these turbulent times.&nbsp; We look forward to continuing to improve health insurance affordability under Acting Superintendent Kaitlin Asrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Mike Pierce, Executive Director of Protect Borrowers and member of the DFS Consumer Protection Advisory Council:</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Superintendent Harris fought for New Yorkers as they've struggled to shoulder rising costs and navigate a shifting and risky financial services market.

<p><span>Kathryn Wylde, President &amp; CEO, Partnership for New York City:</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Adrienne has transformed the Department of Financial Services from an obscure bureaucracy into a smart, responsive regulator.

<p><span>Brandon Milhorn, President &amp; CEO of the Conference of State Banking Supervisors:</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Superintendent Harris has been a strong advocate for state authority and expertise, particularly in digital assets. Her leadership on the CSBS Board and FSOC strengthened the state system and advanced a more dynamic and resilient financial system.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span>Karen Ignani, Chair of Emblem Health and&nbsp;member of the DFS&nbsp;Insurance Advisory Board: &ldquo;</span>Superintendent Harris&rsquo; efforts have ensured that New York has set the regulatory bar on critical national issues, such as cybersecurity and the use of artificial intelligence.&rdquo;</p>

<ul>
<li>Over the past 12 months, the final Basel III standards came into effect in more than 40% of the Basel Committee's 27 member jurisdictions.</li>
<li>The revised credit risk and operational risk standards as well as the output floor are now in effect in around 80% of member jurisdictions.</li>
<li>The Committee will continue to closely monitor and assess the full and consistent implementation of Basel III standards.</li>
</ul>
<p>Member jurisdictions of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision have made significant progress in implementing the Basel III reforms over the past year, according to the Committee's latest&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/implementation/rcap_reports.htm"><span class="firstword">progress</span>&nbsp;update</a>&nbsp;published today.</p>
<p>The update and monitoring dashboard set out the jurisdictional adoption status of the Basel III standards as of end-September 2025 and show where the standards are already implemented by banks. They cover the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d424.htm"><span class="firstword">final</span>&nbsp;elements of Basel III</a>&nbsp;published by the Committee in December 2017 and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d457.htm"><span class="firstword">finalised</span>&nbsp;minimum capital requirements for market risk</a>&nbsp;of January 2019. The implementation date for these reforms was 1 January 2023,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/press/p200327.htm"><span class="firstword">as</span>&nbsp;announced by the Governors and Heads of Supervision (GHOS) &ndash; the Basel Committee's oversight body &ndash; in March 2020</a>.</p>
<p>Since the previous annual update, the final Basel III standards came into effect in more than 40% of the 27 member jurisdictions. Consequently, the revised credit risk and operational risk standards, as well as the output floor are now in effect in around 80% of member jurisdictions, the CVA standard in nearly 70%, and the revised market risk standards in nearly 40%.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The monitoring dashboard provides the implementation history of Basel standards by member jurisdictions, including the publication and implementation dates of their domestic regulations.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor, has today published its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2025-10/ESMA22-50751485-1604_Annual_Work_Programme_2026.pdf">2026 Annual Work Programme</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify">Guided by its multi-annual strategy for 2023&ndash;2028 which sets out three strategic priorities and two thematic drivers, ESMA&rsquo;s 2026 work programme focuses on delivering on core policy and supervisory mandates while contributing to ambitious reforms for more integrated, accessible, and innovative EU capital markets.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>Verena Ross, Chair of ESMA, said:&nbsp;</span></p>
<h6 class="text-align-justify"><em>&ldquo;A core focus in 2026 is ESMA&rsquo;s ambitious, and at the same time pragmatic, approach to simplification and burden reduction. We are pursuing a holistic strategy to streamline rules, enhance risk-based supervision and ensure proportionate reporting requirements across the ESMA remit.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span>In that spirit, we will continue the work linked to three landmark consultations already launched in 2025, on integrated funds reporting, transactional reporting and the investor journey.&nbsp;</em></h6>
<h6 class="text-align-justify"><em>We also stand ready to play a central role in the legislative initiatives set out in the upcoming SIU Strategy, including the removal of barriers in trading and post-trading, facilitating cross-border provision of funds, and strengthening supervision across the EU single market.&rdquo;</em></h6>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>Natasha Cazenave, Executive Director of ESMA, said:&nbsp;</span></p>
<h6 class="text-align-justify"><em>&ldquo;ESMA&rsquo;s ongoing supervisory responsibilities will expand in 2026, through the authorisation and supervision of Consolidated Tape Providers (CTPs), external reviewers under the European Green Bond framework (EUGBR), ESG rating providers, and the extension of third-country benchmark supervision. ESMA and its fellow European Supervisory Authorities will also, for the first time, jointly exercise the oversight of critical third party providers under the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA).</em></h6>
<h6 class="text-align-justify"><em>These new responsibilities will complement our existing mandates and be subject to our risk based, data driven and outcome focused supervision. Through extensive outreach and preparatory work, ESMA supervisory teams are gearing up to take on these new responsibilities."&nbsp;</em></h6>
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span>Supporting the Saving and Investments Union (SIU)</span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify">In 2026, ESMA will continue to build on existing priorities, supporting the forthcoming strategic developments set out by the Commission&rsquo;s Saving and Investments Union (SIU) Strategy. This includes aligning supervisory practices across Member States, enhancing market data capabilities, and actively contributing to upcoming reforms designed to create a more integrated and globally competitive EU financial system.&nbsp;<span>ESMA also aims at seizing opportunities arising from digitalisation, for example by facilitating the simplification and use of clear language in disclosures.</span></p>
<p class="text-align-justify">ESMA&rsquo;s activities will remain closely aligned with the agenda of the European Commission and co-legislators, maintaining the agility needed to address evolving regulatory, economic, and technological landscapes. This responsiveness is crucial as volatility, uncertainty, and rapid change shape the global environment and impact EU financial markets. Given the significance of the forthcoming proposals under the Savings and Investments Union, ESMA stands ready to provide its technical expertise and support to the preparation and implementation of the new legislative files that will be launched.</p>
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span>Other regulatory and supervisory priorities for 2026</span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify">Beyond the priorities coming from the SIU strategy, ESMA will continue supporting implementation of key legislative files agreed under the previous legislature, notably the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR 3) and the European Single Access Point (ESAP).&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>Other ongoing legislative files which, depending on progress, may require ESMA&rsquo;s attention in 2026 are the Retail Investment Strategy (RIS), as well as the review of the PRIIPS, SFDR and Securitisation Regulation.&nbsp;ESMA will ensure that it integrates the principles of Simplification and Burden Reduction across all its activities and will follow up on the 2025 &lsquo;flagship&rsquo; projects seeking simplification and efficiencies in disclosure and reporting frameworks.</span></p>
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span>Driving data innovation and market integration</span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify">ESMA will focus on enhancing data capabilities and promoting innovation across the EU financial sector. Key projects for 2026 include the rollout of the ESMA Data Platform, centralisation studies, and the development of AI-powered supervisory tools. These initiatives will bring common benefits to both ESMA and the National Competent Authorities, improving market efficiency and transparency through the support that data provides for risk-based and data-driven supervision across Europe.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>In the digital finance sector ESMA will continue to focus on the effective implementation of MiCA, as it is key to ensuring investor protection and the orderly functioning of crypto-asset markets. ESMA&rsquo;s supervisory convergence efforts will remain focused notably on the authorisation and supervision of CASPs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>Finally, i</span>n line with the EU&rsquo;s ambition to accelerate the settlement cycle to T+1 by 11 October 2027, ESMA will also coordinate closely with market participants to ensure the smooth transition and preparedness of the financial sector for this event.</p>

</div>
</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At today&rsquo;s symposium, we are saying a fond farewell to an outstanding colleague and friend. Klaas, you can look back on a remarkable career in public service at the national, European and global levels.</p>
<p>You were at the helm of De Nederlandsche Bank for over 5,000 days.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.1" id="fn1">1</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;In that time, you were a gifted communicator, conveying complex themes to the Dutch public in clear but never simplistic terms.</p>
<p>As a member of the Governing Council, you participated in over 330 meetings, overseen by three different ECB Presidents. I won&rsquo;t put you on the spot by asking you who your favourite was. You can tell me later &ndash; no pressure.</p>
<p>Being one of the elders on the Governing Council, your voice carried a weight that helped to forge policy consensus at the most critical of moments &ndash; be it during the pandemic or during the sharpest inflation shock in a generation.</p>
<p>And with experience comes wisdom. As Chair of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), you used that wisdom to advance the global agenda on financial stability, shaping international standards and coordination.</p>
<p>Klaas, you are known for reminding colleagues who tend to talk at length to be more &ldquo;impactful&rdquo; in their interventions. Well, now the pressure is on me. I promise to be as &ldquo;impactful&rdquo; as I can.</p>
<p>So today, I would like to focus on the two themes that have defined your career: monetary policy and financial stability.&nbsp;<a class="link-inline" id="_Hlk209781803"></a>And in so doing, I will discuss the powerful role that regulation and supervision can play in reducing the potential trade-offs between them.</p>
<h2>The interaction between monetary policy and financial stability</h2>
<p><a class="link-inline" id="_Hlk210203869"></a>Financial stability and price stability are preconditions for each other.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.2" id="fn2">2</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;Yet history shows that in the pursuit of price stability, monetary policy can face two key trade-offs with implications for financial stability.</p>
<p>The first can occur when monetary policy rapidly tightens. Higher interest rates help to curb inflation, but they can put pressure on banks by eroding asset values and asset quality, even as rising net interest margins offer them some relief.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.3" id="fn3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>We saw this during the 1980s, when the Federal Reserve rapidly tightened monetary policy to bring down high inflation.</p>
<p>Combined with US deregulation in the late 1970s, which encouraged riskier lending and weaker oversight, this monetary tightening was one of the key factors in the emergence of the savings and loan crisis. That led to the failure of roughly 1,300 savings institutions owing to the maturity mismatch on their balance sheets.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.4" id="fn4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>The second trade-off for monetary policy can arise during or following an extended period of monetary accommodation.</p>
<p>When inflation is below target, low rates can help stimulate demand and push inflation back towards target. But in an environment where regulation is relatively weak and especially where rates remain low for an extended period, they can also encourage borrowing, risk-taking and the build-up of financial imbalances.</p>
<p>These dynamics highlight how monetary policy can affect financial stability not only through banks&rsquo; balance sheets but also via market valuations and investor risk appetite.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.5" id="fn5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>Crucially, financial vulnerabilities may keep building even&nbsp;<em>after</em>&nbsp;rates begin to rise. We saw this in the lead-up to the global financial crisis of 2008.</p>
<p>Low rates earlier in the decade fed the US credit and housing boom that later unravelled &ndash; years after the Federal Reserve had begun to gradually tighten. And in the euro area, the sharp rise in private debt in some countries was a key driver of imbalances that built up before the crisis.</p>
<p>The lesson for policymakers was clear. Insufficient regulation and supervision had allowed risks to build unchecked, leaving monetary policy as&nbsp;<em>de facto</em>&nbsp;the only tool available to confront the fallout.</p>
<p>This placed an undue burden on central banks, forcing them to shoulder responsibilities that could have been better managed through stronger safeguards in the first place. That insight powered the construction of a stronger regulatory and supervisory framework after 2008.</p>
<p>The post-2008 regulatory and supervisory framework was a turning point for the interaction between monetary policy and financial stability. It served as a powerful lever in mitigating the trade-offs between them and, accordingly, increased monetary policy&rsquo;s room for manoeuvre.</p>
<h2>Monetary policy in extraordinary times</h2>
<p>This was most visible during two extraordinary periods for monetary policy that followed in the wake of the global financial crisis.</p>
<p>The first period was when inflation was too low.</p>
<p>Central banks across advanced economies turned to a set of new &ndash; and, at the time, unconventional &ndash; tools to meet their price stability mandates, including large-scale asset purchase programmes and the introduction of negative interest rates.</p>
<p>These were significant measures to fight a significant challenge. And at the time, there were vocal concerns that these measures would fuel financial instability.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.6" id="fn6">6</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;Certainly, asset prices and housing valuations&nbsp;<em>did</em>&nbsp;rise notably during this period.</p>
<p>But crucially, given the stronger regulatory and supervisory regime, rising asset prices did&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;translate into excessive leverage<span>&nbsp;</span>in the banking system. In fact, banks in the euro area deleveraged in the decade after the global financial crisis. Similarly, private sector debt as a share of GDP also fell during that time.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.7" id="fn7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>And here in the Netherlands, we saw how macroprudential policy acted as the first line of defence against financial imbalances.</p>
<p>Under your leadership, Klaas, the DNB strengthened the macroprudential framework, introducing higher capital buffers and stricter risk weight requirements to guard against housing market risks. These measures kept in check vulnerabilities that might once have spilled over into broader financial instability.</p>
<p>After years of below-target inflation, the second period came unexpectedly &ndash; when euro area inflation surged to record highs after the pandemic and the energy shock sparked by Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>In the Netherlands, for example, inflation rose rapidly, peaking just above 17% in September 2022 &ndash; almost six times the rate recorded a year earlier.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.8" id="fn8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>Once again, we faced an extraordinary situation &ndash; and the ECB had to step up. Alongside the unwinding of its asset purchases, it raised rates ten times by a cumulative 450 basis points, the fastest tightening in its history.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.9" id="fn9">9</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>And once again, there were concerns about the financial stability implications of such a rapid tightening.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.10" id="fn10">10</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>Tighter financing conditions risked straining borrower debt service and triggering market repricing. That, in turn, could have exposed financial institutions to vulnerabilities from falling asset values, maturity mismatches and weaker asset quality.</p>
<p>While there were some notable bank failures during this period, the global financial system overall remained broadly resilient to rising rates.</p>
<p>In the euro area, for example, banks were supported by stronger capital and ample liquidity buffers. Strong supervision also helped. Even before the inflation shock hit in full, the Single Supervisory Mechanism had factored interest rate risks into its supervisory work programme.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.11" id="fn11">11</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>Moreover, in line with the outcome of its strategy review, the ECB&rsquo;s Governing Council was regularly assessing the links between monetary policy and financial stability as part of its policy deliberations.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.12" id="fn12">12</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>The experience across these two monetary policy eras confirmed the lessons of 2008. Stronger regulation and supervision were able to contain financial exuberance and limit vulnerabilities. They allowed monetary policy to focus on its job of delivering price stability.</p>
<p>In this regard, Klaas, you have a knack for good timing. When you left the Governing Council last July, inflation had fallen substantially from its historic peak and stood at our target of 2% that same month.</p>
<h2>A global financial system in transformation</h2>
<p>Does the progress we have made in strengthening the regulatory and supervisory framework mean that policymakers can now let their guard down? The answer, of course, is no.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s global financial system looks very different from the one that stood on the brink in 2008.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.13" id="fn13">13</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;Two key shifts<span>&nbsp;</span>stand out compared with then.</p>
<p>The first has been the massive structural transformation that has taken place, the most striking change of which has been the growing footprint of non-banks in financial intermediation.</p>
<p>In the euro area, non-banks &ndash; ranging from investment funds and insurance corporations to money market funds and securitisation vehicles &ndash; have grown from about 250% of GDP in 2008 to more than 350% today.</p>
<p>Non-banks are also highly interconnected with the banking sector.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.14" id="fn14">14</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;In the euro area, banks&rsquo; asset exposures to non-banks are sizeable, averaging around one-tenth of significant institutions&rsquo; total assets.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.15" id="fn15">15</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>At the same time, a second key shift is becoming increasingly evident &ndash; namely, signs of regulatory fatigue, which is creating an uneven playing field for financial institutions.</p>
<p>In particular, investment funds, despite their increasing systemic importance, operate under far lighter rules compared with the banking sector. That has in part helped to fuel their growth.</p>
<p>One of the reasons behind this regulatory fatigue is that the post-2008 global regulatory framework has arguably been a victim of its own success.</p>
<p>In policymaking, 17 years is a long time. Not only do painful memories fade, but so too does the recognition that the financial stability the world now enjoys is thanks to the robustness of that global regulatory framework established back then.</p>
<p>This fading sense of urgency, together with concerns that banks&rsquo; competitiveness vis-&agrave;-vis non-banks is threatened by the uneven playing field, has ignited calls to revisit the existing set of financial rules and regulations.</p>
<h2>The importance of levelling up regulation and supervision</h2>
<p>So how should policymakers react to these shifts in the financial system?</p>
<p>In short, it is vital that policymakers adapt regulation and supervision to this challenging environment. They should do so not by&nbsp;<em>lowering</em>&nbsp;standards for banks, but by&nbsp;<em>levelling them up</em>&nbsp;for non-banks that are involved in bank-like activities, or with significant links to the banking sector.</p>
<p>That helps to address banks&rsquo; concerns about the uneven playing field. And better supervision of non-banks would make potential financial stability risks that have lain dormant in darker corners of the economy more visible, allowing policymakers to pre-empt them.</p>
<p>Klaas, as FSB Chair, you have been a powerful voice in warning against the dangers of regulatory rollback.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.16" id="fn16">16</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;And under your leadership, the FSB advanced ambitious policy recommendations on strengthening rules for non-banks.</p>
<p>They covered money market fund resilience<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.17" id="fn17">17</a>]</sup></span>, liquidity mismatches in open-ended funds<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.18" id="fn18">18</a>]</sup></span>, margin preparedness<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.19" id="fn19">19</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;and, most recently, leverage in non-banks.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.20" id="fn20">20</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;This is not to mention the FSB&rsquo;s important work on other areas of financial stability risk.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.21" id="fn21">21</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>As a central banker, I cannot pretend to be an unbiased observer in these discussions. Because if the regulatory and supervisory spotlight were to be broadened to non-banks, monetary policy would benefit too.</p>
<p>If risks were to build outside the banking system, beyond the current reach of regulators and supervisors, the trade-offs that were evident before 2008 may re-emerge, with monetary policy&nbsp;<em>de facto</em>&nbsp;being the only tool to &ldquo;get in all of the cracks&rdquo; and rein in financial exuberance.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.22" id="fn22">22</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>That would be a suboptimal outcome, one that potentially constrains central banks&rsquo; full freedom to defend price stability.</p>
<p>So as referees on the playing field, it is vital that policymakers resist regulatory fatigue and redouble their efforts to extend stronger global rules to non-banks involved in bank-like activities, or with significant links to the banking sector.</p>
<p>At the same time, after a decade of adding regulation, this is a good moment to take stock and assess how regulation can be simplified to avoid duplication and unnecessary burdens on financial institutions.</p>
<p>In this respect, the ECB High-Level Task Force on Simplification is developing proposals for simplifying the European prudential regulatory, supervisory and reporting framework for the European Commission&rsquo;s consideration.</p>
<p>The goal is not to relax rules, nor undo what has been achieved. Instead, the task force is exploring how to reduce undue complexity in selected aspects of the capital structure, reporting and supervision, while also maintaining the resilience of banks and fostering greater integration and harmonisation in EU frameworks.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Let me conclude.</p>
<p>I have spoken this evening about one Dutch elder &ndash; you, Klaas. Hopefully I have done so in a relatively impactful manner. But I would like to finish by citing another Dutch elder.</p>
<p>In his&nbsp;<em>Adagia</em>, the humanist Erasmus gathered the wisdom of past centuries for the benefit of those living in the present. Among the proverbs that still resonate today is, &ldquo;Prevention is better than cure&rdquo;.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.23" id="fn23">23</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>In the Netherlands in particular &ndash; often said to have witnessed the world&rsquo;s first financial bubble, though historians debate its true scale<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.24" id="fn24">24</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;&ndash; that lesson endures: vigilance is wiser than complacency.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>This principle lies at the heart of sound regulation and supervision. As the financial system evolves, regulators and supervisors must retain visibility of potential risks, since preventing instability is always less costly than repairing the damage afterwards. It also helps to limit the potential trade-offs between monetary policy and financial stability.</p>
<p>Policymakers should not wait for another financial crisis to be reminded of how high the stakes are. It is imperative to extend oversight to non-banks involved in bank-like activities, or with significant links to the banking sector &ndash; and policymakers must do so sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>Speech</h2>
<p>It is a great pleasure to be here today to celebrate Klaas&rsquo;s time as President of De Nederlandsche Bank and Chair of the Financial Stability Board. But more than that, to recognise Klaas as a very good friend and colleague.</p>
<p>Klaas&rsquo;s time as Governor covered most of the period since the financial crisis. But his career goes further back, both at the DNB and the Ministry of Finance here in the Netherlands. He has seen it all, and has been at the heart of rebuilding financial stability. It is I think therefore appropriate to concentrate on the theme of financial stability.</p>
<p>I am going to focus on a number of key questions. What has been achieved in the time since the crisis? What appears to be the challenge today to these achievements? And where do we go from here? There have been times in recent years when we might have treated these questions as matters of more academic speculation, that&rsquo;s not so today. They are real questions up for debate and challenge. I know that Klaas will want to be part of answering them. And Klaas, you need no encouragement from us, please do get stuck in, with your trademark elegance and force, the hallmark of Dutch football that you are such a keen supporter of.</p>
<p>What has been achieved in the field of financial stability since the financial crisis? Answer &ndash; a lot. Yes, today&rsquo;s world is a highly uncertain and unpredictable place sadly. We have experienced very large shocks &ndash; a pandemic, the longest war in Europe since 1945, I could go on.</p>
<p>But we have come through, so far at least, without a crisis of financial stability of the sort that has been seen in the past. Likewise, we have not had a major and lasting recession during these recent shocks.</p>
<p>But, this all reminds us that bad things happen in the world, and they can affect financial stability, this is always possible. That said, we start with a financial system that is much more resilient, which is a much better place to be. We have a banking system that after a long-haul post-crisis appears to be sustainably earning its cost of capital in terms of returns. This is reflected in market pricing, with market price-to-book value more consistently above unity.</p>
<p>Another lens through which to look at this point is to examine arrears and loan losses across the recent period of economic shocks. The evidence points to resilience here &ndash; such losses have been low by historical standards. Of course, this benefits banks and their shareholders, but it also helps consumers as customers and economies generally. Customers get better outcomes and particularly when they avoid having their business closed, losing their job, or having their home repossessed. The benefits of financial stability are real and tangible. Yes, but they may not be perceived as such. One of the challenges of financial stability is that it is a state of being in which success comes when things don&rsquo;t happen, and don&rsquo;t go wrong. It is therefore susceptible to the problem of &ldquo;out of sight, out of mind&rdquo;, in other words under-appreciated.</p>
<p>But, I am conscious that this story alone leaves open the charge that we have achieved the so-called stability of the graveyard. Nothing moves, there are no big dramas, because the system is moribund. Not true, is my response. The financial system has evolved and continues to do so. The record of the last 15 years indicates that the financial system has played its part in supporting economies through a series of severe shocks, and has acted to absorb rather than amplify these shocks. I would emphasise here that financial stability is not an end in itself. Rather, the goal is to support economic activity, a point I will come back to later.</p>
<p>When we look at the developments of the last 15 years or so we should also recognise how the financial system has changed, and it certainly has. I am not going to give an extensive review of the changes, but rather pick out a small number of key points and seek to explain their broader significance.</p>
<p>The first major change that we have seen is a rebalancing of the overall scale of global financial intermediation with an increase in the non-bank sector relative to banks. The non-bank sector is not, of course, homogenous, a point I will come back to. I think it is worth drawing out a number of closely related points that underline this shift in balance between banks and non-banks. The first is one that, I think, was clear during the financial crisis, and provides a backdrop to the changes that were to come. It is that the financial crisis was severely exacerbated by the concentration of assets and exposures on the balance sheets of banks which were too volatile and hard to value in a stress, and thus created too much uncertainty around the stability and ultimately solvency of banks.</p>
<p>One of the eternal questions that gets posed during such a stress is whether for banks it is a solvency or liquidity event. The presumption is that the latter is ok in the sense of manageable while preserving going concern, while the former is not. But the problem is that we only know the answer to this question ex-post. Illiquidity is a symptom which tends to point towards doubt around future solvency, but does not answer the question conclusively, either ex-ante or contemporaneously. The question is better put as whether there is sufficient uncertainty around future solvency to cause stress through illiquidity. The answer to this question in many, if not all, problem cases during the crisis was yes. From that answer, it is a logical step to conclude &ndash; as we did &ndash; that the tools of liquidity assistance available to central banks &ndash; let&rsquo;s call them the traditional Bagehot tools &ndash; should be reinforced and supplemented by tools of resolution, and this rightly became an important part of the post-crisis agenda for national authorities and the FSB, an agenda that Klaas has played a major part in leading.</p>
<p>We have made huge progress on the resolution agenda. Alongside that, we have also made huge progress on the Basel agenda for reforming the prudential regulation of banks. At this point, I must make the - obvious I hope but it has to be made anyway &ndash; comment that we must finish off implementation. Linking this back to the re-balancing of the bank and non-bank financial sectors, these developments help to explain why the re-balance has been a sensible and logical development. It has been a foundation reducing the probability of crisis in the banking system.</p>
<p>But, some of the argument for this was apparent at the time of the crisis, and some was less apparent. I think what has become more obvious over the last 15 years is why this change matters for financial stability, and what it tells us about the future. For me at least, this is where the concept of the singleness of money, and trust in money, comes in, and how it underpins the regulation of banks. Put simply, why were some assets problematic for banks in the crisis, and why did it matter?</p>
<p>The distinctive feature of banks is that their liabilities are typically substantially in the form of money deposits. In the regulatory world, it is deposit taking that is unique to banks. Most of the stock of money in our systems is commercial bank deposits.</p>
<p>These deposits underpin the functions of money &ndash; its role as store of value, unit of account and means of exchange or payment. The critical property of money is trust in its nominal value.</p>
<p>Put simply, a Pound or euro in my account has the same value as a Pound or euro in another account, and thus when we make payments we do not have to worry about variable nominal value. This is a key foundation of financial stability, and thus of public trust. In the crisis it was the uncertainty about the future solvency of banks that undermined this trust and thus ended financial stability itself. The underlying issue here was increasing doubts on whether the liabilities of banks did satisfy the properties of the singleness of money. So, a key objective of the post crisis reforms has been to rebuild confidence in the singleness of, and trust in, money.</p>
<p>However, if I stopped the account here, it would fall into the trap of adapting an old-fashioned view of banks that they are only deposit-takers, and not involved in activities which get loosely called investment banking. In what I regard as one of the best books on financial crises, Gary Gorton described the 2008 crisis in the US as a run on repo, prime broker balances, and asset-backed commercial paper.<sup><sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/october/andrew-bailey-keynote-speech-at-klaas-knott-farewell-symposium#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[1]</a></sup></sup></p>
<p>At first sight, this appears critically to muddy the distinction between banks and non-banks. Can we be confident we know where the boundary lies? The lessons here are that the critical feature of banks is the singleness of money and the public&rsquo;s trust in the assured nominal value of their money. Moreover, since banks are ultimately single entities, their reputation and that trust depends on confidence in their balance sheets as a whole (which is not, of course, to ignore that their capital structures must involve loss-bearing in both going and gone concern states). In other words, we must be very focused on the money system in our economies and its stability.</p>
<p>That said, our economies rely on financial risk taking, and that is essential to support investment and growth. To achieve this, it&rsquo;s crucial in large parts of the non-bank system that there is not assured nominal value for the liabilities so that risky investment proceeds. It is critical that we maintain this distinction between banks and non-banks, and it is well understood by the public.</p>
<p>I will, however, add two important qualifications.</p>
<p>First, banks must of course take risks &ndash; that should not need to be said, but just in case. The point is that the risks must be managed to preserve the assured value of money. Most non-banks do not need to do this. But, second, some non-banks do write liability contracts which contain promises of future value of one sort or another. Insurance is a very good example of this.</p>
<p>My key point here is that over the last fifteen years post crisis, the distinction between banks and non-banks and the importance of the money system has become better understood and defined. It is not new at all, but it has been important to define it under today&rsquo;s conditions. Failure to do so was a major flaw that led to the financial crisis.</p>
<p>There has to be a &ldquo;however&rdquo; though, and this brings in the second of the three big changes in financial intermediation that we have seen since the financial crisis. The &ldquo;however&rdquo; is that it would be a mistake to think that the greater scale of non-bank finance, and the distinction between money and non-money liabilities has led to a comprehensive separation of these two parts of finance. The two are as inter-connected as ever, but in ways that have changed. And, this is absolutely key to understanding financial stability today and the risks to it.</p>
<p>Let me use a prominent example. There has been a major change in the nature of trading in most major government debt markets, resulting in a much expanded non-bank presence and often much more leverage attached to newer trading strategies. But the banking system remains the ultimate source of liquidity for these activities. Banks&rsquo; activities in prime brokerage have expanded substantially and rapidly. The financing is typically secured and margined to protect against risk. Often, this relies on another of the major post-crisis developments, namely the expansion of central clearing.</p>
<p>These developments are consistent with the post-crisis direction of policymaking, to strengthen infrastructures like clearing houses, put them at the heart of the system, and thereby manage and reduce the risk of serious systemic stress which threatens financial stability. There is a good case that these developments have to date worked. However, rather like the overall growth of non-bank finance, we should not be surprised that a stronger infrastructure has led to the growth, for instance, of more leveraged trading activities. Our job as authorities is to understand these developments and assess and if necessary tackle any vulnerabilities that they may give rise to. That&rsquo;s all work that Klaas has led in the FSB, and we are continuing.</p>
<p>I would describe developments such as the growth of leveraged trading as putting the post-crisis financial system to work. We may or may not like all of them, and they give rise to new risks, but we shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised that the system responds and evolves.</p>
<p>Another example of post-crisis developments in non-bank finance is private assets &ndash; private equity and private credit. These may fall into a somewhat different behavioural category, namely there may be aspects of public markets which encourage going private. Our job is to assess the consequences for financial stability purposes. It is not to presume that such developments are per se bad, but rather to ask questions and assess them with rigour and be transparent with our conclusions. In the lead up to the crisis, there was a different culture, more of an absence and at times disapproval of such scrutiny, and the consequences were regrettable.</p>
<p>A third big change in financial intermediation post-crisis that I would highlight is the growth of crypto assets. I&rsquo;m not convinced that the cause of this was a response to post-crisis regulation. It seems to me to be more an outcome of technological advances. But it falls into the category of new areas that require thorough assessment of possible vulnerabilities and their financial stability implications. I don&rsquo;t regard crypto as a homogenous world, and the distinction between investments and money helps with understanding the distinction. Crypto of the Bitcoin variety falls into the risky investment category, whereas stablecoins used for retail and wholesale payments, rather than just to support crypto trading, fall into the money category, or should do. Understanding the implications of this distinction is important for designing the approach to regulation. But, I will go further than that and say it should enable better stablecoins to emerge than would do in a world in which the distinction was not understood and followed up.</p>
<p>This point takes me to the last important theme I want to cover today, and again one that is closely associated with the leadership that Klaas has undertaken.</p>
<p>Today, we face a growing challenge to the post-crisis system of financial regulation. It comes with a number of descriptions and reasons. One is an old point made by Hyman Minksy, that as time passes memories of a financial crisis fade and this leads to a questioning of the continuing need for the responses. This creates the risk of history showing signs of repeating itself, remembering back for instance to the strength of the deregulation argument before the financial crisis. Those of us, like Klaas, who are veterans of dealing with the financial crisis, don&rsquo;t tend to forget, but I can see evidence in today&rsquo;s world of the truth of Minsky&rsquo;s observation.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think the Minsky theory is the end of the story. Another argument made is what gets described as the need for regulatory simplification. I think a reasonable interpretation of this argument is that it is perhaps natural that the response to an event as big as the financial crisis becomes over-complicated, and the passage of time exposes the need to stand back and take a hard look at whether some parts of the response are too complicated, or excessive. There is truth in this, and we should take up the challenge and respond &ndash; and we are doing so. But, again I don&rsquo;t think this is the full story on the reasons for the growing challenge to financial regulation.</p>
<p>A third argument I detect concerns the distributional effects of the regulatory changes, and comes in a few forms. The first is that the response to the financial crisis has changed the financial system and has thereby gone too far to create winners and losers. A second form of this argument is that the post-crisis regulatory system is inflexible and does not allow innovation. These are important arguments about competitiveness that we need to assess carefully. Brushing them off will not do. Again, where there is truth in the argument, we should respond.</p>
<p>The fourth argument I can see in may ways is the most fundamental namely that the regulatory system is impeding growth in economies. This is a very important challenge, for the simple reason that the potential growth rate of many developed economies has slowed markedly since the financial crisis, and particularly the growth of productivity. And since productivity is a main determinant of the growth of living standards, the evidence of a very flat growth in GDP per capita underlines the importance of this point.</p>
<p>So, we have four challenges to the state of financial regulation, all of which amount in different ways to saying that we have overdone it post-crisis. In my remaining time, I probably can&rsquo;t do each or any of them proper justice, but this debate is now so central to what we are doing that it has to be taken on and given due consideration. To remind him again, I hope Klaas will be part of this effort.</p>
<p>I will start with the Minsky passage of time point. First of all, I think Minsky was right, and current events are illustrating his point. As I mentioned earlier, success in financial stability is when nothing happens, and not much has happened relative to the scale and nature of the shocks we have had &ndash; Covid, Ukraine etc. It is convenient to think, nothing has happened, job done with regulation, I rest my case for the benefits. But meanwhile, the argument is growing that since nothing much has happened, we must be overdoing it on regulation.</p>
<p>The answer to all of this is that it rightly pushes us to ground the case for regulation and keep doing so, because &ldquo;out of sight, out of mind&rdquo; does not lead to good long-run outcomes. Moreover, since the world constantly changes, it is a mistake to freeze the regulatory system because it appears to have worked in the recent period of time. Here I think it is important to set out the specific outcomes we seek in the financial system when we say we are aiming for financial stability. What I have in mind here are outcomes as follows: First, we want a system where confidence in banking is maintained in the face of economic shocks and where resolution regimes enable the continuity of financial services if a bank fails. Second, we want to maintain the singleness of money, including where new types of non-bank that have grown up in the crypto world seek to issue money for real-world payments purposed. Third, we want robust market and payments infrastructure that operates without interruption and recovers quickly from rare disruptions. Fourth, we want financing from banks and non-banks to the real economy that is sustainable through the economic cycle and avoids excess supply of debt followed by debt overhang. These are big building block outcomes that we have to articulate, otherwise the debate on regulation is dangerously ungrounded</p>
<p>Let me turn to the second challenge, the point on simplification. Regulation probably does go in cycles, and we should recognise this and respond. Post-crisis it was straightforward to advance a cost-benefit case for increasing regulation, and this happened. By the way, in my experience governments were very much part of this process, it wasn&rsquo;t just central banks and regulators. But pro-cyclical regulation is not a good or stable state of the world, and we should recognise this. There is little doubt that in some areas we collect too much data. There is also a growing risk that because of this, as the pro-cyclical tide turns, we are inhibited from collecting necessary data in new areas of risk. So, we must, and I think are, responding positively to the simplification challenge. Another case of simplification is the adoption of a simpler capital regime for small deposit takers, in the UK the so-called &ldquo;Strong and Simple&rdquo; regime.</p>
<p>The third challenge is the competitiveness one. As I mentioned, this comes in several forms &ndash; you have skewed competitiveness by regulating, and you have prevented innovation by doing so. These are basically the same argument taking on different forms. Here, too, we must respond, and we have to ground the response in the core building block arguments. The danger here, to be frank, is that arguments that are interest based &ndash; and I don&rsquo;t say this in a critical way, it&rsquo;s a matter of fact &ndash; swamp the fundamental ideas based grounding of financial regulation. We have seen this before &ndash; its another form of the Minsky argument. It is the case that post-crisis regulation did intentionally change the competitive balance of banks and non-banks, for the reasons that we had ended up pre-crisis with an unstable and dangerous banking system which had lost the anchor of the singleness of money. That anchor could only be put back in place with massive state intervention at an unacceptable cost to taxpayers.</p>
<p>Today, I would argue that the financial system is not only more stable, but also generally earning returns which meet basic commercial objectives. It is up to firms then to increase their returns further, nothing is wrong with that. But there is a point in the third challenge. We must enable safe innovation and development of the financial system, otherwise competitiveness is an issue and it will undermine achieving the goal of financial stability. This enablement needs however to happen within a system that is grounded in the core ideas and principles. Yes, I&rsquo;m back to points like the singleness of money again.</p>
<p>The fourth challenge, the growth issue, is crucial. We face a huge challenge on this front. However, I push back at the line of argument that post-crisis financial regulation caused the fall in productivity growth, by restricting business investment in the economy. I think it is a rather different line of argument. Big shifts in productivity growth over history have been shaped by advances in so-called general purpose technology &ndash; things like the steam engine, electricity etc. We had such an advance before the financial crisis, through ICT and the internet. Over time, the contribution of these advances to economic growth does run out &ndash; that&rsquo;s as distinct from their contribution to the level of economic activity. I think this is more what we have seen post-crisis, but the timing is coincidentally awkward for separating out causes.</p>
<p>All of that said, we need a financial system that is ready and able to finance the next general purpose technology advance, which I would guess is AI. This is the important question today. In my view this must be a stable financial system, grounded in the core areas and principles of financial stability, but one that must be set up to support growth.</p>
<p>To finish, all of these four challenges have a point to them. We cannot behave as if the case for financial stability can ignore them. That said, if the baby is thrown out with the bath water so to speak, and financial stability is relegated in terms of its importance, we won&rsquo;t achieve our objectives. There is no trade-off between financial stability and objectives like growth and competitiveness.</p>
<p>But nor is our system perfect in every respect and fit for an ever-changing world. Our system must be constantly assessed and adapted as needed. But that process must be grounded in the core principles and ideas of financial stability. Klaas, you have been a leader in ensuring we do this, and I hope and believe you will go on being so.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I would like to thank Nathana&euml;l Benjamin, Sarah Breeden, Karen Jude and Sam Woods for their comments and help in the preparation of this speech.</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Fiserv Small Business Index remains at 148</i></li>
<li><i style="font-family: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">Y</i><i style="font-family: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">ear-over-year sales grew +2.3%</i></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.fiserv.com/" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Fiserv, Inc.</a>&nbsp;(NYSE: FI), a leading global provider of payments and financial services technology, has published the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fiserv.com/en/fiserv-small-business-index.html" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Fiserv Small Business Index</a>&nbsp;for September 2025, with the seasonally adjusted Index holding steady at 148 for a third consecutive month.</p>
<p>Year-over-year sales (+2.3%) and transactions (+2.3%) grew steadily, and average ticket sizes (+0.1%) increased modestly compared to 2024. Month-over-month sales (+0.1%) and transactions (+0.3%) saw small increases; average ticket sizes fell (-0.2%) slightly compared to August.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pragmatism continued to guide consumer spending in September, with discretionary purchases slowing and the essentials seeing the most growth,&rdquo; said Prasanna Dhore, Chief Data Officer, Fiserv. &ldquo;This continuation of budget-conscious purchasing resulted in slower growth in categories like Arts, Entertainment, Recreation, and Retail, while Professional Services, Healthcare and many other essential industries grew.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Key Takeaways</span></p>
<p><span>Retail grows year-over-year; remains sluggish month to month</span></p>
<p>Small business retail sales grew (+1.6%) year over year, led by Sporting Goods, Hobby, and Miscellaneous Retailers (+5.3%), Furniture and Appliance Retailers (+5.3%) and Clothing, Show and Jewelry Retailers (+5.1%). Yearly growth came despite a slowdown (-0.3%) month over month. Food and Beverage Retailers contributed most significantly to the near-term slowdown, contracting -1.5% month over month. Core Retail (which excludes the volatile categories of Gasoline Stations, Motor Vehicle and Parts Dealers, and Building Materials) faced even stronger headwinds (-0.6%) month-over-month.</p>
<p><span>Consumers continue to be pragmatic with purchases</span></p>
<p>Discretionary spending rose (+1.5%) year-over-year, but Essential sales grew at nearly double the pace (+2.9%). The overall slowdown in momentum across small business sales is evident here as well, with discretionary purchases dropping (-0.1%) month-over-month and essential spending rising modestly (+0.3%).</p>
<p><span>Bars and pubs outperformed full-service and quick-service restaurants in September</span></p>
<p>Restaurant sales grew +1.2% year-over-year and +0.3% month-over-month. The strongest momentum in restaurants was observed at Bars and pubs, which saw an increase in sales (+1.6%) and foot traffic (+1.1%) compared to August. Full-service restaurants experienced much smaller sales growth (+0.3%) month-over-month and a slight increase in foot traffic (+0.2%). Quick-service restaurants saw increased foot traffic (+0.4%) and sales (+0.1%) growth.</p>
<p><span>Services outpaced Goods</span></p>
<p>Year-over-year Services sales showed strong growth (+2.3%) and outpaced the growth of Goods (+1.7%). Compared to August, Services sales grew slightly (+0.2%). Top performing service-based businesses compared to 2024 were Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services (+7.2%), Information (+6.7%) and Healthcare (+3.3%).</p>
<p><span>Ahead of the holiday season, hobby and game stores show positive growth</span></p>
<p>Despite decreased foot traffic (-3.2%) month over month, small business Hobby, Toy, and Game Retailers experienced a healthy sales increase (+2.2%).</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><b>Overview</b></p>
<p>In Q3 2025, LME average daily volume (ADV) was up 3.0% on Q3 2024. Q3 2025 was the LME&rsquo;s sixth highest quarter by ADV in the past 10 years and follows the 10-year high&nbsp;for the market in Q2 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>LME Nickel</b>&nbsp;volume has consolidated its progress, up 30.9% over Q3 2024.&nbsp;<b>LME Lead&nbsp;</b>was up 5.2% on Q3 2024 and&nbsp;<b>LME Tin</b>&nbsp;was up 4.4% over the same period.&nbsp;<b>LME Cobalt</b>&nbsp;has grown significantly for each of the last four quarters and ADV was up from 9 lots in Q3 2024 to 125 lots in Q3 2025 with its highest ever monthly ADV in August.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q3 2025 has also seen the highest level of futures market open interest (MOI) since March 2021.</p>
<p>Matthew Chamberlain, LME CEO, said:</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;While markets have drawn breath following an exceptional second quarter we have continued to see strong volumes at the LME. It has been particularly pleasing to follow the growth of our cobalt contract.</i></p>
<p><i>&ldquo;This quarter has marked the first concrete steps in our work to enhance liquidity on our market with the introduction of TAS contracts. There is more to come in the final three months of the year including the calibration of tick sizes as we prepare for the introduction of block thresholds in Q1 2026. It is an exciting period for the LME and I am grateful to members and clients for their continuing support and readiness to work with us on enhancements that will ultimately deliver even stronger, more liquid markets.&rdquo;</i></p>

<p><span>Cityvarasto is a Finnish self-storage, van rental and moving service company established in 1999.

We are very growth-oriented, and the share issue and listing on First North will greatly promote our goals of growing both organically and through acquisitions. I would like to thank the investors who participated in our IPO.

<title>Vienna Stock Exchange Q3: Equity Turnover Up, ATX Maintains Strong Momentum</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Geopolitical and trade policy turmoil has caused considerable volatility on international stock markets. On the Vienna Stock Exchange, this resulted in a trading volume of EUR 52.95 billion, with the Austrian leading index ATX hovering near its all-time high. At the beginning of July,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wienerborse.at/en/news/vienna-stock-exchange-news/reploid-group-new-in-direct-market-plus/" target="_blank" title="Opens new window">REPLOID Group AG</a>&nbsp;became the second company after&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wienerborse.at/en/news/vienna-stock-exchange-news/steyr-motors-trading-start/" target="_blank" title="Opens new window">Steyr Motors AG</a>&nbsp;to be listed in the SME segment direct market plus in 2025. The growth trend in debt listings has led to another record year: after just three quarters, 21,719 new bonds were listed &ndash; around 62% more than in the entire previous record year.</p>
<p><a class="has-image" href="https://www.wienerborse.at/uploads/u/cms/images/fotos/presse/infografiken/vienna-stock-exchange-q32025.jpg" target="_blank" title="Opens new window"><img alt="Trading on the Vienna Stock Exchange Q32025" height="326" src="https://www.wienerborse.at/uploads/u/cms/_processed_/4/1/csm_vienna-stock-exchange-q32025_fbda563a46.jpg" title="Trading on the Vienna Stock Exchange Q32025" width="520" /></a></p>
<p>"Austrian stocks remained in demand as part of the brisk market activity. With continued growth in the global market and ETF sector, as well as business development in the debt listing space, we are consistently expanding our offering beyond our core business in Austrian equity trading. In doing so, we are creating added value for investors and issuers alike," says Christoph Boschan, CEO of Wiener B&ouml;rse AG.</p>
<h2>Volatile market conditions lead to high equity turnover</h2>
<p>After an exceptionally strong spring in terms of turnover, which was particularly influenced by US tariff policy, the summer months were somewhat quieter. Still, August was the second-strongest month in the past decade &ndash; surpassed only by August of the previous year. September turnover was also on a par with peak years such as 2021 or 2022. Geopolitical news therefore continues to cause noticeable movement on the markets. Turnover from equity investments amounted to EUR 52.95 billion at the end of the third quarter (+3.8% vs Q1-Q3 2024: EUR 51.01 billion).</p>
<h2>ATX including dividends at new all-time high and with new composition</h2>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wienerborse.at/en/index/atx-tr-AT0000A09FJ6/" target="_blank" title="Opens new window">ATX Total Return</a>, like the German DAX, a performance index including dividends, tops international rankings with its year-to-date gains. On 19 August, the national index reached its all-time high of 11,825.97 points. By 30 September, the Austrian benchmark, including dividends, had risen by 32.45% (ATX without dividends: 26.56%), putting it ahead of the DAX (19.95%), MSCI World (16.15%) and Euro Stoxx 50 (12.95%). Since 22 September, the ATX has also been calculated with a new composition: as part of the semi-annual review, STRABAG SE and PORR AG were newly included, replacing Telekom Austria AG and Mayr-Melnhof Karton AG. As of 30 September, the market capitalisation of all domestic companies listed in Vienna amounted to EUR 160 billion.</p>
<p>"Austrian stocks are in high demand this year, and this trend is far from short-term. Since the start of calculation, the ATX Total Return has delivered an annualised average performance of around 7%, earning its place in the global league. Attractive dividend yields, a strong position in the growth region of Central and Eastern Europe and moderate valuations make Austrian equities a key component of globally balanced portfolios," says Boschan.</p>
<h2>ETF offering more than doubled since the beginning of the year</h2>
<p>Turnover in the international segments of global market and exchange traded funds also developed very positively this year. Both the number of international equities tradable in Vienna at domestic fees and the number of index funds have been expanded several times over the course of the year. Most recently, 50 new ETFs were added to trading on the Vienna Stock Exchange, more than doubling the offering since the start of the year from 137 to 336 funds. The global market grew by around 60 securities this year, with the latest addition being the Swedish payment service provider Klarna. Shares in the medical technology company Ottobock are also set to be offered on the Vienna Stock Exchange, alongside the planned IPO on Deutsche B&ouml;rse. The international segment currently comprises around 900 securities from 28 countries.</p>
<h2>Another record year for debt listings</h2>
<p>The Vienna Stock Exchange has continued its strong growth in debt listings. By the end of the third quarter, 21,719 primary listings were admitted to trading, clearly surpassing the previous record year of 2024 (13,443) several months before the end of 2025. This is the result of the Vienna Stock Exchange's growing global reach, as underscored by listings from China's Alibaba Group and the first Mexican issue by Cobre del Mayo. A total of 1,297 debt issuers from 48 countries are currently served.</p>

<title>1 In 8 Canadians Are Hybrid Investors – And Most Plan To Stay That Way</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>To mark Investor Education Month, the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) is publishing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/csa-activities/research/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hybrid DIY Investing: A Research Summary Report</a>. The Report offers a comprehensive examination of hybrid investors in Canada, revealing behaviours, motivations and risk profiles of this investor segment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hybrid investors are those who invest on their own but also have a separate portfolio managed by a financial advisor. Overall, the CSA&rsquo;s research indicates that hybrid investors are younger on average and tend to have a higher risk tolerance than other Canadian investors. However, those with limited engagement with their financial advisor, especially younger investors aged 18 to 34, are more prone to speculative behaviour and are less aware of fraud risks, particularly when relying on self-made or absent financial plans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This study provides a compelling portrait of hybrid investors and underscores the importance of having meaningful discussions with your financial advisor,&rdquo; said Stan Magidson, CSA Chair and Chair and CEO of the Alberta Securities Commission. &ldquo;Regardless of the investing method chosen, it&rsquo;s clear that a comprehensive financial plan that encompasses all of your investment accounts can empower investors to make informed investment decisions aligned to their risk tolerance and goals, while avoiding potentially unsuitable or fraudulent investment opportunities.&rdquo;</p>
<div><strong>Key findings:</strong></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prevalence and demographics:</strong>&nbsp;Approximately one in eight Canadians (12 per cent) are hybrid investors. This group is disproportionately younger, identifies as male, compared to the general investor population, and is more likely to hold a university degree.</li>
<li><strong>Sustained hybrid engagement:&nbsp;</strong>A significant majority (68 per cent) of hybrid investors intend to maintain their dual approach to investing. Among these, 93 per cent express high certainty in their decision, a sentiment echoed in qualitative focus group discussions.</li>
<li><strong>Perceived risk tolerance:&nbsp;</strong>Hybrid investors indicate that they are willing to take on moderate or significant levels of risk with their investments (84 per cent) compared to Canadian investors overall (46 per cent) in a recent 2024 CIRO investor survey.</li>
<li><strong>Speculative investing behaviour:&nbsp;</strong>Those who worked on a financial plan with their advisor tended to engage in less speculative investment behaviour in their DIY account. This included investing in high-risk alternative investments like crypto assets and options, buying and selling investments frequently, and taking on significant risk for the chance of a very large return.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Advisor relationships:&nbsp;</strong>The research found contradictory data with regard to advisor relationships. Survey data suggested that hybrid investors maintain close relationships with their advisors, with many reporting that their advisors are aware of their separate self-directed activities. However, focus group findings indicated a more nuanced reality, with most participants sharing that they had a more transactional and distant relationship with their advisors.</li>
<li><strong>Fraud awareness and prevention:&nbsp;</strong>In focus group discussions, hybrid investors with higher risk tolerance had limited awareness of investment fraud. Those who did articulate a fraud prevention strategy relied on informal or untrustworthy sources and methods, such as online searches and community forums, rather than structured professional advice and institutional safeguards provided by registered advisors.&nbsp;</li>

<title>ISDA derivatiViews: A Path To Greater CFTC-SEC Alignment</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-derivativiews-a-path-to-greater-cftc-sec-alignment-2025102/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-derivativiews-a-path-to-greater-cftc-sec-alignment-2025102/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Earlier this week, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) held a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/meetings-events/sec-cftc-joint-roundtable-sept-29-2025">roundtable on regulatory harmonization</a>&nbsp;&ndash; an initiative we wholeheartedly support. The US regulatory framework has evolved over time to facilitate financial markets that are both vibrant and resilient, but we shouldn&rsquo;t shy away from acknowledging where and how the US regulatory process could be improved.</p>
<p>Both the CFTC and SEC have adapted their respective rulesets over time to reflect critical changes in markets, from the introduction of mandatory central clearing for derivatives to the advent of high-frequency trading. But a cautious approach has slowed market and product evolution. At a time when markets are evolving at a ferocious pace because of technological change, we need to make sure the regulatory process is streamlined and coordinated to avoid gumming up the wheels of finance that are so critical to economic growth. As the roundtable discussion showed, market participants are both capable and willing to work with regulators to support the appropriate evolution of the market by developing trading, risk management and operational solutions required for the future.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to remember that regulators and market participants have a successful history of cooperation on reforms that have delivered safer and more efficient markets &ndash; and ISDA has played an important part in developing legal, operational and risk management solutions to support that on a global scale. This includes delivery of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2016/05/05/isda-launches-resolutionstayjurisdictionalmodularprotocol/">ISDA resolution stay protocols</a>&nbsp;as part of global regulatory bank resolution efforts, implementation of the margining rules for non-cleared derivatives and launch of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/isda-solutions-infohub/isda-simm/">ISDA Standard Initial Margin Model</a>, and development of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/protocol/isda-2021-fallbacks-protocol/">ISDA fallbacks</a>&nbsp;to aid the transition from LIBOR.</p>
<p>There are parts of the current US regulatory framework where similar alignment and coordination are sorely needed. The CFTC and SEC rulebooks can be complex, overlap in certain key areas and are overly reliant on no-action relief. They also contain inconsistencies that mean the regulatory treatment of products and activities with similar risk profiles can differ, depending on whether they fall under the jurisdiction of the CFTC or the SEC.</p>
<p>We would highlight three key areas where greater coordination between the CFTC and SEC is critical and market participants can help to deliver solutions that would increase compliance, cut costs and create a robust collateral infrastructure.</p>
<p>The first is regulatory reporting. It&rsquo;s been more than four years since Archegos Capital Management went bust, leaving its counterparty banks with more than $10 billion in losses. US regulators were largely unaware of the exposures Archegos had been accumulating. While the CFTC introduced its reporting rules in 2012, the SEC regime only came into force a decade later, meaning Archegos did not have an obligation to report its security-based swaps ahead of its collapse.</p>
<p>Both regimes are now in place, which should help avoid gaps in the data going forward. This was helped by cooperation between the two agencies, with the SEC allowing firms to use CFTC reporting processes. But this remains a temporary solution. We urge the SEC to work with the CFTC and the industry to codify this relief into the SEC&rsquo;s permanent ruleset &ndash; a development that would eliminate significant unnecessary complexity and inefficiency for market participants. ISDA plans to add the SEC rules to its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/isda-solutions-infohub/isda-digital-regulatory-reporting/">Digital Regulatory Reporting initiative</a>, which already supports compliance in eight jurisdictions, enabling firms to implement changes to regulatory reporting requirements cost-effectively and accurately.</p>
<p>The agencies should also jointly invest in data curation and analytics capabilities. As a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2023/10/10/hidden-in-plain-sight-derivatives-exposures-regulatory-transparency-and-trade-repositories/">2023 ISDA paper points out</a>, a significant amount of data is available to regulators, but ensuring key information does not remain hidden in plain sight is challenging.</p>
<p>The second issue is Treasury clearing. Ahead of the clearing mandate coming into force from end-2026, clients must be able to realize the benefits of portfolio margining across cleared US Treasury securities and futures. The Fixed Income Clearing Corporation and CME Group are set to propose a client portfolio margining solution, and it&rsquo;s critical the CFTC and SEC act to quickly approve it once they do. This is a no-brainer and essential to make the economics of client clearing work.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t just a CFTC and SEC issue &ndash; US prudential regulators also need to adapt their rules to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2025/09/15/recognition-of-cross-product-netting-is-critical/">recognize the risk-reducing benefits of netting across products</a>, including cleared repos and futures, under the standardized approach to counterparty credit risk.</p>
<p>The third issue is market liquidity and collateral infrastructure. According to the latest&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2025/05/14/isda-margin-survey-year-end-2024/">ISDA margin survey</a>, initial margin and variation margin collected by leading derivatives market participants for their non-cleared derivatives exposures increased by 6.4% to $1.5 trillion at the end of 2024. While margin requirements have helped to provide protection against counterparty credit risk, we must recognize that the financial system has become more prone to liquidity crunches during periods of stress.</p>
<p>At a time when some markets are moving to 24/7 trading, we need 24/7 risk management.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2025/09/30/working-towards-tokenized-collateral/">Tokenization could alleviate some of the liquidity and workflow challenges</a>&nbsp;by expanding the types of usable collateral to a wider range of assets, including money market funds and other tokenized cash and securities. The industry is primed to transform the collateral ecosystem to make it more automated and efficient by leveraging blockchain and tokenized solutions. It&rsquo;s time the CFTC, SEC and market participants work together to upgrade this critical infrastructure underpinning our financial system.</p>
<p>We hope this week&rsquo;s CFTC-SEC roundtable is just the start of greater coordination between the agencies and market participants to swiftly address the old regulations that aren&rsquo;t fit for purpose and address the evolution of products, participants and infrastructures. Working together and tackling these issues will reduce unnecessary regulatory burdens, open a path to greater innovation and improve the competition and efficiency of US financial markets.</p>

<title>Basel Committee Approves Annual G-SIB Assessment, Enhances The Clarity Of Its Grading System For Jurisdictional Assessments And Takes Note Of The Implementation Of Margin Requirements For Non-Centrally Cleared Derivatives</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/basel-committee-approves-annual-g-sib-assessment-enhances-the-clarity-of-its-gr-2025103/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li>Basel Committee approves annual assessment exercise for global systemically important banks.</li>
<li>Enhances clarity of its grading system for jurisdictional assessments.</li>
<li>Discusses implementation status of margin requirements for non-centrally cleared derivatives.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision met virtually on 2 October 2025 to discuss a range of initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>Global systemically important banks</strong></p>
<p>The Committee approved the results of the end-2024 assessment exercise for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). The results will be submitted to the Financial Stability Board before it publishes the 2025 list of G-SIBs.</p>
<p><strong>Implementation</strong></p>
<p>The Committee discussed the grading used for its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/implementation/rcap_jurisdictional.htm"><span class="firstword">jurisdictional</span>&nbsp;assessments</a>, which are a key element of its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/implementation/rcap_role.htm"><span class="firstword">Regulatory</span>&nbsp;Consistency Assessment Programme</a>&nbsp;(RCAP). Jurisdictional assessments review the extent to which domestic regulations in each member jurisdiction are aligned with the minimum regulatory standards agreed by the Committee.</p>
<p>The jurisdictional assessment reports have used four terms to grade the overall level of compliance with the assessed standards (in descending order): compliant, largely compliant, materially non-compliant, and non-compliant. To enhance the clarity of the rank ordering of the jurisdictional assessment grades, the Committee agreed to change the name of the third grade from "materially non-compliant" to "partially non-compliant".</p>
<p>Separately, the Committee approved a finalised technical amendment on the hedging of counterparty credit risk exposures, following a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d584.htm"><span class="firstword">consultation</span>&nbsp;</a>last year. The technical amendment will be published later this month.</p>
<p><strong>Margining</strong></p>
<p>The Committee discussed a report on the implementation of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d499.pdf"><span class="firstword">margin</span>&nbsp;requirements</a>&nbsp;for non-centrally cleared derivatives, developed jointly with the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO). The report finds that implementation of the framework has made the financial system more resilient and that there is no evidence of material issues with the implementation of the framework.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>Background:&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>The Basel Committee is the primary global standard setter for the prudential regulation of banks and provides a forum for cooperation on banking supervisory matters. Its mandate is to strengthen the regulation, supervision and practices of banks worldwide with the purpose of enhancing financial stability. The Committee reports to the Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision and seeks its endorsement for major decisions. The Committee has no formal supranational authority, and its decisions have no legal force. Rather, the Committee relies on its members' commitments to achieve its mandate. The Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision is chaired by Tiff Macklem, Governor of the Bank of Canada. The Basel Committee is chaired by Erik Thed&eacute;en, Governor of Sveriges Riksbank.&nbsp;</em></p>

<title>Euronext Reaffirms Its Support For European Strategic Autonomy By Signing Partnerships With National Military Reserves</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Euronext reaffirms its support for European strategic autonomy by signing partnerships with national military reserves</span></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<h5>On 1 October 2025, Euronext signed a partnership with the French military reserve, the Garde nationale</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>On 19 September 2025, Euronext signed a partnership with the Danish military reserve, InterForce Danmark</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>More partnerships will be signed in the coming months with local military reserves in Europe</h5>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Euronext, the leading European capital market infrastructure, reaffirms its commitment to European resilience and strategic autonomy with the signature of new partnerships with national military reserves in Denmark and France. Additional agreements with local military reserves will be signed in the coming months.</p>
<p>These partnerships extend the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=kqTRr9CVRRlF10OaCxFHPAUpm9DuFXgzE2T4Vm7VHIshyUXgW-krO8E_YZq685XwNMMFklnvPpmzfPi09628Ugv6chdwXNM_iIkEv_MXED42cEeqZcX60pliCVzDKWXKUjNGu3LuFgBzAAsPzjb66rvr84ift9-sBeGaMH_EioNPpavgq3FJFKvUD0up9M83sohAplFpC3xiimBshzZOsec10Vm3UnjPAbwmvWH6oovtpKCeaNnz5HQQXvbHmirkByFxzXM-L_zuTtWRVKqm1QAQh2lxP5aTCP29TdTZvUY=" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="initiatives related to Energy, Security and Geostrategy, the &ldquo;New ESG&rdquo;">initiatives related to Energy, Security and Geostrategy, the &ldquo;New ESG&rdquo;</a>, launched by Euronext on 6 May 2025 to strengthen European strategic autonomy. This set of initiatives led by Euronext enhances the visibility of European companies operating in strategic sectors and provides them with unprecedented tools to meet their financing needs through improved access to capital. These solutions also address the growing demand from asset managers, institutional and retail investors to obtain better exposure to high-growth segments through thematic indices.</p>
<p>As European strategic autonomy and independence rely on the ability of European citizens to take part in their country&rsquo;s own defence ecosystem, Euronext has created a support framework for its employees who are already engaged in a reservist commitment, or who wish to take up this opportunity. As of 6 May 2025, Euronext guarantees the continuation of salary and social benefits for preliminary training periods of up to 15 days for all new reservists, and up to 10 days per year for all Euronext employees engaged in a reservist commitment across all the group&rsquo;s European locations. In countries where a more beneficial local reservist support system exists, the existing framework prevails.</p>
<p>To formalise this engagement, Euronext is signing partnerships with national military reserves.</p>
<p>In Paris, Euronext signed a partnership with the French military reserve, the Garde nationale, on 1 October 2025. General Fran&ccedil;ois-Xavier Poisbeau, General Secretary of the French National Guard (Garde nationale), presented the main aspects of the partnership, while Baptiste Mercier, Head of Operational Performance at Allianz France, and Coralie Lecouffe, Senior Consultant at Capgemini Invent, shared personal experiences from their engagement as operational reservists.</p>
<p>In Copenhagen, Euronext signed a partnership with the Danish military reserve, InterForce Danmark, on 19 September 2025. Local employees had the opportunity to meet with members of the reservist forces, who shared insights about their experience and highlighted how military reservists support Denmark&rsquo;s resilience in the long term.</p>
<p>More partnerships will be signed in the coming months with local military reserve forces from European countries.</p>
<p><span>St&eacute;phane Boujnah, CEO and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext, said:</span>&nbsp;<em>"Through these partnerships, Euronext reinforces its commitment to strengthen European resilience and strategic autonomy, at a time of rising geopolitical tensions. I am deeply proud of this citizen engagement that enables our colleagues to put their skills and abilities to the service of their countries. I want to thank InterForce Danmark and the Garde nationale in France for their support, and the valuable insights they shared. Within the coming weeks and months, Euronext will sign similar partnership agreements with military reserve forces in European countries where we operate. These initiatives demonstrate the power of cross-border collaboration and highlight Euronext&rsquo;s role as a unifying force in Europe&rsquo;s capital markets, fostering both national and continental strength.&rdquo;</em></p>
