<p><span>David Schwimmer, CEO said:</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;We continued our strong momentum in Q3, driving growth across all business lines. We are also improving profitability and are now expecting EBITDA margin at the top of guidance for 2025. We have significantly accelerated our strategic progress in the last few months, driving the long-term growth potential of the business: we have launched a series of innovative new products for customers positioning LSEG as the partner of choice in AI with the likes of Microsoft and Databricks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In addition, we are deploying capital effectively. Today we are announcing a significant transaction in our post trade business: a group of leading banks is acquiring a 20% stake in Post Trade Solutions, and in parallel we have amended and extended the revenue share arrangements within SwapClear. This deal strengthens our partnership and strategic alignment with key customers, while delivering attractive margin and earnings enhancement. In addition, having returned nearly &pound;1 billion to shareholders through share buybacks in the last three months, we are committing to a further &pound;1 billion by February 2026.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 class="Heading Heading--l">Q3 2025: Strong delivery against key strategic priorities<span><em>&nbsp;</em></span></h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="VerticalSpacing VerticalSpacing--m">
<div class="RichText   ">
<p>We have aligned our businesses with strong fundamental growth drivers, including: the customer need for more seamless end-to-end solutions across asset classes and along the full length of the investment trade lifecycle; greater digitisation and data-driven decision-making across financial markets; and the critical customer requirement for integrated risk and performance measurement capabilities.</p>
<p>Within these, we expect the rapid rise of AI to simplify workflows and drive value-added insights to generate significant and sustained growth in demand for trusted, industry-standard data. With our unmatched data, infrastructure and partnerships, we are uniquely positioned to partner with customers to seize these opportunities, significantly enhancing our own products and opening up powerful new distribution channels for our data and analytics. Our strategy to deliver on this opportunity centres on three pillars:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Trusted data:</span>&nbsp;Delivering our trusted, high-quality data through multiple new distribution channels to scale AI in financial services through our open, LLM-agnostic, and infrastructure-oriented partnership approach. The value of our data lies in our intellectual property, technology and infrastructure.</li>
<li><span>Transformative products:</span>&nbsp;Reimagining how financial services professionals work, with AI-enabled products that bring speed, simplicity and conviction to our customers&rsquo; workflows and decision-making.</li>
<li><span>Intelligent enterprise:</span>&nbsp;Deploying AI across our own business, so we can innovate faster and serve our customers better, with the same commitment to trust and reliability for which our customers rely on us.</li>
</ol>
<p>We continued to execute against this strategy strongly and at pace in Q3:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Executing on our LSEG Everywhere strategy:</span>&nbsp;we are the partner of choice for financial markets data. In August we partnered with Rogo to integrate our trusted content into its industry-leading AI applications, enabling seamless interoperability between Workspace and the Rogo platform. In September, we announced that our AI-ready data is available on Databricks, allowing customers to rapidly build and deploy AI agents with confidence in the accuracy and auditability of the data powering these tools. In October we entered into a similar partnership with Snowflake, enabling customers to embed LSEG data into AI agents powered by their Cortex AI tools. We also launched MCP infrastructure, giving customers enhanced connectivity and a unified data and AI ecosystem.</li>
<li><span>Deepening our partnership with Microsoft:</span>&nbsp;Continuing our close partnership, we are embedding our data in Microsoft 365 Copilot, a powerful integration allowing financial professionals to generate insights, streamline decision-making, and improve productivity with our trusted, authoritative data. Integration with Copilot Studio further allows users to build agentic workflow based on our data, leveraging MCP.</li>
<li><span>Accelerating product innovation in Workspace:</span>&nbsp;We continue to advance our innovative solutions, investing in new, powerful capabilities for our users across asset classes and communities. We have been engaging key customers in the FX and Commodity trading communities as part of the staged customer roll out of Open Directory from Q4, and we are introducing new Workspace AI tools including natural language capabilities to all users in H1 2026. We look forward to demonstrating all of these features at our Innovation Forum on 10 November 2025.</li>

<h2 class="Heading Heading--l">Further disclosure on Workflows and Data &amp; Feeds revenue</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="VerticalSpacing VerticalSpacing--m">
<div class="RichText   ">
<p>In the webcast this morning, we will present an analysis of revenue by user type for Workflows and by data type for Data &amp; Feeds, to further aid understanding of our business and to demonstrate how our end-to-end workflows and trusted data are essential to our customers. These disclosures are summarised below.</p>
<p><span>Workflows</span>: Traders, accounting for&nbsp;<span>c.50%</span>&nbsp;of Workflows revenue, are benefiting from the deep integration of exclusive, LSEG-enriched and industry-standard content into their pre-trade, at-trade and post-trade tools, networks including Messenger and Advanced Dealing, and access to proprietary analytics and trading venues. A further&nbsp;<span>c.20%</span>&nbsp;of Workflows revenue comes from Trading functionality, including trade routing and order and execution management services.</p>
<p>Investment Banking represents&nbsp;<span>c.15%</span>&nbsp;of Workflows revenue, where practitioners benefit from proprietary, enriched and industry-standard data across deals, corporate actions and research.</p>
<p>Investment Management and Wealth users account for&nbsp;<span>c.15%</span>&nbsp;of Workflows revenue. For these customers, our data leadership including Reuters and Dow Jones news, research and IBES consensus estimates, as well as tools like FTSE benchmark creation and portfolio analytics, are key differentiating features.</p>
<p>For all Workspace customers, the integration of AI over the coming months, and the launch of Open Directory, will further enhance collaboration, surface powerful insights from trusted data and streamline workflows.</p>
<p><span>Data &amp; Feeds:</span>&nbsp;Our accurate, auditable and trusted data is either infrastructure-based, proprietary, exclusive, enhanced or, in the case of public data, benefiting from our extensive processes to validate, normalise and structure it into consistent and easy-to-use datasets. Around&nbsp;<span>90%</span>&nbsp;of our Data &amp; Feeds revenue comes from activities where we have built a deep intellectual property, technology or infrastructure advantage.</p>
<p>Around&nbsp;<span>45%</span>&nbsp;of our Data &amp; Feeds revenue comes from real-time data distributed via our proprietary physical network. Another&nbsp;<span>c.25%</span>&nbsp;of revenue comes from specialised data sources (proprietary, contributed or exclusive) like fixed income evaluated pricing, deals league tables and publications, which we have further enriched with our own analysis.&nbsp;<span>10%</span>&nbsp;comes from other specialised data from exclusive and aggregated non-public sources like Reuters news and contributed fund data. A further 10% comes from public data that we enrich with our own analysis &ndash; like IBES earnings estimates or SentiMine analysis.</p>
<p>The remaining&nbsp;<span>10%</span>&nbsp;of Data &amp; Feeds revenue is from purely public sources, but that data too goes through our extensive data transformation and standardisation processes, and is rarely sold in isolation.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2 class="Heading Heading--l">Creating shareholder value through active capital allocation</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="VerticalSpacing VerticalSpacing--m">
<div class="RichText   ">
<p>Our long-term approach to capital allocation is to prioritise the organic investment needs of the group, to pursue &lsquo;bolt-on&rsquo; inorganic growth subject to stringent financial and strategic criteria, and to return surplus capital to shareholders subject to leverage and other considerations. Overall, we expect to deploy approximately &pound;3.5 billion to M&amp;A and shareholder returns in 2025, as follows:</p>
<p><em>Ordinary dividend - &pound;0.72 billion</em></p>
<p>We have paid &pound;0.72 billion in ordinary dividends, comprising the 2024 final dividend and the 2025 interim dividend.</p>
<p><em>Post Trade Solutions and SwapClear - &pound;0.75 billion net</em></p>
<p>In a separate release today, we have announced that 11 leading global banks have agreed to invest in Post Trade Solutions (&ldquo;PTS&rdquo;), acquiring a 20% stake for an aggregate cash consideration of &pound;170 million, and valuing the whole of PTS at &pound;850 million. As a result of this transaction, PTS will benefit from the partnership with a number of major customers, and these banks will benefit from strategic input into PTS and its future growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, LSEG will acquire an increased proportion of the revenue surplus in the SwapClear business, for a total cash consideration of &pound;1.15 billion, of which &pound;0.9 billion is payable in 2025 and &pound;0.25 billion in 2026. This transaction is effective retroactively from the start of 2025. It will also extend the remaining revenue share arrangements out to 2045, extending the very successful partnership on which SwapClear has continued to grow.</p>
<p>This transaction improves the EBITDA margin of the Markets division by c.250 bps and the EBITDA margin of the Group by c.100 bps from 2025, and is 2-3% accretive to Adjusted EPS in the current year.</p>
<p><em>Share buybacks - &pound;2.0 billion</em></p>
<p>We completed a &pound;500 million share buyback in H1. In recent weeks we have accelerated the pace of the &pound;1 billion share buyback announced on 31 July 2025. As at 22 October 2025, we have completed &pound;938 million of this buyback, repurchasing 10.5 million shares at an average price of &pound;88.95.</p>
<p>This opportunity for significant shareholder value creation has persisted. Consistent with our capital allocation framework we intend to deploy a further &pound;1 billion in share buybacks by the time of the Group&rsquo;s 2025 full year results on 26 February 2026, of which we expect to complete around half during 2025. Taking into account the expected run rate of this new buyback and the Post Trade transactions, we expect Group leverage to be around 1.9x net debt to EBITDA at the end of 2025, below the middle of our target range of 1.5-2.5x.</p>

<h2 class="Heading Heading--l">Raising margin guidance; reconfirming all other financial targets</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="VerticalSpacing VerticalSpacing--m">
<div class="RichText   ">
<p>Excluding the impact of the Post Trade transaction announced today, we now expect constant currency EBITDA margins to increase by c.100 bps in FY2025, at the top of our guidance range, reflecting strong execution and realisation of operating leverage. In addition, the changes to the revenue share agreement in SwapClear have a retroactive effect across 2025, further enhancing Group EBITDA margins by c.100 bps.</p>
<p>Our other guidance for FY2025 remains as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Organic constant currency growth in Total Income (excl. recoveries) of 6.5-7.5%, including an acceleration in Data &amp; Analytics organic growth and more normalised growth at Tradeweb</li>
<li>Capex intensity of c. 10% of Total Income (excl. recoveries)</li>
<li>Equity free cash flow of at least &pound;2.4 billion, based on foreign exchange rates of &pound;1 = $1.28 and &euro;1.18</li>
<li>Underlying effective tax rate of 24-25%</li>
</ul>
<p>Guidance on EBITDA margin, capex and free cash flow is inclusive of all investments in our AI initiatives.</p>

<p>Total Income (excluding recoveries) was up 6.7% including M&amp;A, and 6.4% on an organic basis.</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Data &amp; Analytics</span>&nbsp;was up 4.9%. Growth was broadly consistent with H1 with the benefit of net sales largely offsetting the impact of known headwinds including the new multi-year UBS contract and the isolated mandate losses highlighted at H1.  
<ul>
<li><span>Workflows</span>&nbsp;was up 3.0% with continued strength in FX, commodities and banking users. The sustained growth follows the successful sunsetting of Eikon in June and reflects the continuous enhancement of our Workspace offering, driving new sales and displacements.</li>
<li><span>Data &amp; Feeds&nbsp;</span>was up 6.6% with consistent and broad-based growth. Continuing innovation and expansion of our offering drove demand for our real time services, with sales of machine-readable news for AI use cases and the benefit of AI partnerships further contributing to growth. Demand for pricing and reference services also remained strong supported by ongoing enhancements to content and distribution capabilities.<span></span></li>
<li><span>Analytics</span>&nbsp;was up 7.7%, with strong in-year sales of the Analytics API a key driver of the acceleration to high single-digit growth. The launch of services on Databricks added an additional distribution conduit for our analytics content, further reinforcing momentum across key use cases.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>FTSE Russell&nbsp;</span>was up 9.3%. As highlighted at H1, no significant multi-year customer mandates were due for renewal in the quarter leading to more modest growth in subscription revenues in Q3. A more typical mandate renewal cycle is anticipated for FY2026. Growth in asset-based revenues was strong, up 18.2%, reflecting product inflows and market strength.&nbsp;</li>
<li><span>Risk Intelligence</span>&nbsp;was up 13.9% driven by strong business momentum and customer demand for our screening and identity verification services. We continue to enhance and innovate our offering introducing two new services in Q3, World-Check On Demand and World-Check Verify, delivering precise, continuously updated real-time intelligence on sanctions, politically exposed persons (PEPs), adverse media, and enforcement actions to our customers.</li>
<li><span>Annual Subscription Value (ASV)</span>:&nbsp;Period-end organic ASV growth was +5.6%, a little ahead of guidance. The sequential decline was primarily driven by the final crystallisation of Credit Suisse revenues following the new multi-year UBS contract in the period. Excluding this known impact, underlying ASV growth accelerated slightly. We expect headline ASV growth to further accelerate into the end of the year.</li>
<li><span>Markets</span>&nbsp;was up 6.3%. Amidst continuing macroeconomic uncertainty, we continue to support customers with new trading functionality and tools, driving positive growth across all venues despite a strong prior year comparator.  
<ul>
<li><span>Equities&nbsp;</span>was up 2.6% with growth in equity transaction volumes and data revenues. We continue to expand the funding continuum launching a new Private Securities Market in Q3 and conducting the first private funds transaction on our Digital Markets Infrastructure (DMI).</li>
<li><span>Fixed Income, Derivatives &amp; Other&nbsp;</span>was up 9.9%. The business achieved new record high trading volumes in the third quarter, with $173tn of average daily volume across its platforms, supported by Tradeweb&rsquo;s innovative trading protocols and an uncertain macroeconomic outlook. In the rates business, activity was particularly strong in mortgages, European government bonds and swaps. Tradeweb continued to see good customer engagement and adoption of their RFQ and AllTrade trading tools in credit, as well as their AiEX automated trading solutions. Activity in equity and money market instruments continues to be strong with both asset classes delivering double-digit growth.</li>
<li><span>FX&nbsp;</span>was up 3.1%. Activity across our interbank and dealer-to-client platforms remained strong, delivering positive growth against a demanding prior year volume comparison.<span>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>OTC Derivatives</span>&nbsp;was up 9.2%. Clearing and compression activity grew strongly across all asset classes in Q3 despite a strong prior year comparator. This was aided by new forward clearing capabilities in ForexClear and the international expansion of CDSClear. Our service for uncleared instruments, Post Trade Solutions, continues to build momentum, with 73% growth in activity through our SwapAgent platform in Q3 and 4,800 new counterparty relationships this year in our Acadia business.</li>
<li><span>Securities &amp; Reporting</span>&nbsp;was up 1.8%, with new regulatory reporting tools and strong volume growth in fixed income clearing more than offsetting the annualisation of Euronext-related revenues lost last year.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span>Non-Cash Collateral</span>&nbsp;was up 6.0%, in part reflecting a customer preference to hold a greater proportion of their collateral in non-cash instruments rather than cash.</li>
<li><span>Net Treasury Income</span>&nbsp;was down (7.1%) reflecting lower overall collateral balances, including the reduction in cash balances following last year&rsquo;s loss of business from Euronext, and the mix effect noted above favouring non-cash collateral.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>Group cost of sales&nbsp;</span>was up 4.5%, below the growth rate in revenue reflecting business mix and the partially fixed nature of the costs.&nbsp;</li>
<li><span>Gross profit</span>&nbsp;was up 6.5%, very slightly ahead of growth in Total Income (excl. recoveries) as a result of the lower growth in cost of sales.</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<div class="VerticalSpacing VerticalSpacing--l">
<div class="RichText   ">
<p>LSEG today announced that 11 leading global banks<span><sup>1</sup></span>&nbsp;(together, the&nbsp;<span>Investing Banks</span>) have agreed to invest in its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lseg.com/en/post-trade/solutions">Post Trade Solutions</a>&nbsp;business<span><sup>2</sup></span>, taking a 20% stake. The Investing Banks will each become shareholders in Post Trade Solutions, acquiring the stake for aggregate cash consideration of &pound;170 million, valuing the whole of Post Trade Solutions at &pound;850 million. Post Trade Solutions generated revenue of &pound;96 million and normalised EBITDA of &pound;16 million in 2024.</p>
<p>The Investing Banks are major customers of LSEG&rsquo;s clearing services and Post Trade Solutions business. As a result, this initiative continues the strong history of strategic partnership with LSEG and market participants, replicating the original LCH model that continues to prove so successful for LCH and its customers.</p>
<p>As shareholders in Post Trade Solutions, the Investing Banks will benefit from strategic input into Post Trade Solutions and its future growth. Three directors nominated by the Investing Banks will join the Board of Post Trade Solutions.</p>
<p>LSEG will also acquire an increased proportion of the revenue surplus<span><sup>3</sup></span>&nbsp;from the SwapClear business. Previously, the founding members of SwapClear, which include the Investing Banks, were entitled to c.30% of SwapClear&rsquo;s revenue surplus through to 2035 (the&nbsp;<span>Revenue Surplus Share</span>). As a result of this transaction, the Revenue Surplus Share for the SwapClear banks will reduce to 15% for 2025 (applied retroactively to 1 January 2025) and 10% from 2026. The Investing Banks have reaffirmed their commitment to the ongoing successful partnership in SwapClear through an extension of the Revenue Surplus Share at the 10% level from 2035 until 2045.</p>
<p>The amount paid in relation to the Revenue Surplus Share in 2024, included in LSEG&rsquo;s cost of sales, was &euro;0.2 billion. LSEG is paying a total cash consideration of &pound;1.15 billion for this change in terms, payable in two instalments in 2025 and 2026<span><sup>4</sup></span>. A further payment of up to a maximum of &pound;200 million will be payable should certain future growth targets be met.</p>
<p>The transaction will be accretive to the EBITDA margin of the Markets division and LSEG as a whole, and will be approximately 2-3% accretive to AEPS in 2025 with further benefits anticipated in 2026.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="RichText   ">
<p><span>Daniel Maguire, Head of Markets, LSEG and CEO, LCH Group, said:&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Our SwapClear business was at the forefront of innovation when it was founded in collaboration with our clearing members 25 years ago &ndash; and that spirit of innovation and partnership continues today. Our clearing services have been highly successful in generating substantial growth and ensuring robust risk management for the OTC derivatives market. This has only been possible thanks to our long-term strategic partnership with our customers. With this proven track record of success, I&rsquo;m pleased that our partners are committed to continuing the approach with our Post Trade Solutions business, where we collectively see an opportunity to bring material efficiencies across capital, risk and operations to the bilateral OTC derivatives market. I look forward to working with our bank partners to transform this marketplace and enable it to continue to flourish and grow, efficiently and effectively.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Jim DeMare, Co-President of Bank of America, said:</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Technology-led collaboration is a vital component of enabling growth and efficiency in our industry. Our investment reflects Bank of America&rsquo;s commitment to driving innovation that enhances operational resilience and facilitates effective risk management.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Stephen Dainton, President of Barclays Bank PLC and Head of Investment Bank Management, said:</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Barclays is pleased to continue to support the evolution of market infrastructure through our investment in Post Trade Solutions. We are keen to develop innovative solutions that drive material capital and operational efficiencies for the industry, and are confident this investment will help support that ambition.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Olivier Osty, Deputy Chief Operating Officer of BNP Paribas and Chief Executive Officer of Corporate &amp; Institutional Banking (CIB), said:</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Clearing and post-trade efficiency are structural enablers to robust financial markets. BNP Paribas is committed to invest in those areas, and this long-standing and successful partnership with LSEG is a perfect example of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Andy Morton, Head of Markets, Citi, said:&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;We support LSEG's work to advance the post-trade landscape for bilateral OTC derivatives, having seen the efficiency benefits. Ongoing innovation is vital for improving risk management, and Post Trade Solutions, backed by banks, can transform the global market.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Troy Rohrbaugh, Co-CEO, Commercial &amp; Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan, said:</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Our partnership with SwapClear has been highly successful in growing and scaling the first interest rate swaps clearing service into an established and profitable business. We see great opportunity for the many benefits associated with clearing such as risk management, standardisation and efficiencies, to be replicated by those trading uncleared derivatives. This is an exciting opportunity for us to participate in and shape growth in that area through our investment in Post Trade Solutions.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Nat Tyce, Co-Head of Global Rates &amp; Head of EMEA Global Markets, Nomura, said:</span>&nbsp;"This collaboration with LSEG builds on our established relationship as long-standing members of SwapClear, where we have worked together over more than 15 years to develop clearing infrastructure that reduces risk and improves efficiency for OTC market participants. We look forward to Post Trade Solutions expanding these operational efficiencies into the bilateral space."</p>
<p><span>Alexandre Fleury, Co-Head, Global Banking &amp; Investor Solutions, Societe Generale, said:</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;This important step marks the evolution of a partnership with central parties like LSEG, alongside collaborating banks, to collectively drive operational excellence and efficiency across a critical component of our industry for the benefit of clients and the wider ecosystem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The transaction is expected to close in 2025.</p>

<p>Attached are copies of the addresses to be given by the Chair and the Managing Director and CEO at ASX Limited&rsquo;s Annual General Meeting today.</p>
<p>The address by the Managing Director and CEO includes commentary in relation to ASX&rsquo;s existing expense guidance for FY26. The commentary includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>confirming that total expense growth guidance remains between 14% and 19% in FY26 compared to FY25. This includes operating expenses of between $25 million and $35 million related to ASX&rsquo;s response to the ASIC inquiry&nbsp;</li>
<li>guiding core business expenses (which exclude the ASIC inquiry costs) to be towards the upper end of both the 8 to 11% range for total expenses and the 4 to 7% range excluding depreciation and amortisation. This is primarily driven by ASX&rsquo;s investments in the key programs, particularly Accelerate.</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good afternoon and thank you to the Federal Reserve Banks of St. Louis, Boston, Richmond, and Philadelphia for hosting today's discussions.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20251022b.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;You have organized a dynamic conversation on topics that have a significant bearing on the financial well-being of consumers and communities.</p>
<p>Financial inclusion and access to credit have been a long-standing focus of my work and a key component of the Federal Reserve's mission. The Fed has an important role in implementing a series of laws passed by Congress related to access to credit, including the Community Reinvestment Act. Today, I will share my perspective on the critical role that bank accounts, faster payments, and small-dollar loans can play in serving the needs of low- and moderate-income communities.</p>
<p>The ability to manage personal financial decisions safely and dependably begins with access to a bank account. One program that has been successful in expanding account access is Bank On, supported by the Cities for Financial Empowerment Fund (CFE Fund). Bank On accounts certified by the CFE Fund meet standards including low minimum deposits for account opening and low maintenance, overdraft, and other unexpected fees. The Bank On National Data (BOND) Hub, hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, is a critical data set that helps us understand how financial institutions are expanding access to low-cost banking for consumers.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20251022b.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;It also helps us better understand how this access directly benefits different households in numerous ways.</p>
<p>Beyond account access, innovations such as more efficient payments systems, small dollar loans, and underwriting loans using alternative data, such as cash flows facilitate greater financial inclusion for consumers.</p>
<p>The ability to move money faster can empower households by providing them with more control over financial inflows and outflows&mdash;receiving their income and paying their bills. Better control over their financial lives can reduce knock-on effects from financial volatility, particularly for low-to-moderate income households with less financial slack.</p>
<p>Likewise, products like bank-offered small-dollar loans can provide affordable, short-term liquidity to cover emergencies and unexpected expenses. Data from the Fed's 2024 Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking provide insights into how households might handle a small-dollar liquidity need. The short answer is it would be tough for many households. When asked how they would respond if confronted with an unexpected $400 expense, nearly 20 percent of adults said they would have paid at least in part by selling something, using a payday loan, deposit advance, or overdraft. When looking at households with incomes of under $25,000, this number increased to 46 percent.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20251022b.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a></p>
<p>A bank-offered small-dollar loan could provide help to these households. Some banks have begun offering small-dollar loans that are partially or wholly underwritten using alternative financial data, such as cash-flows, including deposits, paying rent and utilities, and the like. This type of underwriting can help assess the creditworthiness of consumers with thin or no credit files. Additionally, cash-flow underwriting can help banks offer a "second look" for consumers who would otherwise not qualify based on more traditional credit-score-based underwriting models. Beyond expanding the pool of eligible consumers, loans underwritten using alternative financial data can lead to less expensive and faster loan underwriting. A safe, reasonably priced, and transparent small-dollar loan could help consumers better navigate the burden of emergency expenses.</p>
<p>I've mentioned a few ways that financial services can help improve the financial health of low-and moderate-income households&mdash;through safe and affordable bank accounts, faster payments, and small-dollar loans. Thank you for the work you are doing to understand how to better serve households and small businesses in a wide variety of ways. Better access to financial services can help communities to thrive. I hope to see continued collaboration among the Federal Reserve System and myriad stakeholders, including all of you. Through our shared efforts, we can continue to advance financial inclusion for all communities. Thank you.</p>

<p><span>Speaker:&nbsp;</span>Nikhil Rathi, chief executive<br /><span>Event:&nbsp;</span>Corporation of the City of London&rsquo;s annual City Dinner<br /><span>Delivered:&nbsp;</span>22 October 2025</p>
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>Conflict today hits balance sheets, funding, markets and consumers as much as any battlefield.</li>
<li>Finance must be at the centre of our defence &ndash; helping to fund, insure and build the resilience on which our security depends.</li>
<li>Common purpose is needed if we want the national mission and the capital to flow in the same direction: the triple dividend of security, growth and market integrity.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>Lord Mayor, this evening I want to discuss the role finance must play in our national security.</p>
<p>Few have done more than you to put security and defence at the heart of the City&rsquo;s conversation. You are, after all, the decorated chair of the Square Mile reservists &ndash; in which the Lady Mayoress herself serves. &nbsp;<br /><br />I can see what you&rsquo;re thinking: Goodness, Nikhil, couldn&rsquo;t you go for something a little lighter? Something less contentious, like how to define high commission on motor finance?</p>
<p>You may rather I take up your call on risk warnings or talk about our supervisory approach and the need for more consistency and pace all the way through our organisation. Feedback we have heard and are responding to. &nbsp;</p>
<p>You perhaps think I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, guidance and compliance.</p>
<p>Not so. Security is bound up with the FCA&rsquo;s duty to protect and enhance the integrity of our financial system.</p>
<p>Conflict today hits balance sheets, funding, markets and consumers as much as any battlefield. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And we are not prepared, tactically or strategically.</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s a cyber-attack or a production shock &ndash; they move yields and test confidence. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Protection gaps shake market integrity.</p>
<p>Britain will not remain secure nor competitive if we treat finance as separate from our security &ndash; and if investors treat defence as separate from growth.</p>
<p>With hard fiscal constraints and volatile bond markets, government cannot carry this responsibility alone.</p>
<p>Finance must be the bridge between mission and means, technology and capability.</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-security-and-prosperity" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Security and prosperity</h2>
<p>I grew up in Barrow-in-Furness &ndash; a defence town. Back then, any dictator trying to paralyse Britain would have known exactly where to strike.&nbsp;<br /><br />At Barrow. Portsmouth. Plymouth. The Clyde.&nbsp;<br /><br />Where security and deterrence capability clustered.&nbsp;<br /><br />Defence towns knew then what is now being rediscovered. When government, industry and finance unite behind a clear defence mission, growth is more secure.&nbsp;<br /><br />These towns enjoy cycles of prosperity.</p>
<p>Industry mobilises following ship and submarine orders. Capital crowds in, sharing risk. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Greater security for the nation. Growth in the town.&nbsp;<br /><br />Wages and wealth rise, supply chains deepen, skills build.<br /><br />New dreadnought orders now creating thousands of jobs in Barrow, and elsewhere.</p>
<p>The cycle will repeat: Mission and capability. Security and prosperity.</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-a-world-reorganising-around-security" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>A world reorganising around security</h2>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>The old model worked when you could point to security infrastructure on a physical map.</p>
<p>Not anymore.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s security spreads across a digital and financial map: data centres, payment networks, financial infrastructure, satellites, grids, cloud software and undersea cables.</p>
<p>Mostly privately owned, all globally connected and perpetually online.</p>
<p>Such vital infrastructure can be vulnerable: Ukraine's grid targeted. ATMs in conflict zones down, settlement infrastructure at risk, shipping lanes blocked. Or the many drone incursions at airports.</p>
<p>In this environment, separating financial services from national security is outdated and dangerous.</p>
<p>The financial system &ndash; which determines how assets are insured, invested in and built &ndash; is as vital as any arsenal or base.</p>
<p>Others are hard-wiring finance into security.</p>
<p>European defence spending is climbing, pulling in private capital. It&rsquo;s no coincidence that EU savings and investment and defence union proposals came on the same day.</p>
<p>Across the Atlantic, capital has already shifted. The AI boom feeds into many aspects of defence, redefining the US economy.</p>
<p>Dual-use tech making investors money: securing computers, satellites and cyber resilience. Private finance bridging innovation and security.</p>
<p>With the EU and the US scaling technologies we also need fast, Britain brings a unique mix of ingredients: world-class defence primes, with BAE, Rolls Royce and Qinetiq, trading on UK markets with valuation multiples often higher than US comparators.</p>
<p>Extraordinary intelligence relationships, cutting-edge AI firms, top universities, trusted legal and financial institutions and deep capital pools.</p>
<p>Yet we treat finance as though it sits beside defence, not inside it &ndash; and we hesitate to invest in resilience on the sustained scale needed.</p>
<p>These cannot be decisions for risk officers alone &ndash; rebalancing risk must be for all Executives and Boards.</p>
<p>Because we&rsquo;re defending too narrowly. Capital flows into traditional estates - shipyards, airbases, Barrows and Clydes &ndash; but leaves critical civilian infrastructure under-financed and under-armoured.</p>
<p>Which leads to a&nbsp;<span>protection gap</span>.</p>
<p>Assets likely to be hit are privately held. When they fail, the loss is large, fast and connected.</p>
<p>The Jaguar Land Rover cyber incident showed how one shock ripples through the economy: An estimated &pound;1 in every &pound;160 of UK GDP tied to one firm and its supply chain.</p>
<p>Globally, a fraction of catastrophe and cyber risks are insured. The rest migrate to company P&amp;Ls, credit ratings, risk premia, prices, and ultimately to households.</p>
<p>And when cover is thin, it hits the Exchequer. That, along with the impact on livelihoods, drives popular anger.</p>
<p>We are potentially massively under-insuring.</p>
<p>Made worse by an&nbsp;<span>investment gap</span>.</p>
<p>Britain has a legion of innovative firms building what this era demands: autonomy, resilient networks, advanced engineering. Yet too many stall between invention and scale.</p>
<p>And when domestic capital participation is absent, overseas investors capture the upside and capability.</p>
<p>Consider the tungsten mine in Plymouth &ndash; strategically significant and potentially attracting largely foreign financing.</p>
<p>Policy signalling is inconsistent: we talk about AI, defence and industrial strategy but haven&rsquo;t said clearly how finance fits or private capital should be mobilised.</p>
<p>And just as we deepen security cooperation across Europe, proposed EU cross-border branching restrictions and patchwork rules raise the cost of precisely the investment our EU colleagues say they want.</p>

<div class="container">
<h2>Agreeing a common purpose</h2>
<p>So, what do we do?</p>
<p>Well: set the mission and clear the investment path.</p>
<p>The industrial strategy provides the starting point.</p>
<p>Financial services, digital and defence agreed as frontier industries to drive growth.</p>
<p>We should see them as inextricably linked, not individually discrete. Success in one relies on success in them all.</p>
<p>But what next?</p>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s all harness the City&rsquo;s expertise to address the insurance challenges. We will keep shining a light on both the risks and opportunities.</p>
<p>Second, the National Security Strategic Investment Fund, which finances the best startups that bring cutting edge capability to our defence and intelligence communities, is expanding. A good start, indeed one I learnt Japan wants to emulate, but I think ultimately too small.</p>
<p>We could aim for a true national resilience fund, co-investing in dual-use technologies and critical systems. Perhaps through FCA-regulated long term asset funds.</p>
<p>Third, be explicit on policy.</p>
<p>Through our reforms we&rsquo;re making growth capital far more accessible across private and public markets.</p>
<p>Our sustainability rules don&rsquo;t block defence investment. There is no regulatory reason preventing defence firms from accessing banking services.</p>
<p>But if ambiguity creates barriers or rules get in the way, tell us. We&rsquo;ll act.</p>
<p>Fourth, let&rsquo;s fix the procurement bridge: shorter cycles, faster payments, shared contracts banks can lend against. An end to credit and investment committees perceived to default to saying 'no'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the FCA, we&rsquo;ll be investing in cutting edge security technology: to protect our perimeter, support investigations, deliver a new supervisory approach and implement new responsibilities to tackle illicit finance the Chancellor asked us to take on yesterday.</p>
<p>Fifth, investors and lenders must step up.</p>
<p>Resilience is profitable. Power stability, secure data, cyber protection &ndash; these are cash generating growth markets.</p>
<p>So back British capability. Co-invest in firms and supply chains that can scale; don&rsquo;t leave the rewards to overseas capital.</p>
<p>And, finally, close your protection gaps, not just because our rules require it. Measure operational and cyber exposures; build products, hedges and cover that protect them.</p>
<p>In short: let&rsquo;s stop waiting for government to carry this.</p>
<p>Defence and resilience aren&rsquo;t costs outside your business model; they&rsquo;re growth markets you can shape. Core to market integrity.</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-conclusion" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The truth is the whole of Britain is a defence town now. As is this Square Mile.</p>
<p>That changes what national security means.</p>
<p>Not in the sense that every town must now build submarines and bombs.</p>
<p>But every sector holds a piece of the nation&rsquo;s armour and shares the risk and reward of defending it.</p>
<p>Finance must be at the centre of our defence &ndash; helping to fund, insure and build the resilience on which our security depends.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re delivering 50 initiatives supporting growth and competitiveness this year.</p>
<p>We have made hardwiring growth into regulation a strategic priority for the next 5 years. Helping ensure the UK remains a magnet for capital &ndash; stable and predictable in a volatile world.</p>
<p>Nothing in our regulatory approach will stand in the way of investment in the UK&rsquo;s security or sovereign capabilities.</p>
<p>Because we want the national mission and the capital to flow in the same direction: the triple dividend of market integrity, growth and security.</p>

<title>Equity Trading On Nigerian Exchange Surges 115% As Reforms Draw foreign, Domestic Investors</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Transactions by domestic and foreign investors on Nigerian Exchange (NGX) more than doubled in the nine months of 2025, reaching ₦8.54 trillion a 115.2% increase from ₦3.97 trillion recorded in the same period of 2024.</p>
<p>According to NGX&rsquo;s latest&nbsp;<i>Domestic &amp; Foreign Portfolio Participation in Equity Trading</i>&nbsp;report, the surge marks a record high for total market activity, buoyed by stronger participation from Pension Fund Administrators (PFAs) and high-net-worth domestic investors.</p>
<p>Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) accounted for ₦1.84 trillion of total trades, a 164% year-on-year rise from ₦696.9 billion a year earlier, while domestic investors contributed ₦6.7 trillion, up 104.7% from ₦3.27 trillion in 2024.</p>
<p>Foreign investors represented 21.6 per cent of total market activity during the period, up from 17.6% a year earlier. Domestic investors, while still dominant, saw their share ease slightly to 78.4% from 82.4%</p>
<p>Within the domestic segment, institutional investors led activity with ₦4.09 trillion, compared with ₦2.6 trillion from retail participants. Foreign transactions were strong on both the buy and sell sides. Inflows climbed 231% year-on-year to ₦1.03 trillion, while outflows rose 110% to ₦810.4 billion.</p>
<p>Over an 18-year horizon, NGX data shows domestic transactions have grown by 33% from ₦3.56 trillion in 2007 to ₦4.73 trillion in 2024, while foreign transactions rose 38% from ₦616 billion to ₦852 billion.</p>
<p>David Adonri, Vice Chairman Of The Board at Highcap Securities Ltd say the rebound in foreign participation reflects renewed confidence following reforms in Nigeria&rsquo;s foreign exchange regime by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). The changes, aimed at improving transparency and stability in currency markets, have been credited with enhancing liquidity and reducing uncertainty for foreign investors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The surge underscores growing optimism about Nigeria&rsquo;s reform trajectory and corporate resilience,&rdquo; said one Lagos-based analyst. &ldquo;The combination of exchange rate realignment, strong earnings, and the ongoing banking recapitalisation drive is making local equities increasingly attractive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Nigerian capital market has benefited from the momentum of President Bola Tinubu&rsquo;s economic reforms, with improved clarity around monetary policy and renewed interest in Nigeria&rsquo;s oil and non-oil sectors bolstering investor sentiment.</p>

<title>Brief Remarks, Federal Governor Michael S. Barr, At The Opportunity Finance Network Conference, Washington, D.C. (Via Pre-Recorded Video)</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/brief-remarks-federal-governor-michael-s-barr-at-the-opportunity-finance-netw-20251022/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Let me thank the Opportunity Finance Network for the invitation to be part of this gathering.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20251022a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;Unfortunately, I could not join you in person, but I'm pleased to be able to offer a few words to celebrate the legacy of Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs)&mdash;a legacy rooted in opportunity, innovation, and commitment to communities that have too often been overlooked.</p>
<p>I'm deeply grateful to so many of you who are carrying forward that mission&mdash;building on the work of pioneering leaders who saw finance not just as a set of markets, but as a means for broad-based economic inclusion.</p>
<p>I've had the privilege of being a part of the CDFI story myself. Early on, while at the Treasury Department, I worked with colleagues to help stand up the CDFI Fund, strengthen the Community Reinvestment Act, and launch the New Markets Tax Credit. When I returned to Treasury years later, I got a chance once again to work with the talented staff of the CDFI Fund, people whose dedication to expanding economic opportunity was truly inspiring. And over the last three decades, and now at the Federal Reserve, I've seen firsthand how CDFIs around the country help small businesses to thrive and communities to prosper.</p>
<p>CDFIs emerged as a creative solution to a fundamental challenge: how to get credit flowing into places where mainstream finance has not always reached. Through flexible underwriting, tailored lending, and deep community development relationships, CDFIs meet credit needs through good times and bad. CDFIs help fuel the revitalization of neighborhoods, small businesses, and local economies.</p>
<p>When I travel around the country as a Fed Governor, I often meet with local community leaders, including local CDFIs. I've seen CDFIs serving rural areas, such as the Mississippi Delta, where CDFIs have stepped in as traditional bank branches have closed. I've heard small businesses in urban areas such as Atlanta praise the work of CDFIs helping them get access to capital, skills development, and business opportunities that were otherwise unavailable. I've seen countless examples of CDFIs helping to build affordable housing, daycare centers, and revitalize neighborhoods, in communities from Hartford, Connecticut to Dallas, Texas.</p>
<p>CDFIs operate all over the nation, including in Indian Country. The Federal Reserve's Center for Indian Country Development has done remarkable work documenting the power of CDFIs in Native communities. Some of the solutions they've designed include seasonal payment structures for fishermen and loggers, accepting tribal distribution payments as collateral, or creating land buy-back loans. One Native CDFI leader described their work as "blending culture with finance"&mdash;and I think that captures beautifully what makes the CDFI model so powerful.</p>
<p>And when economic downturns come&mdash;as they inevitably do&mdash;CDFIs are often the first to step up. During the foreclosure crisis, they maintained lending and provided critical support to homeowners who otherwise could not or would not be served. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, CDFIs once again acted as first responders, rapidly delivering relief to small businesses.</p>
<p>CDFIs have earned their strong track record through performance and results &mdash; delivering impact in rural areas, urban neighborhoods, and tribal communities across the country. Demand for their services continues to grow.</p>
<p>The story of the CDFI movement is one of persistence, creativity, and partnership&mdash;qualities that will serve us well in the years ahead. Together, we can build on this strong foundation to ensure that opportunity reaches every community and that the legacy of inclusive finance continues for generations to come.</p>
<p>Thank you for your leadership, your commitment, and for the work you do every day to make that vision a reality.</p>

<title>Ontario Securities Commission Releases Findings On Digital Engagement Practices In Online Investing</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) today published&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/en/securities-law/instruments-rules-policies/3/33-760/osc-staff-notice-33-760-digital-engagement-practices-focused-compliance-examination-online-retail">OSC Staff Notice 33-760&nbsp;<em>Digital Engagement Practices: Focused Compliance Examination of Online Retail Platforms</em></a>. The notice outlines staff findings and provides guidance on the use of digital engagement practices (DEPs), including best practices for their responsible application by registrants serving retail clients. The results of this initiative will inform future research by the OSC.</p>
<p>OSC staff reviewed firms&rsquo; use of DEPs to ensure compliance with existing securities obligations. Staff identified that DEPs are increasingly being used by registrants and found both positive and negatives in how they are deployed. Positive examples of DEPs observed by staff included helping clients track savings goals, delivering educational nudges and alerts to promote account security, and encouraging long-term investing behaviour in the clients&rsquo; best interests. However, concerns were raised where DEPs were being used to drive further trading activity; and where firms did not maintain adequate policies and procedures. Examination findings have been shared with these firms, noting any required action to be taken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We recognize that digital tools can help retail investors in a variety of ways to improve education, efficiency and promote smart decision-making,&rdquo; said Matthew Onyeaju, Senior Vice President, Registration, Inspections &amp; Examinations, at the OSC. &ldquo;However, it is important that firms have taken adequate measures within their compliance framework to address the risks of improper use which could harm investors by encouraging excessive trading or speculative behaviours. These safeguards help maintain market integrity and support responsible investing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through its outreach efforts, the OSC is enhancing investor understanding of the potential influence DEPs can have.

<title>Canadian Securities Administrators Reminds Crypto-Backed Lending Platforms Of Potential Regulatory Requirements, And Cautions Investors Over Risks</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) reminds crypto-backed lending platforms about the possible application of securities law to their businesses and encourages them to ensure they comply with regulatory requirements.&nbsp; In addition, investors are reminded to seek information on the regulatory status of any firms they seek to do business with.</p>
<p>The CSA has been engaged with crypto-backed lending platforms that offer loans secured by crypto assets. It has granted exemptive relief tailored to the platform&rsquo;s specific business model, and includes conditions intended to address investor protection.<br /><br />Crypto-backed loans typically involve the investor (or borrower) transferring their crypto assets to the platform (or lender) as collateral in an amount that exceeds the value of the loan. Depending on the circumstances, crypto-backed lending platforms may be engaged in securities trading and distribution with clients, which may require registration and the filing of a prospectus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Platforms that are not registered with, or have not obtained exemptive relief from, securities regulators may present significant risks to investors, such as a lack of internal controls to safeguard collateral, or inadequate or inappropriate disclosure regarding terms of the loan.</p>
<p>Before engaging with any crypto-backed lending platform, investors should verify whether the platform is registered with a Canadian securities regulator or is operating under exemptive relief from securities legislation requirements. A list of those&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/crypto-trading-platforms-regulation-and-enforcement-actions/crypto-trading-platforms-authorized-to-do-business-with-canadians/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">crypto-backed lending platforms that have obtained exemptive relief</a>&nbsp;is available on the CSA website.</p>
<p>The CSA encourages platforms currently offering, or planning to offer, loans collateralized by crypto assets to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/about/contact-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">contact the appropriate securities regulator&nbsp;</a>if they haven&rsquo;t already done so. These discussions can help clarify the applicable regulatory requirements, including if they do apply to you, and whether exemptive relief may be appropriate.&nbsp;Through the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/csa-activities/csa-finhub/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CSA Financial Innovation Hub</a>&nbsp;and jurisdictional innovation hubs, the CSA provides flexible approaches to support innovative businesses seeking to meet regulatory requirements under securities laws.</p>
<p>Platforms who do not engage with regulators risk contravening securities laws and may be subject to regulatory action.&nbsp;</p>

<title>The AML/CFT Colleges Framework Is Maturing, The EBA Finds</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published its fifth and final Report on the Functioning of Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) Colleges. The Report finds that colleges&nbsp;are effective tools to facilitate information exchange, which improved the effectiveness of AML/CFT supervision within the Union. The Report also finds that a key objective of the framework is yet to be fulfilled, i.e to address issues that affect several group entities in a coordinated manner.</span></p>
<p>This Report sets out findings and observations from the EBA staff&rsquo;s monitoring of AML/CFT colleges, which suggest that, overall, competent authorities continued to use colleges to share relevant information that could enhance the effectiveness of supervision. The EBA nevertheless observed that limited progress was made by supervisors in implementing the two key priorities identified in the previous&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-12/95b3c1e2-cf83-4ff3-9648-b6dde709dca0/Report%20on%20the%20functioning%20of%20AMLCFT%20colleges%20in%202023.pdf">report on the functioning of AML/CFT colleges</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Applying the risk-based approach to the functioning of AML/CFT college meetings</p>
<p>The EBA found that certain supervisors were not yet fully adjusting the functioning of colleges (means used to exchange information and frequency at which the information is exchanged) based on the level of ML/TF risk they presented. As a result, supervisors could not always allocate sufficient resources to the most strategic colleges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensuring that discussions on the need for a common approach are meaningful and systematic.</p>
<p>The EBA found that most colleges that were actively monitored by the Authority still made insufficient efforts to identify common ML/TF risks and AML/CFT issues. As a result, the competent authorities participating in these colleges were often unable to have meaningful discussions on the need for a common approach or joint action.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>From 1 January 2026, the responsibility to monitor AML/CFT colleges will be transferred to AMLA. The findings from this report will be relevant for AMLA as it builds its supervisory framework.</p>
<p><span>Legal basis and background</span></p>
<ul>
<li>AML/CFT colleges are permanent structures that serve to enhance cooperation between different supervisors involved in the supervision of cross-border institutions.</li>
<li>Directive (EU) 2018/843 (AMLD) introduced an explicit requirement for competent authorities to cooperate with each other but did not provide a framework of how this cooperation should happen in practice.</li>
<li>The ESAs Guidelines (JC 2019 81) on cooperation and information exchange between competent authorities supervising credit and financial institutions published in December 2019 provide details on how competent authorities should give effect to the cooperation requirements set out in AMLD, by establishing a framework for AML/CFT colleges.</li>

<p>The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU financial market regulator and supervisor, has published its annual&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2025-10/ESMA50-481369926-30552_Carbon_Markets_Report_2025.pdf">market report on EU carbon markets</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify">Looking at the data for 2024, ESMA has not identified any significant issue in the integrity or transparency of EU carbon markets. Emission allowance auctions and secondary markets trading dynamics remain largely unchanged, with the market organised in a way that facilitates the flow of allowances from financial intermediaries to non-financial firms with compliance obligations. The analysis of trading and derivatives positions in the non-financial sector further highlights that the market accommodates different acquisition strategies, reflecting the different needs and capabilities of participants</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">ESMA produces annually a market report on EU carbon markets as part of its monitoring mandate under the EU Emissions Trading System Directive. The ESMA Carbon Markets report 2025 covers 2024 developments in the primary and secondary markets for EU emission allowances, based on a combination of regulatory and commercial data.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Trading Central and Solactive announce the introduction of the Solactive TC Quant Index family, comprising the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.solactive.com/indices/?index=DE000SL0R4U4">Solactive TC Quant EU 50 Index</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.solactive.com/indices/?index=DE000SL0R4R0">Solactive TC Quant US 50 Index</a>, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.solactive.com/indices/?index=DE000SL0R4X8">Solactive TC Quant CA 50 Index</a>. Built on Trading Central&rsquo;s proprietary TC Quantamental Ratings&reg; (TCQR), the indices provide systematic exposure to 50 high-scoring companies in each region, translating Trading Central&rsquo;s data-driven research into investable benchmarks.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Trading Central is known for distilling large and complex financial datasets&mdash;covering fundamentals, news and sentiment, technicals, and macro inputs&mdash;into actionable investor insights. The new index series leverages this capability to deliver diversified, factor-aware equity baskets across Europe, the United States, and Canada.</strong></p>
<p><strong>At the core of each index is the TCQR, a rules-based composite of 20 underlying factors grouped into Value, Growth, Quality, Momentum, and Income. Factor group weights are set at 25% each for Value, Growth, and Quality, and 12.5% each for Momentum and Income. Factors are computed within country-by-industry cohorts, and securities are ranked on a 0&ndash;100 TCQR scale; the top 50 qualify, subject to a maximum of 17 constituents per sector to promote diversification. Constituents are equally weighted and the indices rebalance monthly.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Timo Pfeiffer, Chief Markets Officer at Solactive, commented</span>:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;We are pleased to partner with Trading Central to craft an index series around their proprietary TC Quantamental Ratings&reg; (TCQR).

<title>ISI Markets Unveils REDD For Sovereign Debt To Redefine Emerging Market Credit Intelligence - The Platform Also Introduces “AskREDD,” An AI Feature Enabling Users To Query Data And Analysis On Sovereign Risk, Fiscal Health, And Special Situations In Real Time</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>ISI Markets, the global market intelligence provider known for its unique depth and breadth of coverage of emerging markets, today announced the launch of REDD for Sovereign Debt. The new AI-driven platform delivers early insights into sovereign and government-related risks for investors and analysts. It achieves this by unifying expert analysis, exclusive local sources, and curated economic, technical, and financial indicators.</span></p>
<p><span>Assessing EM sovereign credit risk has never been more challenging with global trade uncertainty, inflation and supply chain shocks and increased geopolitical risk coming into play. Fiscal strain on governments are mounting, with world</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.imf.org%2Fen%2FPublications%2FGFSR%2FIssues%2F2025%2F10%2F14%2Fglobal-financial-stability-report-october-2025/1/0102019a0ab67883-64c83872-9a96-46a4-8279-c0d4e67d051e-000000/ZT-AqAmbQQ2w4ZNJhdFgT8UE_K0=449" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>&nbsp;</span><span>government debt to GDP</span></a><span>&nbsp;hitting an estimate of 95%, and debt service absorbing an</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.development-finance.org%2Ffiles%2FSolving_the_Debt_Service_Crisis_G20_2024_Briefing_Final_2410.pdf/1/0102019a0ab67883-64c83872-9a96-46a4-8279-c0d4e67d051e-000000/a-GtOBh2_zhnaUniVwXJfjer1N8=449" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>&nbsp;</span><span>average of 43%</span></a><span>&nbsp;of budget revenue across developing economies.</span></p>
<p><span>The Emerging Market sovereign hard-currency debt market, valued at approximately</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.ubs.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fassetmanagement%2Finsights%2Fmarket-updates%2Farticles%2Femerging-markets-debt.html/1/0102019a0ab67883-64c83872-9a96-46a4-8279-c0d4e67d051e-000000/Li2NbA58Xa68sda5X8wqaBJx7Io=449" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>&nbsp;</span><span>$1.4 trillion</span></a><span>, demands comprehensive intelligence. Effective investment decision-making is critically dependent on a comprehensive view of all factors that affect sovereign debt. This view must connect macroeconomic fundamentals, investor fund flows, and granular local intelligence, including the financial health of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs). The lack of a unified source can lead to misinformed analysis and incomplete insights.</span></p>
<p><span>ISI Markets developed REDD for Sovereign Debt to address this specific need by integrating data and intelligence from across its product suite into a single easy to use platform tailored to the workflows of sovereign research analysts. It facilitates the analysis of sovereign entities, covering special situations and credit catalysts through expert analysis and exclusive on-the-ground local sources.</span></p>
<p><span>The coverage includes the full universe of emerging markets issuers of hard currency bonds, along with detailed financial models and corporate structures for SOEs, addressing the drivers&nbsp; of government-related risk in complex markets, where reliable data and insights are challenging to access.</span><span><br /></span><span><br /></span><span></span><span>REDD Intelligence, acquired by ISI Markets in 2022, is a leading provider of timely, actionable research, news and intelligence on emerging market sovereign and corporate debt issuers leveraging deep local networks of primary sources.</span></p>
<p><span>REDD for Sovereign Debt represents the latest ISI Markets offering to integrate content and data from across the group including country-level macroeconomic indicators from CEIC, aggregated sovereign fund flow data from EPFR, and country and political risk reports from EMIS. Together they provide the ability to dissect sovereign credit risk with unparalleled ease.</span></p>
<p><span>"The launch of REDD for Sovereign Debt marks a major strategic milestone for our firm,&rdquo; said Steve Pulley, CEO of ISI Markets. &ldquo;By augmenting the powerful proprietary sovereign news and research of REDD with relevant sovereign data from our wider product suite, we provide a 360-degree view of emerging market sovereign credit for our clients. This product showcases our power as an integrated global market intelligence provider powering our clients' critical investment decisions."</span></p>
<p><span>The core functionality and intelligence within the platform includes:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span>Comprehensive Coverage</span></strong><span>: Full universe of hard-currency sovereign bond issuers across emerging and frontier markets, with 10+ years of historical data and over 3 million unique data points.</span></li>
<li><strong>Deeper Intelligence</strong><span>: Integrated macroeconomic indicators, fund flow data, and financial metrics drawn from multiple high-quality sources.</span></li>
<li><strong>Exclusive News and Research</strong><span>: Continuous coverage of restructurings, policy shifts, and special situations, with 1,500+ expert reports published annually.</span></li>
<li><strong>AI-Powered Research</strong><span>: ISI&rsquo;s proprietary AI solution, AskREDD, enables the intuitive and instant extraction of insights from over 80,000 reports and documents - turning complex analysis into clear, actionable signals.</span></li>
<li><strong>Enhanced User Experience</strong><span>: Customisable alerts, watchlists, and a smoother interface designed to cut research time and quickly reveal critical information.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Alongside the launch of REDD for Sovereign Debt, REDD has unveiled a</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.reddintelligence.com%2F/1/0102019a0ab67883-64c83872-9a96-46a4-8279-c0d4e67d051e-000000/wYoCJGoI3jlVZ8JfCGpH_xWYg4k=449" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>&nbsp;</span><span>new website</span></a><span>&nbsp;that reflects its enhanced offering and unified brand positioning. The new site highlights integrated solutions, an expanded product suite, and provides a modern gateway to REDD&rsquo;s market intelligence.</span></p>

<title>Hong Kong Securities And Futures Commission: Court Verdict On Money Laundering Of Listed Company Funds</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) welcomes the conviction by the High Court today of Mr Wong Ming Chun of two counts of money laundering charges in relation to misappropriation of the funds of Hua Han Health Industry Holdings Limited (Hua Han) in 2015 (Note 1).</p>
<p>Today, Wong, the then financial controller and company secretary of Hua Han, was sentenced to seven years and eight months&rsquo; imprisonment in the High Court after he pleaded guilty to the money laundering offences (Note 2). He was also disqualified by the court from being a director of any company in Hong Kong, without the leave of the court, for a period of 12 years (Note 3).</p>
<p>In the course of the SFC&rsquo;s investigation into suspected disclosure of false or misleading information in Hua Han&rsquo;s financial statements from 2013 to 2015, the SFC uncovered misappropriation of proceeds from the fundraising activities of Hua Han in 2015. The SFC then referred our investigation findings to the Police (Note 4).</p>
<p>The SFC&rsquo;s Executive Director of Enforcement, Mr Christopher Wilson, said: &ldquo;Wong didn&rsquo;t just fail as a controller &ndash; he became an accomplice. Today&rsquo;s conviction underscores the gravity of Wong&rsquo;s betrayal of trust as the company&rsquo;s financial controller and reaffirms that financial controllers&rsquo; responsibilities extend beyond transactional oversight to safeguarding a company&rsquo;s financial integrity and investor trust through robust internal control.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When individuals in gatekeeping roles &ndash; whether or not they sit on the board &ndash; abuse their positions to engage in or facilitate criminal acts, they not only breach their fiduciary duties but also undermine the transparency and stability essential to an efficient and sustainable capital market,&rdquo; Mr Wilson added. &ldquo;These roles exist to protect shareholders, not exploit them. When that trust is broken, as it was here, we will not hesitate to use every enforcement tool at our disposal, including collaborating with the Police, to ensure justice is served and market integrity is maintained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hua Han was listed on the Main Board of The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited on 10 December 2002 and subsequently delisted on 16 December 2020.</li>
<li>Under section 25(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person&rsquo;s proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property.</li>
<li>Under section 168E of the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance, Cap. 32.</li>
<li>The SFC&rsquo;s investigation is ongoing.</li>

<title>Amman Stock Exchange: Amending The Directives For Listing Securities And The Directives Of The Over-The-Counter Market</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/amman-stock-exchange-amending-the-directives-for-listing-securities-and-the-dir-20251022/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Mr. Mazen Wathaifi, the Chief Executive Officer</span></span>&nbsp;<span><span>of Amman Stock Exchange (ASE) said that in line with the ASE&rsquo;s efforts to achieve a greater balance between protecting investors' rights and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements, the ASE has amended the Directives for Listing Securities and the Directives of the Over-the-Counter Market by introducing a&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>&ldquo;</span></span><span><span>Restricted Trading</span></span><span><span>&rdquo;</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;mechanism, which represents a significant step toward addressing the situation of suspended companies. The ASE will begin implementing it starting from 02 November 2025.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Wathaifi added that the creation of the &ldquo;Restricted Trading&rdquo; mechanism allows companies to resume trading of their shares after the end of suspension period specified in the directives which is three business days on the same market in which they are listed, subject to restrictions determined by the ASE&rsquo;s Board of Directors. These restrictions include reducing the duration of the trading session and the price limit. This mechanism is applied in cases specified in the Directives for Listing Securities, such as the suspension of trading in a company&rsquo;s shares for failing to submit its audited annual or reviewed interim financial statements to the ASE within the specified period, or if the General Assembly issues a decision not to approve the audited annual financial statements. It also applies upon a request of the Companies Controller or the state litigation attorney for the company's declaration of insolvency, and/or issuance of an insolvency decision. Additionally, it applies when a company is registered in the suspended companies register at the Companies Control Department.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>He added that the major advantages of applying the &ldquo;Restricted Trading&rdquo; mechanism is the reduction of the suspension period of companies shares that have not submitted their audited annual or reviewed interim financial statements from 14 days to only 3 days. This contributes to minimizing the impact of suspension on market liquidity and trading continuity, while protecting investors' interests.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>According to this mechanism, trading of a company's shares will resume within the same market in which they are listed and under the restrictions approved by the ASE Board of Directors, without the need to transfer them to the Over-the-Counter Market. This ensures the continuity of trading in the company's main market.</span></span>&nbsp;<span><span>Accordingly, the company&rsquo;s shares will continue to be traded during and after the accommodation period, without any adjustments or flotation of their price.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The Directives of the Over-the-Counter Market were also amended by deleting certain provisions and paragraphs in light of the cessation of transferring the trading of shares of companies to the Over-the-Counter Market.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Wathaifi added that, in light of the increasing demand from investors and investment funds for information related to climate change and its disclosure in accordance with the latest international standards and practices, and to enhance the competitiveness and attractiveness of companies listed on the ASE, a new provision was added to Article (9/A) of the Directives for Listing Securities. This provision requires companies to provide the ASE with a Climate-related disclosures report</span></span>&nbsp;<span><span>prepared in accordance with the ASE&rsquo;s requirements. It is noted that these requirements have been specified under the "Climate Disclosure Reporting Rules," which regulate the submission of the aforementioned report to the ASE.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>According to these rules, the requirements for submitting climate-related disclosures reports will be applied in two phases to the listed companies included in the ASE20 index sample for the first quarter of 2025.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The first phase is optional, during which companies may voluntarily submit climate-related disclosures reports for their 2025 data throughout 2026. These reports may be submitted separately from the annual report within nine months from the end of the financial year.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The second phase is mandatory, where companies must submit climate-related disclosures reports for their 2026 data and onwards as part of their annual report.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The ASE, in cooperation with the International Finance Corporation (IFC), has prepared Climate &ndash; Related Disclosure Guidance, in addition to the regulatory framework and policy for climate-related disclosure. The guidance includes a set of standards and principles that help listed companies develop financial and non-financial climate-related information. During 2024 and 2025, the ASE, in cooperation with (IFC), organized several training workshops for representatives of the companies included in the ASE20 index sample. These workshops aimed to raise awareness of the importance of issuing climate-related disclosure reports and to provide guidance on how to prepare them in line with the latest standards</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<title>VISTA Investor Survey Finds High Satisfaction And Trust, Industry Mandate Clear As Generational Divide Redefines The Future Of Advice</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/vista-investor-survey-finds-high-satisfaction-and-trust-industry-mandate-clear-20251021/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/vista-investor-survey-finds-high-satisfaction-and-trust-industry-mandate-clear-20251021/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today, SIFMA and KPMG released the results of the 2025 Voice of Investor Satisfaction, Trust, and Advocacy (VISTA) study titled &ldquo;The Future of Investment Advice&rdquo; at SIFMA&rsquo;s Annual Meeting, showing a healthy baseline of investor confidence and a clear mandate for the industry. A KPMG independent study sponsored by SIFMA, the survey of over 2,000 U.S. individual investors found that eight in ten investors are satisfied with the financial services industry overall, and nearly seven in ten say they trust it. Advisor-supported investment relationships remain central, with satisfaction close to 90% and peaking at 91% for Boomers. Ethical standards also scored well, with 83% of investors expressing satisfaction.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-936830" height="209" src="https://www.sifma.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/7-in-10-SIFMA-and-KPMG-Investor-Survey.jpg" width="422" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-936829" height="211" src="https://www.sifma.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/8-in-10-SIFMA-and-KPMG-Investor-Survey.jpg" width="447" /></p>
<p><em>Source: The Future of Advice: Why Combining Trust and Technology is Key to Attracting New Generations of Investors</em></p>
<p>While advisors remain the foundation of trust and satisfaction for millions of investors, the VISTA survey found that generational divides are reshaping investor expectations and perceptions. The results underscore a mandate for the financial services industry to improve the delivery of advice and enhance the digital experience to better engage the next generation of investors.</p>
<p><img alt="Chart from the VISTA study " class="alignnone size-full wp-image-936850" height="201" src="https://www.sifma.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SIFMA-and-KPMG-Investor-Survey-chart.jpg" width="856" /></p>
<p><em>Source: The Future of Advice: Why Combining Trust and Technology is Key to Attracting New Generations of Investors</em></p>
<p>Younger investors are increasingly self-directed, demanding more transparency and digital-first experiences. Gen Z is the only generation where satisfaction (77%) and trust (64%) are higher with self-directed models than with advisor-supported ones (72% satisfaction, 63% trust), signaling a fundamental shift in expectations. While Boomers prioritize returns and performance above all else, Gen Z places over four times greater emphasis on transparency and seven times greater emphasis on digital capabilities than Boomers. This digital focus also drives loyalty: Gen Z is 2.5 times less likely than Gen X and 4 times less likely than Boomers to remain with their provider when better digital options are available, and nearly twice as likely as Gen X and seven times as likely as Boomers to switch providers for improved technology. The study also highlights opportunities for hybrid models that combine advisor support with self-direction, which emerge as the most effective approach to meeting evolving investor needs.</p>
<p><img alt="Gen divide chart from the VISTA study " class="alignnone size-full wp-image-936851" height="184" src="https://www.sifma.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SIFMA-and-KPMG-Investor-Survey-chart-2.jpg" width="879" /></p>
<p><em>Source: The Future of Advice: Why Combining Trust and Technology is Key to Attracting New Generations of Investors</em></p>
<p>Financial advice remains central to investor satisfaction and trust, but the results reveal that communication, delivery, and product offerings must adapt to better appeal to younger generations: advice must be available in the ways investors want to receive it. The future of advice will depend on the industry&rsquo;s ability to deliver stronger digital capabilities across all models and seamlessly integrate technologies to meet the expectations of the next generations of investors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These results show a healthy baseline of investor confidence, and they also deliver a clear mandate,&rdquo; said Ronald J. Kruszewski, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Stifel and Incoming 2026 Chair of the SIFMA Board of Directors. &ldquo;Advisors remain the foundation of trust for millions of investors, but the next generation is asking for more transparency and better digital experiences. SIFMA will use this survey as a benchmark to help the industry bridge the generational gap, improve digital offerings, and build trust across every generation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The VISTA survey provides valuable insights on how investors view our industry,&rdquo; said Kenneth E. Bentsen, Jr., President and CEO of SIFMA. &ldquo;While satisfaction and trust remain high, the results highlight the importance of transparency and accountability in sustaining confidence in the capital markets. As the leading voice of U.S. broker-dealers, investment banks, and asset managers, SIFMA is committed to ensuring our markets remain effective, resilient, and responsive to the needs of investors across generations and asset classes.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Canadian Securities Administrators Clarifies Requirements For Delivering Proxy-Related Materials During Canada Post Labour Dispute</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) is clarifying requirements for delivering proxy-related materials for shareholder meetings during the ongoing labour dispute between Canada Post and the Canadian Union of Postal Workers (CUPW) since CUPW has since moved from a full, nationwide postal strike to rotating strikes.</p>
<p>On October&nbsp;9, 2025, the CSA issued&nbsp;<a class="is-external file-link-simple " href="https://lautorite.qc.ca/fileadmin/lautorite/reglementation/valeurs-mobilieres/0-avis-acvm-staff/2025/2025oct09-51-932-avis-acvm-en.pdf" target="_blank"><span class="file-size">Coordinated Blanket Order&nbsp;51-932&nbsp;<em>Temporary Exemption from requirements in National Instrument&nbsp;51-102 Continuous Disclosure Obligations and National Instrument&nbsp;54-101 Communication with Beneficial Owners of Securities of a Reporting Issuer to send certain proxy-related materials during a postal suspension</em><small>(pdf - 273&nbsp;KB)</small><span class="icon-wrapper external-wrapper typo3-search-exclude"><img class="external" height="10" src="https://lautorite.qc.ca/_assets/15455a295007cc3dbd3b05fc717f7674/Assets/svg/originals/external.svg" width="10" /></span><span class="visuallyhidden typo3-search-exclude">This link will open in a new window</span></span></a>.</p>
<p>The blanket order provides temporary relief from requirements to deliver proxy-related materials for shareholder meetings to consider &lsquo;&lsquo;annual matters&rsquo;&rsquo; during a complete suspension of all postal service in Canada. It is a condition of the relief that commercial volumes are not being accepted by Canada Post.</p>
<p>Since Canada Post has resumed mail deliveries and is now accepting commercial volumes, the relief in the blanket order is no longer available and relief from delivery requirements in securities legislation in connection with the postal strike is no longer required. In the event of an escalation in labour action resulting in another complete suspension of postal service in Canada, the CSA will provide further information.</p>
<p>Reporting issuers or shareholders who have questions should contact their&nbsp;<a class="is-external" href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/about/contact-us/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">local securities regulator&nbsp;<span class="icon-wrapper external-wrapper typo3-search-exclude"><img class="external" height="10" src="https://lautorite.qc.ca/_assets/15455a295007cc3dbd3b05fc717f7674/Assets/svg/originals/external.svg" width="10" /></span><span class="visuallyhidden typo3-search-exclude">This link will open in a new window</span></a>.</p>
<p>The CSA, the council of the securities regulators of Canada&rsquo;s provinces and territories, co-ordinates and harmonizes regulation for the Canadian capital markets.</p>

<title>ISDA And Tokenovate Launch Taskforce To Develop Smart Contract Framework Within The CDM</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-and-tokenovate-launch-taskforce-to-develop-smart-contract-framework-within-20251021/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-and-tokenovate-launch-taskforce-to-develop-smart-contract-framework-within-20251021/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ISDA and Tokenovate have today announced the establishment of a new taskforce within the Fintech Open Source Foundation (FINOS) to accelerate operationalization of the Common Domain Model (CDM).</p>
<p>The initiative responds to growing market demand for standardized, interoperable post-trade processing and will deliver an open-source, production-ready library of CDM functions and workflows, freely available to market participants.</p>
<p>The taskforce&rsquo;s initial focus will be the automation of interest rate resets, referencing the 2021 ISDA Interest Rate Derivatives Definitions. This process underpins trillions of dollars of financial contracts globally but remains largely manual and inconsistent across firms. The shift to risk-free reference rates has made this challenge more acute. These benchmarks, introduced to replace legacy interbank offered rates, require daily rate observations, business-day adjustments and compounding calculations that demand precision and consistency. Automating this process through the CDM represents a major step toward real-time, programmable post-trade infrastructure.</p>
<p>Built in alignment with concepts set out in an ISDA whitepaper,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2018/10/03/smart-derivatives-contracts-from-concept-to-construction/"><em>Smart Derivatives Contracts: From Concept to Construction</em></a>, the taskforce is building a smart contract model within the CDM to translate ISDA&rsquo;s legal and operational standards into executable form. The CDM already provides a canonical representation of the contract layer, defining standardized product terms, calculation conventions and event structures. The smart contract model extends this framework by introducing the executable logic that will power the automation of derivatives products, in line with ISDA&rsquo;s foundational legal and operational standards.</p>
<p>Designed to be technology-agnostic, the initiative delivers immediate operational and strategic benefits by eliminating interpretative differences and reconciliation breaks, enabling deterministic, auditable execution and promoting interoperability with digital infrastructure, tokenization and artificial-intelligence-driven solutions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;ISDA is committed to promoting greater standardization and efficiency in derivatives markets. By embedding the CDM into executable smart contract logic, we are taking a significant step toward fully digitized, interoperable post-trade processes. Our collaboration with Tokenovate and the FINOS community will help ensure that ISDA&rsquo;s legal and operational standards are not just documented, but operationalized &mdash; enabling real-time automation and reducing friction across global derivatives markets,&rdquo; said Olivier Miart, Co-head of Digital Transformation at ISDA.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For more than 40 years, ISDA has set the standards that underpin the global derivatives market. During my time at ISDA, I was fortunate to contribute to that journey, from early work on smart derivatives contracts to the development of the CDM. This collaboration marks the next stage in that evolution: moving from conceptual design to reality. Embedding ISDA&rsquo;s legal and operational standards directly into code establishes a common foundation for automation, interoperability and innovation across the market. Tokenovate is proud to work with ISDA to help bring that vision to life,&rdquo; said Ciar&aacute;n McGonagle, Chief Legal &amp; Product Officer at Tokenovate.</p>
<p>The CDM is an open, standardized representation of trade events, processes and data structures for derivatives and other financial products. Developed under the FINOS open-source governance framework, the CDM provides a single, consistent foundation for trade lifecycle automation, regulatory reporting and interoperability across institutions and infrastructures.

<h2>Speech</h2>
<h3><span>Introduction</span></h3>
<p>I am excited to join you today at the Bank of England and Bank for International Settlements Innovation Hub&rsquo;s DLT Innovation Challenge (The Innovation Challenge) showcase event. This event is more than a celebration of ideas. It is an opportunity to engage with the technologists building distributed ledgers and to explore how central bank money can be represented on external, blockchain-based systems. The Innovation Challenge is part of our broader programme of engagement and experimentation as we explore how to benefit from the critical role of central bank money in wholesale settlement in the future.</p>
<p>Today, I would like to outline how we are thinking about that future, with safer, faster and more innovative central bank money at its heart. And I am delighted to announce a new step in that journey: the launch of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/payment-and-settlement/rtgs-future-roadmap/synchro-lab">Synchronisation Lab</a>, a space designed to help industry explore the wider potential of central bank money.</p>
<p>The Innovation Challenge was designed to build a practical understanding of DLT capabilities, inform future wholesale experimentation, and strengthen the Bank&rsquo;s understanding of unified ledgers. Since blockchains first came to our attention with the launch of cryptocurrencies, there has been continuing development and evolution in distributed ledger technology, including increasing applications in more traditional financial markets.</p>
<p>Over the course of four weeks beginning in September 2025, we invited nine firms to engage with the broad question of how wholesale central bank money could be transacted and settled on an external programmable ledger which the Bank does not control, and where trust is not inherent. Through a series of weekly deep dives participants shared valuable insights on settlement finality and security, scalability, network and asset control, and interoperability.</p>
<p>Through this engagement, we have built a clearer picture of the technical and policy considerations of representing wholesale central bank money in blockchain based technologies. This is helping us identify the conditions under which they could meet the Bank&rsquo;s standards and risk principles, and what policy considerations may emerge as adoption increases. The wide benefit of this work is a testament to the value of a strong public and private partnership.</p>
<h3><span>Why wholesale settlement matters</span></h3>
<p>Wholesale payments are the lifeblood of financial markets. They support investment, liquidity, and economic growth. The Bank plays many roles in wholesale payments, as a supervisor, policymaker, operator and participant. Today I will focus on one that is foundational: our role as operator of wholesale payment infrastructure and orchestrator and convener of the innovation agenda.</p>
<p><span>RTGS and the infrastructure for innovation</span></p>
<p>We operate the trusted, resilient platforms that underpin the UK&rsquo;s financial system: the Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) service and the CHAPS payment system. Our renewed RTGS service (RT2) was launched in April 2025, delivering higher resilience, broader access, wider interoperability, and improved user functionality. RT2 is not just a system upgrade&mdash;it is a launchpad for future innovation where the private sector can build the next generation of payment services. So we want to build on this strong foundation, to enhance functionality and ensure our wholesale settlement infrastructure can continue to evolve to meet the changing needs of industry.</p>
<h3><span>Exploring new settlement models</span></h3>
<p>Central bank reserves are the ultimate risk-free settlement asset, underpinning many other forms of money such as the deposits individuals or businesses hold at commercial banks. This makes central bank reserves an essential anchor for the stability of the wider financial system.</p>
<p>We recognise that enabling innovation in payments is essential to support new business models and improve outcomes across the financial system and the economy as a whole. The importance of competition and innovation in this space was a key driver of our decision to expand direct access to RTGS, allowing a broader range of firms to settle in central bank money, unlocking new business models, improving outcomes for end users, and supporting competition.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, our vision is for a multi-money ecosystem, where different forms of money&mdash; including central bank money, commercial bank money, tokenised deposits, stablecoins&mdash;can coexist and interoperate. These different forms of money must also interact with a wide range of assets, whether they are represented in conventional ledgers, or in a tokenised format. For central bank money to remain at the core of this evolving landscape, it must be secure, accessible and interoperable: supporting smooth movement across different forms of money and assets, and enabling innovation across the financial system.</p>
<p>To support asset side innovation, we have, with the FCA, introduced a Digital Securities Sandbox which creates an environment for firms to facilitate the issuance, trading and settlement of digital securities in the UK, on distributed programmable ledgers. On the cash side, we have launched a programme of wholesale experiments where we are testing different approaches to facilitate a more seamless interaction between various assets and types of money. We believe that linking today&rsquo;s existing systems with emerging new innovative platforms through synchronisation and our omnibus accounts will significantly enhance settlement. We also want to explore whether a new infrastructure, potentially underpinned by a wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency (wCBDC), would provide additional flexibility and resilience that would be desirable to participants.</p>
<p>Our experiments aim to understand how each settlement approach addresses critical topics such as liquidity fragmentation, efficiency, programmability, and interoperability. Our goal is to build an evidence base for a report towards the end of next year and highlight key learnings. Ahead of this we will shortly publish a paper outlining how synchronisation can support tokenised securities settlement and programmability use cases.</p>
<h3><span>DLT Innovation Challenge</span></h3>
<p>The Innovation Challenge, together with projects such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/about/bisih/topics/fmis/agora.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Agor&aacute;<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external">&nbsp;</span></a>, in which the Bank is participating, are focused on exploring the design and development of new ledger infrastructures. Together these initiatives help us understand how future financial systems might operate on these ledgers, and how central bank money can be used safely while represented on external platforms which the Bank does not control.</p>
<p>During the Innovation Challenge we have seen examples of the industry considering questions around settlement finality through &lsquo;consensus mechanism&rsquo; design. We have seen how these systems could scale to meet the demands of wholesale payments, while safeguarding the integrity of central bank money as a foundation of trust and stability. We have gained insights into how programmability could facilitate automation, and how cryptographic tools could ensure privacy and trust in these systems. And importantly, the Innovation Challenge has shown methods by which these new systems can interoperate with existing and new ledgers including through bridges and synchronisation tools. By linking new platforms with existing systems, synchronisation offers a practical route to interoperability, which would enable the Bank to support innovation securely and efficiently.</p>
<p>This work has sharpened our understanding of developments in DLT, and highlighted several areas where further experimenting could be valuable in understanding the limits and benefits of its broader application.</p>
<h3>Synchronisation</h3>
<p>We are already developing a synchronisation capability for RT2. This would enable transactions to settle conditionally upon the movement of assets on external ledgers &ndash; achieving atomic settlement. How would this work?</p>
<p>A new type of entity, a synchronisation operator, would coordinate this process, connecting RT2 to an asset ledger. This would enable RT2 to support real-time settlement for various use cases, from FX settlement to property transactions and much in between. By enabling industry to settle atomically in central bank money potentially across multiple different ledgers, it mitigates risks of partial or incomplete transactions, and eliminates the need for escrow-like arrangements. All of this enhances efficiencies, opens the door to greater innovation in financial markets, and ensures central bank money can interoperate with, and bring risk reduction benefits to, many ledgers.</p>
<p>Through our Meridian experiments (<a href="https://www.bis.org/about/bisih/topics/fmis/meridian.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Meridian<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/about/bisih/topics/fmis/meridian_fx.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Meridian FX<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external">&nbsp;</span></a>) with the BIS Innovation Hub London, we demonstrated that synchronisation can serve as a powerful bridge between existing RTGS infrastructure and emerging tokenised securities settlement solutions built on DLT. Through these experiments, we have also proven that it is technically feasible for synchronisation operators to connect to other ledgers, and orchestrate transactions across property, and foreign currencies. Crucially, this approach avoids the need to rebuild payment systems from the ground up &ndash; thereby offering a pragmatic and more cost-effective route to innovation.</p>
<p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/about/bisih/topics/fmis/meridian_fx.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Project Meridian FX<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external">&nbsp;</span></a>, we worked together with the BIS innovation Hub London, the European Central Bank, and three Eurosystem national central banks to explore how synchronisation could be used for FX transactions. This approach has the potential to work alongside existing and new settlement infrastructures, helping to address long-standing pain points in FX settlement. Looking ahead, we expect that the flexibility of synchronisation means it could be extended to other areas, for instance enabling more efficient mobilisation and substitution of collateral and enhanced liquidity management. All of which could help to reduce costs and support more resilient financial markets.</p>
<p>To advance our exploration of synchronised settlement, on 16 October 2025 we launched a call for applicants for the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/payment-and-settlement/rtgs-future-roadmap/synchro-lab">Synchronisation Lab</a>. This is a dedicated space for hands-on experimentation with promising use cases. The Lab provides a non-live testing environment where prospective synchronisation operators (&ldquo;Lab Participants&rdquo;) can explore how synchronised settlement might work in practice. Lab Participants will interact directly with the synchronisation capability we are designing. Ideally, they will also build on top of the Lab platform to demonstrate how their services might connect with users. By working with a simulated RT2 and showcasing more their end-to-end propositions, Lab Participants will help us validate our design choices, demonstrate the practical benefits of synchronisation to wider industry, and support ecosystem readiness for future implementation. This is an exciting step forward &ndash; one that harnesses the power of public-private collaboration to shape the future of settlement infrastructure.</p>
<p>We have been working closely with a wide range of industry participants throughout this journey, and the response has been overwhelmingly positive. There is strong demand for synchronisation functionality, with firms identifying a diverse set of use cases&mdash;from streamlining housing transactions and securities settlement to improving foreign exchange processes. Many see synchronisation as a way to reduce settlement risk, optimise liquidity, and unlock efficiencies across the transaction chain. Our recent engagement shows that established players and fintech innovators alike are eager to explore how synchronisation can transform their operations.</p>
<p>The Lab will go-live in Spring 2026 and will run for six months, providing a unique opportunity to explore the future of settlement infrastructure. Applications are open until 28 November 2025, and we welcome both public and private sector organisations interested in being a synchronisation operator to apply. This initiative offers a chance to engage with an emerging technology that could redefine how assets and payments move across systems. With your input, we can work together to shape how synchronised settlement looks like in practice. More details are available on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/payment-and-settlement/rtgs-future-roadmap/synchronisation-lab-terms-of-participation">Synchronisation Lab &ndash; terms of participation</a>.</p>
<h3><span>Conclusion</span></h3>
<p>As a central bank we want to enable innovation that delivers tangible benefits for households and businesses, while safeguarding the stability and integrity of our financial system.</p>
<p>Advancing wholesale settlement infrastructure means exploring how central bank money can serve the next era of payments. And that journey is not one we can take alone. Collaboration is key. We learn from and with each other. The Innovation Challenge and our upcoming Synchronisation Lab are powerful examples of that spirit. Thank you for your contributions.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been over two years since I was last here &ndash; this is the long-awaited sequel, if you will.</p>
<p>With the release of Wicked: For Good next month, it&rsquo;s the season of sequels.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s only right that mine happens now.</p>
<p>Much like you&rsquo;d expect in a sequel, the plot may change, but the through line remains.</p>
<p>And that through line is the importance of doing the right thing.</p>
<p>Last time I was here, I spoke of how doing the right thing isn&rsquo;t a slogan, but a standard.</p>
<p>Of how it should underpin every decision, response and relationship in the financial services sector &ndash; whether somebody is watching or not.</p>
<p>But especially when they&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>Those are the actions that shine a light on who we really are.</p>
<p>In many cases, the right thing is subjective.</p>
<p>But when it comes to the financial services sector, it&rsquo;s pretty cut and dried.</p>

<h2>What does doing the right thing look like?</h2>
<p>For firms, doing the right thing means holding yourselves to high standards.</p>
<p>Recognising when something has gone wrong, taking responsibility for it, and taking the necessary steps to fix things.</p>
<p>That includes paying redress to those you&rsquo;ve harmed.</p>
<p>Co-operating with the FCA to ensure it won&rsquo;t happen again.</p>
<p>And being open and honest with us, rather than trying to muddy the waters and keep us from doing our job.</p>
<p>Simply put, doing the right thing is about keeping your side of the street clean.</p>
<p>But we need to keep ours clean, too &ndash; and you can rest assured we&rsquo;re doing exactly that.</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-the-fca-s-approach-to-doing-the-right-thing" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>The FCA's approach to doing the right thing</h2>
<p>While we are taking a new approach to our enforcement cases, the through lines remain the same.</p>
<p>We are holding firms and ourselves to high standards and rewarding those who do the same.</p>
<p>We are conducting fewer investigations, faster.</p>
<p>When I was here in 2023, we had 220 open enforcement operations.</p>
<p>As of 1 October, we have 124.</p>
<p>But fewer investigations does not mean fewer outcomes.</p>
<p>In fact, we are delivering more.</p>
<p>We typically averaged between 20 and 25 enforcement outcomes per year.</p>
<p>In 2024, the number of enforcement outcomes was 41.</p>
<p>And in 2025, we expect to deliver over 30 enforcement outcomes.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s more to come. We&rsquo;re prosecuting more people for criminal offences than we have ever done.</p>
<p>And while some older cases need to be worked through, I can confidently say that investigations launched after April 2023 are being closed on much tighter timelines.</p>
<p>Seven recent investigations achieved a public outcome in 16 months or less, compared to a previous average of 42 months.</p>
<p>And fewer investigations are ending with no further action.</p>
<p>Historically less than a third of our enforcement operations ended with an FCA enforcement outcome. Today the majority do.</p>
<p>We are also prioritising redress for consumers who have suffered harm wherever we can.</p>
<p>In the last financial year, we secured over &pound;442 million for investors and consumers through redress schemes, settlements, and civil proceedings.</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-the-right-thing-in-practice" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>The right thing in practice</h2>
<p>Let me give you an example of what this looks like in practice.</p>
<p>In December 2024, we charged John Dance, WealthTek&rsquo;s principal partner, with 9 criminal offences including multiple counts of fraud and money laundering.</p>
<p>In April this year, we launched an investigation into Barclays for opening a client money account for WealthTek without doing two simple things.</p>
<p>Check that the firm was permitted by the FCA to hold client money &ndash; it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And understand how WealthTek would use the account.</p>
<p>Clients deposited &pound;34 million into the account, which should never have been opened in the first place.</p>
<p>We believe Dance helped himself to a chunk of that to fund his extravagant lifestyle &ndash; and Barclays&rsquo; lax controls allowed it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said publicly that if you provide banking for fraudsters, we will scrutinise those controls with care.</p>
<p>Taking enforcement action against Barclays was the right thing to do.</p>
<p>But Barclays did the right thing, too.</p>
<p>They chose to co-operate with us extensively, which helped us conclude our investigation within three months.</p>
<p>That kind of speed is good for the wider system and Barclays alike.</p>
<p>They avoided the cost and strain of a much longer investigation.</p>
<p>And, given the timing, we pragmatically agreed to combine publication of this outcome with another anti-money laundering case involving Barclays.</p>
<p>Which helped them manage the risks around having two enforcement outcomes published in quick succession.</p>
<p>Barclays also agreed to voluntarily pay &pound;6.3 million to WealthTek&rsquo;s clients, helping to reduce the shortfall they are currently facing.</p>
<p>As a result, we reduced the financial penalty we imposed on Barclays.</p>
<p>They ended up with a penalty of &pound;3 million, but it could easily have been twice that.</p>
<p>Sometimes doing the right thing can help you avoid a financial penalty altogether.</p>
<p>Our investigation into H2O found that the firm failed to carry out due diligence on investments; had few policies in place to manage potential conflicts of interest; and provided the FCA with false or misleading statements and documentation.</p>
<p>These are serious breaches, which would typically result in a substantial fine.</p>
<p>But H2O worked with us and agreed to make &euro;250 million available to anyone whose investments were trapped and apply to cancel its authorisation.</p>
<p>So, we chose to forego a fine.</p>
<p>When firms do the right thing, we take notice &ndash; and they can benefit.</p>
<p>We took enforcement action against three firms last year in relation to their treatment of borrowers in financial difficulty.</p>
<p>The three firms operated voluntary redress schemes worth an estimated &pound;354 million.</p>
<p>We reduced the amount of our financial penalties for all three.</p>
<p>HSBC, for example, invested &pound;94 million in identifying and remedying issues with their treatment of customers, and paid redress of &pound;185 million to over 1.5 million of them.</p>
<p>We reduced their penalty by more than half.</p>
<p>If you do the right thing &ndash; cooperate with us, take responsibility, and put things right for consumers &ndash; we will do the right thing too by reducing the penalty we impose.</p>
<p>But firms don&rsquo;t need to wait until we open an enforcement investigation to do the right thing.</p>
<p>We use our supervisory powers in a way that offers firms a chance to do the right thing well before an investigation is opened.</p>
<p>If you take responsibility and resolve an issue early, you can avoid skilled persons reports, formal requirements, and enforcement referrals.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve likely seen coverage of our motor insurance compensation scheme &ndash; which is a direct result of our supervisory work.</p>
<p>In 2022, we warned insurers not to undervalue cars when settling claims.</p>
<p>In 2023, we published a Voluntary Requirement, requiring Direct Line Group to review five years of claims outcomes and pay redress as needed.</p>
<p>And after an initial review last year, we found that some motor insurers had short-changed customers on claims.</p>
<p>An estimated 270,000 drivers are expected to receive &pound;200 million in compensation.</p>
<p>Of that, &pound;129 million has already been paid to nearly 150,000 customers.</p>
<p>Moreover, insurers re-evaluated their claims process and rewrote them in line with our Consumer Duty.</p>
<p>But there was no need for enforcement &ndash; because they&rsquo;re making it right by the consumers they wronged.</p>
<p>But if you don&rsquo;t put things right, we will act.</p>
<p>Starling had multiple chances to do just that.</p>
<p>First in 2021, when they agreed to restrict opening accounts for high-risk customers &ndash; but didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And again in 2023, when their automated screening system fell short and exposed issues within their financial sanctions framework.</p>
<p>After a 14-month investigation, we imposed a &pound;28 million fine.</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-digging-in-when-necessary" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Digging in when necessary</h2>
<p>I have said that the FCA would be pragmatic in its approach.</p>
<p>But I also promised to pursue investigations when it&rsquo;s the right thing to do.</p>
<p>And when we dig in, we stay dug in until the bitter end.</p>
<p>A case recently reached its conclusion after more than a decade.</p>
<p>In 2008, Barclays entered into two advisory agreements with Qatari entities that involved payment to the entities in return for their participation in capital raisings.</p>
<p>But Barclays only disclosed one of the agreements to shareholders.</p>
<p>And they didn&rsquo;t disclose the payments under the capital raisings or the connection to the Qatari entities&rsquo; participation in them.</p>
<p>That decision was reckless, lacked integrity, and went against Barclays&rsquo; obligations to treat the market and their shareholders seriously.</p>
<p>We first issued a warning notice in 2013.</p>
<p>The case was then paused until 2022, when we published our decision to fine Barclays &pound;50 million.</p>
<p>Barclays chose to refer the case to the Upper Tribunal, before withdrawing the referral in 2024.</p>
<p>It took years, but the conclusion was a welcome one. In the end, we fined Barclays &pound;40 million.</p>
<p>That dedication doesn&rsquo;t stop with banks.</p>
<p>We stay dug in when it comes to insider dealing, too.</p>
<p>We must &ndash; these are some of our toughest, hardest-fought investigations.</p>
<p>Building a case is painstaking. It involves piecing together trading, communications, and banking data.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also up against criminals who get creative with the reasons for their trading.</p>
<p>Moving a case through the system can take years, and a trial can take months.</p>
<p>But we commit to each one to keep our markets clean.</p>
<p>This year alone, we have convicted four individuals for insider dealing.</p>
<p>This includes the Korfuzi siblings, Redinel and Oerta.</p>
<p>As a research analyst at Janus Henderson, Mr Korfuzi had access to sensitive information and saw an opportunity.</p>
<p>In less than two years, the Korfuzis traded 13 stocks and made a profit of &pound;960,000.</p>
<p>But we saw an opportunity, too.</p>
<p>After noticing suspicious trading patterns, we analysed large sets of data to uncover the crime.</p>
<p>In March 2021, the Korfuzis were arrested in a search operation in partnership with the Met Police &ndash; a reminder that we&rsquo;re not the only ones watching.</p>
<p>After an 18-week trial at Southwark Crown Court, in which they pleaded not guilty, they were sentenced to a combined 11 years in prison.</p>
<p>Unlike the Korfuzis, another pair of siblings &ndash; Matthew and Nikolas West &ndash; did plead guilty to six instances of insider dealing.</p>
<p>At just under &pound;43,000 total, their profits were significantly less than the Korfuzis&rsquo;.</p>
<p>But their crimes were no less serious.</p>
<p>Because as professional investors, they knew what they were doing was wrong.</p>
<p>And we refuse to let financial criminals like the Wests undermine our markets&rsquo; integrity.</p>
<p>While both brothers received a suspended sentence, their decision to plead guilty reflects the quality of our investigation and the strength of the case we had against them.</p>
<p>Because, as I said, we stay dug in. And this includes making sure that crime doesn&rsquo;t pay.</p>
<p>Mohammad Zina used inside information about potential mergers and acquisition to his benefit.</p>
<p>In February 2023, he was convicted of all 9 offences and sentenced to 22 months&rsquo; imprisonment.</p>
<p>But our action didn&rsquo;t end there.</p>
<p>We refuse to allow criminals to keep any part of their illicit profits.</p>
<p>Which is why, in January of this year, we took further action against him and confiscated over &pound;586,000 &ndash; all of his assets.</p>

<h2>We&rsquo;re seeing new risks, but we have the same resolve</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/olumide-osunkoya-sentenced-4-years-illegally-operating-crypto-atm-network">said it before</a>&nbsp;and will say it again.</p>
<p>If you flout our rules, try to avoid getting caught, and engage in criminal activity, you will pay the price.</p>
<p>As the world changes, so does the type of financial crime we&rsquo;re up against.</p>
<p>We have long said that consumers who buy crypto should be prepared to lose their money.</p>
<p>Because crypto is uncharted territory: high risk and largely unregulated, with some players who don&rsquo;t care about doing the right thing.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, we secured the UK&rsquo;s first criminal sentence for unregistered crypto activity.</p>
<p>Despite being refused registration with the FCA, Olumide Osunkoya owned and operated a network of nearly 30 crypto ATMs.</p>
<p>Not only did he fail to carry out the checks necessary to ensure criminals weren&rsquo;t using the ATMs to launder the proceeds of their crime.</p>
<p>High markups also ensured he made a profit from each transaction.</p>
<p>Like the West brothers, Mr Osunkoya knew what he was doing was wrong.</p>
<p>But he decided to avoid the glare of our spotlight by operating some of the ATMs under a false name and company.</p>
<p>In the end, Mr Osunkoya was sentenced to four years in prison.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not all we&rsquo;re doing in the cryptoasset realm.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/seven-crypto-atms-seized-two-arrested-suspicion-illegal-cryptoasset-exchange">In July this year,</a>&nbsp;as part of an operation led by the FCA and the Metropolitan Police, four Southwest London premises were searched, and we found and seized seven crypto ATMs.</p>
<p>Two people were arrested on suspicion of money laundering and running an illegal cryptoasset exchange.</p>
<p>That investigation is ongoing.</p>
<p>That same month, we announced that two people were sentenced to a combined 12 years in prison for cold-calling victims and selling fake crypto investments.</p>
<p>They defrauded at least 65 investors and stole over &pound;1.5 million of their hard-earned money.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/two-arrests-connected-suspected-illegal-cryptoasset-business" target="_blank">And in July last year</a>, we announced that the FCA and Metropolitan Police arrested two people suspected of running an illegal crypto asset exchange.</p>
<p>While the investigation is ongoing, we believe over &pound;1 billion of unregistered crypto assets were bought and sold through this business.</p>
<p>Finally, we fined CB Payments Limited, part of Coinbase Group, over &pound;3.5 million for repeatedly breaching a requirement preventing the firm from offering crypto asset trading services to high-risk customers.</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-work-with-us-or-against-us-it-s-up-to-you" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Work with us, or against us &ndash; it&rsquo;s up to you</h2>
<p>At the end of the day, firms have two choices.</p>
<p>To work with the FCA.</p>
<p>Or against us.</p>
<p>Whatever you choose, just know: we will be there regardless.</p>
<p>Now, I want to make it clear that we are always fair. Including when firms behave poorly.</p>
<p>But there are prizes for firms that choose to behave well.</p>
<p>If you choose to do the right thing from the jump, you&rsquo;ll have nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>For example, you wouldn&rsquo;t need to worry about a cooperation credit to reduce a penalty &ndash; because we wouldn&rsquo;t take enforcement action in the first place.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spoken a lot about our public outcomes today, many of which have made headlines.</p>
<p>But there is a lot of private disruption work going on behind closed doors &ndash; and we&rsquo;re more active than you might think.</p>
<p>We frequently get in touch with firms and individuals to let them know we&rsquo;re on their case. We ask them to explain and, where concerns remain, do the right thing.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to receive one of those calls or letters.</p>
<p>But if you do, the same expectation applies: be open with us, take responsibility, and do the right thing.</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-conclusion" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Most firms choose to follow the through line.</p>
<p>To do the right thing and work with us rather than against us.</p>
<p>Those are the ones that reap the benefits.</p>
<p>Now, we aren&rsquo;t the all-knowing Wizard from Oz, and we may not get it right every time.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s right that firms can challenge us and escalate our enforcement decisions.</p>
<p>But we will dig in and back our findings when it is the right thing to do.</p>
<p>The question I&rsquo;d like to leave you with is this: What&rsquo;s the risk equation of not doing the right thing?</p>
<p>As I mentioned last month at AFME, compliance comes with costs.</p>
<p>But good compliance can save money.</p>
<p>And not doing the right thing is far more expensive.</p>
<p>Over the past year, we&rsquo;ve found that 'doing the right thing' is more than ethical rhetoric.</p>
<p>It leads to better outcomes for consumers; healthier markets; and clearer, stronger enforcement.</p>
<p>But it also shows that this kind of standard demands work, integrity, and constant attention.</p>
<p>With this in mind, let us carry the through line of doing the right thing forward together as firms, individuals, and regulators.</p>
<p>So that when failures happen, they are addressed swiftly; when harm occurs, it is remedied fully; and misconduct is prevented as early as possible.</p>

<title>Embracing New Technologies And Players In Payments, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher J. Waller, At The Payments Innovation Conference, Federal Reserve Board, Washington, D.C.</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. It is my pleasure to welcome you to the Federal Reserve Board for our first Payments Innovation Conference.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20251021a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;My objective in creating this conference is twofold. First, I wanted to have a conference that focused on the new technologies that have come from the defi and crypto worlds and how they are entering the mainstream payments ecosystem. My goal is to have a vibrant discussion about payments between the traditional payment incumbents and the new entrants from the defi world. Second, I wanted to send a message that this is a new era for the Federal Reserve in payments&mdash;the defi industry is not viewed with suspicion or scorn. Rather, today, you are welcomed to the conversation on the future of payments in the United States and on our home field&mdash;something that would have been unimaginable a few years ago.</p>
<p>As you all know, we are well into a technology-driven revolution in payments, and I am here to say that the Federal Reserve intends to be an active part of that revolution.</p>
<p>A number of technological advances are transforming the payment system. Stablecoins and tokenized assets making use of distributed ledger technology. The rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI). And, increasingly, the convergence between these innovations and the traditional financial ecosystem. This includes the institutions and infrastructure that our economy has long depended on to operate a safe and efficient payment system. And, yes, this also includes the Federal Reserve. The revolution transforming payments is demanding change everywhere, and I will say more in a moment about some new ideas that the Federal Reserve is studying to support these innovations.</p>
<p>I have spoken before about what I see as the two broad models of payments innovation in our market economy.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20251021a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;The first is private-sector-driven innovation. Most innovation comes from the private sector, which is motivated and best positioned to allocate resources and take risks to explore new technologies. The second model is when public-sector entities such as the Fed build platforms and provide services that enable the private sector to more readily and rapidly expand new services to its customers. This should be done rarely and in limited circumstances where it addresses a specific market need. The posture of public institutions, including the Federal Reserve, should be to acknowledge and embrace private-sector innovation that can improve the payment system while preserving its safety and stability, which are as essential to the new generation of innovators as they are to legacy institutions.</p>
<p>Let me pull back a moment and remind everyone how we got here. Since nearly its founding, the Federal Reserve System has worked to facilitate payment and settlement system efficiency alongside the private sector. From the beginning, the clearing services provided by Reserve Banks obviated the need for daily movements of cash in armored cars with heavily armed guards. Long before we started speaking of the "payment rails" that are facilitating the kind of innovation we will be discussing today, the Fed was running trains on steel rails to deliver and clear paper checks traveling across the country. Fedwire began conducting interbank transfers through telegraph wires in the early 20th century. Fast forward to today, where we have multiple infrastructures that settle interbank transfers in real time.</p>
<p>Today's conference will focus on private-sector-driven innovation. We have assembled 100 private-sector innovators who are leveraging cutting-edge technology to create new possibilities in the payments landscape. Our panelists are engaged in integrating traditional financial payment rails with distributed ledgers, developing new products and services in the digital asset ecosystem, and leveraging AI in the payments landscape.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that the firms engaged in these activities include banks, asset managers, retail payments firms, technology companies, as well as crypto-native fintechs. This is an acknowledgement that distributed ledgers and crypto-assets are no longer on the fringes but increasingly are woven into the fabric of the payment and financial systems.</p>
<p>Before we hear from these innovators, I would like to touch on the roles that the Federal Reserve plays to support the private sector. These include serving as a convener to solve coordination problems and operating core payment and settlement infrastructure. We are also looking ahead, conducting hands-on research on tokenization, smart contracts, and the intersection of AI and payments for use in our own payment systems. We do this to understand the innovation happening within the payment system as well as to evaluate whether these technologies could provide opportunities to upgrade our own payment infrastructures and to enable us to have deeper conversations with the industry on these new technologies.</p>
<p>While this is a good start, I believe we can and should do more to support those actively transforming the payment system. To that end, I have asked Federal Reserve staff to explore the idea of what I am calling a "payment account." Today, Federal Reserve Banks provide access to master accounts and financial services to legally eligible entities following our Guidelines for Evaluating Account and Services Requests. The payment account would be available to all institutions that are legally eligible for an account and could be beneficial for those focused primarily on payments innovations.</p>
<p>This payment account concept would be targeted to provide basic Federal Reserve payment services to legally eligible institutions that right now conduct payment services primarily through a third-party bank that has a full-fledged master account. There are many eligible firms engaged in substantial payments activities that may not want or need all the bells and whistles of a master account, or access to the full suite of Federal Reserve financial services, to successfully innovate and provide services to their customers. The idea is to tailor the services of these new accounts to the needs of these firms and the risks they present to the Federal Reserve Banks and the payment system. Accordingly, and importantly, these lower-risk payment accounts would have a streamlined timeline for review. Payments innovation moves fast, and the Federal Reserve needs to keep up.</p>
<p>To be more concrete, let me describe a possible prototype for this type of payment account or, as I sometimes call it, a "skinny" master account. The account would provide access to the Federal Reserve payment rails while controlling for various risks to the Federal Reserve and the payment system. To control the size of the accounts and associated impacts on the Fed's balance sheet, the Reserve Banks would not pay interest on balances in a payment account, and balance caps may be imposed. These accounts would not have daylight overdraft privileges&mdash;if the balance hits zero, payments will be rejected. They would not be eligible for discount window borrowing or have access to all Federal Reserve payment services for which the Reserve Banks cannot control the risk of daylight overdrafts. I want to be clear that this is just a prototype idea to provide some clarity on how things could change. The upshot is that, in my view, the payments landscape, as well as the types of providers, has evolved dramatically in recent years, and, accordingly, a new payments account could better reflect this new reality.</p>
<p>As Federal Reserve staff examine this idea, we will engage with all interested stakeholders to hear perspectives on the benefits and drawbacks to this approach. You will be hearing more about this shortly.</p>
<p>Let me wrap up here so we can get to the really exciting part of this conference, which is about innovation and the future of payments. Thank you to the panelists who took the time to participate, those in the audience who agreed to be here, and the many others watching online. And a special thanks to Fed staff, who moved very fast to get this together quickly to fit into a very busy fall at the Fed. On with the conference!</p>

<p><span><span class="xn-person">Adena Friedman</span>, Chair and CEO,&nbsp;</span>said, &ldquo;Nasdaq achieved significant milestones in the third quarter, with Solutions quarterly revenue surpassing&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$1 billion</span>&nbsp;and annual recurring revenues reaching&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$3 billion</span>&nbsp;for the first time. This achievement reflects our successful transformation into a leading technology platform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Across our diversified platform, we continue to deepen our competitive advantage, delivering advanced solutions that help clients innovate, modernize their systems, and underpin trust in the global economy.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span><span class="xn-person">Sarah Youngwood</span>, Executive Vice President and CFO,&nbsp;</span>said, &ldquo;Nasdaq delivered an excellent third quarter performance with revenue growth across all three divisions driving robust earnings growth and generating more than&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$2 billion</span>&nbsp;in operating cash flow over the previous four quarters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We achieved our gross leverage milestone ahead of schedule, are executing share repurchases, and we remain focused on organic investments that will drive long-term revenue growth and shareholder value.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>FINANCIAL REVIEW</span></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Third quarter 2025 net revenue was&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$1.3 billion</span>, reflecting 15% growth versus the prior year period. Organic net revenue growth was 11%.</li>
<li>Solutions revenue was&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$1.0 billion</span>&nbsp;in the third quarter of 2025, up 15% versus the prior year period, or 10% on an organic basis, reflecting strong growth from Financial Technology and Index.</li>
<li>ARR was&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$3.0 billion</span>&nbsp;in the third quarter of 2025, reflecting 10% growth versus the prior year period, or 9% on an organic basis. Financial Technology ARR growth was 12% both on a reported and on an organic basis, and Capital Access Platforms ARR growth was 7%, or 6% on an organic basis.</li>
<li>Market Services net revenue was&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$303 million</span>&nbsp;in the third quarter of 2025, up 14% versus the prior year period, or 13% on an organic basis.</li>
<li>Third quarter 2025 GAAP operating expenses were&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$729 million</span>, an increase of 4% versus the prior year period. The increase in the third quarter was primarily due to higher compensation and benefits costs and increased investments in technology and people to drive innovation and long-term growth, partially offset by lower restructuring costs.</li>
<li>Third quarter 2025 non-GAAP operating expenses were&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$583 million</span>, an increase of 5% on an organic basis. The organic increase for the quarter reflected growth driven by increased investments in technology and people to drive innovation and long-term growth and employee compensation.</li>
<li>Cash flow from operations was&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$221 million</span>&nbsp;for the third quarter. In the third quarter of 2025, Nasdaq returned&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$155 million</span>&nbsp;to shareholders through dividends, repurchased&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$115 million</span>&nbsp;of common stock, and repurchased&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$69 million</span>&nbsp;of senior unsecured notes. As of&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">September&nbsp;30, 2025</span>, there was&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$1.4 billion</span>&nbsp;remaining under the board authorized share repurchase program.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><span>2025 EXPENSE AND TAX GUIDANCE UPDATE6</span></p>
<ul>
<li>The company is updating its 2025 non-GAAP operating expense guidance to a range of&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$2,305 million</span>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$2,335 million</span>&nbsp;from the previous range of&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$2,295 million</span>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$2,335 million</span>. The company is updating its 2025 non-GAAP tax rate guidance by lowering the range to 22.5% to 23.5% due to certain discrete items that lowered the tax rate in the third quarter.</li>
</ul>

<p>____________________</p>
<p>1 Represents revenue less transaction-based expenses. 2 Adjusted and organic change for 3Q25 as compared to 3Q24 are equivalent as they include the same period over period adjustments. These changes are calculated by removing the impact of (i) foreign currency (ii) a divestiture and (iii) the AxiomSL accounting change implemented in 3Q24 to recognize on-premises contracts ratably which included a&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$34 million</span>&nbsp;non-GAAP revenue adjustment in 3Q24 and an offsetting&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$2 million</span>&nbsp;adjustment to organic results. As it relates to ARR, organic changes only exclude the impacts of period over period changes in foreign currency exchange rates and a divestiture as the AxiomSL ratable recognition adjustment had no impact on ARR. Adjusted operating results also exclude the impact of the previously announced one-time revenue benefit in our Index business in 1Q24 (<span class="xn-money">$16 million</span>), which did not have an impact on our 3Q25 period over period change but does have an impact on year to date period over period results.3 Constitutes revenue from our Capital Access Platforms and Financial Technology segments.4 Annualized&nbsp;Recurring&nbsp;Revenue&nbsp;(ARR) for a given period is the current annualized value derived from subscription contracts with a defined contract value. This excludes contracts that are not recurring, are one-time in nature or where the contract value fluctuates based on defined metrics. ARR is currently one of our key performance metrics to assess the health and trajectory of our recurring business. ARR does not have any standardized definition and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue and is not intended to be combined with or to replace either of those items. For AxiomSL and Calypso recurring revenue contracts, the amount included in ARR is consistent with the amount that we invoice the customer during the current period. Additionally, for AxiomSL and Calypso recurring revenue contracts that include annual values that increase over time, we include in ARR only the annualized value of components of the contract that are considered active as of the date of the ARR calculation. We do not include the future committed increases in the contract value as of the date of the ARR calculation. ARR is not a forecast and the active contracts at the end of a reporting period used in calculating ARR may or may not be extended or renewed by our customers.5 Refer to our reconciliations of&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">U.S.</span>&nbsp;GAAP to non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq, diluted earnings per share, operating income, operating expenses and organic impacts included in the attached schedules.6&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">U.S.</span>&nbsp;GAAP operating expense and tax rate guidance are not provided due to the inherent difficulty in quantifying certain amounts due to a variety of factors including the unpredictability in the movement in foreign currency rates, as well as future charges or reversals outside of the normal course of business.</p>

<td colspan="16">(1) Annualized&nbsp;Recurring&nbsp;Revenue&nbsp;(ARR) for a given period is the current annualized value derived from subscription contracts with a defined contract value. This excludes contracts that are not recurring, are one-time in nature, or where the contract value fluctuates based on defined metrics. ARR is currently one of our key performance metrics to assess the health and trajectory of our recurring business. ARR does not have any standardized definition and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue and is not intended to be combined with or to replace either of those items. For AxiomSL and Calypso recurring revenue contracts, the amount included in ARR is consistent with the amount that we invoice the customer during the current period. Additionally, for AxiomSL and Calypso recurring revenue contracts that include annual values that increase over time, we include in ARR only the annualized value of components of the contract that are considered active as of the date of the ARR calculation. We do not include the future committed increases in the contract value as of the date of the ARR calculation. ARR is not a forecast and the active contracts at the end of a reporting period used in calculating ARR may or may not be extended or renewed by our customers.</td>

<title>Puro.earth Integrates CCS+ Initiative Carbon Removal Methodologies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li><i>Integration of CCS+ Initiative methodology framework creates one trusted certification journey for suppliers and buyers</i> </li>
<li><i>Supports faster scale up of large infrastructure carbon removal projects, bringing a wider mix of suppliers and buyers into the market</i></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Helsinki &ndash; 21 October 2025 --</b>&nbsp;Puro.earth, the leading crediting platform for Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR), today announced the integration of CCS+ Initiative&rsquo;s CDR methodology framework including CO₂ capture from Bioenergy and Direct Air Capture with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS, DACCS) into its certification and issuance framework.</p>
<p>The move will enable suppliers to issue Puro CO₂ Removal Certificates (CORCs) or credits based on the CCS+ Initiative methodology framework within the Puro Registry. This creates a single-governed system that buyers can access through transparent, investment-grade market infrastructure.</p>
<p>Puro.earth&rsquo;s BECCS and DAC methodologies are market-leading, purpose built for durable carbon removal projects. Integration between Puro.earth and the CCS+ Initiative expands certification possibilities within Puro.earth&rsquo;s trusted framework, maintaining the same standards of rigor and integrity that define our approach. All methodologies used within the Puro.earth framework are verified according to the same independent validation and verification processes in the projects.</p>
<p>As the carbon removal market matures, suppliers need flexibility and simplicity. This integration enables them to prepare and manage projects under either Puro Standard methodology or CCS+ Initiative BECCS and DACCS&rsquo; methodologies through the newly upgraded MyPuro 2.0 platform.&nbsp; While ensuring no double counting, it removes duplication, and future-proofs projects for evolving buyer and compliance needs - particularly for large scale BECCS developers that require compatibility across voluntary and compliance markets.</p>
<p>For buyers, having greater choice within one trusted certification registry simplifies procurement while maintaining the same rigorous standards they&rsquo;ve come to trust. This is particularly relevant as many buyers seek alignment with requirements under the EU-regulated CRCF and the international requirements established under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>This integration marks another milestone in Puro.earth&rsquo;s role as the infrastructure backbone of the carbon removal market, connecting suppliers, buyers, and standards through a rigorous and transparent certification system. Building on the launch of MyPuro 2.0, the upgraded certification platform, it further enhances Puro.earth&rsquo;s ability to accelerate credit issuance, reduce time to revenue for suppliers, and deliver a faster, simpler, and more customer-centric experience to its global ecosystem.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To scale, the carbon removal market needs trusted infrastructure that offers flexibility without compromising on quality,&rdquo; said Jan-Willem Bode, President of Puro.earth. &ldquo;Through this integration with CCS+ Initiative, suppliers can use a single platform that supports certification under both Puro Standard CORCs or CCS+ Initiative methodology framework, while buyers gain simplicity and confidence at the point of purchase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of CCS+ Initiative&rsquo;s core missions is to reduce market fragmentation by delivering clear, interoperable MRV protocols for CCS carbon accounting, raising the bar on integrity so market participants can trust what a tonne removed really means. Developed as collaborative work involving close to 50 members under Verra VCS, the CCS+ Initiative methodology framework will now also be available under Puro.earth,&rdquo; added Pascal Siegwart, Co‑founder and Chairman of the CCS+ Initiative.</p>
<p>The integration highlights the growing alignment between leading carbon removal standards in building a coherent, high-integrity market. By combining rigorous methodologies with shared digital infrastructure, Puro.earth is creating the conditions for scale and choice - ensuring that removals are measured, verified, issued, and tracked transparently while meeting the expectations of both voluntary and compliance buyers.</p>
<p>The work also underlines Puro.earth&rsquo;s evolution beyond a single standard to a broader certification infrastructure supporting diverse methodologies and market choice for durable removals. Through the MyPuro 2.0 certification platform and the Puro Registry, Puro.earth continues to develop digital systems that provide efficiency for suppliers and integrity for the market.</p>

<title>ISDA Derivatives Trading Forum Sydney: Scott O’Malia, ISDA Chief Executive Officer, Opening Remarks</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-derivatives-trading-forum-sydney-scott-omalia-isda-chief-executive-offic-20251021/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-derivatives-trading-forum-sydney-scott-omalia-isda-chief-executive-offic-20251021/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good morning, and welcome to the Derivatives Trading Forum. It&rsquo;s great to be back in Sydney following our last trip back in August. I&rsquo;d like to thank AFMA for working with us again on this event &ndash; it&rsquo;s been a really productive relationship, so a big thank you to Brett and the team for all their support. I&rsquo;d also like to thank our sponsors, Kaizen, ASX and OSTTRA.</p>
<p>This has been a very special year for ISDA, as we celebrate our 40th anniversary. It&rsquo;s been an opportunity to reflect on ISDA&rsquo;s remarkable journey since 1985, when a small group of dealers got together to develop a common terminology for the swaps market. They recognized the need for greater consistency and efficiency to alleviate the documentation backlog and unlock the potential of the derivatives market. Their vision set the vital foundations of ISDA and enabled the market to evolve and grow around the world.</p>
<p>Today, our membership comprises more than 1,000 entities across 78 countries. Our suite of documentation continues to underpin the derivatives market, creating certainty and stability. Our focus on consistency and efficiency extends to the global regulatory framework, and we advocate tirelessly for rules that are appropriate, risk-sensitive and aligned with global standards. It&rsquo;s also the basis of our digital transformation work, as we advance a set of industry solutions to bring greater automation to key processes.</p>
<p>In these remarks, I&rsquo;ll talk about three key areas where ISDA is now working to bring greater consistency and efficiency. First, our ongoing work to standardize the calculation of margin. Second, our efforts to improve collateral infrastructure. And third, a recent initiative to improve the close-out framework for derivatives.</p>
<p><span>Margin calculations</span></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s now nine years since we launched the ISDA Standard Initial Margin Model (ISDA SIMM) to provide a common, transparent methodology for calculating regulatory initial margin (IM) requirements. Over that time, it&rsquo;s been broadly adopted by firms across the globe and has proved to be incredibly robust, including during stress events like the 2020 dash for cash and the post-Liberation-Day volatility in April.</p>
<p>The model hasn&rsquo;t remained static &ndash; it&rsquo;s continued to evolve over time to reflect changes in market conditions. In fact, this year marked an important milestone for the ISDA SIMM, as we published the first recalibration under the new semiannual cycle. Agreed in coordination with global regulators, this shift will ensure the model continues to appropriately reflect risk and is updated in a predictable and transparent way.</p>
<p>The coordination with global regulators has been a feature of the ISDA SIMM since inception. We regularly send our calibration and backtesting results and our quarterly monitoring reports to 22 global authorities and incorporate their feedback into the model. In short, we do all the work, so you don&rsquo;t have to.</p>
<p>This is particularly relevant in the context of Australia&rsquo;s superannuation sector. Funds under management have grown rapidly, and that growth is set to continue &ndash; the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) expects the sector to become the world&rsquo;s second largest pension market within a decade, with assets rising to around 180% of GDP. About half of superannuation fund assets are currently invested overseas, and funds are increasingly using derivatives to hedge their FX risk and investment returns. Based on RBA analysis, the total superannuation FX hedge book, currently estimated at A$500 billion, could more than double over the next decade.</p>
<p>As derivatives portfolios grow, superannuation funds will increasingly come into scope of regulatory IM requirements. Those that exclusively use FX swaps and forwards may also see increased demand for collateral. While these instruments are exempt from regulatory IM requirements, bank counterparties are starting to ask for variation margin (VM) and independent amount as they hit capital constraints given the high volume of these trades.</p>
<p>The ISDA SIMM will play an important role in ensuring margin calculations are consistent, transparent and aligned with global best practices. So far, however, only two Australian superannuation funds have been approved to use the model.</p>
<p>We think the ISDA SIMM has proved its worth &ndash; it&rsquo;s been rigorously tested, regularly reviewed by global regulators and adopted by buy- and sell-side firms around the globe. As more superannuation funds come into scope of margin requirements, we&rsquo;ll continue to extol the benefits of the model to ensure all users of derivatives can calculate their margin requirements efficiently, consistently and cost-effectively.</p>
<p><span>Improving the collateral infrastructure</span></p>
<p>Calculation of margin is a critically important issue. But it&rsquo;s also vital that firms can source sufficient eligible collateral and get it to where it needs to be quickly and efficiently. That&rsquo;s particularly important as the world moves towards 24/7 trading. This must be accompanied by 24/7 risk management.</p>
<p>According to the latest ISDA margin survey, IM and VM collected by the leading derivatives participants for their non-cleared exposures increased by 6.4% to $1.5 trillion at the end of 2024.</p>
<p>While mandatory margin requirements have helped to provide protection against counterparty credit risk, we must recognize that the financial system has become more prone to liquidity crunches during periods of stress. During successive market shocks, firms have had to generate large amounts of cash to meet a spike in VM calls. In these scenarios, liquidity can suddenly drain out of markets, jeopardizing financial stability.</p>
<p>Global regulators have been looking at this issue, focusing on liquidity risk management practices and stress testing &ndash; and we have a panel looking at the systemic impacts of liquidity risk later this morning.</p>
<p>A common option is to use the repo market to quickly transform assets into cash to meet collateral requirements. But there&rsquo;s a lack of clarity on whether superannuation funds can access the repo market for liquidity management purposes under the SIS Act &ndash; something we think needs to be resolved.</p>
<p>A growing number of market participants globally are also looking at alternatives to cash and government securities to meet their VM requirements for non-cleared derivatives. Cash already represents a declining share of total VM received, falling from 80% in 2020 to 68% in 2024, according to the ISDA Margin Survey. But there are certain economic, capital and operational constraints that prevent some counterparties from holding anything other than cash or government securities.</p>
<p>For example, money market funds could be an attractive asset to post as collateral, but the current workflow requires collateral to be posted as cash and then transformed by the custodian, which can lead to increased liquidity and operational risks.</p>
<p>Tokenization has the potential to alleviate some of these challenges. Once tokenized on a shared ledger, a money market fund could be much more efficiently mobilized as collateral and shares could be directly posted and returned, without any need for liquidation within the collateral management workflow.</p>
<p>ISDA is now working with stakeholders across financial markets to enable the adoption of tokenization and we&rsquo;re focusing on the key legal, regulatory and operational challenges.</p>
<p>ISDA will target two key areas. First, we&rsquo;ll work to establish clear and consistent legal and regulatory frameworks. This includes making sure derivatives transactions on tokenized assets are underpinned by robust documentation and legal opinions. We&rsquo;ll also seek regulatory certainty that tokenized assets will be permitted as collateral under the margin rules.</p>
<p>Second, we&rsquo;ll work to establish interoperability, underpinned by common data models, smart contract standards and messaging protocols. We&rsquo;ll look to leverage the Common Domain Model to establish common data standards and avoid technological fragmentation.</p>
<p>The tokenization of assets is a very exciting prospect that could improve the timeliness and efficiency of collateral management, bringing greater choice and flexibility for market participants. There&rsquo;s still some way to go, but we&rsquo;ll be working hard to overcome the hurdles and realize the potential of this powerful technology in derivatives markets.</p>
<p><span>Close-out Framework</span></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll now turn to the close-out framework.</p>
<p>I mentioned earlier that the drive for consistency and efficiency lies at the heart of ISDA&rsquo;s powerful set of industry solutions, which are moving clunky, manual processes into the digital age.</p>
<p>One example is Digital Regulatory Reporting (DRR), which dramatically reduces the risk of inaccurate or incomplete reporting by converting an industry interpretation of reporting rules into unambiguous code. The ISDA DRR enabled market participants to implement updates to reporting rules in Australia last year with an unprecedented degree of consistency and efficiency. But we didn&rsquo;t stop there. Last month, we extended the initiative to support rule updates in Hong Kong &ndash; the eighth set of reporting requirements available on the ISDA DRR &ndash; and we&rsquo;re seeing increased adoption of this game-changing offering.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also now bringing greater consistency and efficiency to the process of closing out derivatives trades. Up until now, critical termination-related notices had to be delivered by certain prescribed methods using the counterparty&rsquo;s address listed in the ISDA Master Agreement. Physical delivery of notices has led to all sorts of problems over the years, with delays and uncertainty leading to serious economic consequences.</p>
<p>That all changed with the launch of the ISDA Notices Hub in July. With this new online platform, users can instantaneously deliver and receive notices from anywhere in the world, while also maintaining updated address details for those counterparty relationships where physical delivery of notices continues. At a stroke, the Notices Hub reduces the inefficiencies, risks and costs of physical delivery.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to say that more than 140 buy- and sell-side entities have now adhered to the ISDA 2025 Notices Hub Protocol, which provides the legal framework to allow delivery of notices via the platform. The Notices Hub is a vital step forward in modernizing the close-out process for derivatives trades and we&rsquo;re seeing widespread interest in accessing it. If you&rsquo;d like to join this growing universe of adopters, our team is available to help you with the onboarding process.</p>
<p><span>Conclusion&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I started these remarks by reflecting on ISDA&rsquo;s 40th anniversary celebrations and our enduring commitment to consistency and efficiency. It&rsquo;s there in everything we&rsquo;ve achieved over the years, from the drafting of the very first standard documents to more recent achievements, such as the retirement of LIBOR.</p>
<p>It underpins our work to standardize margin calculations with the ISDA SIMM, it&rsquo;s the foundation of what we&rsquo;re doing to enable the adoption of tokenization in derivatives markets, and it&rsquo;s the driving force behind our digital solutions, including the ISDA Notices Hub. As we continue our anniversary celebrations and look ahead to the future, you can count on ISDA to maintain its focus on consistency and efficiency in everything we do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to finish by once again thanking AFMA, as well as our sponsors, speakers and delegates. I hope you find the event interesting, and I look forward to celebrating ISDA&rsquo;s 40 years at our drinks reception this evening.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<title>The Golden Mean: Navigating Fast-Evolving Capital Markets Through Balanced Regulation - Keynote Speech At The International Conference Of Legal Regulators 2025 - Dr Kelvin Wong, Chairman, Hong Kong Securities And Futures Commission</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, good morning. Thank you to the Law Society of  Hong Kong for bringing this globally significant conference to the city for the very first time. It  is an honour for me, as a financial regulator, to join this meaningful dialogue with prominent  legal regulators from around the world. Your theme, &ldquo;New ways to regulate in a changing  world?&rdquo;, not a definitive statement but a question, captures exactly the mood and moment we  are living in.</p>
<p>In my opinion, cross-sector regulatory dialogue is much needed to gather our collective  resolve and expertise to uphold the principles of justice and integrity to tackle evolving  challenges in the world today. Such exchange between financial and legal regulators is  increasingly important as our markets are facing heightened risks, uncertainties and volatility.</p>
<p>The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) of Hong Kong shares the legal regulators&rsquo;  commitment to the rule of law, as we strive to ensure Hong Kong&rsquo;s capital markets continue  to thrive in a well-regulated environment that upholds integrity. This is pivotal in maintaining  the trust of global investors in the city as an international financial centre (IFC).</p>
<p>Today, I want to offer three reflections that frame how we, at the SFC, adopt a balanced  regulatory approach to help market participants and investors navigate a complex global  environment. It is imperative that we play our dual roles effectively as both guardian and  facilitator.</p>
<p>First, I will highlight the evolving challenges to Hong Kong&rsquo;s capital markets; second, I will  explain how the SFC&rsquo;s balanced regulatory approach &ndash; the Golden Mean (中庸之道) &ndash; helps  navigate these challenges; and third, I will discuss the critical importance of industry  engagement to our approach in building trust and resilience systems for the future.</p>

<p>The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) today announces enforcement action against numerous individuals for alleged failures to comply with director and officer bans issued by the Capital Markets Tribunal. These actions are part of the OSC Enforcement division's ongoing review of non-compliance.</p>
<p>The review is focused on identifying potential instances of individuals violating multi-year and permanent bans that prohibited them from serving as a director or officer of any issuer. The OSC has filed Applications for Enforcement Proceedings (Applications) against the following individuals:</p>

<p>Each Application includes specific information on the allegations and orders sought. If the OSC&rsquo;s allegations are proven, individuals would face penalties and costs, to be determined by the Tribunal, based on the specific circumstances of each case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Compliance with Tribunal orders is not optional. Any individual failing to comply will be met with a decisive response from the OSC,&rdquo; said Bonnie Lysyk, Executive Vice President, Enforcement, at the OSC. &ldquo;We will not hesitate to take further action against individuals who undermine orders that protect investors and the integrity of our capital markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The OSC is proactively monitoring compliance with director and officer bans and will commence additional enforcement proceedings to address non-compliance where appropriate.</p>
<p>The mandate of the OSC is to provide protection to investors from unfair, improper or fraudulent practices, to foster fair, efficient and competitive capital markets and confidence in the capital markets, to foster capital formation, and to contribute to the stability of the financial system and the reduction of systemic risk. Investors are urged to check the registration of any persons or company offering an investment opportunity and to review the OSC investor materials available at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/">https://www.osc.ca</a>.</p>

<title>US–UK Financial Giants Call For Fast-Track Regulatory Reform To Power Jobs, Growth And Innovation</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/usuk-financial-giants-call-for-fast-track-regulatory-reform-to-power-jobs-grow-20251020/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/usuk-financial-giants-call-for-fast-track-regulatory-reform-to-power-jobs-grow-20251020/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The British American Finance Alliance (BAFA), a coalition of leading financial and professional services organisations from the UK and U.S., is urging governments on both sides of the Atlantic to accelerate regulatory cooperation &mdash; a move they say could unlock widespread economic benefits, from job creation and consumer savings through to business growth and increased innovation.</p>
<p>In its new paper, &lsquo;Finance for growth: A shared U.S.-UK prosperity agenda,&rsquo; published today, the BAFA makes clear the opportunity for the new UK-U.S. Transatlantic Taskforce for Markets of the Future to facilitate this enhanced cooperation and urges it to ensure systematic input from and close consultation with industry.</p>
<p>The Taskforce, backed by both the U.S. and UK Treasuries, was launched following President Trump&rsquo;s September UK state visit and is focused on greater collaboration on capital markets connectivity, innovation and digital assets.</p>
<p>The paper, which includes the collective asks of U.S. and UK financial services sectors, sets out how smarter, more aligned regulation could supercharge economic ties between the world&rsquo;s two leading financial centres &mdash; London and New York &mdash; and deliver tangible benefits for businesses and households across both countries.</p>
<p>Key recommendations include:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Unleashing cross-border data flows</span>&nbsp;to support digital trade and innovation</li>
<li><span>Cooperation on digital asset regulation</span>&nbsp;to reduce costs and boost investor confidence</li>
<li><span>Modernising Securities and Exchange Commission rules&nbsp;</span>to open up new opportunities for investment firms</li>
<li><span>Promoting the alignment of professional qualifications and standards and boosting talent mobility</span>&nbsp;to fill skills gaps and drive productivity</li>
<li><span>A scorecard or reporting mechanism&nbsp;</span>to track regulatory issues identified and addressed</li>
<li><span>Systematic industry input into U.S.-UK dialogues that impact the sector</span></li>
<li><span>For BAFA to work in lockstep with U.S. and UK authorities&nbsp;</span>on discussions relating to digital trade in financial services</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Kenneth E. Bentsen Jr., Co-Chair of the British American Finance Alliance and President and CEO of SIFMA, said:</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The U.S and UK lead the world in financial services, presenting a unique opportunity to strengthen shared growth and prosperity between our economies. BAFA&rsquo;s paper highlights the importance of continued U.S.&ndash;UK collaboration in promoting regulatory coherence and enhancing balanced market access. By identifying ways to jointly capitalize on technological opportunities, deepen trade and investment ties, and promote efficient and proportionate regulation, we can enhance our capital markets and generate increased investment in manufacturing, services, and all sectors of our economy. The Transatlantic Taskforce for Markets of the Future provides an important platform to advance this work, ensuring open, competitive, and resilient capital markets on both sides of the Atlantic. BAFA stands ready to be a constructive partner for this important group.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Chris Hayward, Co-Chair of the British American Finance Alliance, Deputy Chair of TheCityUK and Policy Chairman of the City of London Corporation, said:</span><br />&ldquo;This is about more than finance &mdash; it&rsquo;s about jobs, innovation, and prosperity for millions of people. From small businesses seeking investment to consumers looking for better financial products, regulatory alignment between the UK and US will make a real difference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Transatlantic Taskforce adds welcome urgency. BAFA is ready to help turn ambition into action.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Key facts about U.S.-UK financial services:</p>
<ul>
<li>Financial services contribute around 7% of GDP in both economies &ndash; a true engine for growth.</li>
<li>S. financial services exports to the UK are worth almost $19bn per year &ndash; 80 percent higher than the U.S.&rsquo;s second largest financial services market (Canada).</li>
<li>30 percent of all U.S. FDI in the UK is in the financial services industry. U.S. investment in UK financial services is larger than U.S. investment in any other country&rsquo;s financial services industry.</li>
<li>The UK and U.S. together are home to three of the top five financial centers in the world &ndash; New York, London and Chicago.</li>
<li>S. financial institutions employ 170,000 people in the UK &ndash; over half of all the employees working for U.S. financial institutions in the whole of Europe.</li>
<li>S. investors hold over $1 trillion of UK equities &ndash; more than they hold in any other European, Asian or North American economy.</li>

<ul>
<li>DIFC active registered companies exceeds 8,000, including 1,000 regulated<br />entities</li>
<li>Banking Assets grows to approximately USD 240bn, a 200% increase since 2015</li>
<li>DIFC Courts processes AED 17.5+ billion in total case values year-to-date</li>
</ul>
<p>Dubai continues to advance its position as the Middle East, Africa and South Asia&rsquo;s (MEASA) leading global financial centre.</p>
<p>The announcement coincides with DIFC surpassing 8,000 active registered companies, including over 1,000 entities being regulated by the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA), the Centre&rsquo;s independent regulator. Additionally, the DIFC Courts has recorded over AED 17.5bn in total case values so far this year.</p>
<p>Dubai continues to advance through the Global Financial Centre Index where it has been announced that the city has progressed to 11th place globally, cementing its leading position as the region&rsquo;s most credible centre for the industry, and the top four globalFinTech hub.</p>
<p>The milestones announced today not only reflect how Dubai has transformed into a global financial services hub, but also its significant contribution to the Dubai Economic Agenda (D33).</p>
<p><span>H.E. Essa Kazim, Governor of DIFC, commented</span>: &ldquo;As part of DIFC&rsquo;s significant contribution to Dubai&rsquo;s Economic Agenda (D33), we continue to empower the financial services industry, attract global talent and support sustainable economic growth. DIFC&rsquo;s success is the benchmark for emerging financial centres and a result of creating a business environment built for success, where companies not only gain a licence to operate, but a platform to lead and grow. Our framework is built not just for today, but for the future &ndash; one that embraces innovation, upholds the highest standards and remains anchored in integrity.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Dubai as the region&rsquo;s global financial powerhouse</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>Since its inception in 2004, through its three independent bodies &ndash; DIFC Authority, DFSA and DIFC Courts &ndash; DIFC has turned Dubai into a magnet for global financial powerhouses, innovators and professional services leaders, providing an ecosystem that blends legal and regulatory certainty with business agility, becoming the benchmark for emerging financial centres worldwide.</p>
<p>Its proven model combines the DIFC Authority&rsquo;s leadership in strategy, infrastructure and innovation, supported by the DFSA&rsquo;s globally aligned regulatory oversight, and the DIFC Courts&rsquo; expertise in dispute resolution, together delivering transparency, stability and certainty for businesses.</p>
<p><span>The region&rsquo;s only financial centre operating at scale across all sectors</span>Benefitting from global connectivity and access to more than 77 countries across MEASA, DIFC has grown into the region&rsquo;s largest and most diversified financial hub.</p>
<p>Through the DIFC Authority&rsquo;s strategic direction, the Centre has attracted over 8,000 active registered companies. These companies employ 48,000 professionals &ndash; the region&rsquo;s largest and deepest pool of financial services related talent. DIFC is the only financial centre in the region operating at scale and therefore uniquely positioned to contribute to the development of the global financial industry. Clients include the largest clusters of financial services firms across the banking, capital markets, wealth and asset management, and insurance sectors.</p>
<p><span>H.E. Arif Amiri, Chief Executive Officer of DIFC Authority, said:</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Exceeding 8,000 registered companies reinforces DIFC&rsquo;s position as the only financial centre in the region operating at scale across all sectors of the industry. This depth and diversity enable us to meaningfully contribute to Dubai&rsquo;s economic growth while shaping the evolution of the global financial services landscape. Beyond finance, our agenda is also driving Dubai&rsquo;s emergence as the region&rsquo;s leading city for technology innovation. As we continue to expand our global influence, we remain committed to ensuring DIFC empowers businesses to grow, innovate and create lasting impact for the future economy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DIFC&rsquo;s 289 licenced banks and capital markets companies, including 27 of the world&rsquo;s 29 globally systemically important banks, are now managing approximately USD 240bn of banking assets from the Centre. This has surged from USD 80bn ten years ago, an increase of almost 200 per cent.</p>
<p><span>Regulatory framework supporting scale</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>As the DFSA&rsquo;s strategy and regulatory frameworks continue to evolve to support scale, cross market connectivity and innovation while safeguarding stability, DIFC is well-positioned to lead the next phase of the financial services industry&rsquo;s transformation. The DFSA&rsquo;s robust regulatory framework, based on common law and benchmarked against leading global regulators, is integral to DIFC&rsquo;s success.</p>
<p>The DFSA now regulates more than 1,000 entities within DIFC &ndash; the largest number in any financial centre across the region.</p>
<p><span>Mark Steward, Chief Executive of the Dubai Financial Services Authority,&nbsp;</span>said: &ldquo;With over 1,000 regulated entities in DIFC, it is appropriate to recognise the strength, breadth and depth of the DIFC as the region&rsquo;s premier financial centre. Financial regulated entities are coming here because this is where they are growing, connecting to investors and markets all over the world and linking global capital to new growth opportunities in banking, capital markets, wealth and asset management across developed and emerging markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To support future scale, the DFSA will evolve its funds regime to ensure it retains best-in-class&nbsp;status, enabling DIFC to continue cementing its reputation as the preferred location for hedge&nbsp;<br />funds, wealth and asset management companies and alternative investment firms.</p>
<p><span>Jurisdiction of choice for efficient and reliable court services</span></p>
<p>The DIFC Courts continues to be the leading English language commercial court in the&nbsp;MEASA region, offering domestic, regional, and international businesses world class dispute&nbsp;<br />resolution services. Year to date, over AED 17.5 billion in total claim values have been filed at the DIFC Courts.</p>
<p><span>His Excellency Wayne Martin, Chief Justice, DIFC Courts</span>, commented: &ldquo;Serving as a leading common law commercial court in the Gulf region for over 20 years, the substantial increase in overall claim values in 2025 demonstrates a sustained pattern of growth, particularly in opt-in matters and higher-value claims. These developments reinforce the DIFC Courts&rsquo; status as a trusted regional jurisdiction of choice for resolving complex commercial disputes, supported by experienced judges, and ready enforceability in the UAE and Gulf region. Consistent trust in our services not only provides a strong reflection of the value placed on our legal framework by businesses and individuals alike but also serves to underpin the DIFC and Dubai&rsquo;s status as a leading regional financial hub.&rdquo;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><b>Versana</b>&nbsp;today announced that&nbsp;<b>J.P. Morgan</b>&nbsp;has become the first administrative agent (&ldquo;Agent&rdquo;) of broadly syndicated loans (&ldquo;BSL&rdquo;) to implement Versana&rsquo;s cashless roll capability on its centralized, real-time digital platform. This first-of-its-kind feature links an original loan facility&rsquo;s transaction history (e.g. cash flows and settled trades) to subsequently amended facilities&rsquo; information to improve portfolio management and operational efficiencies for lenders. The launch of this innovative functionality further validates Versana&rsquo;s value proposition and mission to modernize the $8 trillion BSL and private loan markets.</p>
<p>For almost two decades, the BSL asset class has needed an information and technology solution to resolve the fragmented complexity of managing its high volume of loan refinancings and repricings implemented via cashless roll mechanics. Versana has now launched an industry-wide solution, with J.P. Morgan leading the market by being the first Agent to adopt this advanced feature.</p>
<p><b>Joseph Ferraiolo, Head of Debt Capital Markets Operations &amp; Merchant Bank Policy at J.P. Morgan</b>, said: &ldquo;With over 50% of market volume year-to-date occurring in repricings, this cashless roll functionality is a significant benefit to all loan market participants, enabling them to seamlessly track an initial loan position through to its new refinanced facility. J.P. Morgan is proud to be the first agent to implement Versana&rsquo;s cashless roll capability, allowing our lender clients to now string together their full position history.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>Versana&rsquo;s cashless roll solution enables:</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>Seamless Transaction History from Loan Origination</b>: Linkage of an original loan facility&rsquo;s cash flows and settled trades to subsequently amended facilities&rsquo; information, thereby providing a full historical record of loan activity through the entire loan lifecycle</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Golden-Source Agent Information</b>: Access cash flow, transaction and lender level information from Agents&rsquo; golden-source loan servicing systems rather than legacy piecemeal methods</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Real-Time Updates</b>: Cashlessly rolled amended facilities are available and linked to the original facility at close of the amendment</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;This first-ever solution for cashless rolls solves a long-standing pain point in the BSL market,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<b>Cynthia E. Sachs, Founding CEO of Versana</b>. &ldquo;With this release, J.P. Morgan continues to demonstrate its leadership by being the first adopter of our cutting-edge functionality. We&rsquo;re excited to now expand this across all Agents for the benefit of all participants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Versana&rsquo;s cashless roll solution builds upon the company&rsquo;s continued growth, which now offers facility information on over $5 trillion in notional loan commitments on its next-generation platform.</p>

<h2>Deepening the UK-Japan relationship</h2>

<p>This year, the UK Navy visited Tokyo in one of its most powerful ships: the HMS Prince of Wales.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It covers hundreds of miles a day, conducts strike missions and deploys troops. But it also fosters our international relationships &ndash; just like the HMY Emperor did.</p>
<p>I grew up in a ship-building town and know the quiet power a ship carries.</p>
<p>In many instances, it is a first line of security.</p>
<p>But in today&rsquo;s world, conflict is no longer just physical. It&rsquo;s economic and technological &ndash; which means our security must be, as well.</p>
<p><a class="ext" href="https://www.nippon.com/en/japan-data/h02455/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Survey Finds a Third of Japanese Firms Have Experienced a Cyberattack | nippon.com (opens in a new window)">One-third of Japanese firms<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>&nbsp;have experienced a cyberattack.

<p>These attacks are devastating, even for large businesses like Asahi Group and Marks &amp; Spencer.</p>
<p>Asahi saw&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/asahi-shares-mark-weekly-slide-044807676.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Asahi shares mark weekly slide after cyberattack halts production | Yahoo.com (opens in a new window)">falling share prices<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>,&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yje27je5jo" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Asahi restarts beer production after cyber-attack | BBC (opens in a new window)">product launch delays<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>&nbsp;and near-empty shelves.</p>

<p>These threats are real. But when we signed the&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-hiroshima-accord/the-hiroshima-accord" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="The Hiroshima Accord | GOV.UK (opens in a new window)">Hiroshima Accord<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>, our countries promised to &lsquo;stand shoulder to shoulder&rsquo; &ndash; and we remain each other&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/japan-hails-unprecedented-security-ties-british-aircraft-carrier-visits-tokyo-2025-08-28/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Japan hails 'unprecedented' security ties as British aircraft carrier visits Tokyo | Reuters.com (opens in a new window)">closest security partners<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>.</p>
<p>So, we will guard against threats together. With amity and commerce.</p>
<p>We will tackle global challenges through investment, within nations and between friends. Because finance is part of national security.</p>
<p>And sound security is what underpins market integrity, and therefore growth and competitiveness.</p>
<p>Our countries are already working on this together.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Sumitomo Corporation has partnered with the UK government to&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-secures-75-billion-japanese-investment-in-key-growth-sectors" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="UK secures &pound;7.5 billion Japanese investment in key growth sectors | GOV.UK (opens in a new window)">invest &pound;7.5 billion<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>&nbsp;into offshore wind and hydrogen projects.</li>

<li>As part of Project Guardian, we are working together alongside the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) and the Authority of Singapore (MAS) to explore tokenisation and decentralised finance.</li>
</ul>
<p>It comes at an especially opportune moment for the FCA as we prepare to design the next stage for asset management.</p>
<p>Tokenisation could play a pivotal role &ndash; and drive changes that benefit both industry and consumers.</p>
<p>As home to 2 of the world&rsquo;s leading financial markets, our countries have plenty to offer each other.</p>
<p>Japan leads in manufacturing and green technologies, and has a deep pool of capital. Its sense of stability is also a huge appeal to UK investors.</p>
<p>The UK has the size, scale and stability of its markets, plus proven performance and a diverse investor base. We also offer a stable and well-established legal environment and a strong record of innovation.</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-leading-markets-with-global-commitments" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Leading markets with global commitments</h2>
<p>We were pleased to hear of the Japan Financial Services Agency's (JFSA) goals at this year&rsquo;s UK-Japan Financial Regulatory Forum.</p>
<p>Many of the initiatives shared in the plan for Promoting Japan as a Leading Asset Management Center resonate strongly with the FCA&rsquo;s objectives.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensuring open, competitive markets.</li>
<li>Reducing unnecessary barriers to entry.</li>
<li>Fostering greater international alignment.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are critical for Japan&rsquo;s asset management market, which is&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/japan-asset-management-industry" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Japan Asset Management Market Size and Share | Mordor Intelligence (opens in a new window)">worth $4.9 trillion<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>&nbsp;and set to reach $9.6 trillion by 2030.</p>
<p>But they&rsquo;re also critical to our partnership.</p>
<p>They allow UK firms to operate with confidence in Japan and support Japanese firms accessing the UK market.</p>
<p>Transparency and simpler access frameworks strengthen trust and underpin sustainable cross-border capital flows &ndash; priorities at the heart of our growth and competitiveness mandate.</p>
<p>And they make clear that our countries share a commitment to open, high-standard markets and engagement with international standard setters like IOSCO.</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-looking-ahead" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Looking ahead</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to recognise and commend the JFSA for its work in positioning Japan as a global asset management hub.</p>
<p>The reforms on corporate governance and asset ownership have led to a high-performing equity market and considerable innovation in recent years, making Japan attractive to domestic and international managers alike.</p>
<p>Moreover, allowing&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.deloitte.com/global/en/Industries/investment-management/perspectives/shaping-tomorrow-through-investment.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Shaping tomorrow through investment: Japan's vision as a leading asset management center | Deloitte.com (opens in a new window)">managers of all sizes to delegate<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>&nbsp;their investment decisions will provide them access to the best opportunities worldwide.</p>
<p>These plans are already attracting global attention, and I suspect they will continue to do so.</p>
<p>They are also strongly aligned with the UK&rsquo;s own reform agenda.</p>
<p>As the JFSA builds upon its vision and the FCA works to embed growth and competitiveness into regulation, we find ourselves with an opportunity. To collaborate and strengthen the links between our markets.</p>
<p>How do we ensure that asset management benefits both countries, particularly given the challenges like demographic shifts, limited financial literacy, overexposure of foreign assets, and making savings more productive?</p>
<p>By:</p>
<ul>
<li>Working together to facilitate market understanding.</li>
<li>Deepening regulatory cooperation.</li>
<li>Aligning policy frameworks.</li>
<li>Supporting innovation while protecting stability and facilitating capital flows and co-investment.</li>
</ul>
<p>As the world&rsquo;s second-largest international asset management centre, with &pound;14 trillion AUM, the UK is here to support you as you build your asset management centre.</p>
<p>When we developed our own, we found that a commitment to global standards and an openness to international competition were especially helpful.</p>
<p>We also welcome Japanese capital in infrastructure, sustainable finance and private markets.</p>
<p>And we are eager to continue building upon the transfer of knowledge we&rsquo;re already seeing.</p>
<p>For example, discussions with the JFSA helped shape our approach to creating a crypto regime and stablecoin rulebook.</p>
<p>And the Nippon individual savings account (NISA) was modelled on the UK&rsquo;s individual saving account.</p>
<p>With raised contribution limits, greater tax benefits and simpler procedures,&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-09-29/young-japanese-investors-bucking-their-elders-embrace-stocks" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Young Japanese investors bucking their elders embrace stocks | Bloomberg UK (opens in a new window)">investments have increased by 68% since 2023<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>.</p>
<p>Of course, there are other ways in which we can help each other, especially in terms of sustainable finance.</p>
<p>Working together and adopting international sustainability standards will help us mitigate the unique sustainability challenges and threat of natural disaster we face as island nations.</p>
<p>When the FCA developed a Code of Conduct for sustainability data and ratings providers, we received valuable input from the JFSA and International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) to encourage international consistency.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exciting to consider what might be possible when we continue learning from each other, even in a time of change.</p>
<p>With this in mind, I would like to extend my sincere thanks to Shigeru Ariizumi for his partnership and guidance as he moves onto his new role.</p>
<p>I look forward to welcoming my new counterpart.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to leave you with this: investability comes from 2 things.</p>
<ol>
<li>The strength of longstanding global centres like London and Tokyo.</li>
<li>A sense of predictability, which empowers customers to make better and more informed decisions.</li>
</ol>
<p>That is how we will create a &lsquo;<a class="ext" href="https://www.fsa.go.jp/en/policy/pjlamc/20231214.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Policy Plan for Promoting Japan as a Leading Asset Management Center | Financial Services Agency, Japan (opens in a new window)">virtuous cycle of growth and distribution<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>,&rsquo; both in Japan and in the UK.</p>
<p>I look forward to deepening our countries&rsquo; cooperation and having regular exchanges between regulators and industry as we work to make this vision a reality.</p>
<p>Of course, we realise our presence plays a role in this.</p>
<p>We have established our Asia-Pacific office to provide you with greater access to us and our services.</p>
<p>I encourage all of you to engage with us directly.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s continue to build our partnership, align our standards, and create shared growth across our markets &ndash; together.</p>

<title>World Bank Group And International Monetary Fund 2025 Annual Meetings, Development Committee: UK Governors' Statement</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/world-bank-group-and-international-monetary-fund-2025-annual-meetings-developme-20251020/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/world-bank-group-and-international-monetary-fund-2025-annual-meetings-developme-20251020/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The 2025 Annual Meetings of the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund convene at a time of profound global challenge and opportunity. The world continues to grapple with escalating conflicts, intensifying climate impacts, trade friction, food insecurity and the lingering effects of the pandemic. These shocks have slowed, and in some cases reversed, hard-won development gains. The most vulnerable people and countries continue to bear the heaviest costs.</p>
<p>In this context, the United Kingdom reaffirms its unwavering commitment to multilateralism. The IFIs are core to our new model of development and climate finance &ndash; based on partnerships, investment, expertise, and inclusivity. We commend the leadership and staff of the World Bank Group and the IMF for the scale and speed of their responses, and for the ambition of the World Bank Group&rsquo;s evolution agenda and the IMF&rsquo;s work to support stability and resilience. The Bretton Woods institutions remain indispensable to shared prosperity on a liveable planet, and their role is even more critical today.</p>
<p>In a changing global economy, our commitment to sustained economic growth and higher living standards globally remains ironclad. Recent global challenges have underlined the importance of stability as the cornerstone of growth. We will continue to work with our international partners, including at the Bank, to navigate shared challenges and build robust economic partnerships to support global growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our approach is founded on the principles of stability, investment, and reform. That is why we welcome the Bank&rsquo;s focus on delivering quality jobs and sustainable growth. When we build that foundational infrastructure &ndash; a healthy and skilled labour force, clean reliable transport and energy, and resilient natural resources &ndash; the private sector can grow and thrive and create the jobs of the future.</p>
<h2 id="a-new-chapter-for-development-finance">A new chapter for development finance</h2>
<p>At the Fourth International Financing for Development Conference (FFD4) in Seville this July, the international community agreed that a new chapter is needed in how we finance development and sustainable growth for the next decade and beyond. The UK played a leading role in shaping the agenda and outcomes at FFD4, championing a fairer, more inclusive, and future-fit global financial system. We are now looking forward to working with the international community and international financial institutions to build on this consensus. The global financial system should empower developing countries&nbsp;to finance their own development, climate, and nature goals sustainably; attract investment for growth and jobs and reduce reliance on aid.</p>
<p>The UK announced 2 new initiatives in Seville, aiming to drive action on key priorities. First, in partnership with the Bridgetown Initiative, we called for a scale up of pre-arranged finance, including insurance, from 2% to 20% of all crisis finance by 2035. Second, with the Philippines, we launched a coalition to unlock more private capital for developing countries through public markets. Our partnership with the WBG is key to making progress on both endeavours.</p>
<h2 id="uk-commitment-to-multilateralism-and-the-ifis">UK commitment to multilateralism and the IFIs</h2>
<p>The UK&rsquo;s approach remains to ensure every pound spent has maximum impact on global priorities: humanitarian, health, and climate crises. Within this, we have prioritised spending through the most impactful multilateral organisations, including honouring our ambitious pledge to IDA21, recognising the importance of a reformed IDA as the best way of reaching the poorest and most vulnerable.</p>
<p>We continue to support the full spectrum of the Bank Group&mdash;IDA, IBRD, IFC, and MIGA&mdash;and welcome the continued focus on delivering results at country level, strengthening crisis preparedness, and building a more effective system that mobilises all sources of finance. We also welcome ongoing steps to improve efficiency and impact, including strengthened country engagement, streamlined processes, and innovations that expand lending headroom and mobilise more private capital. However, more must be done. As shareholders, we have a responsibility to ensure the institutions are better, bigger, and crucially fairer, delivering for those most in need while safeguarding debt sustainability and fiscal space.</p>
<h2 id="scaling-the-system-doubling-mdb-financing">Scaling the system: doubling MDB financing</h2>
<p>The UK is leading efforts to double the scale of Multilateral Development Bank (MDB) financing, including through balance sheet stretching, financial innovation, and ambitious replenishments. We support the comprehensive review of the IBRD&rsquo;s capital adequacy framework and the introduction of innovations such as hybrid capital and guarantees. The MDBs are uniquely positioned to deliver development finance at scale, and further work on this agenda is needed to deliver the volume of finance needed to meet the scale of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and tackle climate, conflict and nature crises.</p>
<h2 id="improving-system-wide-effectiveness-breaking-down-siloes">Improving system-wide effectiveness: breaking down siloes</h2>
<p>We urge the Bank to continue breaking down siloes, increasing operational efficiency, and deepening collaboration across MDBs, climate funds, and UN agencies. The Bank&rsquo;s speed initiative and evolution toolkit are important steps forward, but client countries want to see further simplification and agility in delivery, particularly in Fragile Conflict and Violence (FCV) contexts. We welcome the Bank&rsquo;s commitment to reducing project approval times and rolling out the evolution toolkit to increase impact, including global challenge programmes and financial incentives.</p>
<p>The World Bank, alongside the Regional Development Banks, has a central role in reforming the fragmented aid architecture, working alongside health and climate funds to deliver a more client-led, responsive, and collaborative multilateral system. We also expect the Bank to play a leadership role in better aligning rules and processes across MDBs and the wider development finance system &ndash; building on the recent mutual reliance frameworks &ndash; to ensure the system is delivering for developing countries.</p>
<h2 id="increasing-voice-and-representation-for-low-income-and-vulnerable-countries">Increasing voice and representation for low-income and vulnerable countries</h2>
<p>The UK is committed to safeguarding and strengthening the World Bank Group, with robust and fair governance at its core. The World Bank&rsquo;s ongoing shareholding review is a critical opportunity to make the institution more representative of low-income and vulnerable client countries, putting these countries more clearly in the lead on their own development priorities.&nbsp; This is a moment for real change &ndash; we want to see an outcome that delivers on behalf of these countries, and the institution as a whole. We also need to look to the longer-term and consider how we can best use future reviews to support a more fit-for-purpose governance structure at the Bank.</p>
<p>Yet this is more than just the World Bank shareholding reviews. We need to see more voice for these countries across the development architecture. That is why we are pleased to co-host this year&rsquo;s African Development Fund replenishment in London &ndash; there is much we can learn from how they put client countries in the driving seat. &nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="increasing-private-capital-mobilisation">Increasing private capital mobilisation</h2>
<p>Public financing alone will never be sufficient to tackle the global development challenges we face. The UK is looking to the IFC and the wider development finance system to take risk to make job-creating and transformative investments in businesses in lower income and fragile contexts. In more established markets, we need them to mobilise private capital at scale, including for the energy transition. We also want the IFC to play a collaborative role in setting standards, from origination to impact, which will create an investible asset class attracting institutional investors.</p>
<p>That is why the UK has supported the IFC&rsquo;s new Emerging Markets Securitisation Programme (EMSP) &ndash; the first transaction of its kind which marks IFC&rsquo;s strategic shift towards an &lsquo;originate-to-distribute&rsquo; model, by transferring assets and risk off their balance sheet. Our $25m investment through the UK&rsquo;s Mobilist programme has helped to draw in private sector investment totalling $510m, freeing up IFC&rsquo;s capital to invest in other development priorities. It is also why we launched an industry-led EMDE Investor Taskforce, capitalising on the substantial expertise that exists in the UK&rsquo;s financial sector to drive action.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to IFC&rsquo;s Vision 2030, we want to see high ambition and concrete steps taken towards implementation &ndash; from scaling up IFC&rsquo;s offer for low income and FCV countries, to mobilisation of the private sector at scale. On the former, in low income and FCV contexts, we want to see a more joined up Group-wide approach, with IFC taking more risk, strengthening its upstream operations, and scaling innovative instruments and approaches. For this to work, IFC needs to ensure it has enough staff in FCV countries to deliver this ambitious agenda. On mobilisation at scale, we want to see continued progress on the securitisation agenda, building on EMSP, a scaling up of guarantees, and more upstream and advisory work to build a bankable pipeline.</p>
<h2 id="maintaining-mdb-leadership-on-climate-and-nature">Maintaining MDB leadership on climate and nature</h2>
<p>We call for continued climate and nature action, advocating for and supporting countries&rsquo; demand for low carbon, climate resilient, and nature positive development pathways. This entails alignment of all Bank operations to the Paris Agreement and inclusion of climate impacts into system-wide least-cost energy investments. Furthermore, it is crucial that the Bank deliver its central contribution to achieving the $300bn New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) agreed at COP29 and outlining further ambition at COP30, in line with the Baku to Belem Roadmap. We urge the Bank to capitalise on the success of the Climate Change Action Plan, furthering action in key areas, including supporting countries to design and implement ambitious national climate and development plans and deepening engagement in country-led platforms. Particular focus should be given to mainstreaming nature-positive solutions and adaptation and resilience.</p>
<p>The Bank&rsquo;s recent flagship report &lsquo;Rebooting Development&rsquo; reframes a critical narrative: that environmental harm is not an inevitable cost of development. Turning this into action is the next step.</p>
<p>The Bank must redouble its efforts on adaptation, significantly scaling up public and private finance and closing the gap on mitigation, particularly at IFC. We welcome the findings from the recent CCDR review and Rising to the Challenge report and encourage their implementation.</p>
<p>Nature must be further mainstreamed into operations and analytics, in line with the joint MDB statement on Nature. We welcome collaboration on deepening nature analysis in CCDRs, as well as other analytical tools, as a key precondition for this. We welcome the progress made on the new Tropical Forests Forever Facility and congratulate Brazil on its leadership; we look forward to seeing this set up by COP30.</p>
<p>Agriculture sits at the intersection of these issues but faces underinvestment (just 7 percent of climate finance). The UK continues to work alongside the Bank on these challenges including through our programmes Commercial Agriculture for Smallholders and Agribusiness (CASA) and Investments in Forests and Sustainable Land Use (IFSLU), and the Just Rural Transition programme.</p>
<p>These challenges are particularly acute in FCV contexts, but similarly they receive little international climate finance. Addressing this gap requires not only scaled-up investment but also long-term support to build local capacity for climate planning, data, and delivery. Without targeted action, fragile settings risk being left behind in global climate efforts, undermining both development and stability.</p>
<h2 id="resilience-in-contexts-affected-by-fragility-conflict-and-violence-deepening-engagement">Resilience in contexts affected by fragility, conflict and violence: deepening engagement</h2>
<p>We expect nearly 60% of the extreme poor to be in countries affected by fragility and conflict by 2030 &ndash; whilst the poorest countries remain the most vulnerable to climate and nature shocks. These compound shocks also mean the scale and intensity of global food insecurity is persistently high, with 600 million people facing hunger last year. The MDBs have an increasingly important role to play working with and alongside humanitarian actors to remain engaged even in the most fragile states, support countries receiving refugees, prevent future conflicts, finance essential services and build the foundations for resilient growth. The Bank is a key partner through conflict &ndash; from Ukraine to Palestine, and across the Sahel and Horn of Africa.</p>
<p>We welcome the ceasefire in Gaza, with an end to the fighting, the release of the hostages and the resumption of aid. We are determined to seize this opportunity to deliver a lasting peace, and a stable, secure future for the whole region.</p>
<p>We respect the rights of both Palestinians and Israelis alike to live their lives in peace &ndash; free from violence and suffering &ndash; and are committed to preserving the 2-state solution and upholding the Palestinian people&rsquo;s right of self-determination. This is the basis of our decision to recognise Palestine.</p>
<p>To support the realisation of this vision we must support the viability of the Palestinian economy and the Palestinian Authority. We call upon Israel to release the stranglehold on the Palestinian Economy and re-commit to the Paris Protocol: releasing withheld Clearance Revenues, committing to banking relationships, and enabling increased Shekel transfers. We welcome the Bank&rsquo;s work and that of our partners gathered here this week to uphold the economy, provide opportunities for Palestinians, and work towards the long-term resilience and economic sustainability. We are proudly members of the Emergency Coalition to support this further.</p>
<p>The UK stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine in pursuit of a just and lasting peace. As well as putting pressure on Russia we need to keep Ukraine in the fight. In support of this, so far the UK has committed $5 billion in guarantees to support additional World Bank lending, part of wider package of European and G7 assistance under Ukraine&rsquo;s Extended Fund Facility arrangement with the IMF, linked to its EU accession. However, with Ukraine facing a significant financing gap ($65.1bn) in 2026 onward, now is therefore the right time to look at unlocking the value of Russian Sovereign Assets in a manner consistent with domestic and international law, as the focus of a renewed financing package. It is also critical any assistance continues to form part of a balance of effort with Ukraine, including their steadfast commitment to reform. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>More widely, we want to see a shift in the World Bank Group&rsquo;s operating model to better address the underlying causes of fragility and conflict, and a clear commitment to improve the number, competencies and quality of staffing in fragile and conflict-affected settings. We also want to see more active tracking of, and reporting on, conflict prevention work, so that the Bank can better evaluate its impact. We also want to see a more strategic and systematic approach to financial and non-financial partnerships between the Bank and the UN, as well as with humanitarian actors who are often the first responders and key partners in crisis contexts. The refresh of the Bank&rsquo;s Fragility, Conflict and Violence (FCV) Strategy is a critical moment to lock in these commitments.</p>
<p>In these contexts, social protection offers a more sustainable and cost-effective alternative to repeated humanitarian responses and is a strategic investment in long-term resilience and stability. Yet despite its proven potential, it remains underused in FCV settings. We want to see IFIs prioritise these contexts within work to extend social protection coverage, engage more with humanitarian actors, and strengthen conflict sensitivity so that systems and assistance can be sustained through new crises.</p>
<h2 id="crisis-preparedness-shock-response-and-food-security">Crisis preparedness, shock response, and food security</h2>
<p>The UK welcomes the Bank&rsquo;s continued roll out of pre-arranged and shock-responsive instruments that can disburse quickly and predictably, helping to protect development gains and fiscal space when disasters strike. We have long championed the expansion of innovative tools such as Climate Resilient Debt Clauses to more countries. Looking ahead, we want to see the Bank further invest in shock responsive social protection, early warning systems, risk analytics, and contingency planning to ensure crisis responses are faster, better targeted, and firmly anchored in country systems. It is clear that a greater proportion of crisis spending needs to be pre-arranged &ndash; in Seville we called for a target of 20% of crisis finance to be pre-arranged by 2035 (up from 2% currently) We would welcome the WBG and other MDBs sharing that ambition.</p>
<p>We also need better crisis finance in health emergencies, where the experience of Covid showed that rapid and effective funding is critical to prevent the loss of trillions of dollars and millions of lives. Given there is a 25% chance of another global pandemic in the next decade, we cannot lose momentum. The Bank is uniquely placed to bring together financing from donors and client countries for vaccines and other countermeasures &ndash; but only if it adjusts its financing toolkit. We are pleased to see that the Bank is developing innovative ways to improve the financing instruments at country level. However, in a future pandemic access to early vaccines is likely to depend on at-risk surging, including from the Bank&rsquo;s own balance sheet, of pooled financing on behalf of many countries and potentially investing in new candidates. We need a clearly articulated framework on this, that can serve as a blueprint for mobilising rapid and effective financing in a future pandemic.</p>
<p>We welcome the World Bank Group commitment last year to double its agriculture finance, recognising that the sector employs 2 thirds of the workforce in low-income countries and is 2 to 4 times more effective at tackling poverty than other sectors. The sector remains underfunded with an estimated 170 billion dollar funding gap globally for smallholder farmers. The UK is using its ODA effectively to catalyse private investment in agrifood systems in low-income countries, working with IFC to strengthen its impact for agri-SMEs and smallholder farmers through the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program, while supporting innovative financing approaches through vehicles such as Financing Agri-SMEs in Africa (FASA), Aceli Africa and AgDevCo Ventures.</p>
<h2 id="tackling-unsustainable-debt">Tackling unsustainable debt</h2>
<p>We remain highly concerned about the debt challenges facing many developing countries. In 2024, interest payments in IDA countries were at their highest rate in nearly 30 years<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/world-bank-group-and-international-monetary-fund-2025-annual-meetings-development-committee-uk-governors-statement/world-bank-group-and-international-monetary-fund-2025-annual-meetings-development-committee-uk-governors-statement#fn:1" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>&nbsp;(World Bank, 2025); these are crowding out critical investments in growth and human capital.</p>
<p>The Fund and the Bank have a central role in supporting countries to address high debt service costs. We therefore call on the Bank and Fund to step up the roll-out the &lsquo;Three Pillars Approach&rsquo;, including a strong communication to countries who could benefit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Low-Income Country Debt Sustainability Framework plays an essential role in shaping debt relief and concessional finance allocations. We welcome the ongoing review and continue to call for a full integration of climate and nature risks and the benefits of adaptation investments, ensuring the framework recognises that investing in resilience today reduces risks for tomorrow.</p>
<p>We thank the Bank and Fund for their ongoing leadership on tackling debt challenges and welcome the recent paper on Private Sector Participation in Debt Restructurings. We recognise that additional complexity in restructurings has led to longer timelines and are committed to strengthening the debt architecture to support sustainable development and growth. This year, the UK has supported the establishment of the London Coalition on Sustainable Sovereign Debt&rsquo; to work with private creditors on sovereign debt issues. This includes finding solutions to prevent creditor holdouts and speed up private sector restructurings. In parallel we continue to work with partners towards a stronger and faster G20 Common Framework that is available to all low- and middle- income countries.</p>
<h2 id="imf">IMF</h2>
<p>The UK has always been a staunch partner of the IMF and supports its essential position at the centre of the global financial safety net (GFSN). Looking ahead, the IMF will need to help its members rise to both the challenges and opportunities facing the global economy, by becoming more alert to emerging risks; more active in preventing crises; and more agile in providing members with tailored and granular advice on how to navigate difficult policy trade-offs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, we need sharpened IMF surveillance. Surveillance is the first line of defence against macroeconomic and financial instability and as memory of the last global financial crisis fades, the IMF must focus and integrate its bilateral and multilateral surveillance to better anticipate risks and transmission channels and take a more systems-wide approach. This requires an ambitious Comprehensive Surveillance Review, including ensuring the Fund&rsquo;s financial surveillance to keep pace with rapid changes in non-bank finance and financial innovation. Bilateral and multilateral surveillance should also allow for a deeper focus on the spillovers to individual economies from the large structural trends facing the global economy, such as climate shocks, the increased role of market-based finance and digital money.</p>
<p>Amidst growing excessive imbalances, the IMF must also improve its analysis of drivers, risks and global spillovers, including the risks of a disorderly unwind. This should also include greater focus on sectoral overcapacity to strengthen evidence, policy coherence and build international consensus. External sector surveillance should be mainstreamed across the Fund&rsquo;s work. The Fund should combine its macroeconomic expertise with the WTO&rsquo;s trade expertise, allowing both institutions to more effectively highlight the risks excessive imbalances create for the global trading system.</p>
<p>Effective IMF programmes, with well-designed conditionality, are crucial to helping countries restore macroeconomic and financial stability. IMF programmes must incentivise long-term reform and strong country ownership. In a more shock-prone world, macroeconomic policies and buffers must be strengthened. Robust fundamentals remain the foundation for a pro-growth environment and the Executive Board should have clear options for restoring off-track programmes. We welcome the forthcoming Review of Program Design and Conditionality, and look forward to further discussions on how to: achieve a longer-term perspective on programme engagement; integrate surveillance and CD firmly into the Fund&rsquo;s lending mindset to ensure macro risks are detected early and authorities receive CD both to support programme implementation and post-programme momentum; instil programme adaptability and course-correction when unexpected shocks hit; better incorporate political economy and social conditions when designing fiscal adjustments and specific structural conditionalities; and learn relevant lessons from repeat/successive programmes to ensure the Fund helps countries tackle more persistent balance of payments (BoP) challenges. The review should also assess the effectiveness of lending and conditionality in protecting the poorest and promoting inclusive, sustainable growth, and consider how to best support fragile and conflict-affected states with limited administrative and reform capacity.</p>
<p>Third, the IMF&rsquo;s central role in the global financial safety net should be reinforced, with greater emphasis on crisis prevention and increased use of precautionary facilities. These tools help countries manage shocks and reduce the risk of crises that strain IMF resources and cause wider spillovers. A holistic discussion is needed on the IMF&rsquo;s role in relation to central bank swap-lines and Regional Financing Arrangements, and we look forward to engaging further on this broader question beyond just reviewing the Short-Term Liquidity Line.</p>
<p>Support for low-income countries and fragile states remains critical. The IMF&rsquo;s capacity development offer is vital as LICs face heightened impacts from weak global demand, commodity price shifts, inflation, trade shocks, and restricted financial flows. We call for the full implementation of the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust reforms to ensure its self-sustained lending capacity. Members must fulfil the necessary steps to facilitate an income transfer from the General Resource Account to the PRGT in the planned timeframe. We remain interested in exploring a targeted gold sale to support the PRGT when political conditions allow.</p>
<p>It is crucial that the IMF&rsquo;s governance continues to evolve and reflect the reality of today&rsquo;s global economy The UK remains firmly committed to quota and governance reforms to ensure the Fund&rsquo;s continued credibility, legitimacy, and representativeness in the eyes of all its shareholders. and. The UK delivered its consent to implement the equiproportional quota increase agreed under the 16th General Review of Quotas (GRQ) last May. We encourage all members to provide their outstanding consent swiftly to avoid any delay in restoring the IMF to a quota-based institution. As we were not able to reach consensus on a re-alignment under the 16th GRQ, quota share re-alignment through the 17th GRQ is even more urgent. This will ensure the IMF better reflects members&rsquo; relative positions in the world economy. Furthermore, the UK believes that adequate burden-sharing, coupled with the protection of the voice and representation of the Fund&rsquo;s poorest members, is essential. We look forward to continuing these discussions at the IMFC and Executive Board.</p>
<h2 id="tackling-global-challenges-illicit-finance-and-irregular-migration">Tackling global challenges: illicit finance and irregular migration</h2>
<p>We must also ensure development finance delivers its intended impact and is not lost to corruption. Each year, billions are laundered through the global financial system, draining resources critical for economic development. The UK is leading efforts to make company ownership transparent worldwide and is tightening our own rules to stop money laundering. We are also calling for stronger international action, including through a UK-hosted Countering Illicit Finance Summit. The UK values its partnership with the World Bank and IMF on tackling illicit finance and corruption, including through UK-supported Multi-Donor Trust Funds. We urge the Bank and Fund to further raise the global profile of efforts to counter illicit finance and corruption, build new partnerships across governments, civil society and the private sector to confront these challenges, and make full use of their expertise and resources to help countries build resilience against such risks and harms.</p>
<p>We welcome the role that the World Bank Group plays in tackling the drivers of irregular migration, including poverty, fragility and conflict. Done right, Bank operations can reduce those push factors &ndash; by supporting economic growth and job creation, increasing food security and access to basic services, and supporting countries&rsquo; resilience to crises and climate change. We welcome the continued commitment under IDA21 to creating economic opportunities for refugees and host communities. As we take forward the President&rsquo;s ambitious jobs agenda and refresh the FCV strategy next month, the UK wants to see innovative and holistic approaches to addressing irregular migration and forced displacement put on the table.</p>
<h2 id="championing-gender-equality-and-inclusion">Championing gender equality and inclusion</h2>
<p>Women and girls are half the world&rsquo;s population and half its potential. Achieving gender equality is therefore critical to achieving all our shared development goals. Last year we welcomed the Bank&rsquo;s bold ambition to accelerate gender equality through its 2024 &ndash; 2030 Gender Strategy and the strong integration of gender equality throughout the IDA21 replenishment. We will continue to hold the Bank to account on the delivery of the Gender Strategy, including via IDA21 &ndash; particularly on the critical areas of tackling gender-based violence and sexual and reproductive health. We encourage the Bank to ensure robust monitoring and accountability for gender outcomes, including through disaggregated data and transparent reporting mechanisms. We stand ready to work with the Bank and other partners to ensure that gender equality remains central to global development efforts and that no woman or girl is left behind.</p>
<h2 id="delivering-a-fairer-system-and-shared-prosperity">Delivering a fairer system and shared prosperity</h2>
<p>It is clear that the global financial system needs to deliver a fairer deal for developing countries and their citizens. Our modern approach to development will continue to be centred on genuine and equal partnerships delivered by listening to the voices of the Global South and making the system more representative of low-income and vulnerable countries. We are committed to working with all shareholders and with Bank and Fund management to translate ambition into delivery at speed and scale for those most in need.</p>

<title>Stable Amid Volatility: Bitcoin Now On Par With Gold Among German Investors</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><b>A recent representative survey reveals: Despite its&nbsp;sometimes sharp&nbsp;price fluctuations, Bitcoin has established itself as a key asset in investment portfolios of investors under 40. In addition, ChatGPT and similar tools are breaking down barriers in financial literacy.</b></p>
<p>BISON, Boerse Stuttgart Group&rsquo;s crypto trading platform for retail customers, has conducted a nationwide, representative study on the role of cryptocurrencies in society. The results give this asset class a boost because even though digital assets are particularly sensitive to geopolitical tensions and economic policy decisions, such as Trump&rsquo;s tariff policies, they are currently experiencing golden times. In particular, Bitcoin has evolved from a speculative asset to a crisis-resistant alternative alongside gold and traditional asset classes. Traditional assets, such as the U.S. dollar or U.S. government bonds, on the other hand, have recently suffered a loss of trust.&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;Cryptocurrencies have established themselves as a serious alternative to the traditional financial system. Above all, Bitcoin increasingly plays in the same league as gold,&rdquo;</i>&nbsp;explains Dr. Ulli Spankowski, Co-Founder and CEO of BISON.</p>
<h4><b>Diversification includes crypto</b></h4>
<p>This dynamic is also reflected in the results of the study. Among young investors, crypto is now more popular than gold, and the trend is picking up. In the age group 18&ndash;29, almost one in four investors (24.1%) already invests in cryptocurrencies, while one in five (21.8%) invests in precious metals such as gold: a difference of 2.3 percentage points. For those aged 30&ndash;39, the preference for crypto is even more clear-cut: 27.2% of respondents who invest in financial products choose cryptocurrencies, compared to 23.7% who choose precious metals. Investment behavior among 40&ndash;49-year-olds is evenly balanced (crypto: 16.6%, precious metals: 16.4%), but preferences start to shift in the 50&ndash;59 age group: 7.4% invest in crypto, while 16.1% invest in precious metals. Among those over 60, a traditional picture emerges with 12.7% investing in precious metals versus 2.6% in cryptocurrencies. &ldquo;<i>Bitcoin is no longer a niche product. Among investors in their 20s and 30s, the &ldquo;digital gold&rdquo; has already become a staple in a diversified portfolio. But interest in Bitcoin &amp; Co. is also growing noticeably among older age groups,&rdquo;</i>&nbsp;Spankowski interprets the results.</p>
<p>A&nbsp;generally positive&nbsp;attitude toward cryptocurrencies also varies across generations. Around two-thirds (66.1%) of 18&ndash;29-year-olds describe their stance as very or&nbsp;somewhat positive, followed by 65.2% in the age group 30&ndash;39. Even among 40&ndash;49-year-olds, the share with a positive attitude is still 44.4%. Only in the age group 50&ndash;59 does this value drop significantly to 24.6%, and to 12.6% among 60&ndash;70-year-olds.</p>
<h4><b>Digital transformation is driving financial literacy</b></h4>
<p>The study also reveals a fundamental shift in investment behavior. Younger generations show strong interest in the topic of investing and place particular emphasis on diversification across a wide range of asset classes, from savings and overnight deposit accounts to investment funds and ETFs, as well as stocks, real estate, and, of course, cryptocurrencies. A particularly striking finding is that 50% of those under 35 who are already invested say they rely on AI for support on investment decisions. Digital transformation is therefore clearly impacting financial literacy.</p>
<p>Dr. Ulli Spankowski welcomes this development and sees it as a long-overdue democratization of the investment industry:&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;The digital transformation has broken down barriers and enables everyone to acquire the necessary knowledge to invest money and build wealth. Offerings like BISON play a part in driving this democratization process. We want to provide all investors, whether beginners or experienced, a secure, simple, and modern way to access cryptocurrencies and thus to help ensure that building wealth is not a privilege but an option for everyone.&rdquo;</i></p>

<p>ASIC is inviting feedback on a proposal to extend the operation of two legislative instruments related to litigation funding until 31 March 2030.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Latest/F2020L00035"><em>ASIC Credit (Litigation Funding-Exclusion) Instrument 2020/37</em></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Latest/F2020L00034"><em>ASIC Corporations (Conditional Costs Schemes) Instrument 2020/38</em></a>&nbsp;(the Instruments) provide relief for litigation funding arrangements, conditional costs schemes and proof of debt arrangements that are not covered by the exemptions in the&nbsp;<em>Corporations Regulations 2001</em>.</p>
<p>These instruments are due to expire on 31 January 2026.</p>
<p>ASIC proposes to extend the operation of these Instruments to provide certainty for litigation funders, lawyers and members of litigation funding and proof of debt funding arrangements whilst the Government considers its policy position for these arrangements.</p>

<p class="component-text">Japan Exchange Group, Inc. (JPX) is pleased to announce that it celebrates the 40th anniversary of its Japanese Government Bond (JGB) Futures market.<br /><br />10-year JGB Futures have been attracting large numbers of investors, both in Japan and abroad. They originally started trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange on October 19, 1985, marking the beginning of financial futures trading in Japan, and were subsequently transferred to the Osaka Exchange in March, 2014.<br /><br />Over the four decades since 10-year JGB Futures were launched, JPX has strived to diversify its line-up by introducing products such as Options on 10-year JGB Futures , as well as 20-year JGB Futures and mini 10-year JGB Futures. It has also implemented system reforms that include extending trading hours and replacing trading systems.<br /><br />In addition, trading volume in JGB and interest rate futures has been steadily increasing in recent years as investors reaffirm the importance of these products in light of the changing direction of interest rates and other environmental shifts.<br /><br />JPX remains committed to enhancing convenience in the derivatives market and contributing to the development of Japan&rsquo;s financial markets.</p>

<h3 class="subhead-title" id="heading_2"><span>Comment from Yokoyama Ryusuke, President &amp; CEO, Osaka Exchange, Inc.</span></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p class="component-text">We are delighted to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the JGB Futures market and it is thanks to the cooperation of our investors and other market stakeholders that we have reached this milestone.<br /><br />Since it first began trading, the JGB Futures market has been evolving in tandem with Japan&rsquo;s financial markets. Over this period, I believe that by offering JGB Futures as a means to hedge against risk in JGB spot trading , we have aided the stable distribution of JGBs on the primary market and their smooth trading on the secondary market and, ultimately, have contributed to stability in Japanese financial markets overall.<br /><br />With Japan now moving away from zero interest rates, the role of JGB Futures and interest rate futures is changing. We will continue striving to ensure stable market operations and enhance convenience for all market stakeholders.</p>

<title>Nigerian Exchange Group: Project BLOOM Scales Up Impact With Second Outreach in Ajegunle, Lagos</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Nigerian Exchange Group Plc (NGX Group), in partnership with the Lagos State Ministry of Health and Health Emergency Initiative (HEI), has expanded its flagship community nutrition intervention, Project BLOOM (Bringing Life to Our Overlooked Minors), to Ajegunle under Lagos State Health District V, reaching over 120 children with their mothers and caregivers.</p>
<p>The outreach, held at Ajeromi Ifelodun Local Government Secretariat in partnership with the Lagos State Health District V, builds on the success and measurable impact of the pilot held at Yaba&rsquo;s Aiyetoro Primary Health Centre, where hundreds of children were screened and over 61% were found to need urgent medical intervention. Follow-up monitoring revealed that more than 48% of these children have shown remarkable nutritional recovery within weeks, regaining healthy weight and vitality. This progress has further strengthened the project&rsquo;s mission to expand its reach across underserved communities.</p>
<p>At the Ajegunle outreach, children received Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Foods (RUTFs) and comprehensive health checks, while mothers and caregivers participated in practical nutrition education sessions focused on preparing low-cost, nutritious meals and maintaining proper hygiene. Initial screening results revealed that 69 children were moderately malnourished, 29 were severely malnourished, and another 24 were at risk of becoming malnourished. The outreach also emphasized early detection of malnutrition and sustained follow-up care through local Primary Health Centres.</p>
<p>Notably, over 20 NGX Group employees volunteered alongside District health workers during the engagement, assisting with screenings, data collection, and caregiver training. Their participation reflects the Exchange&rsquo;s commitment to fostering a culture of service and social responsibility among its workforce. Through initiatives like Project BLOOM, NGX Group continues to encourage employees to actively contribute to community development efforts, demonstrating that true sustainability is achieved through collective action and shared purpose. This approach reinforces the organisation&rsquo;s broader commitment to building the long-term resilience of society and the economy.</p>
<p>Commenting on the impact, Group Managing Director/CEO of NGX Group, Temi Popoola, said: &ldquo;Seeing 48.8% of the children identified with malnutrition now in recovery, and others who were once at risk steadily improving, has been truly inspiring. It affirms that our partnership with Health Emergency Initiative and Lagos State Government, is driving real, measurable change in our communities. For us at NGX Group, building strong capital markets goes hand in hand with building strong communities, because inclusive growth and social well-being are the true foundations of a resilient economy. This recovery rate motivates us to do even more, to scale up, to reach further, and to continue investing in the wellbeing of underserved communities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Executive Director of HEI, Dr. Pascal Achunine, described the expansion as a vital response to the realities revealed by the pilot: &ldquo;The first outreach showed us the depth of the malnutrition crisis and the power of swift, coordinated intervention. The results prove that when public and private sectors work together with urgency and compassion, we can save lives and restore hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr Oladeinde Ebenezer Oluwaseun, Director Planning Research and&nbsp;Statistics, representing the Permanent Secretary of Lagos State Health District V, Dr. Oladapo Ashiyanbi, commended NGX Group and HEI for their &ldquo;unwavering commitment to restoring hope to vulnerable families,&rdquo; noting that the initiative aligns perfectly with the Lagos State Government&rsquo;s ongoing nutrition and child health programmes.</p>
<p>Project BLOOM continues to advance Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 2 (Zero Hunger), 3 (Good Health and Well-being), and 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) through measurable community impact, employee-driven engagement, and multi-sector collaboration.</p>
<p>With two successful outreaches completed, NGX Group is set to scale&nbsp;<i>Project BLOOM</i>&nbsp;across other underserved Lagos communities, with a long-term vision to reach thousands of children and across the state.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, he reviews the immediate economic outlook and its implications for monetary policy. He concludes that, while further cuts in Bank Rate over the coming year would follow from an evolution of the economic and inflation outlook broadly in line with what the MPC anticipates, it will continue to be important to guard against the risk of cutting rates either too far or too fast. On this basis, a more cautious pace of withdrawing monetary policy restriction than seen over the past year may be appropriate from here forward in order to ensure continuation of the disinflation process back towards the 2% target.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, Huw reviews how the framework for monetary policy at the Bank of England is evolving in light of the recent Bernanke review.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And third, he outlines some more concrete ideas about how that framework will evolve in the future.</p>

<title>Statement By Christine Lagarde, President Of The ECB, At The Fifty-Second Meeting Of The International Monetary And Financial Committee, IMF Annual Meetings, 17 October 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Since our last meeting in April, global economic activity has remained subdued but steady, despite ongoing trade policy headwinds.&nbsp;<a class="link-inline" id="_Hlk210113739"></a>This resilience partly reflected a frontloading of demand in anticipation of tariffs, which temporarily boosted activity but is unlikely to be sustained. As this effect fades, global growth dynamics are expected to soften further.</p>
<p>A predictable and open international economic order remains essential to sustain global trade, investment and shared prosperity. While recent preliminary trade agreements have reduced uncertainty, it remains elevated and may weigh on investment. The full impact of the evolving policy environment will only become clearer over time, but early signs are already visible in the reconfiguration of global trade flows.</p>
<p>Global headline inflation is projected to moderate gradually, though the outlook is expected to diverge across countries, reflecting the varying impact of the volatile global policy environment, especially in relation to trade and fiscal policies and geopolitical tensions. In this environment, while monetary policy stances are set to become more divergent, it is imperative that central banks have the independence to fully deliver on their mandates.</p>
<h2>Monetary policy</h2>
<p>In September the Governing Council kept the key ECB interest rates unchanged, with the deposit facility rate &ndash; the rate through which we steer the monetary policy stance &ndash; standing at 2.0%. We are determined to ensure that inflation stabilises at our 2% target in the medium term. We will follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate monetary policy stance and are not pre-committing to a particular rate path. In particular, our interest rate decisions will be based on the inflation outlook and the risks surrounding it, as well as the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. Earlier this year, in June, we concluded our monetary policy strategy assessment, confirming our symmetric 2% medium-term inflation target while updating the framework to ensure the effectiveness of monetary policy in an uncertain and potentially more volatile inflation environment.</p>
<h2>Economic activity</h2>
<p>The euro area economy grew by 0.7% cumulatively over the first half of this year. Stronger growth in the first quarter partly reflected a frontloading of trade ahead of expected tariff increases, which reversed in the second quarter.</p>
<p>Higher tariffs, a stronger euro and increased global competition are expected to hold back growth for the rest of the year, but the effect of these headwinds on growth should fade next year. Surveys point to robust growth in services, indicating some positive underlying momentum in the economy. Furthermore, despite some signs of softening labour demand, the labour market remains resilient. This should support consumer spending over time. Consumer spending and investment should both benefit from more favourable financing conditions as our interest rate cuts feed through to the economy. Increased government spending on infrastructure and defence should also support investment. This is reflected in the latest ECB staff projections, which foresee growth of 1.2% in 2025, 1.0% in 2026 and 1.3% in 2027.</p>
<p>Risks to growth have become more balanced as the likelihood of major tariff-related downside risks materialising has fallen, owing to the new trade deal. At the same time, the risk remains that renewed trade tensions could further dampen exports, investment and consumption. Geopolitical tensions remain a major source of uncertainty. In contrast, higher than expected defence and infrastructure spending in the EU, together with productivity-enhancing reforms, would add to growth. By fostering innovation, diversification and resilience, such ambitious reforms would also mitigate the economic tail risks arising from geopolitical tensions.</p>
<p>In the current environment, governments should address the considerable need for strategic investment while ensuring sustainable public finances. Where more efficient spending leads to higher growth, this would also create fiscal space, providing room for greater public investment in strategically important areas.</p>
<p>Strengthening the euro area&rsquo;s resilience and competitiveness is crucial in this environment. Following up on the recommendations in the reports by Mario Draghi and Enrico Letta with concrete action and accelerating implementation, in line with the European Commission&rsquo;s roadmap, remains essential. Moreover, completing the savings and investments union and the banking union to an ambitious timetable and rapidly establishing the legislative framework for the introduction of a digital euro remain imperative. Europe should take decisive steps to be ready for sizeable longer-term challenges, including in relation to digitalisation, climate change and nature degradation, defence and ageing populations.</p>
<h2>Inflation</h2>
<p>Headline inflation remains close to our 2% target. According to the flash estimate, it edged up to 2.2% in September from 2.0% in the previous three months, mainly because of an increase in the volatile energy component. Core inflation &ndash; excluding energy and food &ndash; was unchanged at 2.3%. Indicators of underlying inflation remain consistent with our 2% medium-term target. Nominal wage growth was 3.9% in the second quarter, down from 4.0% in the previous quarter and 4.8% in the second quarter of last year. Forward-looking indicators, including the ECB&rsquo;s wage tracker, suggest that wage growth will moderate further. Along with productivity gains, this will help keep a lid on domestic price pressures, even as profits recover from low levels.</p>
<p>The September ECB staff projections see headline inflation averaging 2.1% in 2025, 1.7% in 2026 and 1.9% in 2027. Core inflation is expected to fall from 2.4% in 2025 to 1.9% in 2026 and 1.8% in 2027, owing to the stronger euro and declining labour cost pressures. Energy price inflation is expected to remain volatile, but rise over the projection horizon, in part because of the start of the EU Emissions Trading System 2 in 2027. The outlook for euro area inflation remains uncertain, with the still volatile global trade policy environment responsible for both upside and downside risks. At the same time, as new information has come in, the range of risks on both sides has narrowed.</p>
<h2>Financial stability, euro area banking sector and non-bank financial intermediation</h2>
<p>Euro area banks are well positioned to weather headwinds, as shown by the 2025 EU-wide stress test, with high capital levels and strong non-interest income offsetting net interest income pressures. However, tariffs and geopolitical tensions are weighing on several sectors and may strain asset quality, although recent trade agreements have mitigated uncertainty. In this context, it is worth highlighting the role that the international regulatory framework for banks plays in preserving financial stability. While simplification and minimising undue burdens are welcome, they should not mean deregulation: well-capitalised banks are necessary to support the real economy, particularly during economic downturns. Banking sector resilience and compliance with international standards must be upheld.</p>
<p><a class="link-inline" id="_Hlk209610510"></a>Despite episodes of uncertainty, European markets have broadly demonstrated resilience, and the overall market sentiment is positive towards euro area government bonds. Current global market pricing and subdued volatility conceal persistent vulnerabilities, while extreme concentration in a small number of highly valued US tech and AI firms heightens repricing risks for heavily exposed euro area investors. The euro area non-bank financial institution (NBFI) sector has been stable, showing no significant signs of stress. However, liquidity vulnerabilities remain elevated. Coupled with pockets of high leverage, this could amplify potential market-wide stress, and the sector may face challenges from rising market volatility and geopolitical uncertainty. Strengthening the macroprudential framework for NBFIs, as the Financial Stability Board (FSB) recommends, is critical. Equally important are international cooperation and better data quality to close information gaps and support compliance with global standards.</p>
<p>In the digital age, payments are continuously evolving. The Eurosystem is progressing with work on a digital euro, while also exploring new technologies for settlement of wholesale transactions in central bank money.&nbsp;<a class="link-inline" id="_Hlk210040221"></a>With payments becoming increasingly digital, a digital euro would complement cash and ensure that central bank money remains an option for everyday retail payments in the euro area.&nbsp;<a class="link-inline" id="_Hlk210044176"></a>The Eurosystem&rsquo;s work to make central bank money fit for the digital age will safeguard monetary sovereignty and strengthen resilience. It will also enable private sector innovation and European private payment solutions to achieve pan-European reach, in turn enhancing Europe&rsquo;s strategic autonomy.</p>
<p>Developments in payments have also brought private innovations, including stablecoins. While their use within the euro area remains limited, stablecoins offer cross-border capabilities, which may bring benefits if properly designed and regulated. At this stage, risks to euro area financial stability appear contained. However, the global nature of stablecoins calls for consistent regulatory frameworks. By implementing the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCAR), the EU has taken an important step in this direction.</p>
<p>Currently, global implementation of the FSB recommendations on global stablecoins remains fragmented, with further progress needed. Fragmented stablecoin regulation raises many challenges for supervisors, including the risk of regulatory arbitrage, particularly if the same stablecoins are being issued from multiple jurisdictions.</p>
<h2>International cooperation</h2>
<p>In this increasingly uncertain global economic environment, the value of having the IMF as an impartial and trusted policy adviser and lender to countries with balance of payments problems cannot be overstated. We support a strong and adequately resourced IMF at the centre of the global financial safety net, and welcome its upcoming Comprehensive Surveillance Review, Financial Sector Assessment Program Review and Review of Program Design and Conditionality.</p>
<p>Given the urgency of the climate crisis and the significant economic and financial costs it entails, it is important that central banks and international institutions continue to address these issues within their respective mandates.&nbsp;<a class="link-inline" id="_Hlk210819995"></a>International cooperation should remain in place to help countries evaluate climate risks and strengthen resilience.</p>
<p>Over the past 80 years, the global economy has thrived on a foundation of openness and multilateralism. Any change in the international order that erodes integration or causes fragmentation into regional blocs will be detrimental to the world economy. As a major actor in international trade, Europe is committed to supporting open markets that are grounded in international standards and the rule of law &ndash; both of which are closely linked to robust and sustainable growth. At the same time, a well-regulated financial system, underpinned by independent central banks, will remain essential for global stability in an increasingly interconnected and shock-prone world.</p>

<title>SET Seeks Feedback On Enhanced Listed Company Rules To Boost Transparency, Align With International Standards And Streamline Regulatory Overlap With Thailand SEC</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/set-seeks-feedback-on-enhanced-listed-company-rules-to-boost-transparency-align-20251017/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/set-seeks-feedback-on-enhanced-listed-company-rules-to-boost-transparency-align-20251017/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) is advancing its regulatory enhancement on listed companies and disclosure requirements through a market consultation with stakeholders concerning "<b>Revision of Rules for Listed Companies and Disclosure Requirements for Trusts, Property Funds, and Infrastructure Funds</b>.&rdquo; The amendment aims to reinforce transparency and ensure comprehensive information disclosure, enabling effective, timely and well-informed investor decision-making while aligning with international standards and reducing regulatory overlap with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Seven key proposed regulatory amendments are as follows:</p>
<p><b>1. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Introducing</span> disclosure requirements for updated shareholders&rsquo; lists upon significant changes,</b> including changes in shareholding stated in Report on the Acquisition or Disposition of Securities (Form 246) and completion of tender offers documented in the&nbsp;Report&nbsp;on the&nbsp;Result&nbsp;of&nbsp;the Tender Offer (Form 256). Monthly updates are required following such report submissions.</p>
<p><b>2. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Introducing</span> disclosure of transactions posing risk to financial position and operating results including:</b></p>
<p>2.1 Upon recording of asset impairment, expected credit losses, or failure to recover deposits by the due date that exceed 50 percent of revenue or transaction value. Such information must be disclosed concurrently with financial statement submissions.</p>
<p>2.2. Upon detection by the listed company or its audit committee of material events that could adversely affect important internal control systems, immediate disclosure is required.</p>
<p><b>3. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Revising</span> backdoor listing rules </b>to be based on outcomes and substance of the transactions rather than the transaction structures, aligning with international stock exchange practices. This includes asset acquisitions from original owners, whether listed or non-listed companies, resulting in significant changes in business nature or controlling power. The revision also ensures consistency with the SEC&rsquo;s Material Transaction (MT) criteria to ease operational burden, such as transaction size calculation and backdoor listing procedures.</p>
<p><b>4. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Revising</span> Cash Company criteria </b>to be based on<b> </b>the overall asset structure. If a company's assets primarily consist of cash or short-term securities, it will immediately be classified as a Cash Company, regardless of whether this resulted from disposal of business operating assets. The revision also clarifies listing requirements for new assets.</p>
<p><b>5. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reviewing</span> C (Caution) sign requirements </b>by adjusting the timeframe calculation for <b>CC (Non-Compliance) </b>and <b>CF (Free Float)</b> signs from &ldquo;the date of disclosure&rdquo; to &ldquo;the date on which listed companies are obliged to disclose such information&rdquo; to prevent companies from exploiting delayed disclosure.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>6. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reviewing</span> disclosure requirements and related matters to reduce redundancy and align with the current context </b>including eliminating requirements that overlap with SEC regulations to prevent confusion in compliance, such as Material Transaction (MT) and Related Party Transaction (RPT) regulations. The revision also eliminates disclosure requirements for new product launches considered as the company's normal course of business, while adding disclosure requirement for bankruptcy filings against listed companies.</p>
<p><b>7. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Revising</span> disclosure requirements for Trusts, Property Funds, and Infrastructure Funds </b>to ensure consistency with listed companies&rsquo; disclosure requirements and appropriateness for these product characteristics.

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority: Banks Need To Help 'Break The Spell' Of Romance Scams</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The FCA found examples of banks going to significant lengths to protect those at risk of romance fraud, but also uncovered missed opportunities to prevent these scams, which cost victims &pound;106m last year.</p>
<p><span>One of the cases the FCA reviewed involved a victim losing more than &pound;428,000.</span></p>
<p><span>Romance fraud is a growing financial crime, with cases rising by 9% last year. Victims are deceived into sending money to fraudsters who engineer false romantic relationships or friendships. Over 8 in 10 cases (85%) start online, particularly through social media and dating websites, suggesting platforms have a critical role to play in preventing fraud and reducing harm.</span></p>
<p><span>In its&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/multi-firm-reviews/combating-romance-fraud-prevention-detection-and-supporting-victims" title="Combating romance fraud &ndash; prevention, detection and supporting victims"><span>romance fraud review</span></a><span>, the FCA has set out measures banks and other payment firms can take to protect their customers. These include better detection and monitoring systems, staff training, early identification of signs of vulnerability, and compassionate aftercare.</span></p>
<h2><span>Key findings</span></h2>
<ul>
<li><span>Intervention and prevention are made difficult for firms because victims may be 'under the spell' of the fraudster and reluctant to accept they are being defrauded. In nearly half (42%) of the cases the FCA reviewed, victims did not disclose the true reason for making a payment when asked.</span></li>
<li><span>Despite examples of good practice, there were multiple instances of firms missing opportunities to identify seemingly suspicious transactions. This indicated that firms could calibrate their monitoring systems to be more effective.</span></li>
<li><span>A key area of improvement is for firms to ensure their staff are trained to spot red flags and critically probe customer explanations. This was not consistent across all firms.</span></li>
<li><span>Many firms are providing a high level of support, occasionally exceeding the FCA&rsquo;s expectations, through compassionate and tailored engagement, although this wasn't consistent across all firms.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Steve Smart, executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said:</span></p>
<p><span>'Romance fraud is a vicious crime. All too often it is the vulnerable that fall victim. The impact &ndash; financially and personally &ndash; can be devastating. We recognise the challenge banks and payment firms have in combating this complex crime and this review aims to help them stay one step ahead of the criminals.</span></p>
<p><span>'We also all need to be on guard so we can protect ourselves and loved ones by recognising the romance fraud red flags.'</span></p>
<p>In one case in the FCA&rsquo;s review, the victim made 403 payments to a fraudster over the course of a year, resulting in losses of over &pound;72,000. The firm&rsquo;s investigation acknowledged that it had not identified the sustained, out-of-character activity.</p>
<p>Another case involved a victim telling bank staff they intended to send cryptocurrency payments to Iraq, claiming it was the only method accepted by their 'partner' in the military.</p>
<p>The FCA also saw positive examples of banks and payment firms going above and beyond. One firm made 11 calls over a 6-week period to support a victim, demonstrating a commitment to breaking the fraudster&rsquo;s hold and restoring customer confidence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another responded with care to a victim who had recently divorced and was supporting a child undergoing cancer treatment. They proceeded to closely monitor the victim&rsquo;s account.</p>
<h2>Romance fraud red flags</h2>
<ul>
<li>Alarm bells should ring if someone you&rsquo;ve only met online asks for money or suggests investments. Never send money (or crypto assets or vouchers), no matter how sad their story.</li>
<li>Look beyond the online profile. If someone asks you for lots of personal information, yet is unable to meet in person, then that could be a red flag. And use image checkers to see if their pictures can be found elsewhere.</li>
<li>Get a second opinion from a family member or friend if the other person&rsquo;s behaviour seems suspicious and you are being asked to make financial commitments you aren&rsquo;t comfortable with.</li>
<li>If you think you&rsquo;ve fallen victim, report it to Action Fraud or Police Scotland if you live there. Speak to your bank as you may be able to get a refund of money you&rsquo;ve sent &ndash; up to &pound;85,000 &ndash; and it can help to prevent further losses. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good afternoon, and welcome to the ISDA Derivatives Trading Forum. It&rsquo;s great to be back in Tokyo, and I&rsquo;d like to begin by thanking our sponsors &ndash; Mizuho, MUFG, Nomura and OSTTRA. We really appreciate your support.</p>
<p>This has been a very special year for ISDA as we celebrate our 40<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;anniversary. We&rsquo;ve been reflecting on ISDA&rsquo;s remarkable journey since 1985, when a small group of dealers got together to develop a common terminology for the swaps market. They recognized the need for greater consistency and efficiency to alleviate the document backlog and unlock the potential of the derivatives market. Their vision set the vital foundations of ISDA and enabled the market to evolve and grow around the world.</p>
<p>The initial group of dealers was mainly based in New York, but it wasn&rsquo;t long before ISDA became well established here in Japan. In the 1990s, members of ISDA&rsquo;s Japan Committee worked to develop a Japanese language version of the ISDA Master Agreement. They also advocated for the legal recognition of close-out netting, which resulted in key reforms being passed in 1998. Their commitment and diligence led to the development of a strong and vibrant Japanese derivatives market.</p>
<p>ISDA has changed almost beyond recognition since those early days. Our suite of documentation now spans thousands of standard agreements, definitions, confirmation templates and protocols. This robust legal framework has created certainty and stability for market participants, enabling the derivatives market to grow at scale.</p>
<p>Throughout its history, ISDA has maintained its commitment to consistency and efficiency. This has been the key to the success of our legal documentation work. It extends to the regulatory framework, and we advocate tirelessly for rules that are appropriate, risk-sensitive and aligned with global standards. It&rsquo;s also the basis of our digital transformation work, as we advance a set of industry solutions to bring greater automation to key processes.</p>
<p>In these remarks, I&rsquo;ll talk about three key areas where ISDA is now working to bring greater consistency and efficiency. First, the exchange of collateral. Second, the close-out framework for derivatives. And third, the completion of Basel III.</p>
<p><span>Collateral</span></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start with collateral.</p>
<p>The implementation of margin requirements for non-cleared derivatives has been one of the most significant changes in derivatives markets since the financial crisis. At the end of last year, leading derivatives participants had collected $1.5 trillion of initial margin (IM) and variation margin (VM) &ndash; up 6.4% on the previous year. That&rsquo;s a huge safety buffer that has been built into the derivatives market to mitigate counterparty credit risk.</p>
<p>But recent experience has shown that reducing counterparty risk has increased vulnerability to liquidity risk. During successive market shocks, firms have had to generate large amounts of cash to meet a spike in margin calls. In these scenarios, liquidity can suddenly drain out of markets, jeopardizing financial stability.</p>
<p>Steps are being taken to mitigate this issue, with many firms looking at alternatives to cash and government securities to meet their VM requirements. Cash already represents a declining share of total VM received, falling from 80% in 2020 to 68% in 2024, according to the ISDA Margin Survey. But there are certain economic, capital and operational constraints that prevent some counterparties from holding anything other than cash or government securities.</p>
<p>Money market funds, for example, could be an attractive asset to post as collateral, but the current workflow requires collateral to be posted as cash and then transformed by the custodian, which can lead to increased liquidity and operational risks. Gold could also be a viable alternative to cash, but the challenges of physical delivery mean this hasn&rsquo;t so far been possible.</p>
<p>Tokenization has the potential to alleviate some of these challenges. Once tokenized on a shared ledger, a money market fund could be much more efficiently mobilized as collateral and shares could be directly posted and returned, without any need for liquidation within the collateral management workflow. The tokenization of gold could also remove the operational challenges, allowing the instant transfer of holdings of gold as collateral.</p>
<p>ISDA is now working with stakeholders across financial markets to enable the adoption of tokenization and we&rsquo;re focusing on the key legal, regulatory and operational challenges.</p>
<p>ISDA will target two key areas. First, we&rsquo;ll work to establish clear and consistent legal and regulatory frameworks. This includes making sure derivatives transactions on tokenized assets are underpinned by robust documentation and legal opinions. We&rsquo;ll also seek regulatory certainty that tokenized assets will be permitted as collateral under the margin rules.</p>
<p>Second, we&rsquo;ll work to establish interoperability, underpinned by common data models, smart contract standards and messaging protocols. We&rsquo;ll look to leverage the Common Domain Model to establish common data standards and avoid technological fragmentation.</p>
<p>The tokenization of assets is a very exciting prospect that could improve the timeliness and efficiency of collateral management, bringing greater choice and flexibility for market participants. There&rsquo;s still some way to go, but we&rsquo;ll be working hard to overcome the hurdles and realize the potential of this powerful technology in derivatives markets.</p>
<p><span>Notices Hub</span></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll now turn to the close-out framework.</p>
<p>I mentioned earlier that the drive for consistency and efficiency lies at the heart of ISDA&rsquo;s powerful set of mutualized solutions, which are moving clunky, manual processes into the digital age.</p>
<p>One example is Digital Regulatory Reporting (DRR), which dramatically reduces the risk of inaccurate or incomplete reporting by converting an industry interpretation of reporting rules into unambiguous code. The ISDA DRR enabled market participants to implement updates to reporting rules in Japan last year with an unprecedented degree of consistency and efficiency. But we didn&rsquo;t stop there. Last month, we extended the initiative to support rule updates in Hong Kong &ndash; the eighth set of reporting requirements available on the ISDA DRR &ndash; and we&rsquo;re seeing increased adoption of this game-changing offering.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re also now bringing greater consistency and efficiency to the process of closing out derivatives trades. Up until now, critical termination-related notices had to be delivered by certain prescribed methods using the counterparty&rsquo;s address as listed in the ISDA Master Agreement. Physical delivery of notices has led to all sorts of problems over the years, with delays and uncertainty leading to serious economic consequences.</p>
<p>That all changed with the launch of the ISDA Notices Hub in July. With this new online platform, users can instantaneously deliver and receive notices from anywhere in the world, while also maintaining updated address details for those counterparty relationships where physical delivery of notices continues. At a stroke, the Notices Hub reduces the inefficiencies, risks and costs of physical delivery.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to say that more than 140 buy- and sell-side entities have now adhered to the ISDA 2025 Notices Hub Protocol, which provides the legal framework to allow delivery of notices via the platform. The Notices Hub is a vital step forward in modernizing the close-out process for derivatives trades and we&rsquo;re seeing widespread interest in accessing it. If you&rsquo;d like to join this growing universe of adopters, our team is available to help you with the onboarding process.</p>
<p><span>Basel III</span></p>
<p>Before finishing, I&rsquo;ll briefly touch on Basel III.</p>
<p>ISDA&rsquo;s position on the global capital framework has never wavered. We believe capital requirements must be appropriate and risk-sensitive to support deep and liquid markets. If capital requirements are set too high, this can lead to reduced access to funding, a lack of hedging solutions and increased vulnerability to external shocks. It&rsquo;s also important that the rules are as consistent as possible across borders. A lack of alignment creates added complexity for globally active banks, making it more difficult for them to effectively manage their risk and service their clients.</p>
<p>Here in Japan, the Basel III package has now been fully implemented, and the new market risk capital rules &ndash; the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB) &ndash; have applied to all banks since March 31. We commend the Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA) for its pragmatic approach by making certain targeted adjustments where necessary. For example, the treatment of sovereign exposures for the default risk charge was modified under the FRTB internal models approach &ndash; an important step that recognizes the lower risk of highly rated sovereigns and makes internal models a more viable option for banks.</p>
<p>We would urge policymakers in other jurisdictions to adopt this kind of pragmatism as they finalize and implement the FRTB rules. One of the key features of the FRTB is a much higher bar for the use of internal models. We know from our engagement with the market that this will lead to increased reliance on standardized capital models, and regulators should be mindful of the impact of this transition.</p>
<p>The design and calibration of the FRTB standardized approach will inflict the highest capital increases on those banks with large, diversified portfolios. Given the importance of portfolio diversification to maintain market resilience, this is a concern. We think regulators should be mindful of the impact of a broad-based shift to standardized capital models and consider how the high bar for the use of internal models could be appropriately lowered. Without corrective action by regulators, internal models will likely fade away, which would lead to disproportionate capital requirements and diminished market resilience.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not too late to address this issue. In the EU, implementation of the FRTB has been delayed until the start of 2027 and further changes are being considered. In the UK, the Prudential Regulation Authority recently completed a consultation on a set of changes to Basel 3.1, which include a delay to the FRTB internal models approach until the start of 2028. And in the US, it&rsquo;s unclear when regulators will publish their revised Basel III endgame proposals, although engagement with US agencies has begun.</p>
<p>ISDA will continue to engage with policymakers and market participants in pursuit of a capital framework that is both consistent and efficient, with the right incentives in place for the use of internal models. We must get this right.</p>
<p><span>Conclusion &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I started these remarks by reflecting on ISDA&rsquo;s 40<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;anniversary celebrations and our enduring commitment to consistency and efficiency. It&rsquo;s there in everything we&rsquo;ve achieved over the years, from the drafting of the very first standard documents to more recent achievements, such as the retirement of LIBOR.</p>
<p>It underpins the work we&rsquo;re now doing to enable the adoption of tokenization in derivatives markets, it&rsquo;s the driving force behind our digital solutions, including the ISDA Notices Hub, and it&rsquo;s the foundation of our Basel III advocacy. As we continue our anniversary celebrations and look ahead to the future, you can count on ISDA to maintain its focus on consistency and efficiency in everything we do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to finish by thanking our sponsors, speakers and delegates. I hope you find the event interesting, and I look forward to celebrating all that ISDA has achieved in Japan at our 40<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;anniversary reception this evening.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<title>US Federal Bank Regulatory Agencies Announce Withdrawal Of Principles For Climate-Related Financial Risk Management</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The federal bank regulatory agencies today announced the withdrawal of interagency Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions.</p>
<p>The agencies do not believe principles for managing climate-related financial risk are necessary because the agencies' existing safety and soundness standards require all supervised institutions to have effective risk management commensurate with their size, complexity, and activities. In addition, all supervised institutions are expected to consider and appropriately address all material financial risks and should be resilient to a range of risks, including emerging risks.</p>
<p>The interagency principles were previously issued jointly by the agencies in October 2023. The notice, which will be issued in the&nbsp;<em>Federal Register</em>, rescinds these principles effective immediately. The OCC withdrew its participation in the principles earlier this year.</p>

<title>US Office Of The Comptroller Of The Currency Announces Enforcement Actions For October 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) today released enforcement actions taken against national banks and federal savings associations (banks), and individuals currently and formerly affiliated with banks the OCC supervises.</p>
<p>The OCC uses enforcement actions against banks to require the board of directors and management to take timely actions to correct the deficient practices or violations identified.</p>
<ul>
<li><span><a href="https://www.occ.gov/static/enforcement-actions/eaAA-SO-2025-46.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Formal Agreement</a>&nbsp;with First National Bank of Pasco</span>, Dade City, Florida, for unsafe or unsound practices, including those related to board oversight and corporate governance, strategic and capital planning, Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering (BSA/AML) risk management and suspicious activity reporting, and violations of law, rule, or regulation, including those related to Suspicious Activity Reports and Due Diligence Programs for Correspondent Accounts for Foreign Financial Institutions. (Docket No. AA-SO-2025-46)</li>
</ul>
<p>The OCC uses enforcement actions against an institution-affiliated party (IAP) to deter, encourage correction of, or prevent violations, unsafe or unsound practices, or breaches of fiduciary duty. Enforcement actions against IAPs reinforce the accountability of individuals for their conduct regarding the affairs of a bank. The term &ldquo;institution-affiliated party,&rdquo; or IAP, is defined in 12 USC 1813(u) and includes bank directors, officers, employees, and controlling shareholders. Orders of Prohibition prohibit an individual from any participation in the affairs of a bank or other institution as defined in 12 USC 1818(e)(7). The OCC has taken the following actions against IAPs:</p>
<ul>
<li>The OCC does not have any enforcement actions against IAPs to release in October.</li>
</ul>
<p>The OCC terminates enforcement actions when a bank has demonstrated compliance with all articles of an enforcement action; or when the OCC determines that articles deemed &ldquo;not in compliance&rdquo; have become outdated or irrelevant to the bank&rsquo;s current circumstances; or when the OCC incorporates the articles deemed &ldquo;not in compliance&rdquo; into a new action. Termination actions include:</p>
<ul>
<li><span><a href="https://www.occ.gov/static/enforcement-actions/eaAA-CE-2025-48.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Order Terminating the Formal Agreement</a>&nbsp;with B2 Bank National Association</span>, Mountain Iron, Minnesota, dated November 14, 2023 (Docket No.&nbsp;<a href="https://occ.gov/static/enforcement-actions/ea2023-036.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">AA-CE-2023-36</a>).

The Formal Agreements addressed unsafe or unsound practices, including those related to deficient earnings, less than satisfactory liquidity and capital, and strategic plan execution, and violations of law, rule, or regulation, including those relating to BSA compliance.

<title>New Report Shows Importance Of Derivatives To Japan’s Asset Management Ambitions</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ISDA and Crisil Coalition Greenwich shows that derivatives are expected to play a pivotal role in Japan&rsquo;s ambition to become a global leader in asset management, but some barriers need to be reduced to enable the country&rsquo;s asset managers to fully take advantage of these instruments.</p>
<p>The report, based on discussions with 20 senior asset managers in Japan, shows that derivatives are viewed as essential tools for achieving investment strategies and objectives, with 80% of respondents highlighting their importance for both portfolio management and product development. Following the end of the Bank of Japan&rsquo;s eight-year negative interest rate policy last year, firms are expected to increasingly look to the derivatives market to help manage the implications of interest rate changes. According to the report, 90% of asset managers see value in expanding their use of derivatives.</p>
<p>In fact, 89% of market participants who responded to the survey believe further use of derivatives will directly or indirectly support the Japanese government&rsquo;s asset management strategy. Since 2023, the Japanese Financial Services Agency has announced a series of initiatives to strengthen Japan&rsquo;s position as a hub for asset management, including steps to remove barriers to entry and promote a diverse range of investment opportunities.</p>
<p>Despite these steps, market participants highlighted several issues that can constrain their use of derivatives, including uneven liquidity in some market segments, low levels of electronic execution and processing, regulatory and accounting issues and a shortage of local derivatives expertise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our report shows asset managers in Japan see real value in using derivatives to manage risk, enhance returns and enable product innovation &ndash; benefits that will increase the vibrancy of Japan&rsquo;s asset management sector and allow firms to improve their competitiveness on the global stage. We encourage regulators and market participants to work together to deliver the market, policy and infrastructure improvements necessary to unlock the full potential of Japan&rsquo;s derivatives market and cement the country&rsquo;s position as a leading asset management center,&rdquo; said Scott O&rsquo;Malia, ISDA&rsquo;s Chief Executive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Derivatives have proven over time to be useful tools that continue to provide benefits to Japanese asset managers and corporations alike,&rdquo; said Stephen Bruel, Head of Derivatives and FX on the Market Structure and Technology team at Crisil Coalition Greenwich, and author of the report. &ldquo;Removing the constraints will improve scale and efficiency and make those benefits more pronounced.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span>The Joint Committee of the European Supervisory Authorities (EBA, EIOPA and ESMA &ndash; the ESAs) today presented its 2026 Work Programme, outlining key areas of collaboration for the coming year.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li><span>BME's acceleration program has added 14 new companies so far this year with these two new additions.</span></li>
<li><span>Of the 53 companies that have gone through the EpM, nine have reached the capital markets.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The&nbsp;<span>Pre-Market Environment&nbsp;</span>(EpM), BME's acceleration program designed to support companies in their process of joining the financial markets, welcomes two new companies: Alfred Smart and Mectech Catalonia SL. With these additions, the number of new companies that have joined EpM so far this year rises to 14, while the total number of companies active in this initiative reaches 34. Since its creation, the program has had the participation of 53 companies, nine of which have already made the leap to the&nbsp;<span>BME Growth</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span>BME Scaleup</span>&nbsp;growth markets.</p>
<p><span>Alfred Smart</span>, a company belonging to the Amper Group since 2021, joins EpM with its sights set on the stock markets. Specializing in the digitization of buildings, the company is driving its transition towards more sustainable, connected, and efficient models using advanced technology and artificial intelligence. Its comprehensive platform allows all building systems&mdash;from access control to energy management&mdash;to be connected, automated, and optimized with the aim of improving ESG ratings and obtaining international sustainability certifications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For its part,&nbsp;<span>Mectech Catalonia SL.</span>&nbsp;is joining the EpM with the aim of boosting its growth and financing various projects through the stock markets, with a view to global commercialization. The company has begun this process with&nbsp;<span>Clyype</span>, an innovative respiratory protection device that filters both incoming and outgoing air, notable for its sustainable approach. This product, patented and certified by the Spanish Medicines Agency, is already in the manufacturing and marketing phase. Clyype is a modular device that, through minor adaptations to its hospital version, has successfully adapted to sectors such as pharmaceutical-technology, industrial, veterinary, and dental. The company is currently working on expanding its application to new areas such as chemical, emergency, and defense.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"We are very excited about the addition of these two new companies. The EpM is going through a significant period of growth: since last March, with these additions, there are now fourteen new companies and three new partners. The fact that companies are showing interest in training to gain access to the markets is always great news, and it clearly reflects the confidence that the markets inspire and the interest that companies have in them," said<span>&nbsp;Jes&uacute;s Gonz&aacute;lez Nieto</span>, managing director of BME Growth and BME Scaleup.</p>
<p>The Pre-Market Environment continues to consolidate its position as a key platform for preparing companies to access financial markets, offering training, visibility, and connections with investors and specialist advisors. The EpM is still accepting applications from new companies and investors on an ongoing basis.</p>

<title>ATHEX Sustainability Summit 2025: A Dialogue Platform For The Green Transition</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="scroll-animation visible"><span class="scroll-animation visible" lang="EL" xml:lang="EL">The inaugural&nbsp;<span>ATHEX Sustainability Summit 2025</span>, organized by the Athens Exchange Group, took place on&nbsp;<span>October 9th</span>&nbsp;at the Divani Caravel Hotel in Athens, concluding successfully.</span></p>
<p class="scroll-animation visible"><span class="scroll-animation visible" lang="EL" xml:lang="EL">In an ever-changing and demanding environment, where the principles of corporate social responsibility, environmental management, and social sustainability emerge as critical success factors, the conference provided a comprehensive platform for dialogue and knowledge exchange.</span></p>
<p class="scroll-animation visible"><span class="scroll-animation visible" lang="EL" xml:lang="EL">The conference focused on the challenges and opportunities arising from the implementation of Law 5164/2024, sustainability for small and medium-sized enterprises, and the "Stop-the-Clock" strategy. Emphasis was placed on the role of the Board of Directors in ESG strategy, the importance of sustainable investments and ESG assessments, as well as the contribution of digital tools in managing sustainability issues.</span></p>
<p class="scroll-animation visible"><span class="scroll-animation visible" lang="EL" xml:lang="EL">The event commenced with a welcome speech by Mr.&nbsp;<span>Nick Koskoletos, Chief Financial &amp; Issuers Relations Officer, Athens Exchange Group</span>, who, among other points, noted: "Today, more than ever, it is evident that sustainable development is not simply an option but a strategic imperative for modern businesses seeking to survive, grow, and attract investment. Companies that fully embrace sustainability will be the leaders shaping the future." Furthermore, Mr. Koskoletos highlighted: "In today&rsquo;s ever-evolving international landscape, Athens Exchange Group plays a proactive and pivotal role. From publishing the ATHEX ESG Reporting Guide to launching the ATHEX ESG Data Portal&mdash;a comprehensive tool for gathering and evaluating disclosed ESG information&mdash;we have consistently supported Greek listed companies on their journey toward greater transparency, accountability, and sustainability. ATHEX Sustainability Summit is the latest initiative in this effort, designed to be an open platform for sharing knowledge, best practices, and fostering collaboration among businesses, institutional stakeholders, and sustainability advisors."</span></p>
<p class="scroll-animation visible"><span class="scroll-animation visible" lang="EL" xml:lang="EL">Subsequently, Mr.&nbsp;<span>Sean Kidney, CEO, Climate Bonds Initiative</span>, delivered the keynote speech, mentioning: "Over a few years the green bonds market has exploded to EUR5 trillion outstanding. With Greek interest rates now lower than France&rsquo;s, and extra benefits viable from going green, governments and corporates have an opportunity to catch up with the revolution underway in energy and other areas. They can take advantage of investor enthusiasm for green to finance renewables, clean transport and climate resilient agriculture. That will help meet climate goals while making Greece better prepared for the heat, fires and floods of climate impacts."</span></p>
<p class="scroll-animation visible"><span class="scroll-animation visible" lang="EL" xml:lang="EL">Regarding challenges and opportunities from the implementation of Law 5164/2024 Ms.&nbsp;<span>Ifigeneia Koutiva PhD, Director, Climate, &Nu;ature and Water Services, EY Greece</span>, remarked: "74% of Greek companies that published sustainability reports by May 2025, in accordance with the CSRD Directive, did not have a comprehensive transition plan in place. To accelerate climate action, it is essential to first fully map greenhouse gas emissions, assess their projected evolution based on the business plan, and evaluate the technical and financial feasibility of reduction measures. In this way, organizations will be able to commit to targets aligned with the 1.5&deg;C goal and to disclose credible transition plans."</span></p>
<p class="scroll-animation visible"><span class="scroll-animation visible" lang="EL" xml:lang="EL">Mr.&nbsp;<span>Stamatis Dritsas, Deputy Managing Director, SOL Crowe Advisory</span>, during his speech about the role of the Board of Directors and its members to ESG mentioned: "The role of the Board of Directors in the preparation and disclosure of sustainability reports is pivotal for the implementation of the EU CSRD Directive. It constitutes a fundamental requirement for compliance with the regulatory framework and a critical qualitative factor affecting the quality of the non-financial information presented. The implementation of an optimal corporate governance system for the design and execution of the company&rsquo;s sustainable development strategy is disclosed in detail and at multiple levels within the sustainability report, with particular emphasis on the role of the Board and its oversight through independent committees. The qualitative characteristics of the Board&rsquo;s composition and functioning ultimately shape the "Tone at the Top" of the sustainability reports."</span></p>
<p class="scroll-animation visible"><span class="scroll-animation visible" lang="EL" xml:lang="EL">In the same context, Ms.&nbsp;<span>Rania Ekaterinari, President of the Executive Committee &amp; Vice-President of the Board, SEV</span>, marked among others: "The so-called &ldquo;stop the clock&rdquo; creates a state of limbo: businesses are left uncertain about the final criteria or when obligations such as CSRD/CS3D or the EUDR will actually apply. Without clear terms, concrete timelines, and functional compliance tools, serious strategic planning is impossible. What we need is realism, regulatory stability, and simple, enforceable procedures&mdash;not constant delays."</span></p>
<p class="scroll-animation visible"><span class="scroll-animation visible" lang="EL" xml:lang="EL">Additionally, Ms.&nbsp;<span>Smaragda Rigakou, General Counsel, Head of Legal, Regulatory &amp; Compliance Division, Athens Exchange Group</span>, emphasized that the greatest risk for businesses in the sustainability era is not compliance, but credibility. "Market trust is hard to earn and easy to lose &ndash; and this is immediately reflected in the share price." Ms. Rigakou also added that the CSRD raises the bar for Boards of Directors, which are now accountable for sustainability disclosures, while the Audit Committee takes on a pivotal role in ensuring quality, consistency, and transparency across all ESG reporting.</span></p>
<p class="scroll-animation visible"><span class="scroll-animation visible" lang="EL" xml:lang="EL">Concerning sustainable investing, ESG assessments &amp; investor relations, Ms.&nbsp;<span>Elisabeth Vishnevskaja, CFA - Head, Fixed Income, UNPRI</span>, pointed out: "It is clear that the case for responsible investment remains strong, with institutional investors remaining focused on long-term value creation and fulfilling their fiduciary duties. Active stewardship plays a central role in their sustainable investing strategies, helping to drive meaningful outcomes for both markets and a sustainable financial system."</span></p>
<p class="scroll-animation visible"><span class="scroll-animation visible" lang="EL" xml:lang="EL">Likewise, Mr.&nbsp;<span>Marco Macellari, Senior Director &ndash; ESG Business Transformation Lead, CRIF</span>, emphasized: "Analysis of over 2,500 Greek companies, representing the country&rsquo;s business landscape, reveals that more than 80% still face significant challenges in their green transition and are exposed to physical risks such as water stress and heatwaves. Synesgy Ratings, a technological spin-off of CRIF, is committed to promoting financial inclusion by providing ESG scores for all SMEs and tailored ESG ratings that capture the unique characteristics of corporate enterprises. ESG: Easy, Sustainable Growth."</span></p>
<p class="scroll-animation visible"><span class="scroll-animation visible" lang="EL" xml:lang="EL">From his side, Mr.&nbsp;<span>Chris Aesopos, Chairman of The Hellenic Fund &amp; Asset Management Association and Chief Executive Officer of ALPHA TRUST</span>, highlighted: "ESG is not a trend. It&rsquo;s a transformation. The journey is very demanding, but probably the most meaningful our generation is undertaking."</span></p>
<p class="scroll-animation visible"><span class="scroll-animation visible" lang="EL" xml:lang="EL">In the course of the CEO's panel, Mr.&nbsp;<span>Menelaos Tassopoulos, Managing Director, PAPOUTSANIS S.A.</span>, remarked: "Sustainability is today a top strategic priority and a key driver of competitiveness for every responsible business. At Papoutsanis, we integrate sustainability and innovation at the core of our strategy, investing in new technologies, resource optimization, and circular practices for the development of new products. We aim to reduce our environmental footprint, enhance social contribution, and create lasting value for shareholders, partners, and society. We believe that long-term success is built on responsibility, transparency, and collaboration, consistently serving our vision for a sustainable business future."</span></p>
<p class="scroll-animation visible"><span class="scroll-animation visible" lang="EL" xml:lang="EL">On the occasion of the event, Mr.&nbsp;<span>Nikolas Kakogiannis, Managing Director, ResNovae &amp; ESGenius! - The Sustainability OS</span>, mentioned: "The ATHEX Sustainability Summit 2025 served as a meaningful hub for the exchange of knowledge and experiences among highly skilled professionals, decision-makers, and innovators in the sustainability sector. The ESGenius! team, along with myself, had the opportunity to discuss critical challenges and opportunities in the transition toward a sustainable business model, as well as to present the next steps in our strategic roadmap. The well-executed organization of the conference acted as a catalyst for constructive dialogue and collaborations, reaffirming the importance of continuity and the evolution of the institution in the years to come."</span></p>
<p class="scroll-animation visible"><span class="scroll-animation visible" lang="EL" xml:lang="EL">Last but not least,&nbsp;<span>&Alpha;&Tau;&Eta;&Epsilon;&Chi; Sustainability Summit Moderator</span>&nbsp;Ms.&nbsp;<span>Faidra Mavrogiorgi, Journalist &amp; Owner at www.esgstories.gr</span>, remarked: "I am grateful to have been part of organizing and presenting the inaugural ATHEX SUSTAINABILITY SUMMIT, a day filled with insightful discussions and speeches from top executives in the market and business sectors. Through this initiative, the Athens Exchange Group demonstrates that sustainability is fundamentally intertwined with the economy and investment landscape."</span></p>

<title>Welcome Remarks, Federal Reserve Vice Chair For Supervision Michelle W. Bowman, At The 2025 Federal Reserve Stress Testing Research Conference, Boston, Massachusetts (Via Pre-Recorded Video)</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Welcome to the 2025 Federal Reserve Stress Testing Research Conference.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20251016a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;Although I am not able to join you in person today, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge the important contributions this conference has made and continues to make in promoting research on the stress testing process and related issues.</p>
<p>I would like to start by thanking the organizing committee, our presenters, and all of the participants joining us at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston at our Stress Test Research Conference. This event brings together academics, regulators, and industry experts, encouraging broad collaboration and rigorous discussion.</p>
<p>This conference marks a critical and necessary evolution in the Federal Reserve's stress test program. Stress testing is an important supervisory tool that was initially designed to maintain financial stability and establish binding capital requirements for the largest banks. As the role of stress testing must evolve, we have shifted our focus to enhance the reliability and credibility of both the process and its outcomes. Going forward, the Federal Reserve is committed to transparency and ensuring that public input and stakeholder comment enhance the program over time.</p>
<p>Stress testing remains an important element of the Board's capital framework and supervisory program for large banks. To promote public accountability and achieve robust outcomes, the Board plans to solicit public comment on various stress testing reforms later this month. This proposal seeks to ensure that any substantive changes are informed by public input prior to their adoption.</p>
<p>These actions are part of a broader set of capital-related measures designed to right-size and recalibrate the regulatory framework to better balance safety and soundness with the role of the financial system in promoting economic growth. The Board intends to leverage public and industry perspectives to further improve the stress test.</p>
<p>The stress testing package will provide detailed model descriptions, including assumptions and limitations for each model, as well as the rationale behind key modeling choices. The proposal will invite public comment on the specific modeling changes that the Board plans to implement for the 2026 stress test, including proposed changes that address the sensitivity of pre-provision net revenue projections to recent bank performance, and to improve the design and related assumptions for certain models including credit losses, operational risk and securities.</p>
<p>The second aspect of the proposal seeks comment on scenario design for the stress test, particularly the guides governing the variables included in the severely adverse macroeconomic scenario. The proposal would also include details on the macroeconomic model used to formulate the paths of the variables that are not determined by a guide for a given annual scenario. In addition, the proposal would cover disclosure of the global market shock framework, including the logic behind shock severity, liquidity horizons and the description of the models generating these shocks.</p>
<p>Third, the proposal would solicit public comment on the severely adverse scenario that the Board intends to use for the 2026 stress test.</p>
<p>While I have attempted to provide a high-level summary of the proposal, it is not possible to capture the depth and breadth of the changes. We look forward to working with all of our stakeholders to improve our stress test and reduce the year-over-year volatility in the stress testing results.</p>
<p>Before I conclude, I would like to recognize the dedication and professionalism of our stress testing staff at both the Board and Reserve Banks. The pending comprehensive stress testing package reflects countless hours of diligent work, perseverance, and collaboration. This robust and thorough proposal would not have been possible without the extraordinary commitment of all involved. I am grateful for your contributions and would like to formally acknowledge your essential role in this important work.</p>
<p>Thank you to our attendees for your continued partnership and dedication to research and collaboration in stress testing. Your engagement helps us build a safer and more resilient financial system.</p>

<td class="body-text">FIA and its affiliates, the European Principal Traders Association (EPTA), and the Principal Traders Group (PTG), jointly announce a new structure for the respective organisations that recognises the continued evolution and growth of EPTA and PTG, and their members, in markets outside of the cleared derivatives industry. With this announcement, EPTA and PTG will begin to operate independently of the FIA, advocating on behalf of their members in various markets and asset classes globally.&nbsp;<br /><br />FIA will work closely with both groups over the coming months to support the full build out of their independent organisations in the US and Europe. With the launch of these new independent associations, FIA plans to create a new complementary membership category to allow principal trading firms, including EPTA and PTG members, to continue as members of FIA participating in its conferences and on industry initiatives. &nbsp;<br /><br />&ldquo;Since their launch more than a decade ago, we anticipated a time when EPTA and PTG would evolve into independent organisations. Today&rsquo;s announcement is a testament to the power of these brands that can now serve as standalone organisations advocating for their members across multiple asset classes beyond cleared derivatives,&rdquo; said Walt Lukken, president and CEO of FIA. &ldquo;Principal trading firms serve as an integral source of liquidity for our global markets, and we look forward to working together as independent but aligned partners for the betterment of our industry.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;It has been a privilege to be part of the FIA organisation for almost 15 years,&rdquo; EPTA chairman Niels Lemmers said. &ldquo;I am proud of what we have achieved together, advancing the principal trading industry while building strong working relationships across the industry as well as with regulators and policymakers. I want to thank the FIA leadership for their collaboration and EPTA members for their commitment and support. Looking ahead, we will continue to represent our shared interests and advocate for fair, transparent and competitive capital markets that enable efficient access to liquidity for investors to ensure sustainable economic growth.<br /><br />&ldquo;Since 2010, FIA has been an outstanding partner to PTG and our members,&rdquo; said Graham Harper, Chair of PTG. &ldquo;As our reach expands across asset classes, it&rsquo;s the right time for us to become a standalone organization &mdash; but our commitment to open, competitive&nbsp;and transparent markets, and our strong relationship with FIA, will remain unchanged.&rdquo;<br /></td>

<title>Exploring The Possibilities And Risks Of New Payment Technologies, Federal Reserve Governor Michael S. Barr, At 2025 D.C. Fintech Week, Washington, D.C.</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.</p>
<p>Payments innovation is accelerating.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20251016a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;Stablecoins, artificial intelligence (AI), real-time payments, and richer payment metadata offer significant improvements to the cost, speed, and functionality of payments. Better payments functionality can help financial institutions and businesses manage liquidity more efficiently at lower cost. It can also mean that people receive their paychecks more promptly and manage their payments more effectively. Payments innovation is especially important for lower-income individuals who are often underserved by the financial system and lack financial slack.</p>
<p>For the bulk of my remarks today, I will focus on the benefits and risks of stablecoins. Congress has recently passed legislation that provides some clarity to issuers of stablecoins about how they can fit into the regulatory and supervisory framework. While there is a lot of work to do on the part of the government to fill in the specifics during the rule-writing process, increased certainty could lead to more rapid development of stablecoins and related products and services for businesses and households.</p>
<p><span>Potential Benefits of Stablecoins</span><br />I will start with some of the potential benefits of stablecoins. The primary benefit comes from the ledger itself, which can operate globally and encode functionality and conditionality directly into assets and transactions. This functionality unlocks a range of new financial use cases that were previously impractical when transactions required updating a series of ledgers spread across individual financial institutions.</p>
<p>The global nature of stablecoins is fundamental to their usefulness in parts of the payment system that have high friction, such as cross-border payments. Some of these frictions are necessary and important, such as those associated with complying with relevant laws and regulations on money laundering and terrorist financing. But removing or mitigating other frictions may reduce costs and facilitate more efficient transactions.</p>
<p>While today stablecoins are mostly used to facilitate crypto-trading activities, and secondarily as a dollar-denominated store of value in some foreign jurisdictions, I want to provide some examples where stablecoins may be useful for additional functions in cross-border payments.</p>
<p><em>Remittances</em><br />Stablecoins can be used to reduce the costs of remittances, since it tends to be more expensive to send remittances to jurisdictions with less-developed domestic payment systems.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20251016a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;As of a few years ago, stablecoins had only a limited ability to reduce costs because there were meaningful fees associated with on-ramping into stablecoins and off-ramping out to local currencies. However, stablecoin acceptance networks have arisen in some corridors that help reduce these fees and offer the potential to reduce the cost and increase the speed of remittances for those least able to bear these costs.</p>
<p><em>Trade finance</em><br />Stablecoins have the potential to also improve the speed of managing the paperwork and processes inherent in global trade and trade finance, perhaps with the use of smart contracts. In these applications, a digitally native form of payment could potentially be used to streamline the tracking and validation process that occurs between financial institutions, shipping companies, and customs warehouses and the companies that engage in trade. Small businesses might see lower costs and greater access.</p>
<p><em>Multinational firms' cash management</em><br />And for larger firms that have entities across the globe, stablecoins may help with treasury management. Stablecoins offer the promise of near-real-time global payments, helping multinational firms manage their cash efficiently between their related entities while still making payments through local internal entities in different countries, reducing costs and improving liquidity.</p>
<p><span>Risks to Achieving the Benefits of New Payment Technologies</span><br />I have mentioned just a few of the potential ways in which stablecoins can provide benefits to households and business. Continued investment in technology can also support compliance with important legal restrictions that prevent the use of the financial system for nefarious purposes. This investment will be a key area necessary for supporting stablecoins in achieving their potential benefits. Let me start with money laundering and terrorist financing.</p>
<p><em>The potential for technology to support anti-money-laundering compliance</em><br />One unique feature of stablecoins is their role as bearer instruments, similar to old-fashioned traveler's checks, but mostly operating on global permissionless networks that can include plenty of users with bad intentions. That creates particular challenges for preventing money laundering and terrorist finance, since bad actors can purchase stablecoins in secondary markets that may not have customer identification requirements. The U.S. puts a heavy premium on ensuring that all financial institutions comply with rules that seek to prevent criminals and terrorists from using our financial system. Financial companies, particularly banks, that take shortcuts on anti-money-laundering compliance sooner or later come to regret these shortcuts.</p>
<p>Compliance with Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money-laundering requirements can be very data intensive and costly, requiring significant staffing to identify and then address or resolve flagged issues. Permissioned networks with only trusted nodes doing the know your customer work can reduce the risks. Moreover, new technologies, used with care, can potentially reduce frictions on legitimate payments and speed up the identification of problem payments. AI may be well suited to flag payments that are outliers relative to typical patterns, potentially reducing the volume of false positives and unnecessary filings.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20251016a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;There may also be ways to improve the explainability of payments if they travel through the payment cycle with more data elements, such as those in the ISO 20022 standards recently implemented on Fedwire. There are also technologies that can aid with stablecoin compliance, such as trusted identity tokens in wallets that satisfy Customer Identification Program requirements and smart contracts that freeze stablecoins in problematic wallets. This suite of tools can also be used for preventing other types of crime, such as fraud.</p>
<p><span>A Rocky History of Private Money Creation</span><br />A second key area is financial stability. Let me take a step back and explain why I am focused on the financial stability risk of stablecoins. Caution is warranted because of the long and painful history of private money created with insufficient safeguards.</p>
<p>The fragility of private money is inherent in the way that it is created. Financial institutions issue liquid liabilities to the public that are redeemable on demand and at par, but issuers risk being ultimately unable to liquidate their assets promptly at par when facing run dynamics and market stress. Maturity and liquidity transformation can have social benefits by meeting the needs of the public for money-like assets and supporting the supply of credit to the real economy. However, for this social benefit to be durable, maturity transformation necessarily requires safeguards that address run risk.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20251016a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a></p>
<p>Looking at the long history of runs from private money is a helpful reminder of how these runs can happen and what's at stake when they do. For example, in the 1800s, during the so-called Free Banking Era, the United States had competing forms of private money in the form of bank notes. The value of these notes was tied to the creditworthiness, location, and credibility of the issuing bank, although some of the notes were backed by bonds issued by the state governments as well as other high-quality assets.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20251016a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;Despite these protections, the quality of the guarantees backing the bank notes was not beyond question, and they often traded below par. Concerns about the health of issuing banks, or of the states themselves in this era, resulted in regular bank runs and, in a number of instances, widespread financial panics. This stability of the system was improved over time, such as through legal changes that effectively required bank notes to be backed only by U.S. government securities. Nevertheless, regular episodes of runs continued to materialize until the Panic of 1907, which prominently featured a run on trust companies that offered deposit products backed by assets less liquid than the assets held by banks of the era. This episode led to the creation of the Federal Reserve System.</p>
<p>The historical examples point out that issuing liquid liabilities redeemable at par but backed by assets, even high-quality ones, about which creditors might have questions makes private money vulnerable to run risk. These same dynamics occurred even in much more modern times. The most notable example is when the Reserve Primary Fund broke the buck on September 16, 2008, one day after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, as the assets backing the fund came into question.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20251016a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;Pressures on money market funds also occurred during the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020, when institutional prime funds suffered outflows of about 30 percent of their assets under management within a period of two weeks.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20251016a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a></p>
<p>These experiences show the vulnerability of private money-like assets to runs, and how these runs can threaten not only the financial sector, but also the broader economy.</p>
<p><span>Issues in the Unregulated Stablecoin Market</span><br />The mostly unregulated stablecoin market has also experienced run dynamics in recent times. While people purchasing something called a "stablecoin" might reasonably assume that they can rely on redemption at par on demand, unregulated stablecoins are currently backed by a range of non&ndash;cash reserve assets that can make them vulnerable, especially under stressed conditions.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20251016a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a>&nbsp;Three key features&mdash;redemption on demand, at par, and backed by noncash assets&mdash;render stablecoins susceptible to runs similar to fragile banks or money market funds.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20251016a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a></p>
<p>Because stablecoins are not backed by deposit insurance and stablecoin issuers do not have access to central bank liquidity, the quality and liquidity of their reserve assets is critical to their long-run viability. At the same time, stablecoin issuers traditionally retain profits from investing reserve assets and therefore have a high incentive to maximize the return on their reserve assets by extending the risk spectrum as far out as possible. Stretching the boundaries of permissible reserve assets can increase profits in good times but risks a crack in confidence during inevitable bouts of market stress. The incentive to reach for yield can grow especially in lower-interest-rate environments. Stablecoins will only be stable if they can be reliably and promptly redeemed at par in a range of conditions, including during stress in the market that can put pressure on the value of even otherwise liquid government debt, and during episodes of strain on the individual issuer or its related entities.</p>
<p><span>Permissible Stablecoin Reserves under the New Legal Framework</span><br />To address these vulnerabilities in the largely unregulated stablecoin market, Congress passed the bipartisan GENIUS Act. The act's primary tool to mitigate the risk of runs is limiting permissible reserve assets to an itemized list of highly liquid assets.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20251016a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a>&nbsp;This is a significant improvement in an area where reserve assets for stablecoins have been highly varied. Tight control over reserve assets, coupled with supervision, capital and liquidity requirements, and other measures, could enhance the stability of stablecoins and make them a more viable payment instruments over the long term.</p>
<p>But success in accomplishing these goals will depend on the details of regulatory implementation. The GENIUS Act provides a helpful statutory framework, but it will be up to both the federal banking agencies and the states to coordinate and develop a comprehensive set of rules that can fill in important gaps and ensure that there are robust guardrails to protect users of stablecoins and mitigate broader risks to the financial system. Regulators have a lot of work to do to implement the act, and I will outline several areas that will require close attention.</p>
<p>For example, some of the enumerated reserve assets backing stablecoins are not immune to stress. Permissible reserve assets include uninsured deposits, which were a key risk factor during the March 2023 banking stress.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20251016a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a>&nbsp;While the GENIUS Act permits regulators to limit the concentration of reserve assets in uninsured deposits, it will matter how these rules are written.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20251016a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a></p>
<p>Additionally, in connection with overnight repo, the act permits any medium of exchange authorized or adopted by a foreign government to be held as a reserve asset&mdash;a category that could include potentially volatile assets.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20251016a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a>&nbsp;For example, until quite recently, El Salvador treated Bitcoin as legal tender, and it still specifically permits Bitcoin to be used for transactions on a voluntary basis. As a result, an issuer could argue that Bitcoin repo could qualify as an eligible reserve asset for a stablecoin. In a case of stress experienced by the issuer or counterparty, or if Bitcoin were to drop sharply in value, a stablecoin issuer could be stuck holding the Bitcoin that had declined in value, potentially compromising the one-to-one backing of the stablecoin liabilities. To the extent possible, regulations should be put in place to eliminate or minimize such risks.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20251016a.htm#fn14" title="footnote 14"><span>14</span></a><a name="f14"></a></p>
<p>In addition to the potential vulnerabilities of some permitted reserves, other aspects of the GENIUS Act might permit risks to develop unless carefully regulated. The act permits four federal agencies and agencies in each state and territory to serve as the primary regulator and supervisor of stablecoin issuers.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20251016a.htm#fn15" title="footnote 15"><span>15</span></a><a name="f15"></a>&nbsp;As a result, there might be a great deal of heterogeneity in the regulatory frameworks that apply to permitted issuers, despite controls in the act intended to provide that the frameworks are substantially similar. The resulting array of charter choice options, unless carefully managed, may provide incentives for regulatory arbitrage.</p>
<p>For example, the act permits federal and state regulators to authorize stablecoin issuers to engage in a broad range of "digital asset service provider" and "incidental" activities other than stablecoin issuance, including potentially acting as a crypto-asset exchange or broker-dealer.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20251016a.htm#fn16" title="footnote 16"><span>16</span></a><a name="f16"></a>&nbsp;Issuers are likely to seek to stretch these activities limitations. In fact, issuers may argue that they are permitted under the act to perform the full range of activities conducted by FTX, provided they make the relevant representations and conduct appropriate accounting. Unless state and federal agencies carefully coordinate, this could result in some state or federal regulators permitting a range of activities that might expose stablecoin issuers to increased risk.</p>
<p>The potentially broad set of permissible activities could raise heightened concerns in cases where stablecoin issuers are subsidiaries or affiliates of banks.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20251016a.htm#fn17" title="footnote 17"><span>17</span></a><a name="f17"></a>&nbsp;In such cases, the risks of expanded activities could affect the banking organization and the banking system more broadly. These risks are especially elevated because the GENIUS Act carves stablecoin issuers that are part of banking organizations out of bank and bank holding company consolidated capital requirements&mdash;even if they conduct a broad range of activities that pose risks that are greater than and different from those associated with stablecoin issuance.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20251016a.htm#fn18" title="footnote 18"><span>18</span></a><a name="f18"></a>&nbsp;Stablecoin issuers are only subject to the capital requirements implemented under the act, which could end up being too narrow to cover the risks of expanded activities.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20251016a.htm#fn19" title="footnote 19"><span>19</span></a><a name="f19"></a>&nbsp;Thus, appropriate capital requirements are another area where coordination among federal and state regulators is key&mdash;and it may be facilitated by the GENIUS Act's framework for assessing that state requirements are "substantially similar" to federal requirements.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20251016a.htm#fn20" title="footnote 20"><span>20</span></a><a name="f20"></a></p>
<p>Relatedly, the act enables stablecoin issuers&mdash;including those that may conduct an expanded range of activities&mdash;to be chartered by regulators as uninsured national or state-chartered trust banks.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20251016a.htm#fn21" title="footnote 21"><span>21</span></a><a name="f21"></a>&nbsp;This authorization and related decisions by regulators may result in trust banks that engage in a broader range of non-fiduciary, non-custodial, principal activities. Let us not forget a lesson hard-learned in the Panic of 1907&mdash;a lighter-weight regulatory framework for trust-chartered entities conducting bank-like activities can create opportunities for regulatory arbitrage and vulnerabilities for the financial system. Overall, these and other gaps may have implications for the safety and soundness of stablecoin issuers.</p>
<p><span>Consumer Protection Issues</span><br />The act also has gaps relating to consumer protection. For example, it does not apply to all instruments that are commonly referred to as "stablecoins," and certain dollar-denominated, tokenized products can continue to be offered and sold without being subject to the regulatory framework under the act.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20251016a.htm#fn22" title="footnote 22"><span>22</span></a><a name="f22"></a>&nbsp;This risks creating confusion and could result in consumers relying on payment instruments that they believe are regulated, but for which there are no prudential protections of any kind. To mitigate this risk, federal and state regulators should work together to prevent misrepresentations, including through their authority to prohibit unfair and deceptive acts and practices.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20251016a.htm#fn23" title="footnote 23"><span>23</span></a><a name="f23"></a></p>
<p>The act also lacks sufficient protections to prevent the mixing of bank-like activities and commerce, which could lead to an increase of economic concentration and create competitive distortions&mdash;potentially to the detriment of consumers.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20251016a.htm#fn24" title="footnote 24"><span>24</span></a><a name="f24"></a>&nbsp;And, finally, the act does not provide consumers with the fraud protections applicable to traditional payment instruments&mdash;including protection for unauthorized transfers.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><em>Alternative adaptations of payment technologies: Tokenized deposits</em><br />I have talked extensively about how the potential benefits of stablecoins can only be achieved if stablecoins can be reliably redeemed at par under a wide range of conditions. Importantly, the technology that supports stablecoins can also be used for other products&mdash;for example, tokenized deposits.</p>
<p>The benefits of tokenized deposits include that they are part of a regulatory framework that has been tested over time. Banks face robust regulatory and supervisory regimes proportional to their size and complexity. This supervision and regulation is paired with deposit insurance, providing confidence that deposits held in sizes relevant for most retail purposes will be available on demand at par. The resolution regime is orderly, which provides additional confidence about the stability of the instruments in a wide range of circumstances and reduces contagion. Moreover, banks have ready access to the discount window, where they can readily monetize assets on their balance sheets at a pre-specified interest rate under a range of market conditions, including the most dire. I don't want to say this system is perfect&mdash;it definitely is not&mdash;but it is far more robust than what we have developed so far for stablecoins. Thus, it may make sense for both market participants and regulators to consider how tokenized deposits will fit into this ecosystem.</p>
<p>As I said at the outset, stablecoins have the potential to improve the efficiency of the payment system, particularly in cross-border applications. For stablecoins to reach their potential, additional work is needed to create guardrails that protect households and businesses, and the financial system as a whole. While the GENIUS Act made important progress in creating a framework for stablecoins, a great deal will depend on how federal and state regulators implement it. If the regulatory framework provides strong guardrails and consumer protections, both the innovation represented by stablecoins as payment instruments, and the resulting competition in the payments space, could help foster payments improvements that benefit households and businesses.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<title>Cutting Rates In The Face Of Conflicting Data, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher J. Waller, At The Council On Foreign Relations, New York, New York</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Tom, and thank you to the Council on Foreign Relations for the opportunity to speak to you today.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20251016a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a></p>
<p>Since the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) last meeting on September 16 and 17, economic data have tended to support my view of a labor market that is softening and inflation&mdash;absent temporary tariff effects&mdash;that is running fairly close to the FOMC's 2 percent target. Based on what I know today, I support continued easing of monetary policy from its current setting, which I judge is moderately restricting aggregate demand and economic activity. But I also see a conflict right now between data showing solid growth in economic activity and data showing a softening labor market.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20251016a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;So, something's gotta give&mdash;either economic growth softens to match a soft labor market, or the labor market rebounds to match stronger economic growth. Since we don't know which way the data will break on this conflict, we need to move with care when adjusting the policy rate to ensure we don't make a mistake that will be costly to correct. I believe that how that process plays out in the coming months will have a significant impact on the path of monetary policy.</p>
<p>Resolving this conflict has been complicated by the government shutdown, which has delayed important economic data that policymakers and the public rely on to judge economic conditions. Although private-sector data alternatives are available and a helpful complement to official statistics, they are less informative when they stand alone. The delay in the September employment report in particular makes it harder to know whether the labor market is continuing to soften or is stabilizing. The shutdown also delayed today's retail sales report for September, which would help show if household spending is continuing to support solid growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) or if there are signs of slower spending that forecasters have been expecting for some time. Yesterday's and today's releases on consumer and producer prices were also delayed, data that is important in judging the impact of higher import tariffs and progress toward the FOMC's price-stability goal. The Administration has recalled some Labor Department employees to complete and release the consumer price inflation report on October 24&mdash;in time to inform the FOMC's policy decision five days later.</p>
<p>To deal with this lack of public data, I spend a lot of my time talking to business contacts, whose views help me form my outlook for the economy. So far that input tends to support&mdash;rather than resolve&mdash;the contrast we have seen between strong economic activity and a softening labor market. Employers indicate to me that there was some further softening of the labor market last month, while retailers report continued solid spending, with a bit of caution from lower-income households.</p>
<p>In the balance of these remarks, I will examine other information we have on economic activity, inflation, and the labor market, and what this implies for monetary policy. While I feel confident, based on what I know today, that monetary policy should take another step toward a more neutral setting at the FOMC's next meeting, the path of appropriate policy beyond that point will be influenced by how the conflict between data on economic activity and the labor market is resolved and the expected path of inflation.</p>
<p>While there are times when the data are consistent and paint a clear picture, the economy is vast and complex, and it is quite often the case that some of the data we look at will point in a different direction from other data and make that picture of the economy fuzzy. Almost every month, I need to use some judgment in sifting signal from noise in the economic data&mdash;it is just part of the job of economic forecasting and policymaking. Less often, but often enough, the conflicts in the data are consequential for the outlook. For example, recall that in the first half of 2022, the data were creating a puzzle: GDP was contracting while the economy created 2.7 million jobs.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20251016a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;These conflicting data on the performance of the economy complicated the decision on how to set the policy rate. We are facing a similar problem today.</p>
<p>I have been referring to the surprisingly strong data on economic activity, so let's start there. After real GDP expanded 2.8 percent last year, it slowed in the first half of this year. GDP&mdash;after smoothing through the modest contraction in the first quarter and robust growth of 3.8 percent in the second quarter&mdash;grew around 1.6 percent in the first half. This pattern of GDP growth is partially a result of consumption growth that showed a similar pattern. Slower growth in spending and GDP made sense based on the restrictive setting of monetary policy, but it was stronger than many expected with the imposition of sizable tariffs. And after not observing the effects of tariffs on household spending in the first half of the year, many thought it would show up in the third quarter. Yet, the data we have for the third quarter indicate that growth has accelerated. Looking across all the available data, the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model is projecting another quarter of GDP growth close to 4 percent, while the Blue Chip consensus of private-sector forecasts has a prediction of 2.5 percent. Even if the published estimate is closer to 2.5 percent, that is still not consistent with a labor market that has barely created any jobs since May.</p>
<p>One sign that GDP may be expanding closer to the lower end of these estimates is that business conditions seemed a bit softer in September, based on surveys of purchasing managers. The manufacturing sector continued to contract slightly&mdash;as it has since March. Purchasing managers for the large majority of businesses that are outside manufacturing reported a slowdown from August to a level that is at the breakeven point between expansion and contraction.</p>
<p>Something that will affect the growth rate of GDP in the fourth quarter is the federal government shutdown. If it is resolved in the next couple of weeks without major changes in government staffing or funding, the shutdown will lower GDP growth several tenths of a percentage point in the fourth quarter and raise it the same amount in the first quarter of next year. But if the shutdown lasts considerably longer and does result in permanent staffing and spending cuts, then the drag in the fourth quarter could be larger and the bounceback smaller.</p>
<p>Let me now turn to inflation. Twelve-month personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation rose in August to 2.7 percent, and core PCE inflation was up 2.9 percent&mdash;both above the FOMC's 2 percent target. Compared with an earlier era, when inflation ran close to 2 percent&mdash;from 2002 through 2007&mdash;core goods inflation is now running a half a percentage point higher, and research by Federal Reserve Board staff and others indicates that most of this is due to the effects of tariffs. Though a partial pass-through of tariffs will permanently raise the price level, tariffs will only temporarily affect the rate of inflation. The FOMC does not target the price level, but it does target 2 percent inflation over the longer run. Since I expect tariff effects on inflation to fade in the coming months, what matters for monetary policy is the rate of inflation outside of tariffs, and estimates by Federal Reserve staff indicate that this underlying rate of inflation is running fairly close to our target.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20251016a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;With market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations apparently well anchored and a soft labor market keeping down wage demands, I judge that inflation is on a path to a sustained level of 2 percent and should not itself be a barrier to moving monetary policy toward a more neutral setting.</p>
<p>Given this benign view of inflation, I believe the ultimate disposition of the labor market will be the more salient factor affecting monetary policy. As I said, the broad message of all the labor market data is one of weakening in demand, relative to supply, even with substantially lower net immigration and a decline in labor force participation this year. Monthly job creation went from an average of 111,000 in the first quarter to 55,000 in the second, and the latest official report for August was 22,000. The numbers are nearly the same for the private sector, which I consider a better guide to the overall labor market. Furthermore, based on an estimate of the benchmark revision to the level of employment in March 2025 and extrapolating forward for the rest of this year, when the revisions are released next year it is likely that payroll employment has actually fallen, on net, since May. If the economy is growing as healthily as spending and GDP data indicate, I would expect that employment would recover in the coming months to a positive but not high level, reflecting the reduced labor supply that I just mentioned. However, if spending and GDP growth slow, and better reflect an economy that doesn't seem to be creating jobs, then the labor market may continue to soften.</p>
<p>With the absence of the September employment report, we must rely on other data for a sense of what happened last month. Alternative labor market data for September present a mixed picture of how things are evolving. Private-sector employment tracked by the payroll services firm ADP points to continued slowing in job creation. ADP estimates that private employment fell 32,000 in September after falling 3,000 in August. The company said that "job creation continued to lose momentum across most sectors."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20251016a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;Data on job postings on the online job search firm Indeed also point to a continued gradual reduction in employment but don't signal of a significant downturn in hiring.</p>
<p>Indeed's openings data are useful in the absence of the September jobs report because, over time, they line up closely with another report for September that may be delayed: the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS). The JOLTS data, available through August, have been echoing what I have been hearing consistently from my business contacts, which is that firms are holding on to workers but are not backfilling positions or planning to expand hiring. Total separations are quite low by historical standards, and both layoffs and the number of people voluntarily quitting their jobs are low. At the same time, the hiring rate has continued to fall and, outside of the pandemic recession, is at its lowest level since 2012.</p>
<p>This situation may appear fairly stable, but I find this "no hire, no fire" stance by employers a bit ominous. It is possible that many employers who found it hard to find qualified workers during the pandemic are especially reluctant to let them go, even in the face of considerable uncertainty about demand and staffing levels in the future. But when workers do leave, they are not being replaced. Businesses have reported that hiring and expansion are "on pause," but some of my business contacts say that they can't wait forever and will soon have to decide whether more or fewer employees are needed. Both business and consumer surveys conducted by the New York Fed signal an upturn in expectations about future levels of unemployment.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20251016a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a></p>
<p>Looking further ahead, I can see two possible paths for the labor market.</p>
<p>On the one hand, we could see a stabilization of the labor market&mdash;in essence, it could move toward the story that consumption and GDP seem to be telling. Despite more than three years of restrictive monetary policy, spending has proved very resilient. Most forecasts called for a significant step-down in the pace of PCE growth this year, but that sizable slowdown hasn't happened. One factor that may help explain this is that the savings rate has been revised notably upward, resulting in higher disposable personal income and more support for spending. It is possible that resilient spending will help convince businesses to maintain staffing and even expand in the coming months, bringing about a recovery in job creation. Another possibility is that r*&mdash;the interest rate below which monetary policy stimulates demand&mdash;is higher than most forecasters believe. If this were true, then the current setting of monetary policy may not be holding back demand and economic activity very much, which would have implications for how quickly the FOMC should lower the policy rate.</p>
<p>Those are some reasons why the labor market may strengthen and validate the story being told, based on what we know so far, about economic activity in the third quarter. On the other hand, there are some reasons why the labor market could continue to soften while GDP growth steps down to a more moderate pace. For me, one of them is how dependent consumption is on a relatively small number of higher-income consumers. The highest-earning 10 percent of households are responsible for 22 percent of personal consumption. The top 20 percent of households spend 35 percent of the total. Their share of stock market wealth is even more skewed, and lots of research shows that these consumers are fairly unaffected by higher prices, higher unemployment, or a slower economy. The bottom 60 percent of earners represent 45 percent of consumption and hold only 15 percent of wealth. Their spending decisions are much more likely to be affected by prices, financing conditions, and job availability. I have heard from business contacts that this group has been affected by higher prices this year and is already changing its spending plans to find better value.</p>
<p>That view was echoed in the Federal Reserve's recently released Beige Book, which is a survey of business contacts.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20251016a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;The consensus view across the country is that while consumer spending inched down in recent weeks, spending by higher-income households on luxury travel and accommodation was strong; lower- and middle-income households continued to seek discounts and promotions in the face of rising prices and elevated economic uncertainty. At what point do higher prices prompt a larger cutback in spending by middle- and lower-income people?</p>
<p>Another reason for a greater weakening of the labor market is that artificial intelligence (AI) may reduce demand for workers. Over the past few months, retailers have told me that they will reduce employment next year because of the efficiency gains from AI. Firms are saying that they can and will replace workers in call centers and IT support with AI robots. This echoes what I read recently about the largest private employer in the United States: Walmart. Walmart says that despite expectations of solid sales growth, it plans to hold net employment steady for the next three years as AI replaces or transforms different roles at the company.</p>
<p>That said, while AI adoption is widespread among large firms, it is not nearly as common among smaller firms, which account for a large share of the U.S. economy, so the impact of AI on labor demand is uncertain. The implication of this for monetary policy is not so clear. Monetary policy addresses cyclical fluctuations in the economy, but if AI constitutes a structural shift in the demand for labor, monetary policy will not be an effective tool. Overall, I see AI as a short-term risk for the labor market, but, in the long run, AI should bring productivity gains that will be welfare improving.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20251016a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a></p>
<p>So where does all this leave monetary policy? Tariffs have modest effects on inflation, but with underlying inflation close to our goal and expectations of future inflation well anchored, I believe we are on track toward the FOMC's 2 percent goal. As a result, my focus is on the labor market, where payroll gains have weakened this year and employment may well be shrinking already. Lower labor supply has surely reduced what would be a good monthly rate of job creation, but I am very skeptical that it could be zero, or a negative number. Based on all of the data we have on the labor market, I believe that the FOMC should reduce the policy rate another 25 basis points at our meeting that concludes October 29. But beyond that point, I will be looking for how the solid GDP data reconcile with the softening labor market.</p>
<p>If GDP growth holds up or accelerates and the labor market accordingly recovers, it might be an indication that policy is less restrictive than I thought and that the pace toward a neutral setting for the policy rate should be slower than I expected at the last FOMC meeting. What I would want to avoid is rekindling inflationary pressure by moving too quickly and squandering the significant progress we have made taming inflation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the labor market continues to soften or even weaken and inflation remains in check, then I believe the FOMC should proceed to reduce the policy rate toward a neutral level, which I judge is about 100 to 125 basis points lower than it is today. The labor market has been sending some clear warnings lately, and we should be ready to act if those warnings are validated by what we learn in the coming weeks and months.</p>

<p><a name="fn2"></a>2. Some have suggested that this could be the result of higher productivity growth. However, technology that improves labor productivity leads firms to demand more labor not less. Later in these remarks, I consider whether AI may be contributing to the decline in recent net job creation, an effect on the margin of the huge U.S. labor market, but it seems too soon in AI's adoption for it to have significantly raised productivity across the entire economy.&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><span><a>Peer</a>&nbsp;review reveals significant gaps and inconsistencies in implementing the&nbsp;<a>FSB Global Framework for Crypto-Asset Activities</a>, that&nbsp;<a>could pose risks to financial stability and to the development of a resilient digital asset ecosystem</a>.</span></li>
<li><span>Jurisdictions have made progress in implementing recommendations on crypto-asset markets and activities, but regulation of global stablecoin arrangements is lagging.</span></li>
<li><span>FSB urges jurisdictions to prioritise full and consistent implementation, so as to minimise the risk of regulatory arbitrage and to improve the oversight of an inherently global crypto-asset market.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) today published a&nbsp;<a class="custom-internal-link processed-internal-link" href="https://www.fsb.org/2025/10/thematic-review-on-fsb-global-regulatory-framework-for-crypto-asset-activities/">Thematic Peer Review on the FSB Global Regulatory Framework for Crypto-asset Activities</a>. The report describes the findings of a peer review to evaluate progress in implementing the FSB&rsquo;s 2023 global framework, including recommendations on crypto-asset service providers and stablecoin arrangements, data reporting and collection, and cross-border cooperation and coordination.</p>
<p>Crypto-asset markets and regulation are changing rapidly. The review shows that, as of August 2025, jurisdictions have made progress in regulating crypto-asset activities and to a lesser extent global stablecoin arrangements (GSCs). However, it also reveals significant gaps and inconsistencies that could pose risks to financial stability and to the development of a resilient digital asset ecosystem.</p>
<p><a>While jurisdictions have made notable advancements toward implementing the recommendations on crypto-asset markets and activities, few have finalised their regulatory frameworks for GSCs. Even where regulatory frameworks are finalised, full alignment with the FSB recommendations remains limited, especially with regard to stablecoin arrangements and crypto-asset service providers. Moreover,</a><a>&nbsp;</a>jurisdictions may continue to update, modify, or refine their frameworks.</p>
<p>The review calls on the FSB and its member jurisdictions to prioritise work in this area and to do more to reach full and consistent implementation. Specifically, it puts forward some recommendations to address outstanding issues in terms of implementation progress, comprehensiveness and consistency, and cross-border cooperation and coordination. &ldquo;I<a>mplementation progress remains incomplete, uneven and inconsistent</a>.&nbsp;<a>This creates opportunities for regulatory arbitrage and complicates oversight of the inherently global and evolving crypto-asset market</a>&rdquo;, said Arthur Yuen, Deputy Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and chair of the team that prepared the report. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) also released the results of a thematic review on the implementation of IOSCO&rsquo;s Crypto and Digital Asset framework. A&nbsp;<a class="custom-internal-link" href="https://www.fsb.org/uploads/P161025-2.pdf">joint information note</a>&nbsp;provides an overview of the scope and the findings of the FSB and IOSCO&rsquo;s complementary reports.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Background</h2>
<p>The FSB published its&nbsp;<a class="custom-internal-link" href="https://www.fsb.org/2023/07/fsb-finalises-global-regulatory-framework-for-crypto-asset-activities/">global regulatory framework for crypto-asset activities</a>&nbsp;in July 2023. This framework consists of high-level recommendations for the regulation, supervision and oversight of crypto-asset markets and activities and revised high-level recommendations for the regulation, supervision and oversight of global stablecoin arrangements.</p>
<p>The Thematic Review on the FSB Global Regulatory Framework for Crypto-asset Activities evaluates implementation progress by FSB jurisdictions and some volunteering non-FSB jurisdictions but does not assess the effectiveness of the regulatory approaches undertaken by jurisdictions. The review was prepared by a team of experts from FSB member institutions and chaired by Arthur Yuen, Deputy Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.</p>
<p>The FSB coordinates at the international level the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies and develops and promotes the implementation of effective regulatory, supervisory, and other financial sector policies in the interest of financial stability. It brings together national authorities responsible for financial stability in 24 countries and jurisdictions, international financial institutions, sector-specific international groupings of regulators and supervisors, and committees of central bank experts. The FSB also conducts outreach with approximately 70 other jurisdictions through its six Regional Consultative Groups.</p>
<p>The FSB is chaired by Andrew Bailey, Governor of the Bank of England. The FSB Secretariat is located in Basel, Switzerland and hosted by the Bank for International Settlements.</p>

Ltd. (SHECA) as the latest Qualified vLEI Issuer (QVI) within the verifiable Legal Entity Identifier (vLEI) ecosystem.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN-US">Pioneered by GLEIF as the secure digital counterpart of the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI), the vLEI is a globally standardized form of digital organizational identity. By equipping organizations and their representatives with cryptographically verifiable identities, vLEI credentials offer a comprehensive solution that tackles the challenges arising from digitalization by establishing a global digital trust ecosystem.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN-US">SHECA, established in 1998, is one of China&rsquo;s pioneering Certification Authorities accredited by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), providing digital identity certificates and trust services widely used for secure authentication, serving over 7 million legal entities. In 2022, SHECA became a member of Shanghai Data Group. It has built a cross-border digital identity platform that integrates LEI records with authoritative legal entity data sources to provide enterprise query services and LEI-embedded digital certificates. As a QVI, SHECA will now expand proven capabilities to offer authoritative vLEI issuance, validation, and verification services.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN-US">This will help Chinese companies address regulatory requirements across various cross-border trade scenarios by verifying the identity of counterparties and their authorized representatives. It also enables both domestic and international organizations to use the vLEI to support the digitalization of trade by promoting increased security, trust, and transparency across key applications, such as e-invoices and e-bills of lading (eBL). Other digital transactions and exchanges will be supported to promote more efficient business operations &ndash; including contracts, labor agreements, certificates, and reports.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN-US">Alexandre Kech, CEO of GLEIF, said: "Increasing momentum for the vLEI reflects the fact that truly global commerce demands interoperable digital organizational identity solutions capable of delivering immediate and automated trust across borders. SHECA's approval as a QVI marks a significant expansion of the vLEI ecosystem in China, which stands to increase the adoption and application of the vLEI across the region to foster simpler, smoother, and safer trade."</span></span></span></p>

<p>In recognition of the rapid development and growth of crypto-asset markets, IOSCO and other relevant bodies, including the Financial Stability Board (FSB), have developed comprehensive policy frameworks for the regulation and oversight of crypto-assets and global stablecoins. To encourage full and consistent implementation of these frameworks across jurisdictions, IOSCO and FSB each undertook distinct but complementary thematic implementation reviews, both published today with an accompanying&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iosco.org%2Flibrary%2Fpubdocs%2Fpdf%2FIOSCOPD801-joint-note.pdf&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cmailing-lists%40iosco.org%7C28a4147e17bb4e19d1fc08de0c8e0701%7Cbcc6c66cdb3b48328af2cc363a097444%7C0%7C0%7C638962001330055088%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=93dXVPD0qsIYyID7N94vnF9ZdsLbyCNm8DmuQhjshVM%3D&amp;reserved=0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">joint note</a>.</p>
<p>The IOSCO Review was conducted jointly by its Fintech Task Force and Assessment Committee. With a focus on&nbsp;<strong>investor protection</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>market integrity</strong>, the Review examined how twenty jurisdictions, from both advanced and emerging economies, have implemented a set of IOSCO&rsquo;s 2023&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iosco.org%2Flibrary%2Fpubdocs%2Fpdf%2FIOSCOPD747.pdf&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cmailing-lists%40iosco.org%7C28a4147e17bb4e19d1fc08de0c8e0701%7Cbcc6c66cdb3b48328af2cc363a097444%7C0%7C0%7C638962001330070096%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=gUrKOm%2FmloyfH%2BPRjO3Xy9Fg%2FJQ0XOQiQuVeOGkaR3I%3D&amp;reserved=0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Policy Recommendations for Crypto and Digital Asset Markets</a>. The assessed recommendations cover matters related to governance, conflicts of interest, fraud and market abuse, cross-border cooperation, custody, retail client protections, and disclosures. The Review highlights both the progress made in regulating crypto-asset markets and the key areas for continued progress, such as&nbsp;<strong>promoting greater consistency in implementation</strong>, reducing&nbsp;<strong>risks of regulatory arbitrage</strong>, and strengthening&nbsp;<strong>enforcement practices</strong>.</p>
<p>The Review notes that&nbsp;<strong>the fast-evolving crypto-asset ecosystem still harbors risks related to investor protection and market integrity</strong>. The Review is a call for action for jurisdictions to take steps to monitor the existing and emerging risks and seek to fully implement the CDA Policy Recommendations, as early as possible. To this end, IOSCO will look to&nbsp;<strong>enhance its capacity building program</strong>, with the goal of facilitating knowledge sharing and assisting jurisdictions in their implementation efforts.</p>
<p>As jurisdictions are still developing and implementing their regulatory frameworks for cross-border cooperation, the use of existing mechanisms for sharing information across borders remains relatively limited. With most major crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) having a global footprint, there is an increasing need for&nbsp;<strong>closer international cooperation</strong>. The Review recommends IOSCO to monitor developments and consider enhancements to promote&nbsp;<strong>information sharing</strong>, including improved cooperation mechanisms beyond enforcement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In view of the fast-evolving crypto-asset ecosystem, this assessment report is an important milestone in encouraging jurisdictions to ensure that their legal and regulatory frameworks sufficiently address the investor protection and market integrity challenges posed by these markets. The complementarity between IOSCO and FSB reports, published on the same day, is material in analyzing the implementation progress. The IOSCO report demonstrates global standard setters&rsquo; ability to provide principle-based solutions to these global challenges.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ndash;&nbsp;<em><strong>Jean-Paul Servais</strong>, IOSCO Board Chair</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Cross-border cooperation emerges as a critical common area of focus both in IOSCO and FSB reports. Enhanced international cooperation is essential to address regulatory arbitrage and ensure consistent and coherent oversight. Our report underscored the need for proactive information sharing across the regulatory lifecycle, including during authorization, supervision, and enforcement stages.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ndash;&nbsp;<em><strong>Matthew Long</strong>, Director, Payments &amp; Digital Assets, UK Financial Conduct Authority, Review co-chair</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;While progress has been made in many jurisdictions, crypto-assets are increasing their footprint across the world. Our Report therefore notes that more is to be done, especially as new crypto-asset business models are being developed, existing risks are changing, and various new risks are emerging. The Report is an initial assessment conducted under IOSCO&rsquo;s Crypto-Asset Implementation Roadmap and will inform the development of an assessment methodology for future IOSCO reviews.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ndash;&nbsp;<em><strong>Laurent van Burik</strong>, Head of Unit CSSF Luxembourg, Review co-chair</em></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="paragraph"><span class="normaltextrun">The past 12 months have seen highs  and lows around the world. Difficult macroeconomic conditions, compounded by a turbulent trade environment and geopolitical tensions, have created challenges for African economies.&nbsp;</span><span class="eop">&nbsp;</span><span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph"><span class="normaltextrun">As a result, countries in this year&rsquo;s Absa Africa Financial Markets Index have seen their progress hampered by global headwinds. While a third of countries were able to improve their overall scores, the remaining two-thirds saw their  scores fall or remain unchanged. However, this is just the surface story. The detail shows important developments in a number of areas.</span><span class="eop">&nbsp;</span><span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph"><span class="normaltextrun">The index assesses financial market development across the continent through the lens of transparency, accessibility and openness. Now in its ninth year, it provides a benchmark for market infrastructure and an opportunity for policy-makers  to learn from improvements across Africa.&nbsp;</span><span class="eop">&nbsp;</span><span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph"><span class="normaltextrun">With support from the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, the index covers 29 economies in the region. This equates to approximately 80% of the population and gross domestic product of Africa.</span><span class="eop">&nbsp;</span><span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph"><span class="normaltextrun">Key findings from this year&rsquo;s edition include:</span><span class="eop">&nbsp;</span><span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="normaltextrun">While many economies faced a decline in reserves adequacy in the 12 months to June 2025, countries that prioritised tackling inefficient foreign exchange regimes fared best.&nbsp;</span><span class="eop">&nbsp;</span></li>
<li>In total, 18 AFMI economies now offer environmental, social and governance-related or Islamic financial products, providing crucial diversification for both short- and long-term investment.<span class="eop" style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN-US">Despite backtracks on ESG goals globally in the past year, </span><span class="normaltextrun" style="font-size: 11px;">four AFMI countries have issued green bonds for the first time this year, taking the total number to 14.</span><span class="eop" style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></li>
<li>Expectations for GDP growth rose in 22 countries this year despite the more challenging economic conditions.&nbsp;<span class="eop" style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="paragraph"><span class="normaltextrun"><b>As Kenny Fihla, Chief Executive Officer of Absa Group</b></span><span class="normaltextrun"> highlights:<i> &ldquo;On a headline basis, the last year may feel like a bit of a disappointment. But the detail shows that progress continues  to be made across the region, particularly in foreign exchange reforms, improved product diversity and action on climate change.&rdquo;</i></span><span class="eop">&nbsp;</span><span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph"><span class="normaltextrun">Despite considerable global challenges, there is much cause for optimism in this year&rsquo;s index. It is clear that the work done by countries in recent years has set the continent in much better stead to weather volatility. <i>&ldquo;This year&rsquo;s index comes at a pivotal moment for Africa,&rdquo; </i>says <b>Ahmed Attout, Director of Financial Sector Development at the African Development Bank</b>.<i> &ldquo;AFMI 2025 is more than a scorecard; it is a roadmap for building robust, transparent and  inclusive financial markets to power Africa&rsquo;s transformation.&rdquo;</i></span><span class="eop">&nbsp;</span><span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph"><span class="normaltextrun"><b>Claver Gatete, under-secretary general and executive secretary of UN ECA, observes:</b></span><span class="normaltextrun"> <i>&ldquo;Looking ahead, sustaining this momentum will require unwavering commitment to transparency, legal certainty and the expansion of domestic institutional investment.&rdquo;</i></span><span class="eop">&nbsp;</span></p>

<title>Finansinspektionen: Zimpler Receives A Remark And An Administrative Fine</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/finansinspektionen-zimpler-receives-a-remark-and-an-administrative-fine-20251016/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/finansinspektionen-zimpler-receives-a-remark-and-an-administrative-fine-20251016/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority (FI) issues Zimpler AB (Zimpler) a remark and an administrative fine of 3 million kronor for violations of anti&ndash;money laundering regulations.</span></p>
<div class="editor-content">
<p>Zimpler AB (Zimpler or the company) is a payment institution with authorisation under the Payment Services Act (2010:751). The company offers, among other things, a payment initiation services that natural and legal persons can use when purchasing goods or services online from retailers that have integrated Zimpler&rsquo;s payments services at checkout. The company also provides a service for outgoing payments for retailers and a service for account information that can be used by both retailers and their customers. The company also offers a currency exchange service for retailers.</p>
<p>Finansinspektionen has investigated Zimpler&rsquo;s compliance with central provisions of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Act (2017:630). The investigation shows that the company has been in violation of several of these provisions. In part, Zimpler&rsquo;s risk assessment has not contained an assessment of how one of the company&rsquo;s services could be used for money laundering or terrorist financing and the extent of this risk. The company also failed to assess the risk associated with a large number of its customers when establishing the customer relationship. For customers that have been risk-assessed, the company has not considered relevant customer risk factors that were identified in the general risk assessment. In terms of customer due diligence measures, the company has not requested information about the purpose and nature of the business relationship in all required situations.</p>
<p>The observed violations are such that there are grounds for Finansinspektionen to intervene against Zimpler. The violations are not so serious that there is cause to consider withdrawing the company&rsquo;s authorisation or issuing the company a warning. Finansinspektionen is therefore issuing Zimpler a remark that, in order to be an adequate intervention, will be accompanied by an administrative fine of SEK 3 million.</p>

<title>ASX To Implement Recommendations From Independent Panel Review On The Process For Developing Corporate Governance Principles And Recommendations</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asx-to-implement-recommendations-from-independent-panel-review-on-the-process-fo-20251016/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>On 12 June 2025 ASX informed members of the Corporate Governance Council (&ldquo;Council&rdquo;) that it had established an independent review panel (&ldquo;Review Panel&rdquo;) to consider how ASX should continue to develop and maintain appropriate corporate governance principles and practices for the Australian listed market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ASX has today released the Review Panel Report (&ldquo;Report&rdquo;) and confirms it will adopt the recommendations.</p>
<h3>Recommendations</h3>
<p>Led by corporate governance expert Quentin Digby, the Review Panel unanimously recommended that ASX assume ultimate responsibility for developing, approving and issuing the Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations (&ldquo;Principles&rdquo;). The Report recommended that ASX be supported by a new Advisory Group that would oversee the drafting and consultation process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Report proposed the Advisory Group be led by an independent Chair and that it should comprise between six and ten expert members who would bring governance expertise relevant to issuers, shareholders and investors. The Advisory Group members would be appointed in their individual capacity, meaning they would be expected to act in the interests of the market as a whole rather than represent the views of the industry group or constituency they happen to be drawn from.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Members of the new Advisory Group will be appointed by ASX from nominations made by relevant peak bodies and other stakeholders reflecting a cross-section of issuers and investors. Examples include a significant superannuation fund Chair or CEO; an experienced listed company director, ideally with experience in large and small listed entities; an experienced investment manager; an experienced listed company secretary; and a stockbroker with broad expertise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.asx.com.au/content/dam/asx/about/corporate-governance-council/asx-corporate-governance-council-review-panel-panel-report-20250901.pdf">Review Panel&rsquo;s report</a><a href="https://www.asx.com.au/content/dam/asx/about/corporate-governance-council/asx-corporate-governance-council-review-panel-panel-report-20250901.pdf"> </a>has been published on ASX&rsquo;s website today.</p>
<h3>Next steps</h3>
<p>ASX has commenced discussions with potential candidates who could act as the inaugural Chair of the new Advisory Group. Once appointed, the Chair will contribute to the development of a new Advisory Group Charter and will also be actively involved in appointing new members.</p>
<p>ASX is targeting the end of this calendar year for Advisory Group members to be confirmed and an initial meeting called.</p>
<p><b>Panel Review Chair</b> <b>Quentin Digby said</b>: &ldquo;The Panel was unanimous in reaching the conclusion that now is the right time to evolve the current approach to Australia&rsquo;s corporate governance principles and practices. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In proposing this model, the Panel considered the purpose of the Principles, international benchmarking and alternative models. The Panel also considered feedback provided by existing Council members and other market participants in developing its findings and recommendations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;While we did not have the remit to recommend changes to the Principles themselves, we did make an observation that there was strong support for the &ldquo;if not, why not&rdquo; approach and the new Advisory Group would do well to retain this as central to the Principles.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>ASX CEO Helen Lofthouse said</b>: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re pleased to have reached a new stage in how we will approach corporate governance principles for the benefit of the whole market. The Review Panel&rsquo;s recommendations are reflective of global best practice and the new Advisory Group should allow for a more efficient process.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ASX Corporate Governance Council has played a critical role in shaping corporate governance practices in Australia for more than two decades and I want to thank all those individuals who have generously given their time and expertise. I hope individual members will consider future involvement through the public consultation process that the new Advisory Group will oversee in respect of any changes to the Principles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would also like to thank the independent Review Panel members for the significant consultation that was undertaken in reaching its conclusions and the time they invested in reaching this outcome.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<title>Improving Consumer Outcomes Is Everyone’s Job - Keynote Address By ASIC Commissioner Alan Kirkland At The Institute Of Managed Account Professionals Independent Thought Conference In Sydney On 15 October 2025</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/improving-consumer-outcomes-is-everyones-job-keynote-address-by-asic-commissi-20251016/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/improving-consumer-outcomes-is-everyones-job-keynote-address-by-asic-commissi-20251016/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul>
<li>The responsibility for good consumer outcomes does not sit solely with ASIC.&nbsp; It is the responsibility of all who operate within the financial system.</li>
<li>Managed accounts are playing an ever-increasing role in Australia&rsquo;s investment landscape.</li>
<li>Given its growing significance, ASIC will examine compliance across the managed accounts sector, focusing on governance frameworks, management of conflicts of interest and most importantly, outcomes for consumers.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would like to begin by acknowledging the Traditional Owners, the Gadigal people of the Eora nation, and by paying my respects to their ongoing connection to and custodianship of the lands on which we&rsquo;re meeting.</p>
<p>And I extend that respect to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people here today.</p>
<p>Today, I want to speak briefly about consumer outcomes because at ASIC, the financial wellbeing of Australians is core to what we do &ndash; and we pursue that in a range of ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>we license and monitor financial services to ensure integrity and professional standards</li>
<li>we hold companies and businesses to account, ensuring they operate honestly and fairly, and</li>
<li>we publish educational resources and information through our&nbsp;<a href="https://moneysmart.gov.au/">Moneysmart website</a>&nbsp;to help Australians to make decisions that can advance their financial wellbeing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Toby mentioned our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/corporate-publications/asic-corporate-plan/" title="ASIC Corporate Plan">corporate plan</a>, recently released. Two of the five strategic pillars in that corporate plan are directed at the financial wellbeing of Australians:</p>
<ul>
<li>one that&rsquo;s focused on improving outcomes for consumers generally,</li>
<li>another supporting better outcomes for retirees.</li>
</ul>
<p>And obviously both of these priorities relate directly to your roles in the financial system and provide the context for my comments today.</p>
<h2>Improving consumer outcomes</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to start by making a general point, and that is that the responsibility for good consumer outcomes does not fall solely with ASIC.&nbsp; It is the responsibility of everybody who operates within the financial system.</p>
<p>For licensees generally, that means ensuring that you continue to fulfil your obligation to provide efficient, honest and fair financial services.</p>
<p>For advisers, that means acting in the best interests of your clients, providing appropriate advice and prioritising their interests over yours.</p>
<p>For fund operators, that means fulfilling your obligations as a responsible entity and licensee, including acting in the best interests of scheme members and providing efficient, honest and fair financial services.</p>
<p>For platform operators, that means continuing to perform your obligations honestly and with reasonable care and diligence.</p>
<p>And for ASIC, it means ensuring compliance through our supervisory and surveillance work and addressing misconduct where we see it.</p>
<p>You will all be familiar with your obligations under the Corps Act, so I won&rsquo;t rehash them here. However, there is one obligation that carries particular importance for people involved in the provision of managed accounts and that&rsquo;s in relation to the management of conflicts of interest.</p>
<h2>Managing conflicts of interest</h2>
<p>Recently we consulted on updates to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/regulatory-guides/rg-181-licensing-managing-conflicts-of-interest/" title="RG 181 Licensing: Managing conflicts of interest">Regulatory Guide 181</a>&nbsp;on the management of conflicts of interests for AFS licensees.</p>
<p>That guide had not been amended since 2004, and so we need to update it to reflect changes in the law and policy.</p>
<p>As&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/regulatory-guides/rg-181-licensing-managing-conflicts-of-interest/" title="RG 181 Licensing: Managing conflicts of interest">RG 181</a>&nbsp;in its current and proposed revised form makes clear, a number of provisions of the Corps Act raise obligations in relation to conflicts, depending on an individual or entity&rsquo;s role in the provision of financial services &ndash; but one of the most important is the core obligation in s912A(1)(aa) to have adequate arrangements for the management of conflicts of interest that may arise wholly or partially in relation to the provision of financial services by the licensee or their representative.</p>
<p>That obligation is very broadly framed. And it is articulated in the law as a key obligation of licensees. The intent of parliament is very clear. And we expect licensees under that obligation to engage deeply, and on a regular basis, to understand where conflicts may arise and ensure that their arrangements for addressing those conflicts are adequate.</p>
<p>The proposed changes to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/regulatory-guides/rg-181-licensing-managing-conflicts-of-interest/" title="RG 181 Licensing: Managing conflicts of interest">RG 181</a>&nbsp;have been informed by observations from our surveillance and enforcement work in recent years. They aim to better articulate:</p>
<ul>
<li>how the law applies, including its scope and operation with other related obligations</li>
<li>the types of conflicts that you need to identify and manage in order to meet your obligations</li>
<li>the need to have robust and tailored arrangements that are adequate to manage those conflicts, and</li>
<li>how you can effectively manage conflicts.</li>
</ul>
<p>And I want to say that we welcomed the engagement of many people in this room with our consultation process and we aim to publish the final updated guidance by the end of the year.</p>
<h2>A sector growing in size and influence</h2>
<p>Moving on to managed accounts specifically.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear that managed accounts are playing an ever-increasing role in Australia&rsquo;s investment landscape.</p>
<p>Based on IMAP data, funds under management have increased by an average of 24% each year since 2019<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/improving-consumer-outcomes-is-everyone-s-job/#fn1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Of course, much of that growth has been in Separately Managed Accounts, which form the largest category of the overall managed accounts sector &ndash; with the other main category for retail clients being Managed Discretionary Accounts.</p>
<p>And - I mentioned the growth rates - when regulators see shifts like this in market composition and dynamics, we are naturally interested. We are interested in:</p>
<ul>
<li>what is driving these changes</li>
<li>what the impacts are</li>
<li>how different incentives might influence these changes, and most importantly</li>
<li>what they mean for consumers.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that is why our corporate plan for the coming year highlights managed accounts as an area of focus.</p>
<h2>Reviewing compliance in the managed accounts sector</h2>
<p>It has been a number of years since ASIC took a detailed look at this area and given the growth and potential risks we are seeing, we consider a review is both warranted, and timely.</p>
<p>Our focus will be on licensees and advisers who recommend or offer managed accounts to&nbsp;<strong>retail</strong>&nbsp;clients.</p>
<p>We will examine how licensees are managing compliance with their general obligations - which at their core require industry participants to act efficiently, honestly and fairly.</p>
<p>We will examine how financial advisers - when they recommend managed accounts - comply with their obligations to act in the best interests of their client and provide appropriate advice.</p>
<p>And we will be examining what conflicts of interest may be present, and how these conflicts are addressed by advisers and licensees.</p>
<p>Managed accounts can be very attractive for licensees at all parts of the product manufacturing and distribution value chain. So, we&rsquo;ll be looking at what conflicts may arise, what challenges they may present and how they are being managed.</p>
<p>Planning and scoping for this surveillance work is currently underway. Some of you have been involved in that, and I thank you for your involvement to date.</p>
<h2>The behaviour of bad actors impacts everyone</h2>
<p>Turning now from our surveillance work to our enforcement work.</p>
<p>At ASIC, addressing misconduct and holding wrongdoers to account is a major part of our work.</p>
<p>This year we have banned 16 financial advisers and 40 responsible managers, brokers or investment managers for non-compliance with their obligations.</p>
<p>We recognise that the overwhelming majority of financial services are doing the right thing by their clients, but we also recognise &ndash; like you &ndash; that the behaviour of a small number of bad actors can cause significant harm to consumers and threaten the reputation of an entire industry.</p>
<p>While we can never eliminate all bad actors, we need to work together to minimise the impact of misconduct.</p>
<p>We all have a role to play.</p>
<p>Licensees, it is your responsibility to ensure advisers are acting in the best interests of clients, and to have adequate monitoring and supervision arrangements to detect concerning conduct.</p>
<p>Advisers, you are in a unique position to recognise where somebody has been the victim of poor advice from somebody else.</p>
<p>Individually and in cooperation your peers, you must uphold and promote the ethical standards of the profession and hold each other accountable for the protection of the public interest<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/improving-consumer-outcomes-is-everyone-s-job/#fn2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Where you detect concerning conduct, we encourage you to report it to ASIC.</p>
<p>At ASIC we continue to crack down on misconduct because we are all too aware of the significant harm that it can cause.</p>
<p>Just look at the devastating fallout from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/asic-investigations-and-enforcement/enforcement-activities/shield-master-fund/" title="Shield Master Fund">Shield</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/asic-investigations-and-enforcement/enforcement-activities/first-guardian-master-fund/" title="First Guardian Master Fund">First Guardian</a>&nbsp;failures where best interests duties and conflict of interest obligations appear to have been blatantly disregarded.</p>
<p>While these two matters - and to call them two matters grossly [unintelligible] simplifies the complexity of what we&rsquo;re dealing with &ndash; while they&rsquo;ve dominated the headlines, they are not the only instances where industry professionals appear to be playing fast and loose with people&rsquo;s life savings.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve currently got active investigations into multiple high-risk super switching matters, each involving multiple third parties and associates.</p>
<p>In the case of Shield and First Guardian alone, we&rsquo;ve got more than 40 staff involved in these matters, making it one of our largest enforcement projects in many years.</p>
<p>We are scrutinising as part of that every part of the value chain. So that includes the lead generators, the financial advisers, the advice licensees, the superannuation trustees that hosted the funds on their platforms, those involved in rating the funds, and the auditors and operators of the managed investment schemes themselves.</p>
<p>So far, we have been in court more than 45 times. We have issued stop orders to prevent ongoing harm, frozen assets, made applications to courts for the appointment of receivers and liquidators. We&rsquo;ve obtained travel restraints, cancelled financial services licenses and banned financial advisers. And you should expect to see more of that.</p>
<p>As you&rsquo;re likely aware, there has recently been positive news for some investors.</p>
<p>Late last month, we commenced proceedings against Macquarie in the Federal Court following admissions that it did not act efficiently, honestly and fairly by failing to place Shield on a watch list for heightened monitoring.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-215mr-macquarie-admits-to-shield-contraventions-and-commits-to-pay-affected-members/" title="25-215MR Macquarie admits to Shield contraventions and commits to pay affected members">Macquarie also importantly committed to repaying investors</a>&nbsp;100% of the net cash they invested in Shield through Macquarie&rsquo;s wrap platform.</p>
<p>This decision returns the 3,000 affected members to the position they were in before their retirement savings were eroded.</p>
<p>ASIC has also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-176mr-asic-sues-equity-trustees-alleging-due-diligence-failures-relating-to-shield/" title="25-176MR ASIC sues Equity Trustees alleging due diligence failures relating to Shield">commenced civil penalty proceedings in the Federal Court against Equity Trustees Superannuation Limited</a>, alleging failures in due diligence concerning Shield. And last week we sought to amend those proceedings to seek compensation for the 3,000 investors who invested in Shield through Equity Trustees.</p>
<p>However, our work is far from done. It has been, and continues to be, one of the most complex and resource-intensive investigations in ASIC&rsquo;s history.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re fully invested in combatting the misconduct behind high-risk super switching but it requires a whole of system response.</p>
<p>While we can never eliminate all bad actors, by working together we can minimise the impact of misconduct and ensure better outcomes for more Australians.</p>
<h2>Close</h2>
<p>And while that work on high-risk super switching is a major priority, it is not the only area of our work of relevance to people in this room.</p>
<p>We have a range of investigations and enforcement actions underway in relation to conduct that we consider to have involved serious breaches of the law, resulting in significant harm to consumers.</p>
<p>And in that context, I want to say, at events like this people often ask me what they need to do to avoid being on the other end of one of those actions. If that&rsquo;s a question on your mind, I&rsquo;d go back to the comments I made at the start.</p>
<p>Everybody in the system has a role in promoting good consumer outcomes.</p>
<p>And while, as I&rsquo;ve said, there are a range of detailed legal obligations that articulate what that means in practice, when you strip it back to basics, promoting good consumer outcomes involves a few basic things:</p>
<ul>
<li>understanding your role in the system</li>
<li>understanding the risks that come with that and, most importantly</li>
<li>taking a close and ongoing interest in what happens to the consumers who engage with your services or products, directly or indirectly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because when you fail to do these things, and that results in significant harm to consumers, we&rsquo;re much more likely to come knocking.</p>
<p>Thanks for the opportunity to make a few opening remarks. I&rsquo;m now happy to take some questions.</p>

<title>US Office Of The Comptroller Of The Currency Announces Conditional Approval For Chartering Erebor Bank</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) announced today that it has conditionally approved the de novo national bank charter application for Erebor Bank, National Association, Columbus, Ohio.</p>
<p>The OCC granted preliminary conditional approval to Erebor Bank after thorough review of its application. In granting this charter, the OCC applied the same rigorous review and standards applied to all charter applications.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Erebor is the first de novo bank to receive a preliminary conditional approval since I arrived at the OCC. I am committed to a dynamic and diverse federal banking system, and our decision today is a first but important step in living up to that commitment,&rdquo; said Comptroller of the Currency Jonathan V. Gould. &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s decision is also proof that the OCC under my leadership does not impose blanket barriers to banks that want to engage in digital asset activities. Permissible digital asset activities, like any other legally permissible banking activity, have a place in the federal banking system if conducted in a safe and sound manner. The OCC will continue to provide a path for innovative approaches to financial services to ensure a strong, diverse financial system that remains relevant over time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The federal banking system includes more than 1,000 national banks, federal savings associations, and federal branches of foreign banking organizations operating in the United States that range in size from 1,000 smaller community banks under $30 billion in assets focused on meeting local needs to the largest internationally active banks. These banking companies conduct a wide array of businesses that range from retail and wholesale banking activity to trust, credit card and other more narrowly focused services. The institutions that make up the federal banking system conduct approximately 67 percent of the banking activity in the United States, hold more than $16 trillion in assets combined and manage more than $85 trillion under their custody and fiduciary control.</p>

<title>ISDA Expands Digital Regulatory Reporting Solution To Cover Hong Kong’s Revised Reporting Rules</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-expands-digital-regulatory-reporting-solution-to-cover-hong-kongs-revised-20251015/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ISDA has expanded its Digital Regulatory Reporting (DRR) solution to support revised derivatives reporting rules in Hong Kong, enabling in-scope firms to implement the changes cost-effectively and accurately.</p>
<p>The amendments from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) came into effect on September 29. This represents the eighth set of reporting requirements available on the ISDA DRR following earlier launches to cover revisions in Australia by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, Canada by the Canadian Securities Administrators, the EU under the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR), Japan by the Financial Services Agency, Singapore by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the UK under UK EMIR and the US by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. In total, the ISDA DRR will support 12 reporting rule sets in nine major jurisdictions and ISDA will maintain the DRR code as those rules evolve in future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is another important milestone in the development of the ISDA DRR and means firms subject to those rules can implement the requirements accurately and efficiently, based on a golden-source industry interpretation of the rules. This not only cuts the burden and cost for implementing firms &ndash; it also reduces the risk of regulatory penalties for misreported data,&rdquo; said Scott O&rsquo;Malia, ISDA&rsquo;s Chief Executive.</p>
<p>The ISDA DRR takes as its foundation a common interpretation of each ruleset that has been reviewed and agreed by an industry working group. It uses the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/isda-solutions-infohub/cdm/">Common Domain Model</a>&nbsp;&ndash; an open-source data standard for financial products, trades and lifecycle events &ndash; to convert the industry interpretation into free, machine-executable code. That code can be used as the basis for implementing the rules or to validate that a firm&rsquo;s interpretation is aligned with the industry reading.</p>

<p>Trading Technologies International, Inc. (TT), a global capital markets technology platform services provider, announced today that its TT&reg; Trade Surveillance solution was named winner of the Best AI Solution for Trade Surveillance at the inaugural AI in Capital Markets Awards. The award highlighted the platform's ability to deliver measurable value to financial institutions through an AI-driven data and technology solution.</p>

<p>Nick Garrow, global head of TT's compliance business, said: "This recognition from the industry is a testament to our team's dedication to building on our innovative AI-driven solution. We've been a true pioneer in the space, having deployed AI for trade surveillance long before AI became part of the daily lexicon.

<h2>Speech</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pleasure to be here at DC Fintech Week 2025 to speak about tokenisation and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), given their potential to transform real world retail and wholesale financial services.</p>
<p>This technology allows the creation of common shared ledgers that can be updated near-simultaneously across all parties in a financial transaction, thereby eliminating the need for each party to maintain its own records.</p>
<p>It enables financial assets to be digitally represented (&lsquo;tokenised&rsquo;) on such shared ledgers and settled near instantaneously.</p>
<p>And in this way, it can facilitate faster, cheaper processes in wholesale financial markets and cross-border payments - with fewer intermediaries, less operational risk, shorter settlement windows and smart contracts automating processes such as coupon payments on bonds.</p>
<p>In addition, these ledgers can increase the liquidity of a wider range of financial assets (for example private assets, units in investment funds, or real estate), enabling them to be held, traded or even used as collateral by a broader set of players. Assets can also be 'fractionalised' so that investors can hold a portion (eg of a property) if they can't afford the whole.</p>
<p>Applied to retail payments, these technologies can offer households and businesses new functionality &ndash; embedding payments more deeply, automatically and efficiently into our increasingly digital lives.</p>
<p>They could enhance online shopping by enabling a buyer&rsquo;s funds to be reserved at time of purchase and automatically released to the seller only once physical delivery of goods is confirmed. That could enable greater competition in online retail if consumers are more confident to shop online with a new merchant or platform.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/october/sarah-breeden-panellist-at-fintech-foundation-2025-dc-fiintech-week#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Such functionality might also help to alleviate the perennial challenge of late payments to small businesses, as they could receive payments automatically upon delivery. Lower cost payments could also make micropayments (those for very small amounts) more economical, so that, for example, customers pay for the newspaper articles, book pages or songs that they consume as they do so, rather than some being putting off by having to pay flat subscriptions upfront.</p>
<p>In addition, as we start to see so-called &lsquo;agentic&rsquo; artificial intelligence (AI) being deployed in commerce<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/october/sarah-breeden-panellist-at-fintech-foundation-2025-dc-fiintech-week#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[2]</a></sup>&nbsp;- where an AI-powered virtual &lsquo;agent&rsquo; learns a user&rsquo;s preferences, autonomously browses online stores, compares prices and makes purchases on a user&rsquo;s behalf &ndash; tokenisation and DLT could support this by enabling the AI agent to integrate more seamlessly with real-time, digitally native payments infrastructure than it can with traditional technology.</p>

<p>The Bank of England has today&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/report/2025/the-boes-approach-to-innovation-in-ai-dlt-quantum-computing">published</a>&nbsp;its approach to promoting responsible innovation in DLT, AI and quantum computing &ndash; the three technologies we see as having the greatest potential today to shape financial services.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t forecast with perfect foresight, least of all when it comes to technological trends. Some benefits expected today will turn out not to materialise tomorrow, and other new technologies will no doubt emerge.</p>
<p>There are also challenges to overcome &ndash; for example in using DLT, we need to ensure that these ledgers when used in regulated infrastructure deliver the same levels of operational resilience, settlement finality and clearly accountable governance that we expect for regulated infrastructure using traditional technology, while still maintaining scalability for high transaction volumes.</p>
<p>But by seeking to get ahead of how these new technologies will impact our objectives for monetary and financial stability, we can ensure that we have the hard and soft infrastructure, and that we convene and coordinate the financial services industry, to enable their responsible adoption.</p>
<p>When it comes to tokenisation, we&rsquo;ve already put in place&nbsp;<a id="_Hlk211026121"></a>soft infrastructure &ndash; the regulatory framework &ndash; to enable the private sector to set up trading venues and settlement systems for tokenised assets. This is the Bank&rsquo;s so-called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financial-stability/digital-securities-sandbox">Digital Securities Sandbox</a>&nbsp;launched last year jointly with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). &lsquo;Sandbox&rsquo; is an understatement though. These won&rsquo;t merely be prototypes or experiments; they will be real-world transactions in tokenised securities, and market participants will interact with these trading venues and settlement systems in the same way as they do in the conventional financial system.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got 15 firms preparing with regulators to launch trading and settlement venues potentially as early as next year, with more in the pipeline &ndash; ranging from established financial firms (eg Euroclear, HSBC, JP Morgan and the London Stock Exchange Group) to new players, and across the full range of asset classes (eg equities, corporate and government bonds, and investment funds including real estate funds).</p>
<p>The sandbox will enable markets in these securities to grow up to a set size<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/october/sarah-breeden-panellist-at-fintech-foundation-2025-dc-fiintech-week#footnote-4" id="footnote-ref-4"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[3]</a></sup>&nbsp;over the next five years, during which time the Bank, FCA and HM Treasury intend to learn from firms&rsquo; activity and, subject to that, to determine the new, permanent regulatory regime for the trading and settlement of digital securities.</p>
<p>Of course, financial markets are inherently global, and tokenised financial markets should be no different.</p>
<p>As tokenised asset markets emerge in different jurisdictions, we should avoid them operating in a such a way that they are incompatible with each other - or indeed with those parts of domestic financial systems using traditional technology. That would impede cross-border and cross-asset trading, and so fragment market liquidity. Interoperability and regulatory cooperation including across borders will be essential.&nbsp;That motivates our participation in the Monetary Authority of Singapore&rsquo;s Global Layer 1 initiative, which is exploring common standards for DLT platforms. Given I&rsquo;m here in DC, I should also flag that we&rsquo;ve had a lot of positive interest from US authorities in our Sandbox.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/october/sarah-breeden-panellist-at-fintech-foundation-2025-dc-fiintech-week#footnote-5" id="footnote-ref-5"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[4]</a></sup>&nbsp;And I look forward to discussing opportunities for greater UK-US collaboration in tokenised markets in the new Transatlantic Taskforce<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/october/sarah-breeden-panellist-at-fintech-foundation-2025-dc-fiintech-week#footnote-6" id="footnote-ref-6"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[5]</a></sup>&nbsp;announced following the US President&rsquo;s state visit to the UK in September, to be chaired by our respective finance ministries.</p>
<p>Given the inevitable coordination issues with deploying new technologies across financial markets, there is an important role for UK authorities in convening market participants and driving collective action. The UK government announced in July as part of its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wholesale-financial-markets-digital-strategy/wholesale-financial-markets-digital-strategy#market-leadership" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wholesale Financial Markets Digital Strategy<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;that it will appoint a Digital Markets Champion to join up the private sector&rsquo;s work on these issues. And it is proceeding with issuing a digital gilt instrument (DIGIT) on a platform within our Sandbox, to help catalyse the development of UK-based DLT infrastructure and the adoption of DLT in UK financial markets.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/october/sarah-breeden-panellist-at-fintech-foundation-2025-dc-fiintech-week#footnote-7" id="footnote-ref-7"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Now I know&nbsp;<a id="_Hlk211026294"></a>you&rsquo;d expect me to say this &ndash; I am a central banker and we are in the money business after all<a id="_Hlk211026313"></a>&nbsp;&ndash; but the most important enabler for the responsible adoption of tokenisation in finance is the availability of settlement assets with the requisite safety and functionality to play the role of money in tokenised transactions.</p>
<p>I set out in a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/september/sarah-breeden-keynote-speech-at-the-boe-and-warwick-business-school">speech</a>&nbsp;last month that my vision for the UK payments landscape is one of a &lsquo;multi-money&rsquo; mixed ecosystem &ndash; with a role for money issued by the central bank, money issued by commercial banks, and money issued by regulated non-banks (that is, stablecoin issuers); all freely and frictionlessly exchangeable at par, while providing users with choice and competition.</p>
<p>For central bank money, we&rsquo;ve launched the Bank&rsquo;s new wholesale payments infrastructure, RT2, this year. This has functionality already to support settlement of the cash leg of tokenised asset transactions using a tokenised representation of central bank money.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/october/sarah-breeden-panellist-at-fintech-foundation-2025-dc-fiintech-week#footnote-8" id="footnote-ref-8"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[7]</a></sup>&nbsp;And a payment system of this kind is already live in the UK and in its initial stages of operations.</p>
<p>Synchronisation functionality, which will allow central bank money to be fully integrated with wholesale tokenised transactions, will initially launch next year in our Synchronisation Lab, to enable testing of real-world use cases. And subject to that, it will be delivered into production.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re calling on industry to work with us on starting to deploy these new functionalities in RT2. Omnibus account functionality is live. And later this week, we will be issuing a call for participants for the Synchronisation Lab. So the tools are there for industry to use. I encourage you all to bring your creativity to bear in developing innovative use cases with them.</p>
<p>For our part, we&rsquo;re also experimenting with whether there is anything further that we can do, beyond omnibus accounts and synchronisation, such as the Bank itself tokenising central bank money for use in wholesale transactions (so-called &lsquo;wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency&rsquo;)<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/october/sarah-breeden-panellist-at-fintech-foundation-2025-dc-fiintech-week#footnote-9" id="footnote-ref-9"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[8]</a></sup>&nbsp;or for use in retail transactions (retail CBDC).<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/october/sarah-breeden-panellist-at-fintech-foundation-2025-dc-fiintech-week#footnote-10" id="footnote-ref-10"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>For commercial bank money, we clarified to banks two years ago how deposit-taking entities issuing digital money can do so in the form of (tokenised) deposits and we continue to engage closely with banks to ensure that regulation is not a barrier.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/october/sarah-breeden-panellist-at-fintech-foundation-2025-dc-fiintech-week#footnote-11" id="footnote-ref-11"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[10]</a></sup>&nbsp;Importantly also, a new institutional model for UK payments announced this summer will deliver the next generation of UK retail payments infrastructure, to enable the seamless exchange of tokenised money between banks and stablecoin issuers.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/october/sarah-breeden-panellist-at-fintech-foundation-2025-dc-fiintech-week#footnote-12" id="footnote-ref-12"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[11]</a></sup></p>
<h3>Stablecoins</h3>
<p>I want to spend the remainder of my remarks today on stablecoins. There&rsquo;s obviously been a lot of focus on stablecoins this year, with the passage in July of the GENIUS Act in the US establishing the legislative basis for stablecoin regulation at a federal level.</p>
<p>With the flurry of activity in the US this year, I hear people say that the UK is behind in its work on stablecoins. I must say I don&rsquo;t recognise this. The FCA&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/consultation-papers/cp25-14-stablecoin-issuance-cryptoasset-custody" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">consulted<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;on its detailed requirements for stablecoins in May this year. We will consult later this year on our requirements for sterling-denominated stablecoins used in systemic payment systems. That will put us in a position to finalise our regulatory regimes next year &ndash; as is the aim in the US.</p>
<p>I should be clear that the Bank&rsquo;s role as the regulator of stablecoins used in systemic payment systems means that we are concerned only with those stablecoins being widely used as money in retail and wholesale &lsquo;real world&rsquo; payments. The vast majority of stablecoin activity globally at the moment is instead used as the settlement asset for trading of unbacked cryptoassets.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/october/sarah-breeden-panellist-at-fintech-foundation-2025-dc-fiintech-week#footnote-13" id="footnote-ref-13"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[12]</a></sup>&nbsp;While unbacked cryptoassets are growing in popularity, the Bank&rsquo;s Financial Policy Committee continues to judge that their systemic risks to UK financial stability are limited &ndash; and so there is no need for stablecoins used in that market to be subject to the Bank&rsquo;s stablecoin regime.</p>
<p>Our stablecoin regime is instead motivated by their potential for use in retail and wholesale payments. We want to support such a role for stablecoins as part of a multi-money system (as I mentioned earlier). And while, to date, proposals for stablecoins to be used for these purposes are yet really to take off, we know from other areas of tech innovation how quickly new products can grow, particularly where (as in payments) network effects are large, and where they can harness large existing user bases. We also know from experience how difficult it can be retrospectively to regulate such networks.</p>
<p>Those network dynamics are why at the Bank we have been working hard to put in place a regulatory regime for stablecoins being widely used for payments&nbsp;<em>ahead of</em>&nbsp;their emergence, so that our regulatory framework for money is fit for the future.</p>
<p>We are well advanced in putting this in place. Such a regime will allow those stablecoin firms who want to innovate by providing better payment services to users to understand the risks that need to be managed as they develop those products &ndash; and ensure that innovation is not simply competing by taking higher financial, operational or conduct risks.</p>
<p>In that vein, for such stablecoins to have a role in our multi-money system, it&rsquo;s important that they meet the same levels of robustness as we expect from widely used money today &ndash; that issued by commercial banks.</p>
<p>That isn&rsquo;t to say they have to meet the exact rules we apply to banks. In our regime, stablecoins don&rsquo;t seek in their business models to make money from lending or maturity transformation, so lots of banking sector regulation need not apply. But we do need to ensure that in all states of the world, a pound issued by a regulated stablecoin issuer is worth the same as a pound issued by a commercial bank and a banknote issued by the Bank of England. This &lsquo;singleness of money&rsquo; is the foundation on which monetary and financial stability and ultimately economic activity depend &ndash; just as we don&rsquo;t in our everyday lives expect today to question whether a pound in one bank is worth the same as a pound in another.</p>
<p>The Bank of England is clear that it is prepared to offer regulated stablecoins the means to achieve this.</p>
<p><a id="_Hlk211244851"></a>In particular, we said in 2023<span>&nbsp;</span>that we would provide accounts at the Bank of England for systemic stablecoin issuers, which they can use to back their coins and so ensure their value.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/october/sarah-breeden-panellist-at-fintech-foundation-2025-dc-fiintech-week#footnote-14" id="footnote-ref-14"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[13]</a></sup>&nbsp;And, as my colleague Sasha Mills and I have set out in recent months, in response to feedback on those proposals, we will supplement that in our upcoming consultation by enabling systemic stablecoin issuers to receive some return on their backing assets by allowing a proportion of them to be invested in short-term UK government debt.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/october/sarah-breeden-panellist-at-fintech-foundation-2025-dc-fiintech-week#footnote-15" id="footnote-ref-15"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[14]</a></sup>&nbsp;In addition, our consultation will set out that the Bank is considering putting in place a liquidity facility to help backstop solvent systemic stablecoin issuers&rsquo; ability to monetise those assets if needed and so to support meeting redemption requests.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/october/sarah-breeden-panellist-at-fintech-foundation-2025-dc-fiintech-week#footnote-16" id="footnote-ref-16"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[15]</a></sup></p>
<p><a id="_Hlk211367781"></a>As a consequence, and in contrast to other jurisdictions where stablecoins have to rely in effect on their competitors (commercial banks) to provide them a bank account, in the UK&rsquo;s regime the Bank of England will play the role of banker to systemic issuers. That avoids the issues we&rsquo;re already starting to see overseas of a lack of availability of banking services for stablecoin issuers.</p>
<p>Holding deposits with the central bank also mitigates the financial stability risks that could otherwise arise from interconnectedness between commercial banks and systemic stablecoin issuers. It avoids the risk of rapid outflows from a stablecoin backed with commercial bank deposits creating funding challenges for the bank. And it avoids the risk of failure of a bank calling into question the solvency of a stablecoin issuer (as we saw, for example, in March 2023 when Circle&rsquo;s USDC stablecoin lost its peg to the dollar after the failure of one of its bankers).<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/october/sarah-breeden-panellist-at-fintech-foundation-2025-dc-fiintech-week#footnote-17" id="footnote-ref-17"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[16]</a></sup>&nbsp;And of course, the lower risk of holding cash at the central bank rather than in a commercial bank can be reflected in lower capital requirements for the stablecoin issuer.</p>
<p><a id="_Hlk210898972"></a>My final point touches on how we safely manage the transition from our current system of central bank and commercial bank money, to a more diverse and competitive multi-money system where regulated stablecoin issuers can also issue money.</p>
<p>Our focus here is on ensuring the real economy&rsquo;s continued access to credit, by ensuring the financial system has time gradually to adjust to new forms of digital money &ndash; a critically important issue in the UK given credit here relies more heavily on banks compared to, for example, the position in the US.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/october/sarah-breeden-panellist-at-fintech-foundation-2025-dc-fiintech-week#footnote-18" id="footnote-ref-18"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[17]</a></sup>&nbsp;It is not on protecting banks&rsquo; business models.</p>
<p>To illustrate my point, let&rsquo;s consider a widespread and fast adoption of stablecoins. Significant and rapid outflows of bank deposits into such stablecoins could lead to a precipitous drop in credit for businesses and households if the banking system were unable to increase, at scale and at pace, its use of wholesale financing from non-banks (insurers, funds etc). Once adjusted, access to finance for the real economy would be stabilised.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/october/sarah-breeden-panellist-at-fintech-foundation-2025-dc-fiintech-week#footnote-19" id="footnote-ref-19"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[18]</a></sup>&nbsp;But it is the financial stability risks in transition that we are concerned with.</p>
<p>We are clear that this is the outcome we want to avoid, and are open to exploring how best to achieve it. We have considered different tools - limits on a customer&rsquo;s holdings of systemic stablecoins, aggregate limits on the overall size of the coin, and limits on transaction size. All of these are intended to be temporary to allow the structure of real-economy financing to adjust &ndash; and to enable the Bank to monitor adoption of stablecoins and assess the potential for rapid changes in the structure of the financial system. So let me be clear. We would expect to remove the limits once we see that the transition no longer threatens the provision of finance to the real economy.</p>
<p>Our starting point is that applying limits to a user&rsquo;s holdings of a given systemic stablecoin is the best way to avoid such a precipitous reduction in the availability of credit to UK borrowers. These would limit flows around the system, whilst still allowing for coins to be widely usable for retail payments. Our consultation later this year will seek feedback on the proposed levels for such limits<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/october/sarah-breeden-panellist-at-fintech-foundation-2025-dc-fiintech-week#footnote-20" id="footnote-ref-20"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[19]</a></sup>&nbsp;&ndash; businesses would have a higher holding limit than individuals, and there would likely be an exceptions regime so that the largest businesses in the country (eg supermarkets) could hold more if required, We also intend to seek feedback on implementing such limits in practice, as well as on other approaches to achieving our aims.</p>
<p>When it comes to wholesale payments, my view is that central bank money must remain the settlement asset for systemically important asset markets even as we see greater tokenisation in those markets. That way, we don&rsquo;t introduce potentially precarious and unnecessary interconnections in the financial system and so create financial stability risks.</p>
<p>But, central bank money isn&rsquo;t needed for all settlement today, and it won&rsquo;t be needed for all settlement in the future. That&rsquo;s why there will likely be an important role in tokenised markets for privately issued money: both tokenised deposits and regulated stablecoins.</p>
<p>We are therefore working to expand the range of settlement assets in the Digital Securities Sandbox to include not just tokenised deposits but also regulated stablecoins. The limits I mentioned on holdings of systemic stablecoins would not need to apply to stablecoins used as a settlement asset for transactions in the Sandbox &ndash; as individual trading and settlement venues in the Sandbox are already subject to limits on their overall issuance in a particular asset class.<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;And so we will be able to observe use cases and risks as we consider what adjustments may be needed as we move towards a permanent regime, while still allowing innovation to take place in real-world transactions.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>As I said, we will be consulting in coming weeks on the detail of our proposed regime for sterling stablecoins used in systemic payment systems, and we&rsquo;ll be open to feedback as we finalise our rules.</p>
<p>Tokenisation holds much potential for retail and wholesale financial services. The Bank is committed to enabling such responsible innovation. These aren&rsquo;t token gestures that we&rsquo;re making. They are significant modernisations of our own infrastructure, regulation and convening role, as we seek to maintain monetary and financial stability at an exciting time of technological change.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t though do this alone. We need the industry - both incumbents and new entrants - to work with us to engage, to experiment, to develop the use cases, and to deploy this technology; and thereby harness it for the benefit of households, businesses and financial markets.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) have today confirmed plans to increase flexibility around senior banker pay, alongside changes to create better links between bonus awards and responsible risk-taking.</p>
<p>The amount of time that senior bankers must now wait before receiving their full amount of bonus &ndash; a bonus deferral period - will be cut from eight to four years. The proposals bring the UK more closely in line with many other major jurisdictions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following industry feedback, these changes go further than original proposals announced last year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The regulators will also allow part-payment of bonuses for the most senior bankers from year one, rather than year three as it was previously.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new rules will come into force on 16 October 2025, in time for 2025 pay awards and any other awards made but not yet fully paid.</p>
<p>The changes will deliver greater alignment between the regulators and remove unnecessary duplication. The FCA&rsquo;s remuneration Handbook rules will be cut by more than 70% as firms will now largely only need to refer to the PRA&rsquo;s remuneration rules.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam Woods, Deputy Governor of Prudential Regulation and CEO of the PRA said: &ldquo;These new rules will cut red tape without encouraging the reckless pay structures that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis. These changes are the latest example of our commitment to boosting UK competitiveness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sarah Pritchard, Deputy CEO at the FCA, said: &ldquo;Streamlining our remuneration rules by 70% will cut unneeded complexity and make them simpler to follow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;re working faster and smarter to support growth by letting firms apply the changes to this year&rsquo;s pay cycle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The new rules also mean senior managers will continue to follow our high standards and remain on the hook where poor decisions affect consumers and markets".</p>
<p>The regulators believe that the new bonus deferral periods will continue to provide enough time for firms to spot any problems and reduce individuals&rsquo; pay where needed. This supports safety and soundness and should also help to reverse a trend which has seen banks put a higher amount of total financial reward into fixed pay. This matters as bonuses can be more rapidly reduced if individuals are found to have been at fault for poor decisions, or if the firm&rsquo;s financial performance worsens.</p>
<p>Additional changes from the regulators include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lifting restrictions on the proportion of bonuses that need to be deferred, going further than at consultation. Previously, 60% of the full amount of any bonuses above the &pound;660,000 threshold needed to be deferred. Now only 60% of amounts above that threshold will need to be deferred.</li>
<li>New rules to give firms more flexibility to allow a greater share of the cash element of bonuses to be received up front. More of the component comprised of shares and other instruments can now be deferred, which helps promote responsible risk-taking. Previously, both the upfront and deferred components of bonuses had to be 50% cash and 50% instruments.</li>
</ul>
<p>The new rules simultaneously look to strengthen the link between the actions of senior bankers and their financial rewards, strongly encouraging firms to tie bonuses closer to not just the successes of executives, but also any risk-management failures.</p>
<p>The rules also introduce greater alignment with the Senior Managers Regime, so that firms consider performance against PRA supervisory priorities in the bonus payouts of the responsible Senior Managers.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>1. See the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/prudential-regulation/publication/2025/october/ps2125-remuneration-reform">remuneration policy statement</a>.<br /><br />2. See the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2024/november/pra-and-fca-publish-consultation-on-pay-for-senior-bankers">previous proposals</a>. They suggested cutting bonus deferrals to five years for senior bankers, and four for less senior staff.<br /><br />3. Previously, the maximum deferral period was seven years for higher-paid senior managers, plus a 6 to 12-month retention period (which the PRA is now abolishing as part of this reform).<br /><br />4. Additional changes previously announced at consultation stage and coming into force at the same time include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removing EU-originated guidelines that:<br />&nbsp;- prohibit paying dividends or interest on deferred bonuses awarded in shares or other instruments; and<br />&nbsp;- require senior bankers to wait up to a year before being able to sell deferred bonuses in shares or other instruments.</li>
<li>Reducing the number of individuals subject to rules on their pay, giving firms more discretion to determine which employees will be subject to the rules.</li>
<li>Introducing clarifications to ensure pay, particularly for senior staff, is adjusted to better reflect risk outcomes, including risk-management failures and individual responsibilities, in turn holding senior managers more accountable for the outcomes of their areas&rsquo; risk-taking.</li>
</ul>
<p>5. The rule changes also come in the wake of 2023&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/prudential-regulation/publication/2022/december/remuneration">removal of the banker bonus cap</a>. Since its removal, several firms have started using this new flexibility to announce plans to offer higher bonus ratios, increasing the attractiveness and sensitivity of pay packages to risk outcomes.<br /><br />6. The senior banker remuneration regime describes individuals it applies to as Material Risk Takers. Material Risk Takers are employees whose professional activities have a material impact on the firm&rsquo;s risk profile. Anyone identified as a PRA Senior Manager Function holder (i.e. CEO, CFO, CRO) is a material risk taker and is therefore subject to these remuneration regulations.<br /><br />7. Within that Senior Manager group those that are &lsquo;higher-paid&rsquo; senior managers have previously been subject to a longer deferral. Higher paid was defined as individuals whose total pay is in excess of &pound;500,000 or whose variable pay accounts for over 33% of total pay.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />8. The changes build on work from the regulators to boost growth and competitiveness in the financial sector. These include options to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2025/july/pra-unveils-options-to-enhance-competition-in-the-mortgage-market">enhance competition in the mortgage market</a>, work to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2025/july/boe-announces-measures-to-promote-banking-resilience">make the resolution regime more proportionate</a>, and plans to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/prudential-regulation/strong-and-simple">simplify the capital regime for smaller, UK-focused banks</a>.<br /><br />9. The FCA is also supporting the growth and competitiveness of UK financial services by:&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;a. Simplifying its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/policy-statements/ps25-11-mortgage-rule-review-first-steps-simplify-rules-increase-flexibility" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mortgage rules<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external">&nbsp;</span></a><br />&nbsp;b. reforming its regime for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/calls-input/future-regulation-alternative-fund-managers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">alternative asset managers<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external"></span></a>, to make it easier for firms to enter the market, grow, compete and innovate.&nbsp;<br /><br />10. The FCA is also reviewing the effectiveness of its solo remuneration rules and will update next year following industry and stakeholders engagement. The FCA&rsquo;s three other remuneration codes are:<br /><br />&nbsp;a. the AIFM Remuneration Code (SYSC 19B)<br />&nbsp;b. the UCITS Remuneration Code (SYSC 19E)&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;c. the MIFIDPRU Remuneration Code (SYSC 19G)</p>

<title>AMLA Expects High Standards Against Financial Crime In Crypto Sector</title>

<div class="ecl-page-header__description-container">
<p class="ecl-page-header__description">With the launch of its powers and responsibilities on 1 July 2025, AMLA expects firms engaging in crypto asset activities to have in place strong protections against money laundering and terrorist financing.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><em>&ldquo;We welcome the development of new technologies and business models. However, it is essential that in the light of a new regulatory framework and major transformation of the crypto-assets sector, Europe is adequately protected from the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing stemming from this sector.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;said&nbsp;<span>Bruna Szego</span>, Chair of AMLA. The Authority will work closely with other European authorities and the National Competent Authorities (NCAs) to coordinate actions to ensure effective outcomes. Crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) and their supervision are therefore featuring prominently in AMLA&rsquo;s recently published Work Programme for 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<p>AMLA recognizes that CASPs are exposed to significant money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF) risks due to their technological features, cross-border operations, and anonymity-enhancing capabilities. The Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) is now in effect and requires CASPs to get a MiCA licence to provide their services in the EU. Several authorisations have already been issued including for some of the larger crypto companies. AMLA expects that the number of licenced CASPs will continue to increase considerably.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In its recently published&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amla.europa.eu/document/download/b78bee2f-16b9-4742-a3a1-23e7aad394ab_en?filename=AMLA_Work_Programme_July%202025_0.pdf">Work Programme 2025</a>, AMLA has announced the strategic objective to prevent ML/TF threats and to promote a level playing field across the EU, including for crypto-asset service sector. Following the risk-based approach, AMLA places a strong emphasis on CASPS providing services across the EU to implement anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) standards consistently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to MICA and the European AML Framework the initial licensing and supervision of CASPs remain under the remit of national competent authorities (NCAs). There is a risk of diverging application of AML/CFT requirements and inconsistent controls. As part of its role in indirect supervision of the financial sector, AMLA expects licencing and supervisory authorities to ensure that CASPs have effective AML/CFT systems in place from day one of their authorisation. &nbsp;<br />By working closely with national supervisors and European authorities, AMLA will develop plans to promote high standards of AML/CFT controls to reach that goal. In parallel, AMLA&rsquo;s financial intelligence pillar will reflect this priority by including crypto-asset related financial intelligence within the initial areas proposed for joint analyses, targeting cross-border typologies and emerging risks in this fast-evolving domain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today about artificial intelligence (AI).<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20251015a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;AI is a powerful and rapidly advancing technology that has captured everyone's attention. If you've watched enough sci-fi, you know that major technological change is usually either dystopian or utopian&mdash;the robots either take over the world or improve it. These polarized views are also common among economists and technologists. On one side, there are the doomers&mdash;those convinced that new technologies will destroy jobs, widen inequality, and concentrate power. On the other, there are the techno-optimists&mdash;those convinced we're on the brink of an unprecedented leap in productivity, growth, and creativity if we let the technology proliferate. As usual, the truth about AI is probably somewhere in between. The job of an economic policymaker is to separate hype and hyperbole from hard data and sound analysis and understand what AI really means for growth, productivity, and the broader economy.</p>
<p>I will focus on three aspects of major technological change that "repeat" through history. First, technological change is a constant in our lives, and it is almost always disruptive. It upends the way we work and socialize. Second, it alters existing power relationships in unsettling ways. Finally, technological change reliably raises productivity and our standard of living while improving the quality of our lives. My intent is to describe how AI is likely to affect our lives along these lines and how it differs from past technological changes.</p>
<p>We have always had technological changes that dramatically transform the economy and our daily lives. In the 1880s, electricity was a curiosity reserved for a few wealthy urban people and some limited industrial uses. By 1920, half of homes had electricity, by 1940 nearly half had a refrigerator, and by 1945, 85 percent of homes were electrified. Automobile use also rose swiftly. Auto registrations rose from 140,000 in 1906 to 23 million in 1929, at a time when the total number of households was fewer than 30 million. These advances changed daily life in profound ways. Another aspect of technological change is the speed at which new technologies are being adopted. In the last 50 years, we've experienced adoption of new technologies twice as fast: Personal computers were widespread within 20 years&mdash;the internet in 12 years&mdash;and it only took 6 years for smartphones to be universal. And now AI is moving even more rapidly. I tend to believe that the transition for workers affected by AI will be accelerated also, but no one really knows. Such predictions are certainly beyond my powers as an economic policymaker, so I will limit myself to the here and now. The point of this discussion is that technological change is a constant in our lives&mdash;it is always happening and will continue to happen&mdash;and AI seems to be following the pattern of ever-faster adoption and change.</p>
<p>Although it is a constant in our lives, technology also disrupts our lives every time a new innovation appears. The way that we work and produce changes. Jobs disappear, and new ones appear. Our social lives are disrupted as well, often in good ways&mdash;but sometimes not so good. We used to write letters and mail them to communicate with loved ones. This took time and was expensive. Now we text or use FaceTime or Zoom to communicate with friends and family members anytime. This makes it easier to maintain relationships across geography and time. But it can also undermine those social connections. When I walk into a party and see half of the people there staring at their screens, I can see that technology can lead to less social interaction, not more. Technological disruption, like anything else, has benefits and costs. But, as I will argue later, I believe that we need to let this disruption occur to recognize the benefits alongside the costs, to enable us to lead better lives.</p>
<p>My second point was that technological innovation can alter power relationships in profound ways. When Gutenberg invented the printing press, he took away the Catholic Church's power over the written word and democratized it. When personal computers appeared, power shifted from those who managed mainframes to individual users. When the internet arrived, the control of news, information, and opinion pieces shifted from major news outlets to anyone with a webpage. AI will do the same. It will take power from "experts" and shift it to "nonexperts." Much like Gutenberg's printing press, AI will likely democratize expertise. Tools that once required specialized training are already becoming accessible to a much wider range of people. We see this happening with software coding already. A nurse using an AI diagnostic tool or a technician relying on a generative model to troubleshoot complex equipment can perform higher-order tasks more efficiently. It will likely do the same for scientific discovery. Those who collected economic rents, or excess payments, from the control of power will lose those rents. But this will improve our lives in the process.</p>
<p>Whenever a new technology emerges, the first question economists get is about jobs: Will this replace people or make them more productive? The challenge is that, with innovation, there is often a time inconsistency between the costs and the benefits. The disruptions come first; the benefits take time. When a new technology appears, it's always easier to see the jobs that are likely to disappear, but it's much harder to see the ones that will be created. When automobiles came on the scene, it was easy to see that saddlemakers' jobs would disappear. But it wasn't obvious that the saddlemaker's skills could be used to make car seats and that higher-productivity auto production would create many more and much higher paying jobs. Ten years ago, if I had said something called TikTok would arrive soon, no one would likely have been able to imagine that, or that social media would create what is now an established occupation&mdash;influencer.</p>
<p>The pattern appears to be repeating&mdash;only faster. A recent study by Stanford economists found that employment has fallen about 13 percent in occupations most exposed to AI, relative to those less affected.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20251015a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;Those contractions have appeared mainly in support and administrative roles&mdash;fields that tend to be automated first. This early effect from AI is consistent with what I have been hearing from business contacts. Retailers in particular are cutting back on employment for call centers and IT-related occupations. So far, most say this is being handled through attrition, but a number of retailers say that there is the potential for downsizing next year. That is also a message from a New York Fed survey that finds very few businesses are reporting AI-induced layoffs; they are instead using the technology to retrain employees.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20251015a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;That said, AI is influencing recruiting for these firms, with some scaling back hiring because of AI and others adding workers who are proficient in its use. Looking ahead, however, layoffs and reductions in hiring plans due to AI use are expected to increase, especially for workers with a college degree.</p>
<p>Returning to my final point, history has shown us that technology improves productivity and our standard of living. We initially always talk about how it will be a substitute for labor. This was the basic premise behind Marx's theory of capitalism&mdash;machines would replace humans in production, which would raise unemployment so high that social revolution would occur, leading to the end of capitalism and the rise of a socialist utopia. Yet this theory makes the fundamental mistake of failing to see that capital and labor are complements, not substitutes. More machines mean a firm can produce more output, but that also requires more labor as well. This is obvious just looking at economic data. The U.S. capital stock, measured in constant prices, is seven times larger than it was in 1950. Yet the unemployment rate in September 1950 was 4.4 percent, and it is 4.3 percent as of August 2025. This is why economists are typically techno-optimists&mdash;history has repeatedly shown that adopting new technologies leads to economic growth and greater employment, not less. Technological disruption is one form of a concept that economists have studied since Joseph Schumpeter named it in 1942: creative destruction. This topic has never been more relevant, and I note that just last week a share of the Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to two economists who explored how productivity-enhancing disruption raises living standards.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20251015a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a></p>
<p>There will surely be losers and winners from AI, but aside from questions about how AI's gains will be distributed, there is the more fundamental matter of how they will be measured, even at a macro level. Firms are using AI to increase productivity, which allows for greater output based on the same level of inputs. This gain is counted in gross domestic product (GDP) and its corollary, gross national income.</p>
<p>In America, one common feature of great technological innovations has been an onslaught of competition that has rapidly driven down costs and resulted in rapid and widespread adoption. If hardware and software innovation continue to drive down the cost of AI, then I see few barriers to its ongoing proliferation throughout the economy. That prospect, clearly, is driving the surge of AI investment we have seen. Will it continue? That will depend, in part, on whether AI delivers on the productivity increases that some believe it will bring.</p>
<p>Labor productivity measures output per hour of work. The data is volatile, but average growth over the past few years is slower than over the past decade or several decades. A crucial question is whether AI will contribute to a resurgence in productivity growth. Any sustained productivity growth above 2 percent will tend to support rising real incomes and living standards without inflation pressure. As a monetary policymaker, I'm hoping that AI delivers.</p>
<p>While we often focus on how technology enhances market activity and productivity, it also enhances the value of non-market-based activities. For example, Google Maps allows me to navigate foreign cities easier and faster when I am sightseeing. While this value is a not market-based activity and does not show up in GDP, it clearly makes my life better. Agentic AI has the potential to save me lots of leisure time that would have otherwise been spent planning vacations, paying bills, or making medical appointments. This increase in my well-being is not directly measured in GDP. But if these time-saving AI activities free me up to do more market-based production, then GDP will increase. I have no doubt that AI will boost GDP and national income, but many of its benefits may be in improving our nonmarket activities.</p>
<p>Every technology that changes how we live and work brings both promise and risk. AI is no exception. Fraud, disinformation, bias, and cybersecurity threats are already emerging. Any tool powerful enough to improve lives can also be misused. The task for policymakers is to manage those risks without slowing the innovation that drives growth. History shows that adaptation, not avoidance, is what sustains progress. Each wave of technology has disrupted industries and employment, but over time it has also lifted productivity, raised real incomes, and improved living standards.</p>
<p>We see different approaches to managing the disruption that occurs with technological change. Europe has often chosen to regulate first&mdash;to contain potential harms before the technology fully develops. The United States is taking a different path, leaning on its tradition of experimentation and market dynamism. That openness has long been a competitive advantage. It allowed the United States to lead in earlier waves of technology&mdash;from the internet to advanced computing&mdash;and it can do the same with AI. Over time, that willingness to experiment has translated into faster productivity growth and stronger economic performance than many of our peers, including Europe.</p>
<p>Thirty years ago, the United States embraced a new and disruptive technology&mdash;the World Wide Web. Europe was more cautious, weighed down by regulations and legacy industries that sought to control this innovation. The result, of course, is that America led a global technological revolution that disrupted media and other industries but also delivered jobs and broadly shared prosperity that handily outpaced the European Union over those thirty years. Perhaps the most important legacy of the American-led innovation of networked communications and computing was the culture of entrepreneurship and innovation it fostered, one that, in fact, has greatly contributed to America's leadership in AI. The American tradition is to invent and make use of technology, not shrink from it. Where there are risks, we take reasonable steps to mitigate them, rather than seek to avoid them altogether. Risk-taking is at the heart of our market economy; it fuels innovation, and we must preserve it.</p>
<p>Much like the leaders in this audience, the Federal Reserve is also learning by doing. I have championed a System-wide approach to continually educate our teams and enable experimentation with the latest wave of innovations&mdash;from large language models and agentic AI to applications in coding and payments. That's why, on October 21, I'm convening industry leaders to discuss AI in Payments as part of our Payments Innovation Conference. These engagements, combined with our own hands-on technical research, allow us to apply these technologies within the Fed and to support innovation across the private sector.</p>
<p>To conclude, AI is moving faster than previous waves of innovation. That velocity means both the disruptions and the benefits will arrive sooner. The challenge is to keep pace&mdash;to help workers and firms adjust so the gains in efficiency translate into higher real wages and sustained growth across the economy. For policymakers, we must let the disruption occur and trust that the long-run benefits will exceed any short-run costs.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/home.php" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Interactive Brokers</a><span>&nbsp;(Nasdaq: IBKR), an automated global electronic broker, today announced the launch of Ask IBKR, an AI-powered tool that delivers instant portfolio insights through natural language queries.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;With Ask IBKR, we&rsquo;re introducing a natural language-based way for investors to interact with their portfolio data,&rdquo; said Milan Galik, Chief Executive Officer at Interactive Brokers. &ldquo;Instead of navigating across screens, clients can simply ask, &lsquo;What sector am I underweight compared to the S&amp;P 500?&rsquo; and get an instant, visualized answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Categories of queries include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Portfolio Metrics<b>:</b>&nbsp;Compare performance against benchmarks, identify valuation changes over time, and highlight periods of outperformance or underperformance</li>
<li>Allocation Analysis: Analyze sector exposure, compare returns across asset classes, and assess performance by instrument type</li>
<li>Holdings Exploration: Identify top positions, review geographic allocations, and locate dividend-paying securities</li>
<li>Activity Tracking: Review trade history, monitor interest and fees, and analyze cash inflows and outflows</li>
</ul>
<p>Originating as a chatbot extension of PortfolioAnalyst, Interactive Brokers&rsquo; comprehensive and free portfolio management solution, Ask IBKR will be expanding its capabilities into new realms such as fundamentals data, statements and reporting, corporate actions, tax lot details, and more. The intent is for users to access the wealth of data IBKR offers more intuitively and naturally while saving time that would otherwise be spent searching through screens.<br /><br />While Ask IBKR is AI-powered, it uses proprietary techniques to avoid uncertainty often associated with generative AI applications. Additional features include intelligent question completion, which suggests relevant queries as users type. Dropdown menus also allow clients to select parameters such as benchmarks, timeframes, and accounts.</p>

<title>The EBA Publishes Its 2024 Report On Supervisory Convergence</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-eba-publishes-its-2024-report-on-supervisory-convergence-20251015/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-eba-publishes-its-2024-report-on-supervisory-convergence-20251015/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (the EBA) today published its annual Report on convergence of supervisory practices for 2024 across the European Union (EU). The Report details the EBA&rsquo;s extensive efforts to strengthen the alignment of supervisory approaches across Member States and across all dimensions of its activities: prudential, resolution, consumer protection, digital finance and, until the end of 2025, anti-money laundering/countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT). This is also a first step in implementing the recommendations set out in the EBA&rsquo;s&nbsp;</span><a href="https://eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2025-10/b8e0ef8e-2d49-43fc-b917-dbca3423588c/Report%20on%20the%20efficiency%20of%20the%20regulatory%20and%20supervisory%20framework.pdf">Report on the efficiency of the regulatory and supervisory framework</a>.&nbsp;<span>Going forward, the EBA will further deepen its focus on supervisory outcomes to ensure consistent and robust supervision across the EU.</span></p>
<h5><span>Key highlights</span></h5>
<p>In the area<span>&nbsp;</span>of<span>&nbsp;prudential supervision</span>, the EBA&rsquo;s European Supervisory Examination Programme (ESEP) for 2024 focused on liquidity and funding risk, interest rate risk and hedging, and recovery operationalisation. The Report notes stable risk levels across these areas, while identifying ongoing challenges such as data quality, stress testing scenarios, and modelling assumptions. The EBA will continue to monitor risks related to online deposit platforms and compliance with Supervisory Outlier Tests (SOTs) in 2025.</p>
<p>On<span>&nbsp;resolution and crisis management</span>, significant progress has been made in operationalising resolution tools, particularly the bail-in mechanism in cross-border environments. The EBA highlights improved coordination among authorities and stakeholders, enhanced management information systems, and ongoing efforts to address challenges in data quality and legal recognition of bail-in actions.</p>
<p>On<span>&nbsp;digital finance,&nbsp;</span>the EBA prioritised preparations for the implementation of the EU&rsquo;s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), focussing on the supervision of asset reference token (ART) and e-money token (EMT) issuers. It also developed an EU-wide supervisory handbook and coordinated workshops to ensure convergence in supervisory approaches from the outset.</p>
<p>In the area of<span>&nbsp;consumer protection and AML/CFT,&nbsp;</span>the Report notes improved cooperation and risk-based supervision among national authorities, with notable progress made through AML/CFT college monitoring and implementation reviews. The EBA is preparing for the transition of AML/CFT supervisory responsibilities to the new EU Anti-Money Laundering Authority (AMLA) at the end of 2025.</p>
<p>On<span>&nbsp;cross-cutting activities</span>, the EBA continued to support convergence through peer reviews, Q&amp;As, breach of Union law investigations, and training programmes for competent authorities. In 2024, the EBA delivered 23 courses to over 3,000 participants, thus strengthening supervisory skills and promoting best practices across the EU.</p>
<h4>Legal basis, background and next steps</h4>
<p>This annual Report is a first step in implementing recommendation 17 of the EBA&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2025-10/b8e0ef8e-2d49-43fc-b917-dbca3423588c/Report%20on%20the%20efficiency%20of%20the%20regulatory%20and%20supervisory%20framework.pdf">report on the efficiency of the regulatory and supervisory framework</a>&nbsp;(EBA/REP/2025/26) in which the EBA committed to providing a more detailed account of supervisory convergence in the EU, building on a number of initiatives and efforts it has already engaged into with its members. The focus of the EBA&rsquo;s work may shift on ensuring proper implementation of the existing rulebook through supervisory convergence action.</p>
<p>In line with Article 1(5)(g) and 29 of its founding regulation, the EBA contributes to enhancing supervisory convergence across the European Union and plays an active role in building a common supervisory culture and ensuring the consistent application of the Single Rulebook.</p>
<p>In the context of the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP), the EBA annually reports to the European Parliament and the Council on the degree of convergence of the application of the SREP and supervisory measures as mandated by Article 107 of the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD).</p>
<p>With the Single Rulebook now well established, the EBA will gradually increase the importance of its convergence work relative to policy development. The Authority remains vigilant in addressing emerging risks and ensuring the stability and integrity of the EU banking sector.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>YellowDog, the industry leader in large-scale compute infrastructure, today announced its release of RayDog, YellowDog&rsquo;s open-source integration to Ray.io.&nbsp; With RayDog, Ray users get seamless access to YellowDog&rsquo;s unmatched ability to build compute clusters for distributing workloads at massive scale.</p>
<p>"Our mission has always been to give organisations easy access to compute at scale, helping them accelerate results and make faster decisions&rdquo; said Bruce Beckloff, CEO at YellowDog. &ldquo;With our new RayDog integration, we&rsquo;re extending that advantage to every Ray user &mdash; combining the simplicity and ease of use of Ray with YellowDog&rsquo;s exceptional and proven ability to scale across massive clusters, on premises or in the cloud."</p>
<p><b>Ray: the AI/ML compute engine</b></p>
<p>Ray is an open-source framework that accelerates AI and machine learning (ML) development by building on familiar Python and ML workflows. Developers can prototype models and applications locally, then scale them seamlessly to large clusters in the cloud. By removing infrastructure friction, Ray enables teams to iterate faster, train AI models efficiently, and deliver machine learning solutions at scale with agility.</p>
<p><b>RayDog: Scaling Ray to new heights</b></p>
<p>RayDog takes Ray to the next level by combining its ease of use with YellowDog&rsquo;s powerful orchestration platform. Engineering teams can rapidly spin up massive clusters across on-premises and cloud resources, multiple regions, and even different cloud providers &mdash; ensuring the right compute is always available. Teams struggling with the complexities of scaling infrastructure can turn to YellowDog for a simpler path. With RayDog, clusters scale to thousands of nodes in minutes and release just as quickly to control costs, while resilient use of Spot instances ensures maximum performance within budget.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In quantitative finance, time to market, speed and scale are everything,&rdquo; said Jon Fautley, Head of Cloud Infrastructure at Qube Research &amp; Technologies (QRT). &ldquo;Ray has become a popular choice for its ease of use and excellent developer experience. Using RayDog to combine it with YellowDog&rsquo;s powerful compute infrastructure, we can write and test new data processing applications on local datasets, then seamlessly scale them to massive compute power with no code changes. This gives us the power to instantly turn up the dial up when performance matters most &mdash; ensuring we hit our objectives while giving our engineers the freedom to innovate faster.&rdquo;<b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>RayDog is publicly available via&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://pypi.org/project/yellowdog-ray/#files" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">PyPI</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://github.com/yellowdog/raydog" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, and technical documentation is provided via the YellewDog&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://docs.yellowdog.ai/raydog/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">developer portal</a>.</p>

<title>The EBA And ESMA Recommend Targeted Revisions To The Investment Firms’ Prudential Framework</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) and the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) have issued their technical advice in response the European Commission's Call for Advice (CfA) on the Investment Firms Regulation (IFR) and Investment Firms Directive (IFD). They propose limiting significant changes to the framework, which has proven to be fit-for-purpose, as confirmed by stakeholder feedback during the joint consultation.</span></p>
<p>The recommendations aim to:</p>
<ol>
<li>enhance the proportionality and functioning of the prudential framework;</li>
<li>improve the framework's ability to contribute to a level playing field among investment firms, and between investment firms and financial institutions that perform similar activities.</li>
</ol>
<p>The joint report highlights the areas where higher or lower alignment with the banking framework would be beneficial. It also identifies the need to improve definitions, calculation methodologies, and thresholds monitoring for investment firms, while emphasising the importance of harmonising the scope of calculation to ensure consistent application of the framework.</p>
<p>In addition, the report addresses a wider range of topics, including the adequacy of own funds requirements, the implications of the Banking Package, the prudential consolidation of investment firm groups, and aspects related to remuneration. It also considers the interactions between the IFR/IFD framework and other regulations, namely the Market in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), the Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS), and the Alternative Investment Funds Managers (AIFM) Directives.</p>
<p><span>Next steps</span></p>
<p>The EBA and ESMA will submit the joint report to the European Commission.</p>
<p><span>Legal basis and background</span></p>
<p>Under Article 16a(4) of their founding regulations, the EBA and ESMA may provide technical advice at the request of the EU Commission, in areas defined in the legislative acts referenced in Article 1(2) of their respective founding regulations.</p>
<p>This report was prepared in response to the &ldquo;Call for advice to the EBA and ESMA for the purposes of the reports on the prudential requirements applicable to investment firms&rdquo;, published on 1 February 2023. The CfA asked to cover, among others, the areas of categorisation of investment firms, the interaction with CRR/CRD, and the future proofing of the IFR/IFD regime.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA), the independent regulator of the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), and the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), the specialist regulator responsible for regulating and overseeing the virtual assets sector in the Emirate of Dubai and its free zones excluding the DIFC, today signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU).</p>
<p>The MoU will enhance cooperation and collaboration between the two regulators in undertaking their responsibilities within their respective jurisdictions and will further support the development of a robust and well-regulated virtual asset market in Dubai. The MoU was signed by Mark Steward, Chief Executive of the DFSA, and Matthew White, Chief Executive Officer of VARA, at GITEX Global, the world&rsquo;s largest tech and start-up event.</p>
<p>The MoU provides a framework for collaboration between the DFSA, which is responsible for regulating and overseeing the DIFC&rsquo;s virtual asset regime, and VARA, which governs the virtual assets economy across the Emirate of Dubai, excluding the DIFC.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, both regulators will work together to:</p>
<ul>
<li>strengthen cooperation on licensing, supervision, and enforcement matters;</li>
<li>support efforts to combat money laundering, terrorism financing, and proliferation financing; and</li>
<li>facilitate the exchange of information to promote integrity and confidence across Dubai&rsquo;s financial and virtual asset markets.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Mark Steward, Chief Executive of the DFSA, said:</span><em>&nbsp;&ldquo;</em><i>Regulatory cooperation is an important step forward and this MoU will help the DFSA and VARA work together and share information on a formal basis to help develop further the virtual asset sector in Dubai.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p><span>Matthew White, Chief Executive Officer of VARA, said:&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;<i>Dubai&rsquo;s strength lies in our ability to innovate with regulatory coordination, offering clarity so that the industry can operate with certainty, investors are protected, and market misconduct is remediated swiftly.&nbsp;</i><i>This MoU reinforces Dubai&rsquo;s commitment to operating a single, high-integrity marketplace that sets global benchmarks for responsible innovation in virtual assets.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The signing ceremony took place during GITEX Global, reflecting Dubai&rsquo;s Economic Agenda D33 vision as the global benchmark for digital transformation and regulatory innovation. The collaboration between DFSA and VARA comes as Dubai has been ranked among the world&rsquo;s top four fintech hubs, and has advanced to 11th position globally, according to the Global Financial Centres Index 38 (GFCI), published on 25 September 2025.</p>
<p>The DFSA-VARA MoU underscores this progress, strengthening regulatory alignment across the Emirate and further supporting Dubai&rsquo;s objective to strengthen its position as a top-tier global centre for finance and innovation.</p>

<title>LME Clear Introduces Triparty Agent For Clearing Members</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/lme-clear-introduces-triparty-agent-for-clearing-members-20251015/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/lme-clear-introduces-triparty-agent-for-clearing-members-20251015/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="large-text">LME Clear has today launched its new triparty member margin collateral service that has been introduced to support members&rsquo; collateral management. The service will be provided by Euroclear, a financial market infrastructure, that holds over &euro;41 trillion assets in custody.</p>
<p>The introduction of a triparty agent provides members with the opportunity to reduce the complexity and costs of managing the collateral they hold with LME Clear to meet margin requirements. Currently, when required to provide securities as collateral to LME Clear, members transfer individual securities directly from their account into LME Clear&rsquo;s collateral account. This entails a member selecting which securities to transfer, processing instructions for each settlement and facing instruction and settlement costs for each security that is transferred.</p>
<p>In future, members will be able to hold securities with Euroclear through the triparty service and give a single instruction for Euroclear to transfer multiple securities to LME Clear to meet margin requirements. All the administration will be handled by Euroclear which will ensure that members&rsquo; securities are optimised and used efficiently.</p>
<p>Under the triparty arrangement, members will be able to hold a wider range of assets than current bilateral eligibility allows. Euroclear will be responsible for determining whether securities meet LME Clear&rsquo;s requirements and LME Clear will work with Euroclear to ensure that the correct risk parameters are set and applied.</p>
<p>The triparty service will make it easier for LME Clear to introduce new categories or issuers of securities as acceptable collateral. It has enabled LME Clear to now accept eligible collateral from an additional nine new issuers, as well as including US and UK Inflation Linked Bonds as eligible, where the securities are held by Euroclear as the triparty agent.</p>
<p>Barry Gethin, LME Clear&rsquo;s Head of Collateral and Liquidity Services said: &ldquo;We are keen to support our members who face the challenge of making the most efficient use of their resources. &ldquo;Introducing a triparty service will allow members to reduce their operational burden and make optimal choices about the securities they provide as collateral. In addition, it opens the door to members holding a wider range of securities as acceptable collateral. We will continue to deliver enhancements to our collateral service to benefit our marketplace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sara Cescutti, Chief Commercial Officer, EMEA Euroclear commented: &ldquo;Euroclear has a strong history of delivering collateral management solutions across the globe. This new initiative highlights the vital role we play in supporting clients and other market infrastructures to optimise collateral allocation, minimise settlement fails, and reduce credit usage &ndash; ultimately contributing to greater market efficiency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>LME Clear has also confirmed that it will be making changes to the way that Offshore Renminbi (CNH) can be held as eligible cash collateral. Applicable from 1 November, changes to the interest paid on CNH held as collateral are intended to make it a more attractive option for clearing members as part of a renewed focus on the CNH collateral service.</p>
<h4><span>Background</span><span>&nbsp;</span></h4>
<ul>
<li>LME Clear accepts a range of assets as acceptable collateral, including securities (bonds) from: USA, UK, France, Germany, Finland, Japan, Netherlands. For those clearing members using the triparty service, acceptable collateral will be extended to include certain explicitly government guaranteed and supranational issuers as well as Inflation Linked Bonds issued by some approved sovereign issuers. Full details of eligible collateral and further detail on the triparty collateral service can be found on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lme.com/Clearing/Collateral-management">collateral management</a>&nbsp;.</li>
<li>The LME has accepted Offshore Renminbi as eligible cash collateral since 2015. Details can be found on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lme.com/Clearing/Collateral-management/Acceptable-collateral/Renminbi-as-collateral">renminbi as collateral</a>.</li>

<title>From Open Data To AI: UAE Securities And Commodities Authority Highlights The Future Of Regulatory Services At GITEX Global 2025</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/from-open-data-to-ai-uae-securities-and-commodities-authority-highlights-the-fu-20251015/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li><i>Smart tools incorporating artificial intelligence, open data, and interactive services to enhance transparency and communication with investors</i></li>
<li><i>AI assistant and a virtual asset monitoring system that strengthen oversight and facilitate easy access to information</i></li>
<li><i>An updated digital platform to improve user experience and promote inclusivity</i></li>
</ul>
<p>The Securities and Commodities Authority (SCA) today spotlighted the next generation of regulatory services, focusing on ease of access, transparency, and open data, placing them at the core of the UAE&rsquo;s financial regulatory framework, during its participation in GITEX Global 2025.</p>
<p>This step is part of the SCA&rsquo;s efforts in its digital transformation journey, aligning with the UAE&rsquo;s national strategy for advanced and inclusive government services.</p>
<p><b>H.E. Waleed Al Awadhi, CEO of the Securities and Commodities Authority</b>, said: &ldquo;SCA&rsquo;s digital transformation reflects the UAE&rsquo;s broader vision for modern, accessible governance. By leveraging advanced technologies such as open data and artificial intelligence, and redesigning our digital platform, we are creating regulatory tools that anticipate change and protect confidence in the market. It is a transformation that strengthens both service and supervision.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During GITEX Global 2025, SCA is showcasing two AI-powered prototypes that illustrate how advanced technologies can strengthen investor engagement and market oversight, alongside a newly designed digital platform.</p>
<p>The SupTech Virtual Assets Monitoring prototype illustrates how supervisory tools can support proper onboarding and monitoring of virtual asset service providers. The tools are powered by AI for seamless case investigations. Meanwhile, the Investor AI Assistant, developed using MS Azure Cognitive Services, allows investors to verify SCA-licensed entities and individuals and access regulatory information through bilingual voice and text interaction.</p>
<p>The redesigned website complements these innovations by improving how users navigate, search and interpret market data. Service titles and descriptions have been rewritten for clarity, while bilingual content has been refined for accuracy and consistency</p>
<p>The new platform also enhances access to information and strengthens market transparency.</p>
<p>Accessibility was an equally important part of the redesign, ensuring that the platform serves every user without barriers. In line with DLS 2.0 standards, the website introduces features that make SCA&rsquo;s digital services more inclusive for people of determination, including text-to-speech functionality, adjustable font and contrast settings, and layouts optimised for mobile and tablet.</p>
<p>Through these initiatives, SCA is shaping a more transparent and connected capital market environment that supports innovation, inclusion and sustainable economic growth.</p>

<title>BETTER FINANCE &amp; FESE Joint Statement: Call To Action For The Market Integration Package</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/better-finance-and-fese-joint-statement-call-to-action-for-the-market-integration-20251015/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>BETTER FINANCE and FESE have issued a joint statement urging EU policymakers to fully seize the opportunity presented by the forthcoming Market Integration Package to introduce&nbsp;<span>bold measures that address liquidity fragmentation and restore transparency</span>. This legislative initiative will offer a unique and time-sensitive moment to advance these essential reforms, making EU capital markets deeper, more attractive, and more resilient, delivering on the Savings and Investment Union (SIU) vision.</p>
<p>Deep, transparent, and liquid secondary markets are&nbsp;<span>essential to attracting IPOs and sustaining a vibrant listing ecosystem</span>. This stands in contrast to the ongoing shift toward &ldquo;off-exchange&rdquo; trading channels, which is driving fragmentation and opacity.</p>
<p>A key priority is to establish a&nbsp;<span>level playing field between multilateral and bilateral venues</span>&mdash;particularly by significantly enhancing transparency for systematic internalisers&mdash;and to&nbsp;<span>ensure that retail orders are executed on lit, multilateral venues</span>. Proposals imposing new constraints on lit venues, such as mandatory interconnectivity, are not a priority. Preserving effective rules like MiFIR open access and related ETD exemptions, while avoiding premature expansion of the Consolidated Tape before implementation, is equally important.</p>
<p><span>The moment for bold action is now: to create EU capital markets that are transparent, liquid, and competitive.</span>&nbsp;BETTER FINANCE and FESE are committed to supporting policymakers in turning this vision into reality.</p>

<title>24X National Exchange Opens For Trading As First SEC-Approved 23/5 Stock Exchange - Historic Exchange Now Delivers Extended Hours Trading In U.S. Equities To Global Investors</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In a historic milestone for the financial industry,&nbsp;<a href="https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4530330-1&amp;h=385188198&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2F24exchange.com%2F&amp;a=24+Exchange" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">24 Exchange</a>&nbsp;today announced that trading has officially commenced on&nbsp;<a href="https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4530330-1&amp;h=997023903&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fequities.24exchange.com%2F&amp;a=24X+National+Exchange" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">24X National Exchange</a>&nbsp;(the "Exchange"), the first national securities exchange approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to offer 23-hour weekday trading of U.S. equities under full regulatory oversight.</p>
<p>24X National Exchange offers live trading of U.S. equities from 4:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. ET on weekdays, providing unprecedented access to U.S. equity markets for institutional investors and retail investors worldwide via broker-dealers that are members of this SEC-licensed Exchange.</p>
<p>24X National Exchange addresses growing demand for extended-hours trading among global investors, particularly in Asian and other regions where time-zones make traditional U.S. market hours difficult to access. With its early-morning (U.S. pre-market) and evening trading hours, the Exchange provides increased flexibility for trading strategies, improved liquidity, and more opportunities to react to global economic, corporate, or policy news outside of standard U.S. exchange operating hours.</p>
<p>The Exchange operates as a fully regulated national securities exchange under SEC oversight across an extended trading day, providing the same investor protections and market integrity safeguards as all other SEC-licensed national exchanges. 24X National Exchange is built upon a proven, cutting-edge technology platform powered by MEMX Technologies, ensuring a seamless, resilient, and cost-effective trading experience. The Unlisted Trading Privileges (UTP) data feed exchange code for 24X National Exchange is 'G'.</p>
<p>24X National Exchange CEO and Founder Dmitri Galinov said: "Our launch marks a milestone in the evolution of U.S. equities markets to trading around-the-clock. We're excited that 24X National Exchange has pioneered this path that will increase access, transparency, speed, and alignment with the global nature of today's economy &ndash; while lowering costs."</p>
<p>The Exchange received SEC approval in November 2024 to operate 23/5 trading hours, subject to the implementation of necessary modifications to Equity Data Plans and subsequent rule filings confirming its compliance with the Securities Exchange Act.</p>
<p>Pending final approvals and market infrastructure alignment, 24X National Exchange currently expects to launch 23/5 trading in the second half of 2026. In that phase, the Exchange will operate from 8:00 p.m. ET on Sunday through 8:00 p.m. ET on Friday, with a daily one-hour pause for operational maintenance.</p>
<p>"This launch is a transformational moment for global traders looking to access U.S. equity markets at more convenient times," Galinov added. "After years of innovation and regulatory collaboration, we're proud to deliver on our promise of around-the-clock trading to investors around the world. 24X National Exchange's launch is just the beginning &ndash; we're one major step closer to making 23-hour weekday trading a reality for U.S. equities worldwide."</p>

<title>Securities Commission Malaysia And TERAJU Move To Boost Capital Market Access For Bumiputera MSME And MTC</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) and TERAJU Bumiputera Corporation (TERAJU) have jointly agreed to facilitate better access to capital market financing for Bumiputera micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) and mid-tier companies (MTC).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both sides today signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to help facilitate such access for Bumiputera companies. The MoU was signed by the SC Chairman Dato&rsquo; Mohammad Faiz Azmi and TERAJU Chief Executive Officer Junady Nawawi at the SC.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two-year MoU supports the SC&rsquo;s &lsquo;Catalysing MSME and MTC Access to the Capital Market: 5-Year Roadmap (2024-2028)&rsquo; (Roadmap), which is aimed at increasing MSME and MTC market-based fundraising to RM40 billion in 2028. In addition, this partnership supports SC&rsquo;s capacity building initiatives as outlined under the Roadmap aimed at enhancing the readiness of MSMEs and MTCs for capital raising.</p>
<p>The tie-up also aligns with the 13<sup>th</sup> Malaysia Plan aspirations to scale up SMEs and enable Bumiputera entrepreneurs to compete regionally and globally.</p>
<p>Dato&rsquo; Mohammad Faiz said that Bumiputera companies have significant potential to scale, and capital market financing can be an important catalyst for their next phase of growth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through this collaboration with TERAJU, we aim to build a stronger pipeline of investment-ready companies that can raise funds, expand their businesses and compete regionally,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>TERAJU&rsquo;s CEO Encik Junady Nawawi said, &ldquo;This collaboration opens up new pathways for Bumiputera companies to expand beyond traditional financing. By working together with the SC, we are preparing more Bumiputera enterprises to access capital market opportunities with stronger governance, sharper financial discipline, and the confidence to compete regionally and globally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A key outcome from this collaboration is to strengthen the fundraising readiness and leadership capacity of Bumiputera companies. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This will be achieved through targeted capacity building initiatives, including the creation of the Elevate&ndash;TERAJU cohort under the SC&rsquo;s Elevate programme, led by Capital Markets Malaysia (CMM), an SC affiliate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Elevate programme is an executive leadership and fundraising readiness programme that help MTCs and SMEs strengthen their business strategy, governance, and financial management to meet the standards expected by investors.</p>
<p>Since its launch, five cohorts, comprising 78 companies have now successfully completed the Elevate programme.</p>
<p>Under this initiative, 20 Bumiputera companies from the manufacturing, healthcare, engineering and technology sectors has been selected for the inaugural Elevate&ndash;TERAJU cohort, marking the first step toward broader participation in Malaysia&rsquo;s capital market.</p>
<p>The MoU will cover the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build a strong pipeline of Bumiputera companies with the potential to access capital market financing. </li>
<li>Explore financing avenues through potential co-investment opportunities with private investors, to support the growth and expansion of Bumiputera companies. </li>
<li>Support sustainability disclosures for companies through the adoption of the SC&rsquo;s Simplified ESG Disclosure Guide and targeted capacity-building programmes.</li>
</ul>

<title>Joint Statement By Commercial Affairs Department, Singapore Police Force (CAD) &amp; Monetary Authority Of Singapore (MAS) - Civil Penalty Action Taken Against Tan Tee Beng For Insider Trading</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has imposed a civil penalty of S$50,000 on a 56-year-old-man, Tan Tee Beng (&ldquo;Tan&rdquo;), for insider trading in the shares of Tee International Limited (&ldquo;Tee International&rdquo;) and Tee Land Limited (&ldquo;Tee Land&rdquo;). This civil penalty follows a joint investigation by the CAD and the MAS.</p>
<p>2.<span> </span>On 13 January 2020, Tee International announced that it had entered into a conditional sale and purchase agreement to sell its entire stake in its subsidiary, Tee Land to Amcorp Supreme Pte Ltd at S$0.179 per share. This sale price represented a premium of 9.1% over the closing price of Tee Land shares at S$0.164 on the previous trading day.<br /><br />3.<span> </span>At the material time, Tan was the Head of Margin at RHB Securities Singapore Pte Ltd (&ldquo;RHB Securities&rdquo;)<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/regulation/enforcement/enforcement-actions/2025/civil-penalty-action-taken-against-tan-tee-beng-for-insider-trading#1">[1]</a></span>. In the course of his work, Tan came to know of Tee International&rsquo;s impending sale of Tee Land and its intended sale price before this information was made public.&nbsp;<br /><br />4.<span> </span>Tan saw this corporate transaction as positive news and believed that the market would react positively to it. On 16 October 2019, he procured an individual to purchase shares in Tee International and Tee Land. On 11 and 13 December 2019, he personally purchased three million shares in Tee International. The Tee Land sale was eventually announced on 13 January 2020.&nbsp;<br /><br />5.<span> </span>Tan has admitted to contravening section 219(2)(a) and section 219(2)(b) of the Securities and Futures Act (Chapter 289, Revised Edition 2006) (&ldquo;SFA&rdquo;) and has paid MAS the civil penalty without court action. Tan has also given a voluntary undertaking not to be a company director or be involved in the management of a company for a period of two years.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><br />***</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/regulation/enforcement/enforcement-actions/2025/civil-penalty-action-taken-against-tan-tee-beng-for-insider-trading#1-footnote-1">[1]</a></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="footnote-item-content" id="footnote-1">RHB Securities is no longer in operation.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Additional information</span></span></p>
<p><span>(A)<span>&nbsp;</span>The civil penalty regime<br /></span><br />A civil penalty action is not a criminal action and does not attract criminal sanctions. The civil penalty regime, designed to complement criminal sanctions and provide a nuanced approach to combat market misconduct, became operational at the beginning of 2004.<br /><br />Under section 232 of the SFA, MAS may enter into an agreement with any person for that person to pay, with or without admission of liability, a civil penalty for contravening any provision of Part 12 of the SFA. The civil penalty may be up to three times the amount of the profit gained or loss avoided by that person as a result of the contravention, subject to a minimum of $50,000 (if the person is not a corporation) or $100,000 (if the person is a corporation).<br /><br /><span>(B)<span>&nbsp;</span>Section 219(2)(a) of the SFA<br /></span><br />Section 219(2)(a) prohibits a person who is not connected to any corporation but who possesses materially price-sensitive information that is not generally available, which he knows is materially price-sensitive and not generally available, from subscribing for, purchasing or selling, or entering into an agreement to subscribe for, purchase or sell these securities.<br /><br /><span>(C)<span>&nbsp;</span>Section 219(2)(b) of the SFA<br /></span><br />Section 219(2)(b) prohibits a person who is not connected to any corporation but who possesses materially price-sensitive information that is not generally available, which he knows is materially price-sensitive and not generally available, from procuring another person to subscribe for, purchase or sell, or enter into an agreement to subscribe for, purchase or sell these securities.</p>

<title>ASIC Updates Guidance On Communicating Audit Findings To Directors, Audit Committees And Senior Managers</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC has updated guidance on how, when, and which audit file review findings will be communicated to directors, audit committees and senior managers.</p>
<p>The revised Regulatory Guide 260&nbsp;<em>Communicating findings from audit files to directors, audit committees or senior managers</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/regulatory-guides/rg-260-communicating-findings-from-audit-files-to-directors-audit-committees-or-senior-managers/" title="RG 260 Communicating findings from audit files to directors, audit committees or senior managers">RG 260</a>) provides practical guidance for directors, audit committees, and senior managers of companies, responsible entities, superannuation trustees, disclosing entities, and audit firms.</p>
<p>The updates reflect:</p>
<ul>
<li>ASIC&rsquo;s new responsibilities and powers following law reform to regulate the financial reporting and audit requirements of registrable superannuation entities (RSEs), and</li>
<li>that the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (ASIC Act) now allows ASIC to communicate findings from audit file reviews to the relevant directors of superannuation trustees.</li>
</ul>
<p>The updated&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/regulatory-guides/rg-260-communicating-findings-from-audit-files-to-directors-audit-committees-or-senior-managers/" title="RG 260 Communicating findings from audit files to directors, audit committees or senior managers">RG 260</a>&nbsp;replaces previous guidance issued in July 2022.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/regulatory-guides/rg-260-communicating-findings-from-audit-files-to-directors-audit-committees-or-senior-managers/" title="RG 260 Communicating findings from audit files to directors, audit committees or senior managers">RG 260</a>&nbsp;outlines ASIC&rsquo;s approach to communicating financial reporting and audit quality findings from audit file reviews. It aims to help entities and audit firms understand what to expect.</p>
<p>ASIC has a pro-active surveillance program designed to raise the standard of financial reporting and audits and build confidence in the financial system.</p>
<p>We review a selection of audit files and where we have concerns about audit quality or auditor independence, we raise these with the audit firms and include our findings and observations in a public report.</p>
<p>We also share our findings, together with the firms&rsquo; response, with the directors, audit committees, senior managers and other key stakeholders of the audited entity. The purpose of this is so the audit firms and audited entities can work together and take steps to improve financial reporting and audit quality.</p>

<title>New Zealand Financial Markets Authority: OCR Pass Through Transparency - Delivering Transparency On The Pace At Which Financial Institutions Respond To Changes In The Official Cash Rate</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-ocr-pass-through-transparency-deliver-20251015/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-ocr-pass-through-transparency-deliver-20251015/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) sets the official cash rate (OCR) to achieve and maintain price stability (inflation). Banks and other financial institutions like credit unions, building societies and some finance companies use the level of the OCR as one of the factors when they determine interest rates offered to their customers.</p>
<p>When the RBNZ changes the OCR the financial institutions may make changes to their interest rates, but that can take time depending on the institution. The table below shows the size of interest rate changes and the time taken for the change to take effect for new and existing customers of floating rate mortgages and on call savings accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMA has requested information from eight financial institutions<span>1</span>&nbsp;that provide ~98% of housing loans in New Zealand<span>2</span>. These financial institutions already provide information about the interest rates applicable to their products, and when they are moved, through a variety of channels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are publishing this information to:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve transparency of the pace at which banks pass through changes to the RBNZ&rsquo;s Official Cash Rate (OCR) for new and existing customers. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Provide consumers a centralised source of information to view the interest rates of the financial institutions participating. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Illustrate the changes made to interest rates on two key products affected by moves in the OCR and, importantly, when those changes come into effect for new and existing customers.&nbsp;</li>
<li>To assist consumers in making informed decisions.&nbsp;</li>

<title>BC Securities Commission: Victims Of U.S.-Based DFRF Fraud Can Seek Compensation With U.S. Authorities</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/bc-securities-commission-victims-of-us-based-dfrf-fraud-can-seek-compensation-20251015/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/bc-securities-commission-victims-of-us-based-dfrf-fraud-can-seek-compensation-20251015/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The BC Securities Commission (BCSC) is encouraging B.C. victims of a U.S.-based Ponzi and pyramid scheme to file a claim with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<p>The US$15 million fraud was orchestrated in 2014 and 2015 by Daniel Rojo Fernandes Filho, a Brazilian national who was living in Florida. U.S. federal courts ruled in 2019 that Filho and several others, including Heriberto C. Perez Valdes, a former Florida resident, committed securities fraud.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The scheme involved selling membership units in Massachusetts-based DFRF Enterprises LLC and Florida-based DFRF Enterprises, LLC. Investors were promised extraordinarily high no-risk returns in the entities&rsquo; supposedly lucrative gold mining operations. In reality, the entities did not have any gold reserves, and their only source of money was investors.</p>
<p>People who purchased memberships in DFRF Enterprises between June 1, 2014 and June 30, 2015 may be eligible for a distribution from the SEC&rsquo;s DFRF Distribution Fund. Eligible investors can submit an electronic claim by December 19. More information about the process is available on the official claims&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dfrfdistributionfund.com/" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>
<p>In February 2023, a BCSC panel&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bcsc.bc.ca/about/media-room/news-releases/2023/13-bc-residents-must-pay-956k-for-role-in-cross-border-fraud">ordered</a>&nbsp;three B.C. residents to pay a combined total of almost $956,000 for their role in the fraud; the BCSC also banned them from the investment market for varying amounts of time. The BCSC found that 137 B.C. residents or people connected to the province lost a total of $1.5 million. In total, there were about 1,400 victims around the world.</p>

<title>Understanding The Fed’s Balance Sheet, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell, At The 67th Annual Meeting Of The National Association For Business Economics, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-md-8">
<p>Thank you, Emily. And thank you to the National Association for Business Economics for the Adam Smith Award. It is an honor just to be mentioned alongside past recipients, including my predecessors Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke. Thank you for this recognition and for the opportunity to speak with you today.</p>
<p>Monetary policy is more effective when the public understands what the Federal Reserve does and why. With that in mind, I hope to enhance understanding of one of the more arcane and technical aspects of monetary policy: the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. A colleague recently compared this topic to a trip to the dentist, but that comparison may be unfair&mdash;to dentists.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20251014a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a></p>
<p>Today, I will discuss the essential role our balance sheet played during the pandemic, along with some lessons learned. I will then review our ample reserves implementation framework and the progress we have made toward normalizing the size of our balance sheet. I will conclude with some brief remarks on the economic outlook.</p>
<p><span>Background on the Fed's Balance Sheet</span><br />One of the primary purposes of a central bank is to provide the monetary foundation for the financial system and the broader economy. This foundation is made of central bank liabilities. On the Fed's balance sheet, the liability side of the ledger totaled $6.5 trillion as of October 8, and three categories account for roughly 95 percent of that total.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20251014a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;First, Federal Reserve notes&mdash;that is, physical currency&mdash;totaled $2.4 trillion. Second, reserves&mdash;funds held by depository institutions at the Federal Reserve Banks&mdash;totaled $3.0 trillion. These deposits allow commercial banks to make and receive payments and meet regulatory requirements. Reserves are the safest and most liquid asset in the financial system, and only the Fed can create them. The adequate provision of reserves is essential to the safety and soundness of our banking system, the resilience and efficiency of our payments system, and ultimately the stability of our economy.</p>
<p>Third is the Treasury General Account (TGA), currently at about $800 billion, which essentially is the checking account for the federal government. When the Treasury makes or receives payments, those flows affect dollar-for-dollar the supply of reserves or other liabilities in the system.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20251014a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a></p>
<p>The asset side of our ledger consists almost entirely of securities, including $4.2 trillion of U.S. Treasury securities and $2.1 trillion of government-guaranteed agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS).<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20251014a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;When we add reserves to the system, we generally do so by purchasing Treasury securities in the open market and crediting the reserve accounts of the banks involved in the transaction with the seller. This process effectively transforms securities held by the public into reserves but does not change the total amount of government liabilities held by the public.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20251014a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a></p>
<p><span>The Balance Sheet Is an Important Tool</span><br />The Fed's balance sheet serves as a critical policy tool, especially when the policy rate is constrained by the effective lower bound (ELB). When COVID-19 struck in March 2020, the economy came to a near standstill and financial markets seized up, threatening to transform a public health crisis into a severe, prolonged economic downturn.</p>
<p>In response, we established a number of emergency liquidity facilities. Those programs, supported by Congress and the Administration, provided critical support to markets and were remarkably effective in restoring confidence and stability. At their peak in July 2020, loans from these facilities totaled just over $200 billion. Most of these loans were quickly unwound as conditions stabilized.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20251014a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a></p>
<p>At the same time, the market for U.S. Treasury securities&mdash;normally the deepest, most liquid market in the world and the bedrock of the global financial system&mdash;was under extraordinary pressure and on the verge of collapse. We used large-scale purchases of securities to restore functionality to the Treasury market. Faced with unprecedented market dysfunction, the Fed purchased Treasury and agency securities at an extraordinary pace in March and April of 2020. These purchases supported the flow of credit to households and businesses and fostered more accommodative financial conditions to support the recovery of the economy when it ultimately came.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20251014a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;This source of policy accommodation was important as we had lowered the federal funds rate close to zero and expected it to remain there for some time.</p>
<p>By June 2020, we slowed our purchase pace to a still substantial $120 billion per month. In December 2020, as the economic outlook remained highly uncertain, the FOMC said that we expected to maintain that pace of purchases "until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee's maximum employment and price stability goals."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20251014a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a>&nbsp;That guidance provided assurance that the Fed would not prematurely withdraw support while the economic recovery remained fragile amid unprecedented conditions.</p>
<p>We maintained that pace of asset purchases through October 2021. By then, it had become apparent that elevated inflation was not likely to go away without a strong monetary response. At our meeting in November 2021, we announced a phaseout of asset purchases. At our next meeting in December, we doubled the pace of the taper and said that asset purchases would conclude by mid-March of 2022. Over the entire period of purchases, our securities holdings increased by $4.6 trillion.</p>
<p>A number of observers have raised questions, fairly enough, about the size and composition of asset purchases during the pandemic recovery.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20251014a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;Throughout 2020 and 2021, the economy continued to face significant challenges as successive waves of COVID caused widespread disruption and loss. During that tumultuous period, we continued purchases in order to avoid a sharp, unwelcome tightening of financial conditions at a time when the economy still appeared to be highly vulnerable. Our thinking was informed by recent episodes in which signals about reducing the balance sheet had triggered significant tightening in financial conditions. We were thinking of events of December 2018, as well as the 2013 "taper tantrum."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20251014a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a></p>
<p>Regarding the composition of our purchases, some have questioned the inclusion of agency MBS purchases given the strong housing market during the pandemic recovery.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20251014a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a>&nbsp;Outside of purchases aimed specifically at market functioning, MBS purchases are primarily intended, like our purchases of Treasury securities, to ease broader financial conditions when the policy rate is constrained at the ELB.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20251014a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a>&nbsp;The extent to which these MBS purchases disproportionately affected housing market conditions during this period is challenging to determine. Many factors affect the mortgage market, and many factors beyond the mortgage market affect supply and demand in the broader housing market.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20251014a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a></p>
<p>With the clarity of hindsight, we could have&mdash;and perhaps should have&mdash;stopped asset purchases sooner. Our real-time decisions were intended to serve as insurance against downside risks. We knew that we could unwind purchases relatively quickly once we ended them, which is exactly what we did. Research and experience tell us that asset purchases affect the economy through expectations regarding the future size and duration of our balance sheet.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20251014a.htm#fn14" title="footnote 14"><span>14</span></a><a name="f14"></a>&nbsp;When we announced our taper, market participants began pricing in its effects, pulling forward the tightening in financial conditions.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20251014a.htm#fn15" title="footnote 15"><span>15</span></a><a name="f15"></a>&nbsp;Stopping sooner could have made some difference, but not likely enough to fundamentally alter the trajectory of the economy. Nonetheless, our experience since 2020 does suggest that we can be more nimble in our use of the balance sheet, and more confident that our communications will foster appropriate expectations among market participants given their growing experience with these tools.</p>
<p>Some have also argued that we could have better explained the purpose of asset purchases in real time.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20251014a.htm#fn16" title="footnote 16"><span>16</span></a><a name="f16"></a>&nbsp;There is always room for improved communication. But I believe our statements were reasonably clear about our objectives, which were to support and then sustain smooth market functioning and to help foster accommodative financial conditions. Over time, the relative importance of those objectives evolved with economic conditions. But the objectives were never in conflict, so at the time this issue appeared to be a distinction without much of a difference. That is not always the case, of course. For example, the March 2023 banking stress led to a sizable increase in our balance sheet through lending operations. We clearly differentiated these financial stability operations from our monetary policy stance. Indeed, we continued to raise the policy rate through that time.</p>
<p><span>Our Ample Reserves Framework Works Well</span><br />Turning to my second topic, our ample reserves regime has proven highly effective, delivering good control of our policy rate across a wide range of challenging economic conditions, while promoting financial stability and supporting a resilient payments system.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20251014a.htm#fn17" title="footnote 17"><span>17</span></a><a name="f17"></a></p>
<p>In this framework, an ample supply of reserves ensures adequate liquidity in the banking system, and control of our policy rate is achieved through the setting of our administered rates&mdash;interest on reserve balances and the overnight reverse repo rate. This approach allows us to maintain rate control independently of the size of our balance sheet. That is important given large, unpredictable swings in liquidity demand from the private sector and significant fluctuations in autonomous factors affecting reserve supply, such as the Treasury General Account.</p>
<p>This framework has proven resilient whether the balance sheet is shrinking or growing. Since June 2022, we have reduced the size of our balance sheet by $2.2 trillion&mdash;from 35 percent to just under 22 percent of GDP&mdash;while maintaining effective interest rate control.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20251014a.htm#fn18" title="footnote 18"><span>18</span></a><a name="f18"></a></p>
<p>Our long-stated plan is to stop balance sheet runoff when reserves are somewhat above the level we judge consistent with ample reserve conditions.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20251014a.htm#fn19" title="footnote 19"><span>19</span></a><a name="f19"></a>&nbsp;We may approach that point in coming months, and we are closely monitoring a wide range of indicators to inform this decision.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20251014a.htm#fn20" title="footnote 20"><span>20</span></a><a name="f20"></a>&nbsp;Some signs have begun to emerge that liquidity conditions are gradually tightening, including a general firming of repo rates along with more noticeable but temporary pressures on selected dates. The Committee's plans lay out a deliberately cautious approach to avoid the kind of money market strains experienced in September 2019. Moreover, the tools of our implementation framework, including the standing repo facility and the discount window, will help contain funding pressures and keep the federal funds rate within our target range through this transition to lower reserve levels.</p>
<p>Normalizing the size of our balance sheet does not mean going back to the balance sheet we had before the pandemic. In the longer run, the size of our balance sheet is determined by the public's demand for our liabilities rather than our pandemic-related asset purchases. Non-reserve liabilities currently stand about $1.1 trillion higher than just prior to the pandemic, thus requiring that our securities holdings be equally higher. Demand for reserves has risen as well, in part reflecting the growth of the banking system and the overall economy.</p>
<p>Regarding the composition of our securities portfolio, relative to the outstanding universe of Treasury securities, our portfolio is currently overweight longer-term securities and underweight shorter-term securities. The longer-run composition will be a topic of Committee discussion. Transition to our desired composition will occur gradually and predictably, giving market participants time to adjust and minimizing the risk of market disruption. Consistent with our longstanding guidance, we aim for a portfolio consisting primarily of Treasury securities over the longer run.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20251014a.htm#fn21" title="footnote 21"><span>21</span></a><a name="f21"></a></p>
<p>Some have questioned whether the interest we pay on reserves is costly to taxpayers. In fact, that is not the case. The Fed earns interest income from the Treasury securities that back reserves. Most of the time, our interest earnings from Treasury holdings more than cover the interest paid on reserves, generating significant remittances to the Treasury. By law, we remit all profits to the Treasury after covering expenses. Since 2008, even after accounting for the recent period of negative net income, our total remittances to Treasury have totaled more than $900 billion. While our net interest income has temporarily been negative due to the rapid rise in policy rates to control inflation, this is highly unusual. Our net income will soon turn positive again, as it typically has been throughout our history. Of course, having negative net income has no bearing on our ability to conduct monetary policy or meet our financial obligations.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20251014a.htm#fn22" title="footnote 22"><span>22</span></a><a name="f22"></a></p>
<p>If our ability to pay interest on reserves and other liabilities were eliminated, the Fed would lose control over rates. The stance of monetary policy would no longer be appropriately calibrated to economic conditions and would push the economy away from our employment and price stability goals. To restore rate control, large sales of securities over a short period of time would be needed to shrink our balance sheet and the quantity of reserves in the system. The volume and speed of these sales could strain Treasury market functioning and compromise financial stability. Market participants would need to absorb the sales of Treasury securities and agency MBS, which would put upward pressure on the entire yield curve, raising borrowing costs for the Treasury and the private sector. Even after that volatile and disruptive process, the banking system would be less resilient and more vulnerable to liquidity shocks.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that our ample reserves regime has proven remarkably effective for implementing monetary policy and supporting economic and financial stability.</p>
<p><span>Current Economic Conditions and Monetary Policy Outlook</span><br />I will close with a brief discussion of the economy and the outlook for monetary policy. Although some important government data have been delayed due to the shutdown, we routinely review a wide variety of public- and private-sector data that have remained available. We also maintain a nationwide network of contacts through the Reserve Banks who provide valuable insights, which will be summarized in tomorrow's Beige Book.</p>
<p>Based on the data that we do have, it is fair to say that the outlook for employment and inflation does not appear to have changed much since our September meeting four weeks ago. Data available prior to the shutdown, however, show that growth in economic activity may be on a somewhat firmer trajectory than expected.</p>
<p>While the unemployment rate remained low through August, payroll gains have slowed sharply, likely in part due to a decline in labor force growth due to lower immigration and labor force participation. In this less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market, the downside risks to employment appear to have risen. While official employment data for September are delayed, available evidence suggests that both layoffs and hiring remain low, and that both households' perceptions of job availability and firms' perceptions of hiring difficulty continue their downward trajectories.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20251014a.htm#fn23" title="footnote 23"><span>23</span></a><a name="f23"></a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, 12-month core PCE inflation was 2.9 percent in August, up slightly from earlier this year, as rising core goods inflation has outpaced continued disinflation in housing services. Available data and surveys continue to show that goods price increases primarily reflect tariffs rather than broader inflationary pressures. Consistent with these effects, near-term inflation expectations have generally increased this year, while most longer-term expectation measures remain aligned with our 2 percent goal.</p>
<p>Rising downside risks to employment have shifted our assessment of the balance of risks. As a result, we judged it appropriate to take another step toward a more neutral policy stance at our September meeting. There is no risk-free path for policy as we navigate the tension between our employment and inflation goals. This challenge was evident in the dispersion of Committee participants' projections at the September meeting. I will stress again that these projections should be understood as representing a range of potential outcomes whose probabilities evolve as new information informs our meeting-by-meeting approach to policymaking. We will set policy based on the evolution of the economic outlook and the balance of risks, rather than following a predetermined path.</p>
<p>Thank you again for this award and for inviting me to join you today. I look forward to our conversation.</p>

<p><a name="fn4"></a>4. Within its securities portfolio, the Federal Reserves also holds $2.3 billion in government agency debt.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn5"></a>5. In 2021, the standing repo facility was established to serve as a backstop in money markets to support the effective implementation of monetary policy and smooth market functioning. It is available to provide liquidity to primary dealers and eligible depository institutions through overnight repurchase agreements. The Federal Reserve also maintains U.S. dollar liquidity swap lines with several major central banks to prevent strains in global dollar funding markets from spilling over into domestic markets. The Foreign and International Monetary Authorities Repo Facility also is a source of dollar liquidity for approved foreign central banks and international monetary authorities. Beyond securities, the Fed maintains lending facilities that serve as crucial backstops for the banking system. The loans we make through these facilities show up as assets on our balance sheet, with the corresponding liability typically being reserves. Our discount window provides no-questions-asked liquidity to eligible depository institutions. In unusual and exigent circumstances, we may establish emergency liquidity facilities, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury. These facilities have demonstrated their critical importance in times of stress.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn6"></a>6. The combined peak in balances across these facilities occurred in July 2020 at just above $200 billion, including loans totaling $2.5 billion by the Primary Dealer Credit Facility, $20.6 billion by the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility, $68.1 billion by the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (PPPLF), $12.8 billion by the Commercial Paper Funding Facility, $41.4 billion by the Corporate Credit Facilities, $37.5 billion by the Main Street Lending Program (MSLP), $16.1 billion by the Municipal Liquidity Facility, and $8.8 billion by the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility; see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2020), Statistical Release H.4.1, "<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/20200702">Factors Affecting Reserve Balances of Depository Institutions and Condition Statement of Federal Reserve Banks</a>" (July 2). At present, the only remaining balances from the pandemic-era emergency lending facilities are $75 million in the PPPLF and $4.1 billion in the MSLP. All other emergency lending facilities have already been fully repaid.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="fn10"></a>10. In December 2018, financial markets experienced significant volatility and equity prices dropped notably. While multiple factors were in play, many market participants pointed to the description of the Fed's quantitative tightening as being on "autopilot" as exacerbating the turmoil. The "taper tantrum" was a sharp market selloff in 2013 when Chair Ben Bernanke suggested the Fed might soon reduce its asset purchases, causing Treasury yields to spike and triggering volatility in financial markets.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="fn13"></a>13. Research indicates that house price increases during this time reflected factors well beyond mortgage rates. For example, Mondragon and Wieland (2022) estimate that the shift to remote work explains approximately one-half of the rise in house prices during the pandemic; for more details, see John A. Mondragon and Johannes Wieland (2022), "<a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w30041/w30041.pdf">Housing Demand and Remote Work (PDF)</a>," NBER Working Paper Series 30041 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, May; revised May 2025).&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="fn15"></a>15. Even before the taper in purchases was completed in 2022, markets were anticipating the rapid decline in the size of the balance sheet that we subsequently delivered. Those expectations were formed based on our communications, even though the anticipated pace was three times faster than our experience from 2017 to 2019. For example, the median respondents to the Survey of Primary Dealers in June 2022 anticipated that the size of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) portfolio would ultimately fall by more than $2 trillion in less than three years, from its mid-2022 level of $8.5 trillion to $6.25 trillion by 2025:Q1.

<p><a name="fn17"></a>17. By contrast, before the GFC, the Fed implemented monetary policy through a fundamentally different approach, a scarce reserves regime. This system relied on complicated reserve requirements to stabilize reserve demand, as the Fed did not have the authority to pay interests on reserves. Because banks did not receive interest on reserves, they engaged in a variety of costly activities to minimize their reserve requirements. To hit the federal funds rate target, the Fed had to conduct daily open market operations to fine-tune reserve supply. That approach was operationally burdensome for both depository institutions and the Federal Reserve. It minimized systemwide liquidity consistent with the federal funds target rate, thus making the banking system more vulnerable to shocks. Unexpected swings in reserve demand at times led to excess volatility in short-term interest rates. In this scarce regime, banks relied more heavily on unsecured borrowing from other financial institutions&mdash;funding that can rapidly evaporate in times of stress, as was evident in the GFC.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn18"></a>18. In January 2022, the FOMC released its "Principles for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet," followed in May by more detailed plans for doing so; see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2022), "<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20220126c.htm">Principles for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet</a>," press release, January 26; and Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2022), "<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20220504b.htm">Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet</a>," May 4, press release.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn19"></a>19. Once balance sheet runoff has ceased, reserve balances will continue to gradually decline as other Federal Reserve liabilities grow over time. At some point, the Committee will determine that reserve balances have reached an appropriately ample level. Thereafter, the Committee will manage securities holdings as needed to maintain ample reserves over time.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn20"></a>20. While reserves appear to remain abundant, they are declining and will continue to do so. Since we began shrinking our balance sheet in 2022, the quantity of reserves has not changed much as the excess liquidity in the system was absorbed and then subsequently released by our overnight reverse repo facility. Now, however, balances in that facility have declined to minimal levels, so further declines in our securities holdings will translate more directly into lower reserves. Currently, reserve balances stand just below $3 trillion, or about 10 percent of GDP. By comparison, reserves as a share of GDP stood near 8 percent of GDP in early 2019, prior to the acute funding pressures that emerged later that year. Note that reserves as a share of GDP is merely indicative, not a measure of the ampleness of reserves. Assessments of where reserves stand relative to ample levels depend on a wide range of market indicators.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn21"></a>21. As noted in the minutes of the May 2022 FOMC meeting, the Committee could, at some point, consider sales of agency MBS to accelerate progress toward a longer-run SOMA portfolio composed primarily of Treasury securities; see Federal Open Market Committee (2022), "<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20220504.pdf">Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee (PDF)</a>" (Washington: FOMC, May 3&ndash;4).&nbsp;</p>

See, for example, Alyssa Anderson, Dave Na, Bernd Schlusche, and Zeynep Senyuz (2022), "<a href="https://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.3173">An Analysis of the Interest Rate Risk of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet, Part 1: Background and Historical Perspective</a>," FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, July 15); and Alyssa Anderson, Philippa Marks, Dave Na, Bernd Schlusche, and Zeynep Senyuz (2022), "<a href="https://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.3174">An Analysis of the Interest Rate Risk of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet, Part 2: Projections under Alternative Interest Rate Paths</a>," FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, July 15).&nbsp;</p>

September results regarding perceptions of employment conditions by firms and households are also available from recurring surveys, such as the National Federation of Independent Business's Jobs Report and the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Survey.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Speech</h2>
<p>Thank you for the introduction, and the kind invitation to come back and visit King&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s an honour to speak here today, and I am looking forward to our fireside chat and taking your questions.</p>
<p>For me, King&rsquo;s will always be a place of warm memories. It was on another October day, four decades ago, that I went up to Cambridge to read for the Mathematical Tripos. In 1984 I arrived at the gate from a small coal-mining village in Yorkshire with my happy but nervous parents in tow. I was the first in my family line to go to university, so it was a moment of great anticipation and anxiety, for them as much as for me, as I crossed that threshold. But we need not have worried&mdash;from day one, I could not have felt more at home in this college, nor more welcomed by students, fellows, and staff.</p>
<p>Arriving at King&rsquo;s on that first day, and then as time passed, and even a little bit today, I always had a sense of wonder walking in through the Porters&rsquo; Lodge, thinking: I maybe do not know what comes next, what I will learn, or where I will go, but I sure am excited to find out. It&rsquo;s a great institution that can make you feel that way, and I am very thankful.</p>
<p>Well, the journey, intellectual or otherwise, hopefully never ends &ndash; for me or for you &ndash; and I feel fortunate to be back here today following a career that has taken me around the world, studying and researching economics as an academic, and now, since last year, as a policymaker at the Bank of England on the Monetary Policy Committee.</p>

<title>The EBA Finds That White Labelling Is Widely Used In Banking And Payments</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published a Report on white labelling, i.e. a business model in which a financial institution works with another company (partner)&mdash;sometimes not even a financial firm&mdash;to offer products and services under the partner&rsquo;s brand. The EBA found that over a third of banks surveyed in 2025 use this model and has identified a need for ongoing supervisory convergence actions that will be taken forward in 2026.</span></p>
<p>Driven by digitalisation and platformisation, new ways for people to access financial services are emerging, including via white labelling that is being used by 35% of the banks responding to the EBA 2025 Spring Risk Assessment Questionnaire (RAQ). White labelling is a business model which involves a&nbsp;financial institution (the provider) entering into an agreement with another financial or non-financial firm (the partner), to offer one or more financial products and services under the partner&rsquo;s own brand only. Traditionally partners were also financial institutions but, increasingly, are non-regulated commercial entities (e.g. those operating online marketplaces).</p>
<p>The Report sets out the key features of white labelling, provides an overview of use cases, and identifies potential opportunities and risks. For consumers, risks include less clarity about who is responsible for the product, which can make it harder to know who to contact or to avoid fraud. For supervisors, it can mean less direct oversight of some partners.</p>
<p>The Report sets out follow-up actions the EBA will take in 2026 to promote a common supervisory approach towards these models and improve consumer understanding, including:</p>
<p>(i) raising supervisory awareness, having integrated white labelling in competent authorities&rsquo; supervisory priorities for 2026; and</p>
<p>(ii) ensuring more effective disclosures to consumers to facilitate their awareness as regard the firm they are dealing with and how to make complaints.</p>
<h4>Legal basis and background</h4>
<p>The EBA has a statutory duty to monitor and assess market developments, including technological innovation and innovative financial services (Article 9(2) of the EBA Founding Regulation).</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-09/a5bce431-7793-4b75-bd07-d5741c961fbe/EBA%20Work%20programme%202025.pdf">EBA&rsquo;s priorities</a>&nbsp;on innovative applications for 2024-25, included white labelling of financial products and services as part of the broader topic of value chain developments.</p>

<title>FCA Secures US$101m Redress For BlueCrest investors</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/fca-secures-us101m-redress-for-bluecrest-investors-20251014/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/fca-secures-us101m-redress-for-bluecrest-investors-20251014/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li><span>The FCA has secured US$101m in redress to UK and other non-US investors in a fund sub-managed by BlueCrest Capital Management (UK) LLP (BlueCrest) and imposed a public censure.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Between October 2011 and December 2015, BlueCrest failed to manage fairly a conflict of interest created by its role in managing both an investment fund exclusively for the benefit of its partners and employees and a flagship fund available to external investors.</p>
<p>BlueCrest&rsquo;s management approved UK-based traders being moved from the external fund to work on the internal fund, in which they were personally invested and where they stood to benefit personally from those decisions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Disclosures to investors were insufficient and, at times, misleading. Investors were not told that a significant number of traders were moved to work on the internal fund. This affected investors&rsquo; ability to make informed decisions.</p>
<p>The firm&rsquo;s failure to manage fairly the conflict led to a sub-standard service for the external fund and its investors.</p>
<p>Asset managers are trusted to make decisions for their clients. It is vital they have appropriate systems and controls in place to ensure conflicts of interest are managed fairly.</p>
<p>Therese Chambers, Joint Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight, said:</p>
<p>'This redress scheme brings a positive end to a long-running case. BlueCrest put its own interest ahead of the external fund and provided a substandard service, which meant that investors lost out.</p>
<p>'After many years of legal challenge, the FCA has now successfully secured a substantial US$101m for affected investors.'</p>
<p>The redress scheme will be overseen by BlueCrest. Affected investors will be contacted on next steps by BlueCrest or a scheme administrator if it chooses to appoint one.</p>

The redress requirement imposed by the FCA seeks to redress non-US investors that were not eligible to be compensated by the SEC&rsquo;s Fair Fund.</li>
<li>On 22 December 2021, the FCA published a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-publishes-decision-notice-hedge-fund-conflicts-interest-failings" title="FCA publishes Decision Notice against hedge fund for conflicts of interest failings">decision notice</a>&nbsp;against BlueCrest for conflicts of interest failings, which BlueCrest referred to the Upper Tribunal on 22 November 2021. That Decision Notice has now been superseded by the Final Notice above.</li>
<li>On 21 June 2023, the Upper Tribunal granted BlueCrest&rsquo;s application to strike out the FCA&rsquo;s case on redress. The Upper Tribunal also refused permission for the FCA to introduce certain new allegations and issues in response to arguments raised by BlueCrest.</li>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Supports Tokenisation To Boost Efficiency And Innovation In Asset Management</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-financial-conduct-authority-supports-tokenisation-to-boost-efficiency-and-inn-20251014/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li><span>The FCA has set out plans to support tokenisation, to drive innovation and growth in asset management.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The plans include guidance to provide firms with additional clarity to aid adoption of this new technology.</p>
<p>The UK is a leading asset management hub, with around 2,600 firms managing &pound;14 trillion of assets for UK and global clients. The FCA is committed to supporting innovation to help the sector continue to grow, as set out in its strategy.</p>
<p>As the way people invest changes in the future, tokenisation &ndash; digital representation of assets on distributed ledger technology &ndash; can help asset managers to innovate and stay competitive. Tokenised products could drive competition and increase choice for consumers &ndash; and open up new ways to distribute funds, including to those new to investing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tokenisation also has the potential to broaden access to private markets and infrastructure investment and ultimately help consumers access more cost-effective and personalised investments.</p>
<p>It offers further opportunities to improve efficiencies and reduce the costs of fund management, for example, by lowering the costs of sharing and reconciling data between firms involved in operating or distributing the fund. The FCA has been actively working with industry to deliver these benefits for asset managers in the UK.</p>
<p>Simon Walls, executive director of markets at the FCA, said:</p>
<p>'Tokenisation has the potential to drive fundamental changes in asset management, with benefits for the industry and consumers. There are many things that firms can do under our existing rules and more that become possible with the changes we propose enacting now. We stand ready to design the next stage with the industry &ndash; this publication suggests a path. The UK has the opportunity to be a world-leader here and we want to provide asset managers with the clarity and confidence they need to deliver.'</p>
<p>The FCA&rsquo;s proposals include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Guidance on operating tokenised fund registers under current FCA rules through the UK Blueprint model.</li>
<li>A streamlined, alternative dealing model for fund managers to process buying and selling of units in authorised funds, whether traditional or tokenised.</li>
<li>A roadmap to advance fund tokenisation and address key barriers like using public blockchains and settling transactions entirely on the blockchain.</li>
<li>A discussion on how tokenisation models could evolve and how regulation may need to change.</li>
</ul>
<p>This consultation also supports the delivery of the FCA&rsquo;s roadmap for digital assets.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>

<title>SIX Lands Seven-Year Strategic Partnership With Barclays</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li><span>SIX, the global financial data and market infrastructure provider, has today signed a seven-year strategic partnership with Barclays, the global banking group, to support the bank&rsquo;s international growth and drive cost efficiencies.</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="textimage ">
<div>
<div>
<p>Building on a longstanding relationship, the multi-year collaboration will see Barclays&rsquo; entire business &ndash; which spans investment banking, retail banking, wealth management, and corporate services &ndash; gain access to the vast suite of market-leading financial data products from SIX.</p>
<p>In addition, this new collaboration will see Barclays contributing to the product strategy and development of new data and analytical products, and jointly collaborating to develop new innovative customer solutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The news comes amid a major strategic transformation for Barclays, with the bank focused on simplification, and strengthening its three core businesses, whilst slashing &pound;2bn costs by 2026. &nbsp;&nbsp;The wide array of financial information services from SIX, including real-time market data, wealth management capabilities, regulatory reporting solutions, and cross asset data coverage, will be instrumental in supporting Barclays growth and cost management ambitions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Barclays&rsquo; strong presence in key regions such as the US and Asia aligns with the business model from SIX, supporting its plans to accelerate expansion and strengthen its presence in these markets. The partnership also comes after SIX launched two expansive new market data offerings in the first half of the year &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.six-group.com/en/newsroom/media-releases/2025/20250429-six-fixed-income-data.html">SIX Fixed Income Data</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.six-group.com/en/newsroom/media-releases/2025/20250401-six-darts-launch.html">Digital Assets Regulatory &amp; Tax Service</a>.</p>
<p><span>Marion Leslie, Head Financial Information &amp; Executive Board Member, SIX</span>, said: &ldquo;We are thrilled SIX will continue to play such a pivotal role in Barclays&rsquo; impressive growth story. As banks face immense pressure to curb costs amid an increasingly uncertain economic environment, harnessing the smartest financial data will be essential in protecting margins and laying the foundations for growth. This partnership is a testament to the strong foundations of our relationship that has been built on trust, commitment and collaboration.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Georges Lauchard, Global Markets and Wholesale Lending COO at Barclays</span>, added: &ldquo;SIX has been a valuable partner to Barclays over recent years, and it will continue to be so at this incredibly exciting chapter of the company&rsquo;s growth. Accelerating our digital transformation with the help of leading market data vendors like SIX is a central tenet of our expansion strategy, and we are excited to bring innovative new products and services to our global client base over the coming months.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Axes Falling On Bond Trading: FIX Trading Community</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/axes-falling-on-bond-trading-fix-trading-community-20251014/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/axes-falling-on-bond-trading-fix-trading-community-20251014/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<blockquote>
<div dir="ltr">
<div dir="ltr">
<p>The FIX Trading Community, the industry association that manages the world&rsquo;s trading language, the FIX Protocol, has committed to working with the global bond trading community and the International Capital Market Association (ICMA) to improve the efficiency and quality of bond trading.</p>
<p>The joint effort, spearheaded by the FIX Fixed Income Axe Standards Working Group, will address a specific ongoing issue for global buyside firms around &lsquo;axes&rsquo; &ndash; a traders&rsquo; indication of interest in buying or selling a security.</p>
<p>The growing prevalence of electronic trading in fixed income platforms has heightened demand for axes, however this had also led to a reduction in quality. As a result, axes have become less effective for price discovery and more difficult to trade, according to some buyside traders. Solving this issue would better support best execution.</p>
<p>FIX Executive Director Jim Kaye said both buy- and sell-sides had experienced frustrations with axes, which are an important part of bond trading, in an increasingly electronic world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is not a new issue but it&rsquo;s one that has irritated both sides for years,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;FIX is ideally placed as a neutral, independent space for all members of the bond trading community to come together to sort this out and improve the bond trading experience for everyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>FIX EMEA co-chair Matthew Coupe from Susquehanna said that for the sell side, dealer selection protocols have meant RFQs are routed toward dealers who show axes, applying pressure for firms to show them to ensure they are included in RFQ selection. This has led to a reduction in quality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sell side firms are well aware of these issues and are putting a lot of effort into making axes more accurate,&rdquo; Mr Coupe said. &ldquo;What we are looking for are higher-level strategic solutions that work for both sides, raise the quality of axes and allow buyside firms to use them when selecting their trading counterparties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The working group has identified two key deliverables. The first is to identify different types of liquidity and liquidity provider interest through FIX data standards,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;For example, having a flag in an axe to identify &lsquo;real&rsquo; positions would allow for better client and broker selection. Another deliverable that the group has agreed to look at is the creation of a standard report that can be delivered by platforms and trading venues of metrics that can be used to identify poor axe quality&rdquo;.</p>
<div>
<p>FIX and ICMA will publish a joint discussion paper in the coming months. Firms interested in this issue are invited to contact FIX and potentially participate in the FIX Fixed Income Axe Standards Working Group by visiting&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="http://www.fixtrading.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">www.fixtrading.org</a>. ICMA members can also engage through its&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.icmagroup.org/market-practice-and-regulatory-policy/secondary-markets/secondary-market-practices-committee-smpc-and-related-working-groups/icma-electronic-trading-council-etc/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Electronic Trading Working Group</a></p>
<p>The FIX Trading Community is an independent global community where capital markets firms come together to solve common issues and shape the evolution of capital markets.&nbsp;FIX groups in over 60 countries are working on a range of global issues including digital assets; reference data; carbon trading; AI; algo trading; FICC and ETFs, while country and regional committees work together to manage local regulation and market structure matters.</p>

<title>Crypto Markets Stabilise Post Tariff Turmoil - Comment From Hina Sattar Joshi, Director, TP ICAP, Digital Assets</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="xxmsonormal"><span>Trump&rsquo;s latest round of sweeping tariffs on Chinese imports sent shock tremors through risk assets, marking one of the most aggressive leverage washes in months. Crypto markets, true to form, were the first to react, and experienced a sudden sell-off over the weekend. What has followed since however is very telling.</span></p>
<p class="xxmsonormal"><span>By Monday morning, the market had stabilized, and more importantly, it had begun to recover. Bitcoin and Ethereum reclaimed ground, and altcoins like Solana and Ripple bounced meaningfully. Beneath the surface, indicators pointed to institutional buying the dip rather than panicking. Major Over-The-Counter (OTC) desks reported renewed flow, funding rates normalized, and the excessive leverage that was in the system has now been flushed out.</span></p>
<p class="xxmsonormal"><span>The quick recovery is clear evidence of how much more resilient and mature the market structure has become. Where once a cascade of liquidations could send the crypto market into free fall, we&rsquo;re now seeing depth of liquidity and real demand on the other side. Though still highly volatile, crypto&rsquo;s investability is no longer just purely speculative. With macro shocks likely to persist, particularly amidst the flurry of tariffs, the role of institutions as stabilizers is becoming harder to ignore.</span></p>
<p class="xxmsonormal"><span>The upcoming launch of US-listed Solana ETFs could mark a major turning point for institutions who are looking to expand beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Given the strong reception of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in the US, Solana is widely expected to have significant inflows, at least by the end of the year. For institutions, these ETFs are a regulated, streamlined path into a fast-growing asset class without having to deal with the hurdles of actually holding the spot.</span></p>

<title>Securities Commission Malaysia Drives Market-Based Financing For Climate Adaptation And Resilience</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) today hosted its inaugural Climate Adaptation and Resilience (A&amp;R) Conference, marking a step towards shaping the future of climate adaptation financing in Malaysia. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The event gathered over 400 delegates from ministries and government agencies, financial institutions, climate experts and academia to address the pivotal role the capital market plays in mobilising public and private finance for climate adaptation projects. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Minister of Plantation and Commodities and Acting Minister of Natural Resources and Environmental Sustainability, YB Datuk Seri Johari Abdul Ghani, delivered the keynote address on the government&rsquo;s approach in tackling climate risks. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The SC Chairman Dato&rsquo; Mohammad Faiz Azmi underscored the SC&rsquo;s aim to catalyse private capital into adaptation and resilience efforts. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unlike mitigation projects, many adaptation initiatives struggle to attract financing as their benefits are often long-term, localised and not easily monetised, yet it is essential to protect communities and economic resilience. This can only succeed if we work with partners across government, business, and society to align resources and expertise to build resilience at scale.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sustainability is a core pillar of the upcoming Capital Market Masterplan 4 (CMP4), which will also explore how blended finance can mobilise capital for climate adaptation and resilience,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Conference featured discussions on enabling policies, science-based investment strategies and innovative models to improve the bankability of adaptation projects, among others. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Solutions showcased coastal flood protection, biodiversity conservation and urban heat resilience, offering insights on how global approaches can be tailored for Malaysia.</p>
<p>The Conference is part of the SC&rsquo;s broader Coastal Flooding Adaptation &amp; Resilience (COFAR) initiative, which seeks to strengthen the capital market&rsquo;s role in financing climate adaptation. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Under COFAR, the SC, together with ICAEW Malaysia, SD Guthrie and SEADPRI-UKM, recently organised the COFAR University Challenge, engaging 220 students from 29 universities to design practical, financially viable solutions for flood resilience in Carey Island.</p>
<p>The challenge reflects SC&rsquo;s commitment in fostering technical, financial and collaborative innovation to address one of the nation&rsquo;s most pressing climate challenges, flooding.</p>
<p>An interactive exhibition &lsquo;The Rising Waters&rsquo; was also featured at the conference, highlighting the escalating impacts of floods and the urgent need for financing solutions, including a look at Malaysia&rsquo;s flood history and future climate scenarios.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>LSEG in collaboration with the Islamic Corporation for the Development of the Private Sector (ICD), a member of the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) Group, today announced the findings of the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://lseg.group/IFDI2025" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">2025 Islamic Finance Development Indicator (IFDI) report</a>, a global benchmark assessing the development of the Islamic finance industry across 140 countries.</p>
<p>Malaysia maintained its top position in the global rankings, followed by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, reflecting their continued investment and policy leadership in developing Islamic finance ecosystems. Indonesia, Pakistan, Kuwait, Bahrain, Iran, Qatar, T&uuml;rkiye, and Bangladesh completed the top rankings, collectively representing the most advanced and diversified Islamic finance markets worldwide. Governance recorded the highest average score globally, driven by robust regulatory frameworks and enhanced disclosure standards.</p>
<p>Mustafa Adil, Head of Islamic Finance, LSEG, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looking ahead, the industry will be shaped by cross-border connectivity, regulatory advancements, and strategic national initiatives. Based on current trajectories, global Islamic finance assets are projected to reach US$9.7 trillion by 2029, growing at an average annual rate of 10%. This underscores Islamic finance&rsquo;s vital role in supporting sustainable economic growth and financial inclusion globally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Khalid Khalafalla, Acting Chief Executive Officer (ACEO) of ICD, added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The IFDI continues to serve as a vital benchmark for policymakers and market participants. It reflects the sustained efforts of governments and institutions to create an inclusive and resilient Islamic finance ecosystem, one that supports real economies and aligns with global development objectives. These goals are intrinsically linked to ICD's mission to foster private sector development and advance Islamic finance across its member countries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The report also highlights the industry&rsquo;s resilience and growing mainstream relevance. The global sukuk market surpassed US$1 trillion in outstanding value in 2024, despite persistent macroeconomic headwinds. Total global sukuk issuance reached US$254.3 billion, up 11% year-on-year. Meanwhile, ESG sukuk surpassed US$50 billion in outstanding value, with US$15.4 billion in new issuances, marking the increasing integration of sustainability into Islamic finance.</p>
<p>Islamic banking continues to dominate the sector, accounting for 72% of total industry assets, and expanding its presence to 84 markets globally, including growing momentum across sub-Saharan Africa, where 104 Islamic banks and windows now operate across 28 countries. The three largest markets, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Malaysia, collectively represent US$4.3 trillion, or 72% of global Islamic finance assets.</p>
<p>The Islamic Finance Development Indicator (IFDI) is a composite weighted index that assesses the development of Islamic finance across five key areas, Financial Performance, Governance, Sustainability, Awareness, and Knowledge. It provides a holistic view of the global Islamic finance landscape, measuring progress in alignment with Islamic principles and supporting stakeholders in identifying opportunities for growth and reform.</p>

<title>Protecting Financial Futures: ASIC's Priorities In Credit - Keynote Address By ASIC Commissioner Alan Kirkland At Credit Law 2025, 14 October 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul>
<li>ASIC&rsquo;s role is to ensure consumer credit protections are universally applied and enjoyed. That&rsquo;s why ongoing work to examine compliance across the sector continues to be a priority.</li>
<li>Key areas of focus include mortgage brokers, motor vehicle finance, financial hardship, debt management, credit repair and debt collection.</li>
<li>ASIC continues to take action across the spectrum, wherever we see credit-related misconduct. Entities whose conduct causes harm to consumers &ndash; or harm to their financial futures &ndash; should expect ASIC to take an active interest.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Good morning, everyone. It&rsquo;s a pleasure to be here.</p>
<p>I would like to acknowledge the traditional owners of the land on which we meet, the Yugambeh people. I pay my respects to their elders past and present &ndash; and extend that respect to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people here today.</p>
<p>I understand that this is the 35<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;annual Credit Law Conference. The fact that this event has been drawing a crowd for so many years speaks to the importance of credit.</p>
<p>Credit is central to our economy. It gives individuals and businesses the ability to exert control over their financial futures. But, where not done well, credit can cause real and lasting harm.</p>
<p>That is why &ndash; after more than three decades &ndash; the focus of this conference continues to be on the laws that protect people who use credit products.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where ASIC comes in.</p>
<p>We commonly describe ourselves as Australia&rsquo;s corporate, markets, financial services and consumer credit regulator &ndash; and the consumer credit plank of our role is a key priority for us. So today I&rsquo;d like to speak about ASIC&rsquo;s priorities in credit &ndash; and what we&rsquo;re doing to help protect financial futures.</p>
<h2>My first engagement with credit</h2>
<p>When dealing with credit issues at ASIC, I&rsquo;m often reminded of my first contact with the world of consumer credit in the early 1990s &ndash; when this conference was one of the newest events on the block.</p>
<p>As a university student, living in rented accommodation and surviving on casual wages from hospitality work, I needed a bit of extra money for an overseas study trip. A large bank had a branch on campus, and having heard of a friend&rsquo;s success in getting a credit card, I decided to give it a crack.</p>
<p>After a short application and cursory conversation, a week or two later I was the pleased holder of my very first credit card. Sure enough, I ran it up to my credit limit in the course of my travels. And sure enough, the bank soon obliged with the offer of a credit limit increase &ndash; as it did on a number of other occasions when I hit my limit.</p>
<p>Now I was lucky. I was nearing the end of my degree and on track to find full-time work, so I didn&rsquo;t end up in serious trouble. But that story could so easily have ended differently.</p>
<h2>The evolution of consumer credit law</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to think that kind of lending behaviour wouldn&rsquo;t happen today.</p>
<p>It shouldn&rsquo;t &ndash; because consumer credit protections have been significantly transformed since the early 1990s, most notably through the introduction of national laws overseen by ASIC.</p>
<p>These laws seek to acknowledge the economic benefits of credit by setting a framework within which it can be provided. But they also acknowledge the risks.</p>
<p>They require lenders to act responsibly, to consider a customer&rsquo;s circumstances, needs and objectives, and not put them at foreseeable risk of financial hardship.</p>
<p>They acknowledge that while we can&rsquo;t&nbsp;<strong>predict</strong>&nbsp;a person&rsquo;s financial future, we can help them to&nbsp;<strong>protect</strong>&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>If, for whatever reason, that future brings adverse circumstances that put a customer in financial hardship, lenders must respond quickly and appropriately to requests for assistance.</p>
<p>If a customer who needs help finding a pathway out of debt engages with the services of a debt management business, they are entitled to be treated fairly. They should not end up worse off because of it.</p>
<p>And while creditors have a right to recover payments owed to them, they must take care to ensure that they and any third parties they engage respect the rights of their customers. These are, after all, some of the most vulnerable people in the system.</p>
<h2>ASIC&rsquo;s priorities in credit</h2>
<p>While there have been incremental reforms to consumer credit law since the introduction of the National Credit Act, the core protections that it introduced are, today, relatively long-standing.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s role is to ensure they are universally applied &ndash; and universally enjoyed. But, based on our work, we have observed that isn&rsquo;t the case &ndash; and that&rsquo;s why ongoing work to examine compliance with consumer credit law continues to hold a key place in our priorities.</p>
<p>A little under two months ago, we announced our strategic priorities for 2025-26<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/protecting-financial-futures-asic-s-priorities-in-credit/#fn1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>. The first of these is to &lsquo;improve consumer outcomes&rsquo;.</p>
<p>That includes an explicit focus on credit and, in particular, lender responses to financial hardship. It also includes a focus on mortgage brokers, motor vehicle finance, debt management and credit repair, and debt collection.</p>
<p>We have work underway across all of these areas, which I&rsquo;ll speak about today. This includes several new credit-related surveillances.</p>
<h2>Mortgage brokers</h2>
<p>The first area of our credit priorities I&rsquo;d like to speak about involves conduct in relation to lending.</p>
<p>Home lending is the largest area of consumer credit in Australia, and as the role of mortgage brokers in this sector continues to grow, ASIC will be taking a closer interest in the conduct of brokers and aggregators.</p>
<p>Currently, around three quarters of new residential mortgages are facilitated by a broker<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/protecting-financial-futures-asic-s-priorities-in-credit/#fn2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>. While the sector attracts relatively few consumer complaints, we are conscious that misconduct by brokers will not always be obvious to their customers.</p>
<p>ASIC has been engaging for some months with several large mortgage aggregators in relation to brokers&rsquo; compliance with their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/regulatory-guides/rg-273-mortgage-brokers-best-interests-duty/" title="RG 273 Mortgage brokers: Best interests duty">best interests obligations</a>. So far, we have gathered data relating to brokers&rsquo; product recommendation behaviour, loan flows, remuneration and consumer complaints.</p>
<p>In the coming months we will be focusing further on brokers&rsquo; complaints handling, and audit and compliance practices.</p>
<p>We will review brokers&rsquo; compliance with their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/regulatory-guides/rg-271-internal-dispute-resolution/" title="RG 271 Internal dispute resolution">internal dispute resolution obligations</a>&nbsp;&ndash; and seek to understand how brokers identify and respond to complaints that flag potential concerns about compliance with the best interests duty.</p>
<p>We will also be looking at the audit and compliance practices of large aggregators. We want to understand how effectively they are supervising their mortgage broker representatives and ensuring they comply with their best interests duty.</p>
<p>If we identify serious issues, we will take appropriate action.</p>
<p>Since July 2019, ASIC action against finance and mortgage brokers has resulted in 11 criminal convictions. A further 22 individuals or companies were removed from credit services. Seven individuals or companies were removed from financial services. And one individual was disqualified from managing corporations. This highlights the broad range of tools available for us to use in response to any misconduct we may uncover in the course of our review.</p>
<h2>Motor vehicle finance</h2>
<p>While the value of loans in relation to motor vehicle finance is of course smaller than home lending, conduct in the provision of motor vehicle finance continues to be the subject of a significant number of complaints to ASIC.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, ASIC commenced a new surveillance of the motor vehicle finance sector<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/protecting-financial-futures-asic-s-priorities-in-credit/#fn3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>We are examining the practices of seven lenders and will also look at the conduct of brokers and intermediaries.</p>
<p>We are particularly interested in understanding the experiences of individuals living in regional and remote areas, including First Nations communities.</p>
<p>The review will consider overall compliance with the law, as well as consumer outcomes in relation to loan defaults, hardship and dispute resolution processes.</p>
<p>In the coming weeks, we will be publishing some initial insights from that work, with a more detailed report to come later.</p>
<p>While that surveillance is focused on the motor vehicle finance sector as a whole, we are also taking more targeted action in relation to&nbsp;<strong>used car</strong>&nbsp;finance, with a particular focus on misconduct involving vulnerable consumers.</p>
<p>We currently have proceedings against car dealership Diamond Wheels, Keo Automotive and a former director for allegedly providing car loans to consumers while unlicensed, with many of those consumers having paid an excessive interest rate<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/protecting-financial-futures-asic-s-priorities-in-credit/#fn4"><sup>[4]</sup></a><a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/protecting-financial-futures-asic-s-priorities-in-credit/#_edn4" name="_ednref4"><span>&nbsp;</span></a>.</p>
<p>In September, our proceedings against car finance company Money3 Loans concluded, with the court ruling largely in Money3&rsquo;s favour<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/protecting-financial-futures-asic-s-priorities-in-credit/#fn5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Some limited contraventions of the responsible lending provisions of the Credit Act were found in our favour. The Court found that Money3 failed to make reasonable inquiries about or verify each borrower&rsquo;s living expenses based on bank statement transaction data and, in one instance, failed to make reasonable inquiries about a borrower&rsquo;s requirements and objectives. However, the Court rejected the balance of ASIC&rsquo;s claims.</p>
<p>Despite the outcome, we believe it is important to take action to enforce the law where there are concerns a breach has occurred.</p>
<p>ASIC took this case following numerous complaints &ndash; including from consumer advocates &ndash; about the inappropriate provision of finance to vulnerable consumers. We are currently considering the judgment and our next steps.</p>
<h2>Financial hardship</h2>
<p>Another area that has been the subject of numerous complaints has been the financial hardship practices of lenders &ndash; and our focus on these practices will continue into 2025-26.</p>
<p>We know the causes of financial hardship are many and varied. As with many of life&rsquo;s misfortunes, they often arrive with little warning. But when they do, a helping hand can make a huge difference.</p>
<p>As a result, the way in which lenders respond to requests for hardship assistance can have lasting impacts, positive or negative, on a customer&rsquo;s financial future.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we will continue to pursue enforcement outcomes where we see risk of significant consumer harm.</p>
<p>In September, ASIC asked the Federal Court to approve a $40 million penalty against ANZ for hardship-related failures &ndash; as part of a record $240 million package of penalties for a range of misconduct, which ANZ has admitted to<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/protecting-financial-futures-asic-s-priorities-in-credit/#fn6"><sup>[6]</sup></a><a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/protecting-financial-futures-asic-s-priorities-in-credit/#_edn6" name="_ednref6"></a>.</p>
<p>In August, the Federal Court imposed a $15.5 million penalty on National Australia Bank and subsidiary for failing to respond to hardship applications within the required 21-day timeframe<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/protecting-financial-futures-asic-s-priorities-in-credit/#fn7"><sup>[7]</sup></a><sup>.</sup>&nbsp;We are awaiting the outcome of similar proceedings against Westpac<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/protecting-financial-futures-asic-s-priorities-in-credit/#fn8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>We have also filed our first case against a credit licensee in relation to its approach to assessing hardship applications.</p>
<p>We allege home loan manager, Resimac, imposed a &lsquo;one-size-fits-all&rsquo; approach to hardship applications, requiring customers to provide extensive standard information without considering whether it was relevant or necessary to that customer&rsquo;s individual circumstances<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/protecting-financial-futures-asic-s-priorities-in-credit/#fn9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth mentioning that the use of such &lsquo;cookie-cutter&rsquo; approaches was among a range of concerns we highlighted in our landmark 2024 financial&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-783-hardship-hard-to-get-help-lenders-fall-short-in-financial-hardship-support/" title="REP 783 Hardship, hard to get help: Lenders fall short in financial hardship support">hardship report</a>.</p>
<p>Since then, we have continued to monitor lenders&rsquo; hardship practices and, pleasingly, there are signs of improvement &ndash; but we have made it clear that we still have concerns about the overall quality of some lenders&rsquo; hardship responses<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/protecting-financial-futures-asic-s-priorities-in-credit/#fn10"><sup>[10]</sup></a>.</p>
<h2>Debt management, credit repair and debt collection</h2>
<p>As I acknowledged earlier in my speech, some people who find themselves in financial difficulty may engage the services of a debt management business to help them find a pathway out.</p>
<p>Yet we have heard numerous distressing accounts of people being let down by these firms &ndash; or, worse, having their problems compounded.</p>
<p>Consequently, we have stepped up our scrutiny of the practices of businesses involved in debt management and credit repair.</p>
<p>Since 2021, individuals and entities providing these services have been required to hold an Australian credit licence, unless a relevant exemption applies. The regime was introduced to protect consumers from predatory practices &ndash; and requires holders to abide by all the obligations that a licence imposes on them.</p>
<p>We are undertaking a surveillance which will look at how the sector &ndash; comprising around 100 licensees &ndash; is complying with those obligations<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/protecting-financial-futures-asic-s-priorities-in-credit/#fn11"><sup>[11]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>We will review instances where debt management firms may have failed consumers &ndash; including by not meeting the terms of their agreements, charging high fees for no or limited services, or not communicating adequately with them.</p>
<p>We will also seek to understand the varying debt management and credit repair business models in operation.</p>
<p>ASIC has also been actively engaging with consumer advocates to better understand current issues and potential consumer harms in relation to debt collection &ndash; and we intend to commence a surveillance in the coming months.</p>
<p>The laws governing debt collection conduct apply to creditors and collectors alike. Lenders should take care to ensure they and any third parties they engage in this process uphold the consumer protections these laws provide.</p>
<p>Our surveillance will include credit providers, as well as debt buyers and contingent collectors &ndash; and we have begun approaching entities we plan to include in our review.</p>
<p>Misconduct in debt management and collection is also an ASIC enforcement priority<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/protecting-financial-futures-asic-s-priorities-in-credit/#fn12"><sup>[12]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In June, ASIC refused the licence application of Bakken Holdings &ndash; against whom we have ongoing proceedings &ndash; meaning it can no longer provide debt management services<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/protecting-financial-futures-asic-s-priorities-in-credit/#fn13"><sup>[13]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>ASIC is suing Bakken Holdings &ndash; trading as Solve My Debt Now &ndash; following concerns of substantial consumer harm<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/protecting-financial-futures-asic-s-priorities-in-credit/#fn14"><sup>[14]</sup></a>. We are also suing Bakken&rsquo;s director and co-owner for their involvement in the alleged false or misleading representations made by the company.</p>
<p>Solve My Debt Now made promises to help customers by collecting funds from them, on-paying their creditors and negotiating with creditors to reduce debt.</p>
<p>In reality, we allege, the business failed, in many instances, to pass on customers&rsquo; payments to those creditors. We also allege that, in many cases, the fees it charged for its services exceeded the amount the debts were reduced &ndash; leaving clients worse off.</p>
<p>We have also taken action where we see misleading statements by debt management firms about the quality of debt management outcomes offered.</p>
<p>In April, we issued infringement notices on Chapter Two Holdings about misleading statements on its website that the company had &ldquo;wiped $80 million in debt&rdquo; and &ldquo;saved consumers $30 million in interest&rdquo;, that they were not able to substantiate<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/protecting-financial-futures-asic-s-priorities-in-credit/#fn15"><sup>[15]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In relation to debt collection, in June we commenced legal proceedings in the Federal Court against Venture 5 Group &ndash; trading as CashnGo Australia &ndash; for a range of contraventions, including alleged unconscionable debt recovery practices relating to small amount credit contracts<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/protecting-financial-futures-asic-s-priorities-in-credit/#fn16"><sup>[16]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Through its online loan application process, CashnGo either obtained consumers&rsquo; internet banking login details or required them to connect their bank account to a third-party provider.</p>
<p>This enabled them to monitor consumers&rsquo; bank balances on an hourly basis &ndash; and, in the event of default, to debit the consumer&rsquo;s bank account as soon as funds became available.</p>
<p>Between 20 April 2022 and 7 May 2025, we allege about 20% of its small amount credit contracts &ndash; held by over 34,000 customers &ndash; experienced an unscheduled debit after defaulting on a payment. This left some with less than $5 in their bank account. During this period, CashnGo earned $77 million in revenue.</p>
<h2>Business models designed to avoid consumer credit protections</h2>
<p>The final area of our priorities that I&rsquo;d like to touch on is business models designed to avoid consumer credit protections.</p>
<p>These business models take advantage of perceived legal loopholes &ndash; and, with it, vulnerable consumers. As a key enforcement priority, ASIC is closing those loopholes and closing in on the businesses who seek to exploit them.</p>
<p>In August, Rent4Keeps and its franchisee Darranda were fined $7.4 million for overcharging vulnerable consumers on essential household goods<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/protecting-financial-futures-asic-s-priorities-in-credit/#fn17"><sup>[17]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The Federal Court found the arrangements, which were styled as &lsquo;consumer leases&rsquo; so they would fall outside of the credit protections, were in fact credit contracts.</p>
<p>As a result of this misconduct, customers who could least afford it, were typically charged almost four times the retail cost of essential items.</p>
<p>To give you an example &ndash; and keep in mind that the majority of these people were in receipt of social security payments &ndash; a 10kg washing machine, retailing at $795 was sold for $4,316, to be paid for over two years.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, we have commenced proceedings against online consumer goods suppler, Snaffle, operated by Walker Stores<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/protecting-financial-futures-asic-s-priorities-in-credit/#fn18"><sup>[18]</sup></a>. Here again, we have seen examples of customers being charged exorbitant amounts for essentials such as fridges and phones.</p>
<p>We allege Snaffle inflated the cost of household goods and electronics &ndash; and applied unlawful interest charges through a pricing structure designed to circumvent the legal cap.</p>
<p>Of course, business models designed to avoid consumer credit protections come in many forms.</p>
<p>Another common tactic involves consumer loans styled as business loans, with the objective of this artifice of course being to assert that consumer credit protections will not apply. This is an artifice that ASIC will continue to correct, through all avenues available to us.</p>
<p>While this has been a practice of longstanding concern to ASIC, a current example is our case against Oak Capital<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/protecting-financial-futures-asic-s-priorities-in-credit/#fn19"><sup>[19]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>We allege Oak Capital engaged in unconscionable conduct to avoid the National Credit Code. That it employed a lending model requiring a company to be the named borrower for loans that the company did not benefit from or have any genuine interest in. That between 7 March 2019 and 4 October 2023, it made up to 47 loans totalling over $37 million under this model.</p>
<p>Despite the purported business loan arrangements, the individuals seeking the loans provided their own homes as security. Several of these individuals defaulted on their loans and Oak Capital repossessed their homes.</p>
<p>Losing one&rsquo;s home can have a profound effect on a person&rsquo;s financial wellbeing, so it&rsquo;s outcomes such as these that should be front of mind when we think about what it means to protect financial futures.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In closing, while it might be tempting to think that poor lending practices are isolated to particular forms of lending, ASIC&rsquo;s regulatory and enforcement record tells a different story.</p>
<p>We continue to take action across the spectrum, wherever we see credit-related misconduct. From major retailers to major banks. From some of the country&rsquo;s biggest brands to lesser-known operators.</p>
<p>In taking these actions, our concern is with<strong>&nbsp;outcomes</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; not the type of credit, or the type of business involved. If the result of an entity&rsquo;s conduct in any part of the credit system causes harm to consumers &ndash; or harm to their financial futures &ndash; you should expect ASIC to take an active interest.</p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to speak. I&rsquo;ll now be happy to take some questions.</p>

<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>In its July 2025 monetary policy review, MAS maintained the rate of appreciation of the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate (S$NEER) policy band, with no change to the width of the band or the level at which it was centred. After keeping close to the top of the policy band in August, the S$NEER has eased in recent weeks as appreciation pressures ebbed. On average, the level of the S$NEER since the July policy review has been similar to that in the preceding three months.</span></p>

<h2>GROWTH BACKDROP</h2>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>The global economy&nbsp;has remained broadly resilient since the last monetary policy review. The staggered implementation of tariffs by the US has sustained the front-loading of shipments globally which, alongside<span>&nbsp;</span>robust AI-related investments, has buoyed manufacturing production and trade in Singapore&rsquo;s major trading partners. In the quarters ahead, global growth should moderate as front-loading activity dissipates while labour markets soften and spending slows. However, the extent of the downturn should be contained. International production networks have demonstrated some flexibility in adapting to tariffs, while global financial conditions remain accommodative and supportive of investment, including in the IT sector.</span></p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Advance estimates from MTI today show that the Singapore economy expanded by 1.3% on a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis in Q3 2025, only slightly slower than the 1.5% recorded in the previous quarter. Growth surpassed expectations, underpinned by resilient activity in the manufacturing and domestic consumer-facing sectors. On a year-on-year basis, GDP growth came in at 2.9%, compared with 4.5% in Q2.</span></p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Singapore&rsquo;s GDP growth is expected to moderate from this above-trend pace in the upcoming quarters as activity normalises in the trade-related sectors. However, continuing global investments related to AI will provide some support to the domestic manufacturing sector, while growth in construction and financial services should be bolstered by infrastructure investment and accommodative financial conditions, respectively.</span></p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>The Singapore economy has expanded at an above-trend rate of 3.9% on a y-o-y basis in Q1&ndash;Q3 this year. MAS assesses that the output gap should stay positive for the year as a whole. In 2026, GDP growth is projected to slow in line with external developments to a near-trend pace, such that the output gap narrows to around 0%. The GDP growth forecasts for 2025 and 2026 will be announced in November by MTI.</span></p>
<p>6.&nbsp; &nbsp;<span>Uncertainty around the economic outlook has receded somewhat with the conclusion of some trade deals between the US and various countries. MAS is monitoring closely the actual implementation of the tariffs, and the risks of renewed trade conflict and disruption. At the same time, further increases to effective tariff rates, including from product-specific duties, could impact the performance of Singapore&rsquo;s externally-oriented sectors while still-elevated global policy uncertainty could also weigh more heavily on hiring and investments with a lag. An abrupt correction in the AI investment boom and the associated exuberance of financial markets is another downside risk to the growth outlook.</span></p>
<h4>INFLATION OUTLOOK</h4>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS Core Inflation<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/monetary-policy-statements/2025/mas-monetary-policy-statement-14oct25#1">[1]</a></span>&nbsp;<span>eased to 0.4% y-o-y in Jul&minus;Aug 2025, from 0.6% in Q2. Inflation slowed for most goods and services, reflecting fresh government subsidies for long-term care services as well as subdued imported and moderating domestic cost pressures. Imported costs for items such as crude oil, capital, intermediate, and some retail goods fell and passed through to consumer prices. Meanwhile, unit labour cost growth has slowed with the decline in wage growth and the step up in labour productivity.</span></p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>While core inflation could edge down further in the near term, some of the factors dampening inflation are expected to diminish in the quarters ahead. Imported costs should exert a smaller drag on inflation in 2026, given projections for a more gradual decline in global crude oil prices, as well as a modest pickup in regional inflation from the easing this year. On the domestic front, services unit labour costs growth is projected to rise in 2026 as productivity growth normalises. Private consumption is likely to remain steady amid healthy household balance sheets and a broadly resilient labour market. The net drags on inflation associated with administrative price changes and their base effects should also unwind more discernibly from Q4 this year.</span></p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>All in, MAS Core Inflation is forecast to trough in the near term and rise gradually thereafter. It should average around 0.5% for 2025 as a whole and come in between 0.5&minus;1.5% in 2026.</span></p>
<p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>CPI-All Items inflation, which fell to 0.6% in Jul&minus;Aug, should average 0.5&ndash;1.0% this year. It is forecast to come in at 0.5&ndash;1.5% in 2026, with the anticipated pickup in core inflation offset to an extent by non-core components. Accommodation inflation is projected to ease as the more modest growth in market rents passes through to the CPI. Increases in private transport inflation should also be tempered by the further increase in COE supply.</span></p>
<p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>The inflation outcome is subject to risks. Supply shocks, including those stemming from geopolitical developments, could lift some imported and shipping costs abruptly.&nbsp;Conversely, core inflation could stay lower for longer should growth be more hesitant and weaker than projected. Another significant decline in global oil prices could also temporarily tamp down the pace of price increases.</span></p>
<h4>MONETARY POLICY</h4>
<p>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>MAS has eased monetary policy twice this year. Singapore&rsquo;s economic growth has turned out stronger than expected and the output gap will remain positive in 2025 and come in around 0% next year. MAS Core Inflation should trough in the near term and rise gradually over the course of 2026 as temporary factors dampening inflation fade.</span></p>
<p>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>MAS will therefore maintain the prevailing rate of appreciation of the S$NEER policy band. There will be no change to its width and the level at which it is centred.</span></p>
<p>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>MAS is in an appropriate position to respond effectively to any risk to medium-term price stability and will continue to</span><span>&nbsp;closely monitor economic developments amid uncertainties in the external environment.</span></p>

<title>ASIC Sends Clear Message To Super Trustees Amid Glaring Retirement Communications Gaps</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC is concerned that many Australians may not have the information they need to make confident and informed decisions about retirement after a review identified a lack of urgency in improving retirement communications among superannuation trustees collectively responsible for millions of members.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s review, Report 818&nbsp;<em>From superficial to super engaged: Better practices for trustee retirement communications&nbsp;</em>(<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-818-from-superficial-to-super-engaged-better-practices-for-trustee-retirement-communications/" title="REP 818 From superficial to super engaged: Better practices for trustee retirement communications">REP 818</a>)<em>,</em>&nbsp;found some trustees offer one-size fits all retirement communications aimed primarily at pre-retirees, missing opportunities to engage with members throughout retirement and provide more meaningful support.</p>
<p>ASIC Commissioner Simone Constant said, &lsquo;Over 1.5 million members are in the retirement phase now, collectively holding approximately $575 billion in superannuation assets, and more than 2.5 million Australians will enter retirement over the coming decade.</p>
<p>&lsquo;However, ASIC&rsquo;s Moneysmart research suggests only one-third of Australians on the cusp of retirement are confident that they will be financially comfortable once they leave the workforce. It is important now more than ever for superannuation trustees to focus their attention on providing meaningful, and timely retirement communications to their members that can meet their needs.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Moreover, members entering retirement typically hold larger balances, require more tailored solutions and expect high-touch support. Trustees that can meet these needs stand to unlock powerful commercial outcomes: stronger member retention, deeper engagement, and scalable growth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s review also found little evidence of trustees tailoring their messaging and delivery methods to meet the diverse needs and preferences of their member base, including those already in the retirement phase.</p>
<p>Commissioner Constant said despite the retirement income covenant (covenant) obligations commencing over three years ago on 1 July 2022, some trustees are yet to address gaps identified by ASIC and APRA (<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-143mr-super-trustees-urged-to-strengthen-oversight-of-retirement-strategy-implementation/" title="24-143MR Super trustees urged to strengthen oversight of retirement strategy implementation">24-143MR</a>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&lsquo;The clear message we are sending to super trustees is a one size fits all communications approach won't work for all member groups as it may not provide the quality of information customers need to make confident and informed decisions about retirement,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Trustees have developed significantly fewer communications targeted at retired members. Most of these targeted communications were more relevant to members in the lead up to, or in early stages of retirement, which given the size of the retirement wave already breaking, is a real missed opportunity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was disappointing to see the retirement communications practices of participating trustees largely overlooked the specific needs of First Nations members, vulnerable members and culturally and linguistically diverse members. None of the trustees we reviewed developed specific retirement communications for vulnerable members.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Commissioner Constant said effective data and research capabilities were critical in producing meaningful insights for driving strong member engagement, and removing barriers for vulnerable groups.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Some trustees demonstrated how individual retirement communications were tailored to some of these groups and others demonstrated innovative approaches to member engagement, like offering webinars, in-person seminars, TV programs, and radio and social media content,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;However, we saw little evidence of wider processes in place to identify vulnerable groups and adequately support them with tailored retirement communications.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Commissioner Constant said it was concerning that one third of trustees did not have a formal process that considered member feedback.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Super trustees cannot understand member needs if they do not have processes in place for identifying specific challenges faced by diverse groups, particularly the most vulnerable among us,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ultimately, our review found that trustees with robust governance, strong data and research capabilities and effective benchmarking are delivering better communications, and in turn supporting better retirement outcomes for their customers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>ASIC is urging trustees to carefully consider the calls to action and better practice case studies outlined in this report to identify and address blind spots in their retirement communications.</p>
<p>Calls to action for trustees include:</p>
<ul>
<li>focus on informing members about retirement, rather than prioritising product promotion and member retention</li>
<li>develop retirement communications that are better tailored to member needs, using meaningful member groups and nudges</li>
<li>better tailor retirement communications to the diverse needs and preferences of member groups approaching, and in retirement</li>
<li>ensure retirement communications are accessible to culturally and linguistically diverse members and members with a disability</li>
<li>adequately resource governance structures to execute the retirement income strategy and communications strategy, with appropriate oversight by executive and management-level staff, and</li>
<li>strengthen oversight of external service providers that develop and deliver retirement communications to ensure the communications meet quality, compliance and strategic expectations.</li>
</ul>
<p>ASIC is committed to working alongside APRA to hold superannuation trustees to account for compliance with their covenant obligations, including by publishing results from the latest joint Retirement &lsquo;Pulse Check&rsquo; later this year.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s Moneysmart has conducted extensive consumer research with the pre-retiree segment that found there was a need to demystify complex financial concepts, and provide practical, actionable guidance. That was particularly the case for First Nations, vulnerable and culturally and linguistically diverse communities.</p>
<p>Based on consumer feedback, Moneysmart has updated its content pages to assist First Nations communities with actionable guidance on retirement and insurance, and will continue to build out new content to meet consumer needs.</p>

</ul>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>This review represents the next phase of ASIC&rsquo;s oversight of Australia&rsquo;s retirement system, following the implementation of the retirement income covenant on 1 July 2022.</p>
<p>ASIC examined how various Registrable Superannuation Entity licensees (trustees) have been progressing with implementation of the retirement income covenant, with a focus on how the trustees are communicating to their members about retirement in the lead up to, and through retirement.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s report provides detailed observations of good and poor practices from 12 participants since the covenant came into effect to 11 December 2024.</p>
<p>The trustees reviewed are collectively responsible for more than 9.3 million superannuation member accounts and $1.14 trillion in member assets. Collectively, they represent 45% per cent of APRA-regulated funds by member assets (see:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.apra.gov.au/quarterly-fund-level-statistics">Quarterly Fund-Level Statistics | APRA</a>).</p>

<p>Validus will integrate into Openmarkets' existing trade surveillance infrastructure and monitor all trade activity and orders brokered by the firm, which clears more than AUD $2 billion in annualized equities trades per month across more than 99,000 accounts.</p>
<p>Openmarkets CEO Dan Jowett said Eventus' solution would support the company for the long term and play an integral role in its growth plans.</p>
<p>He said: "Our trade surveillance processes will greatly benefit from Validus, a platform globally recognized as best-in-class. This important partnership isn't just about streamlining our already strong trade surveillance processes but having a scalable solution that will enable our compliance function to grow with our expanding needs. Openmarkets has an exciting path ahead as we focus on expanding our suite of wealth and trading capabilities and pursue growth opportunities in Australia, Asia and the U.S. Partners like Eventus play an important role in supporting our ambitions."</p>
<p>Openmarkets considered multiple trade surveillance providers before moving to Eventus for a variety of reasons, including its comprehensive, cost-efficient Validus platform that executives said "is ahead of the curve in the surveillance world in the automation space." Eventus' ability to offer local support in Australia was another factor in the decision, along with the control Openmarkets would have to customize the platform and make sure the alerts generated are on target so compliance staff are able to spend their time wisely.</p>
<p>Openmarkets Head of Compliance Chong Yu said: "The Eventus team has been supportive and timely in terms of integration and implementation and is working with us to make our processes streamlined and more efficient. One of the main features of Validus we really like, in addition to bringing in automation, is the ability to group clients by accounts and subject individual buckets to different parameters and alerts we want to apply to them. Given the variation in trading behavior across our client base, this was very important to us."</p>
<p>He added that Validus has a much larger suite of alerts and typologies (recognized patterns of suspicious behavior) than many competing offerings.</p>
<p>Naveen Wahi, Eventus Senior Director of Sales, APAC, said: "Openmarkets management is clearly committed to growing the group while ensuring its compliance program is meeting the highest industry standards. We're delighted to establish a long-term partnership as the firm's trade surveillance solution provider of record. Australia has been an important and growing market for us, and we continue to devote resources to meet the demand we're seeing here."</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Dubai, United Arab Emirates,&ndash; Dubai International Financial Centre (&ldquo;DIFC&rdquo;), the leading global financial centre in the Middle East, Africa and South Asia, and Partners for Growth (&ldquo;PFG&rdquo;), a global specialty credit manager providing tailored, asset-backed lending solutions to high-growth technology companies, have announced a strategic partnership to support and scale the next generation of high-growth companies across Dubai and the GCC.</span><br /><br /><span>This landmark collaboration brings together DIFC&rsquo;s vision to drive the future of finance with PFG&rsquo;s global reputation and local track record as a leading private credit investor in the region. With over two decades of global experience and more than USD 2.1bn deployed across more than 250 companies worldwide, PFG is recognised for its expertise in providing flexible, founder-aligned capital to innovation-driven businesses at pivotal moments of growth.</span><br /><br /><span>The partnership reflects DIFC&rsquo;s contribution to the D33 Economic Agenda which includes further enhancing Dubai&rsquo;s position as a global hub for innovation and entrepreneurship. It also builds on PFG&rsquo;s five-year track record in the GCC, where it has already committed to scaling some of the region&rsquo;s most prominent technology companies, including Tabby, TruKKer, Bayzat, Syarah, Huspy, and Silkhaus.</span><br /><br /><span>Under the new mandate, the partnership will provide structured growth debt to companies aligned with DIFC&rsquo;s Strategy 2030 and the D33 agenda in sectors such as FinTech, HealthTech, InsurTech, PropTech, SME Digital Finance, and SpaceTech. While the focus will be on high-growth companies headquartered in Dubai and the GCC, a portion of capital may be deployed globally, backing international businesses that bring strategic value to the regional ecosystem through their technology, talent, or sector leadership.</span><br /><br /><span>His Excellency Arif Amiri, Chief Executive Officer of DIFC Authority said:&nbsp;</span><span>&ldquo;Our mandate is to build the world&rsquo;s most advanced financial centre in Dubai, stimulate the local venture ecosystem, and support the next generation of high-growth technology and innovation companies. This partnership with PFG and our shared belief that growth debt plays a vital role in scaling high-potential companies in the region and beyond. Together, we are expanding the range of funding tools available to founders and investors and accelerating the ambitions of the D33 Agenda.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span>Andrew Kahn, CEO and Co-Founder of PFG, commented:&nbsp;</span><span>&ldquo;We pioneered growth debt in Silicon Valley as part of our global mission to help founders grow without giving up control. Over the past five years in the GCC, we&rsquo;ve seen first-hand the extraordinary ambition and execution of regional entrepreneurs. Partnering with DIFC is a significant milestone that enables us to double down on this momentum and back the companies shaping the future. This collaboration gives us a powerful platform to continue delivering flexible, minimally dilutive capital to businesses ready to scale globally from Dubai.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span>PFG brings full investment decision-making capabilities to the partnership, ensuring agility and strategic alignment with the needs of ambitious founders and operators in the region. As one of the few private credit providers with scale and experience in the GCC, PFG will continue to lead on origination, underwriting, and portfolio management, ensuring that this capital is deployed efficiently and with impact.</span><br /><br /><span>Armineh Baghoomian, Managing Director and Head of EMEA at PFG, added:&nbsp;</span><span>&ldquo;We are proud to be working with the Dubai International Finance Centre. They have been instrumental in shaping the region&rsquo;s innovation economy and their support is a strong vote of confidence in the role growth debt is already playing across the GCC. This partnership is a natural next step in a journey we have been on for several years. With DIFC behind us, we can scale our impact and back even more founders with the flexible capital they need to grow their businesses and reach new markets.&rdquo;</span></p>

<title>The EBA Updates List Of Third-Country Groups And Branches Operating In The European Union And The European Economic Area</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-eba-updates-list-of-third-country-groups-and-branches-operating-in-the-europ-20251013/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-eba-updates-list-of-third-country-groups-and-branches-operating-in-the-europ-20251013/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today released an updated list of third-country groups and third-country branches operating across the European Union and the European Economic Area (EU/EEA). This annual publication enhances market transparency by providing stakeholders with clear information on the ownership structures of institutions operating within the EU/EEA under foreign control.</span></p>
<p>The 2025 update identifies 445 third-country groups from 50 countries outside the EU/EEA that are currently active in the area. Among these, 10 groups have established intermediate EU parent undertakings (IPUs), as required by EU regulations. Additionally, 59 third-country groups have branches in the EU/EEA, resulting in a total of 88 third-country branches spread across EU/EEA.</p>
<p>This Report is part of the EBA's efforts to ensure that market participants have clarity regarding the direct ownership and presence of foreign institutions within the EU/EEA, contributing to a stable and transparent banking environment.</p>
<h5>Legal basis and background</h5>
<ul>
<li>According to Article 21b of Directive 2013/36/EU (Capital Requirements Directive - CRD), third-country groups operating through ​more than one institution in the Union and with total assets of EUR 40 billion or more are required to have an intermediate EU parent undertaking (IPU).</li>

<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU financial markets regulator and supervisor, has published its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2025-10/ESMA74-2119945926-3430_Final_Report_-_CSDR_RTS_on_Settlement_Discipline_and_tools_to_improve_settlement_efficiency.pdf">final report</a>&nbsp;recommending significant amendments to the Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) on Settlement Discipline.</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>These changes aim to enhance settlement efficiency across the EU, facilitate the transition to a shorter settlement cycle (T+1) by 11 October 2027 and reduce the administrative burden on central securities depositories (CSDs) and market participants.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The proposed changes are designed to improve operational readiness of the EU financial industry and include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Same-day (trade date) timing for trade allocations and settlement instructions.</span></li>
<li><span>Machine-readable formats for allocations and confirmations.</span></li>
<li><span>Mandatory implementation of key functionalities such as hold and release, auto-partial settlement, and auto-collateralisation.</span></li>
<li><span>Updated provisions for the monitoring and reporting of settlement fails.</span></li>
<li>A phased-in implementation schedule, beginning in December 2026 and concluding by 11 October 2027, intended to ensure a smooth transition to the new regime.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>ESMA strongly encourages market infrastructures, financial intermediaries and their clients to treat these regulatory changes as a central element of their T+1 transition strategy.</span></p>

<title>MQube Becomes First Fintech In Europe To Tokenise Mortgage Debt On The Blockchain</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/mqube-becomes-first-fintech-in-europe-to-tokenise-mortgage-debt-on-the-blockchai-20251013/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/mqube-becomes-first-fintech-in-europe-to-tokenise-mortgage-debt-on-the-blockchai-20251013/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li><span>M<span>ove set to transform the financial services industry, radically reshaping the mortgage ecosystem</span></span></li>
<li>Paves the way for a new, more accessible mortgage securitisation market</li>
</ul>
<p>MQube, the Guilford-based mortgage fintech, has today announced that is has tokenised &pound;1.3bn of mortgage debt on the blockchain. The tokenisation of mortgage assets via an EVM* compatible chain, sees MPowered, the One Day Mortgage&trade; lender, and lending arm of MQube become the first in Europe to have its mortgage debt tokenized on-chain.</p>
<p>The tokenisation of assets* involves converting tangible or intangible assets such as real estate or art into digital tokens which are then recorded on a secure decentralised and immutable blockchain ledger or digital registry. While stock, bonds and real estate have previously been tokenised, this is the first time mortgage debt has been brought onto the blockchain in Europe, marking a significant shift for the mortgage industry and broader financial services industry.</p>
<p>MQube says if more lenders begin to tokenise their assets on the blockchain, which is only a matter of time, it could open up a whole new world for banks and building societies.</p>
<p><b>Stuart Cheetham, CEO of MQube, explains:&nbsp;</b>&ldquo;The benefits of tokenising mortgage debt right now, is that it allows mortgage lenders to achieve data integrity, transaction security and audit traceability but once the necessary regulatory and operational framework is in place, and there is still a huge amount of work to be done here, the opportunity for the mortgage lending industry is huge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The plethora of benefits include the ability to transfer assets from one lender to another cutting out legal process in a remortgage case and saving thousands of pounds per remortgage transaction. Most importantly, however, the tokenisation of mortgage debt, paves the way for a brand-new mortgage securitisation market via the blockchain which involves the pooling of mortgage debt into a tradable and investable mortgage security.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The securitisation of mortgage debt frees up money for banks and non-bank lenders that was otherwise tied down. The benefit for banks and building societies is increased liquidity, reduced capital requirements, enhanced risk management and the ability to write more loans and grow their business. For consumers it is reduced cost of borrowing and more product choice.</p>
<p><b>Cheetham, concludes:</b>&nbsp;&ldquo;This is a remarkable development for our industry and we are proud to be at the forefront of this monumental shift. As a fintech business, we set out to reinvent the mortgage industry and now not only are we now delivering one day mortgages but we are seriously addressing how we can use the cutting edge of blockchain technology to transform the entire banking ecosystem.&rdquo;</p>
<h4><i>Background:</i></h4>
<p>*EVM or Ethereum Virtual Machine which is a decentralised computational engine that executes contracts and maintains the state of the Ethereum blockchain. It acts as a virtual computer allowing developers to run smart contracts and decentralized applications.</p>
<p>**Tokenisation of assets involves the conversion of tangible or intangible assets such as real estate or art into digital tokens which are then recorded on a secure decentralised and immutable blockchain ledger or digital registry. The benefits of tokenisation for financial services firms include increased liquidity and fractional ownership as the debt can be sold via the blockchain to a range of investors. As well as this, it boasts transparency of data, security of data and data accuracy. Lastly tokenised assets can be traded globally on the blockchain opening up markets to the wider audience.</p>

<title>Decision By The Disciplinary Committee Of Nasdaq Stockholm Regarding Hedera Group AB (publ)</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/decision-by-the-disciplinary-committee-of-nasdaq-stockholm-regarding-hedera-grou-20251013/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/decision-by-the-disciplinary-committee-of-nasdaq-stockholm-regarding-hedera-grou-20251013/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Disciplinary Committee of Nasdaq Stockholm (the &ldquo;Exchange&rdquo;) has found that Hedera Group AB (publ) (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) has breached the rules of Nasdaq First North Growth Market (the &ldquo;Rulebook&rdquo;) and therefore ordered the Company to pay a fine of three annual fees, corresponding to an amount of SEK 375,000.</p>
<p>On 14 November 2024, the Company published a press release stating that it had received two separate decisions from the Swedish Social Insurance Agency (F&ouml;rs&auml;kringskassan) regarding repayment claims for assistance compensation, amounting to a total of SEK 26.8 million. The press release included a reference indicating that the information was of the type the Company was obliged to disclose under the EU Market Abuse Regulation (&ldquo;MAR&rdquo;).</p>
<p>The repayment claims were received by the Company on 27 August and 31 October 2024, respectively, with amounts of SEK 8.5 million and SEK 18.4 million. Upon receiving the second repayment claim, the Company assessed that, combined with the earlier claim, the information constituted inside information. On the same day, the Company established an insider list and decided to delay the disclosure of the inside information.</p>
<p>The issue considered by the Disciplinary Committee was whether the conditions for delayed disclosure under Article 17.4(a) of MAR were met&mdash;specifically, whether immediate disclosure of the inside information would likely have prejudiced the Company&rsquo;s legitimate interests.</p>
<p>In the Committee&rsquo;s opinion, uncertainty regarding the information in this case did not justify the Company waiting a full two weeks before disclosing it, without releasing any information about the repayment claims during that time. Based on this, the Committee concluded that the Company&rsquo;s decision to delay disclosure of the inside information was not in compliance with Article 17.4 of MAR, and the information was therefore not disclosed in a timely manner.</p>
<p>The Disciplinary Committee considered the breach to be serious and therefore imposed a sanction. The fine was set at three annual fees.</p>
<p>The Disciplinary Committee&rsquo;s decision is available at:</p>

<title>DTCC Comment On T+1 Implementation</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/dtcc-comment-on-t1-implementation-20251013/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/dtcc-comment-on-t1-implementation-20251013/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The United Kingdom, European Union, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein now have a two-year window to prepare for the transition to a T+1 settlement cycle, a significant shift for the region's financial markets.</p>
<p>Val Wotton, Managing Director and Global Head of Equities Solutions at DTCC, commented on the timeline:</p>
<p class="xelementtoproof"><i>&ldquo;As of October 11,&nbsp;</i><i>market participants in the United Kingdom, European Union, Switzerland and Liechtenstein have exactly two years to prepare for T+1 implementation. While North America&rsquo;s successful move to T+1 provided great insights, European market structure is more complex and presents unique challenges. Research, industry consultations, and our own experience spearheading the US transition have confirmed that automation of post-trade processes across the trade lifecycle are critical to firms&rsquo;&nbsp;preparedness for shorter settlement cycles.&nbsp;</i><i style="font-family: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">&nbsp;</i></p>
<p><i>&ldquo;The move to T+1 provides firms across Europe with an opportunity to enhance automation and collaboration, acting as a catalyst for greater&nbsp;efficiency, reduced risk, and improved liquidity as well as a more harmonized post-trade environment that aligns the region with global peers. With enhanced automation, standardisation and increased market efficiencies, the migration to T+1 will bolster the EU &lsquo;s Savings and Investments Union (SIU) , the UK&rsquo;s Competitiveness and Growth agenda as well as national and regional growth initiatives.</i></p>
<p class="xelementtoproof"><i>With clear timelines, aligned frameworks, and strong collaboration, a smooth and successful transition is highly possible. But with just two years to go, firms must act decisively to modernize their operations, embrace automation, and coordinate across jurisdictions. DTCC remains committed to supporting market participants and fostering collaboration across global markets during this transition and beyond.&rdquo;&nbsp;</i></p>

<title>Incomplete Reform Implementation Leaves Financial System Vulnerable To Shocks, Warns FSB Chair</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/incomplete-reform-implementation-leaves-financial-system-vulnerable-to-shocks-w-20251013/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><span>In his letter to G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors, FSB Chair Andrew Bailey stresses the importance of multilateral cooperation and reform implementation in the current environment of elevated risks and uncertainty.</span></li>
<li><span>Mr Bailey notes that the rapid evolution of the financial sector calls for enhanced surveillance of emerging risks.</span></li>
<li><span>An interim report from the FSB&rsquo;s strategic review of implementation monitoring shows that full, timely and consistent implementation of G20 reforms has not been completely achieved, leaving the financial system vulnerable to shocks.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) today published a&nbsp;<a class="custom-internal-link" href="https://www.fsb.org/2025/10/fsb-chairs-letter-to-g20-finance-ministers-and-central-bank-governors-october-2025/">letter from its Chair, Andrew Bailey, to G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors</a>&nbsp;ahead of their meeting on 15‑16&nbsp;October. The letter is accompanied by an interim report from the G20 strategic review of the FSB implementation monitoring work, led by former FSB Chair Randal K. Quarles.</p>
<p>In the current environment of elevated risks and uncertainty, Mr Bailey&rsquo;s letter highlights the importance of global standards and cooperation, not just to prevent crises, but also as a foundation to support sustainable growth.</p>
<p>However, the preliminary results from the G20 strategic review of the FSB implementation monitoring work show that full, timely and consistent implementation of G20/FSB reforms has not been completely achieved, despite the active programme of implementation monitoring by the FSB and standard-setting bodies. Significant inconsistencies in the implementation of global financial reforms can pose risks to market efficiency, financial stability and the integrity of the global regulatory framework.</p>
<p>Mr&nbsp;Bailey reaffirms the FSB remains steadfast in its mandate to promote timely and consistent implementation. The next phase of the G20 strategic implementation monitoring review will reflect on why implementation gaps exist and make specific recommendations to strengthen the FSB&rsquo;s monitoring and implementation processes.</p>
<p>The rapid evolution of the financial sector, coupled with the uncertain economic and political outlook, calls for enhanced surveillance. The adoption of artificial intelligence in the financial sector or the increasing use of stablecoins for payment and settlement purposes, for example, put a premium on the monitoring of emerging risks. To address this, the FSB will enhance its surveillance capabilities by improving its agility to recognise and respond to emerging vulnerabilities and strengthening engagement with stakeholders, including the private sector. The FSB will also improve the communication of its assessments, to enable public and private sector stakeholders to better mitigate risks.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><span>October G20 deliverables</span></h4>
<p>The FSB is delivering four reports to the G20:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em><a class="custom-internal-link" href="https://www.fsb.org/2025/10/g20-roadmap-for-cross-border-payments-consolidated-progress-report-for-2025/">G20 Roadmap for Cross-border Payments: Consolidated progress report for 2025</a></em></li>
<li><em><a class="custom-internal-link" href="https://www.fsb.org/2025/10/monitoring-adoption-of-artificial-intelligence-and-related-vulnerabilities-in-the-financial-sector/">Monitoring Adoption of Artificial Intelligence and Related Vulnerabilities in the Financial Sector&nbsp;</a></em></li>
<li><em><a class="custom-internal-link" href="https://www.fsb.org/2025/10/g20-implementation-monitoring-review-interim-report/">G20 Implementation Monitoring Review Interim Report</a></em>, delivered today with the Chair&rsquo;s letter</li>
<li>A thematic review, monitoring progress implementing the FSB Global Regulatory Framework for Crypto-asset Activities (to published on 16 October).</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Notes to editors</h2>
<p>In 2025, at the request of the South African G20 Presidency, the FSB embarked on a strategic review of its work to encourage and monitor the implementation by member jurisdictions of the agreed G20/FSB financial reforms, with a view to identify any opportunities for improvement. The high level team conducting the review is led by an independent external Chair, Randal K. Quarles (former FSB Chair and former Vice Chair for Supervision of the US Federal Reserve Board). It comprises the following FSB Plenary members: Ayman Al-Sayari, Governor of the Saudi Central Bank; Mark Branson, President of Bundesanstalt f&uuml;r Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht; Pablo Hern&aacute;ndez de Cos, General Manager of the Bank for International Settlements; and Ryozo Himino, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan, in his capacity as Chair of the Standing Committee for Standards Implementation.</p>
<p>The FSB coordinates at the international level the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies and develops and promotes the implementation of effective regulatory, supervisory, and other financial sector policies in the interest of financial stability. It brings together national authorities responsible for financial stability in 24 countries and jurisdictions, international financial institutions, sector-specific international groupings of regulators and supervisors, and committees of central bank experts. The FSB also conducts outreach with approximately 70 other jurisdictions through its six Regional Consultative Groups.</p>
<p>The FSB is chaired by Andrew Bailey, Governor of the Bank of England. The FSB Secretariat is located in Basel, Switzerland and hosted by the Bank for International Settlements.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Europe&rsquo;s leading crypto infrastructure provider,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span><a href="https://www.bsdigital.com/en/">Boerse Stuttgart Digital</a>, partners with DekaBank to develop a crypto offering for retail customers of the German savings banks (Sparkassen). As part of this collaboration, Boerse Stuttgart Digital ensures reliable liquidity in the form of crypto assets for DekaBank through its institutional brokerage solution. DekaBank is leveraging its already established crypto infrastructure, originally built for institutional business, and expanding it for the retail segment. The Deka offering will cover the entire value chain, from trading and custody to the front end, and is scheduled to launch next year.</p>
<p>Boerse Stuttgart Digital plays an integral role in enabling DekaBank to offer a highly liquid range of crypto assets. &ldquo;We are proud to support DekaBank in bringing a crypto offering to the German saving banks in the retail segment. Boerse Stuttgart Digital is Europe&rsquo;s leading provider of crypto infrastructure and stands for values that are also essential to DekaBank: trust, integrity, and professionalism. Leading financial institutions across Germany and Europe rely on us to provide their customers with simple and secure access to cryptocurrencies,&rdquo; says Dr. Matthias Voelkel, CEO of Boerse Stuttgart Group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With our in-house infrastructure, we secure the largest possible share of the value chain within Sparkassen Finance Group (Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe) and make it as easy as possible for savings banks to integrate the offering. We are already working successfully with Boerse Stuttgart Digital on crypto services for institutional clients and now plan to use their services to build an offering for the retail segment as well,&rdquo; says Marion Spielmann, COO Banking &amp; Custody Services at DekaBank.</p>
<p>Boerse Stuttgart Digital has been DekaBank&rsquo;s infrastructure partner for cryptocurrency trading with institutional clients since 2024. Now the partnership is being extended to include DekaBank&rsquo;s non-advisory crypto offering developed on behalf of the savings banks for self-directed investors.</p>

<title>LME Drives Forward Sustainable Metal Premium Pricing Plans</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/lme-drives-forward-sustainable-metal-premium-pricing-plans-20251013/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/lme-drives-forward-sustainable-metal-premium-pricing-plans-20251013/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="large-text">The London Metal Exchange (LME) has today announced the next steps in its plans to develop sustainable metal premium pricing for LME-approved brands.</p>
<p>These include the launch of a new HKEX Group company in Dubai that will serve as the pricing administrator, and the publication of a discussion paper on its proposed pricing methodology.</p>
<p>Matthew Chamberlain, LME Chief Executive Officer, said: &ldquo;Our goal is to publish premium prices for sustainable metals, underpinned by robust definitions and real trading activity &ndash; which will enable our industry to unlock the potential value of sustainable metal production. We recognise that there may not be a premium for every metal, but there is a clear market desire to determine whether one exists and the LME is keen to play a part in answering this question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The LME announced its plans to explore the potential for producing sustainable metal premium pricing in April 2025. The roadmap published today sets out more detail on the LME&rsquo;s approach to sustainable metal premium price discovery &ndash; built on the foundational pillars of standardisation and transparency &ndash; as well as the important role of the pricing administrator and the link between sustainable metal and critical minerals supply security.</p>
<p>The LME&rsquo;s solution is based on the following key components:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>LME brand list</span>&nbsp;&ndash; all LME branded metals must meet the LME&rsquo;s existing market-leading quality and responsible sourcing standards, ensuring that core globally agreed sustainability standards are incorporated into all areas of the LME&rsquo;s activities. These will remain unchanged and the LME will work towards discovering premium prices for copper, aluminium, nickel and zinc that are both LME-branded and possess enhanced sustainability credentials, going beyond the core globally agreed sustainability standards, but which are of increasing importance for many metal consumers.</li>
<li><span>LMEpassport transparency</span>&nbsp;&ndash; LME brands already disclose sustainability data on LMEpassport, the LME&rsquo;s free-to-access digital credentials register &ndash; which currently holds over 1,300 disclosures from LME-listed brands. Premium sustainability thresholds &ndash; following significant market engagement, the LME has now set out its premium sustainability thresholds for each metal, incorporating both maximum carbon footprints and third-party sustainability assurances, based on internationally recognised methodologies. These thresholds will be maintained by the LME and kept under review.</li>
<li><span>Trading platform</span>&nbsp;&ndash; metal of LME brands whose LMEpassport disclosures meet the premium sustainability thresholds will be eligible for trading on the sustainable metals segment of the Metalshub digital platform. Metalshub is a strategic partner of the LME whose platform already enables consumers to buy LME-grade low-carbon nickel. Since March last year, 1,942 tonnes of low-carbon nickel have been offered through the platform with 488 tonnes traded.</li>
<li><span>Pricing administrator</span>&nbsp;&ndash; in order to produce pricing for metal that meets the premium sustainability thresholds, the newly incorporated HKEX Group company &ndash; Commodity Pricing and Analysis Limited (CPAL), located in Dubai &ndash; will act as an independent price administrator. In the coming months, CPAL will build out its operations with the aim of publishing premia, based on transparent transactions executed on Metalshub (and augmented where necessary with market intelligence based on physical trading of metal which meets the thresholds).</li>
</ul>
<p>The discussion paper, also published today, seeks views on the proposed methodologies the pricing administrator will use to determine premia for LME-branded metal meeting the premium sustainability threshold that trades on Metalshub. The proposed primary basis for determining the pricing for each metal will be arm&rsquo;s length transactions conducted on Metalshub. If there are insufficient trades, then bids, offers and/or assessments made by the pricing administrator would be used. All relevant data would be reviewed to ensure consistency and integrity and then normalised to take account of commercial factors such as delivery location and contractual terms.</p>
<p>The feedback from the discussion paper will be used to finalise the methodology which CPAL will be responsible for applying and updating in future.</p>
<p>Commenting on the launch of CPAL, Georgina Hallett, Chief Sustainability Officer and Head of Physical Markets, said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thrilled that we have made such quick progress that we are now able to announce the incorporation of CPAL in Dubai, a location that provides us with both the agility to respond quickly to market developments and the access to a rapidly developing international metals centre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>CPAL was granted a licence by the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) in September 2025.</p>

<title>LME’s 2026 Market Overhaul To Test Brokers’ Technology Readiness - Sinara Warns Firms Must Modernise Trading Workflows Or Risk Falling Behind</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/lmes-2026-market-overhaul-to-test-brokers-technology-readiness-sinara-warns-20251013/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="Standard">Landmark reforms next year on the London Metal Exchange to speed up and deepen trading will challenge brokers that collect client orders over the phone to further automate their transactions or risk falling behind, leading technology provider Sinara Consultants has said.</p>
<p class="Standard">Mirroring moves across global market infrastructure to boost liquidity and speed up transactions to help customers cut costs and risk, the LME intends to introduce two sweeping changes in the first quarter of 2026: crossing of trades for client order flow, and minimum volume thresholds for block trades.</p>
<p class="Standard">Electronic trading currently accounts for less than half of total trading on the LME as many market participants trade inter-office over the phone or via email or other external systems, making it an outlier as similar exchanges are typically fully electronic already.</p>
<p class="Standard">&ldquo;The LME changes are part of a wider acceleration in markets globally, forcing participants to rethink both their technology and business models,&rdquo; Hamish Adourian, Sinara&rsquo;s head of sales and marketing, told Mondo Visione.</p>
<p class="Standard"><img alt="Hamish_Sinara" src="https://mondovisione.com/_assets/images/Hamish_Sinara.jpg" title="Hamish_Sinara" /></p>
<p class="Standard">&nbsp;<span>Hamish Adourian, Head of Sales and Marketing</span></p>
<p class="Standard">&ldquo;This isn't just a tech thing either. It's about processes, governance and everything else related to that as well. It&rsquo;s certainly at the forefront of their minds for anyone responsible for trading and clearing operations at the very least,&rdquo; Adourian said.</p>
<p class="Standard">Speaking ahead of LME Week, the annual gathering that draws thousands of participants in metals trading from across the world to London, Adourian said there was a strong connection between structural reforms, technology adoption and rising expectations among regulators who are keen to improve transparency in markets.</p>
<p class="Standard">The LME is not forcing brokers to redirect all of their off-exchange trades onto its platform but using cheaper trading fees to compete better with over-the-counter (OTC) or off-exchange &lsquo;prints&rsquo; or transactions.</p>
<p class="Standard">Inevitably such major changes have sparked resistance among some market participants, but others who are already teed-up or are set to adopt automated crossing and &lsquo;smart slicing&rsquo; technology will likely have an advantage.</p>
<p class="Standard">However, voice-heavy desks that lean on small, inter-office trades face having to adapt their business model, Adourian said.</p>
<p class="Standard">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to impact for many the core business model. For brokers who rely on lots of small, bespoke, relationship-driven deals, the new rules might be a challenge to adapt to,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p class="Standard">&ldquo;At the same time, there&rsquo;s definitely an opportunity for those who can leverage technology to stay ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="Standard">Tom Habibi, Sinara's head of engineering, said the reforms will require taking a &lsquo;holistic&rsquo; look at a broker&rsquo;s IT systems, rather than simply adding an extra module to legacy systems, given the nature of the pending market reforms on the LME.</p>
<p class="Standard"><img alt="Tom_Sinara" src="https://mondovisione.com/_assets/images/Tom_Sinara.jpg" title="Tom_Sinara" /></p>
<p class="Standard"><em>&nbsp;Tom Habibi, Head of Engineering</em></p>
<p class="Standard">&ldquo;It changes the data flows, risk checks, and reporting and reconciliation requirements across the whole trading infrastructure. Firms that treat this as a bolt-on will struggle,&rdquo; Habibi said.</p>
<p class="Standard">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about integrating block trade functionality into a resilient, end-to-end workflow. That&rsquo;s where tech can make the difference between being compliant and being competitive,&rdquo; Habibi added.</p>
<p class="Standard">Adourian said market participants will have to juggle the LME changes with other major reforms, including commodity derivatives exchanges (including the LME) taking responsibility for managing position limits in their own markets by early July next year, putting pressure on exchanges to scrutinise market structure more closely.</p>
<p class="Standard">In addition, market participants and exchanges face heightened demands from regulators to ensure that their IT systems are resilient and can recover from cyberattacks or operational glitches within specified times.</p>
<p class="Standard">The wider trading industry is also shifting to faster settlement cycles as Europe copies Wall Street's shift to T+1 or one-day settlement in stocks in the latest sign of how markets in general are speeding up, requiring participants to respond as the prospect of instant settlement loomed, Adourian added.</p>
<p class="Standard">&ldquo;Eventually there will be a T+0 and all the implications around what that means. People are expecting those processes to be faster and faster. You need technology to help with that, but we also need to think about how that tech is used as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="Standard">Sinara said there will also be greater reliance on having technology for monitoring margins in near real-time during the trading day to check whether they are sufficient, a key lesson learned by regulators and market participants after Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine triggered huge moves in energy and nickel markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Standard">&ldquo;We see how markets evolve, regulations evolve, and if your technology can&rsquo;t keep up with that, you end up paying the price later,&rdquo; Habibi said.</p>
<h4 class="Standard">ASSEMBLING LEGO</h4>
<p class="Standard">Sinara was set up 35 years ago with two of its founders still part of its 50 staff, making it a veteran in a sector known for its rapid entries and exits of firms. It provides bespoke trading, clearing and settlement software across the financial sector, with long experience in the LME market.</p>
<p class="Standard">With the company facing competition from deep-pocketed players that employ thousands of staff and outsource work to centres in India and elsewhere, Sinara has opted to keep its employees in the UK with no operations outsourced, a business model it sees as making it particularly responsive to customers.</p>
<p class="Standard">Sinara's roots are in market data technology solutions, but over the years it has broadened out to building, delivering and helping to maintain and enhance trading systems, offering a joined up 'straight through processing' approach that includes using cloud computing.</p>
<p class="Standard">It challenges the trading sector's longstanding structure of rigidly defined front, middle and back offices.</p>
<p class="Standard">To manage costs for customers who face a welter of demands on their IT budgets, Sinara offers to slot together in a tailored way modular components it has already built, like assembling a Lego model to replace only what's necessary rather than the more expensive option and greater upheaval of starting from scratch to fully replace legacy systems, Adourian said.</p>
<p class="Standard">&ldquo;Lego is actually a great analogy as it might seem simple to snap the bricks together but creating an amazing model still takes some effort and experience! So it's that expertise around how to put it all together, put the finishing touches as well as extra customer customisation on top of that, which is what essentially we are offering as a business and the support that goes with it,&rdquo; Adourian said.</p>
<p class="Standard">The increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) in financial services is already being felt in the software sector with the use of apps like ChatGPT to write code, leading to some coding jobs disappearing.</p>
<p class="Standard">Sinara said that while AI might improve productivity across what it calls the software development lifecycle, ultimately it will need to be used by expert software engineers, project managers, quality assurance analysts, and, crucially, support analysts. That human touch is also key to reassuring customers when things go wrong.</p>
<p class="Standard">&nbsp;&ldquo;Software is software,&rdquo; Habibi reflected. &ldquo;Something will always happen eventually. It&rsquo;s how you respond to it which, as a business we&rsquo;re always keen to improve, take lessons, and share those lessons with our customers as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="Standard">For example, Sinara is expanding its &lsquo;nightshift' or overnight staffing for customers to call at any hour, unlike some rivals who have opted for outsourced help centres abroad or AI-based chat boxes to cut costs.</p>
<p class="Standard">&ldquo;I think the irony will be that actually as there is more use of AI in many aspects, whether it's trading or coding, there's more value being placed on where there is a real-life human relationship and expertise,&rdquo; Habibi said.</p>
<p class="Standard">AI won't be able to capture the 'nuances' that expert humans can when responding to customers, whether in the immediate future or possibly even in the longer term, he said.</p>
<p class="Standard">&ldquo;I think many of our customers, who themselves rely on quite deep, longstanding customer relationships, recognise that value even more to a large extent. There is going to be a value in providing that real, genuine human expertise,&rdquo; Adourian added.</p>
<p class="Standard">&ldquo;If something goes wrong and there's no one who really knows how that trading system works, who are you going to talk to?&rdquo;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Bermuda Stock Exchange (BSX), a wholly owned subsidiary of Miami International Holdings, Inc. today hosted its annual &ldquo;Ring the Bell for Financial Literacy 2025&rdquo; underscoring its ongoing commitment to investor education and financial empowerment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The event is part of the global World Investor Week 2025 campaign an initiative of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) and the World Federation of Exchanges (WFE), taking place from October 6 &ndash; 10, 2025.&nbsp; This international effort unites more than 50 exchanges worldwide to spotlight the importance of investor protection and financial literacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This year, BSX partnered with Butterfield to highlight the bank&rsquo;s recent financial education initiative.&nbsp; Earlier this year, Butterfield and nudge, a global leader in financial wellbeing, launched an online learning platform <a href="https://nudge.butterfieldgroup.com/">(</a><a href="https://nudge.butterfieldgroup.com/">https://nudge.butterfieldgroup.com</a><a href="https://nudge.butterfieldgroup.com/">)</a> designed to help all individuals understand their finances, manage risk, and make informed financial decisions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The platform delivers personalised, impartial financial education through four life stages, from Children, Young Adults, Middle Adults, and Seniors, ensuring an inclusive approach that meets diverse needs. Extending beyond the online platform, Butterfield continues to host in-person workshops to college and university students on budgeting, saving and responsible money management, and to seniors on fraud prevention.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<title>Bank Of England: Minutes Of The Securities Lending Committee Meeting – September 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The Securities Lending Committee is a forum for market participants and authorities to discuss the UK securities lending market.</span></p>
<p>Location: Blackrock, Drapers Gardens, 12 Throgmorton Ave, London EC2N 2DL</p>
<p>Time: 2.30&ndash;4.30pm</p>
<p><section class="page-section">
<div class="section-heading">
<h2 id="chapter-0">Minutes</h2>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-0">Item 1: Introductory remarks</h3>
<p>The Chair opened the meeting and welcomed the members and observers. The Committee gave thanks to two long-standing members, Andy Dyson of ISLA and Andy Krangle of Citi, who will both step down from the Committee.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-1">Item 2: Diversity, equity and inclusion</h3>
<p>The Committee discussed hybrid working solutions and noted references to flexible working in UK Money Market Code best practice are for all roles regardless of location, and contribute to greater diversity of participation in financial markets. Members highlighted that as cultural shifts in managing work and home life have embedded, flexible working is seen as a key element in recruitment and retention of talent. In some cases, a reduction in flexible working patterns has led to a negative impact on career aspiration and ambition.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-2">Item 3: T+1 update</h3>
<p>The Committee discussed the upcoming draft legislation on T+1 settlement. They noted that the government plans to publish a draft statutory instrument for comment, with an accompanying policy note explaining the approach, by the end of 2025.</p>
<p>The Committee noted the importance of automation ahead of the 11 October 2027 deadline as the Accelerated Settlement Taskforce published the second version of its report. The FCA is engaging with firms as part of ongoing supervision, to confirm preparation and readiness for testing which commences in 2026. Engagement will be augmented with publication of the FCA blog due in October, which will set out key points and good practice for end-to-end settlement processes.</p>
<p>Members commented on the necessity to confirm solutions for cross-border collateral settlements and market sales executed at market close, ahead of the 2027 deadline which will require collaboration and enhanced resourcing. Compressed settlement may lead to an increased risk for participants and impact the type of business firms are able to conduct.</p>
<p>The Committee noted a reticence to invest in digitalisation, which requires a consolidated agreement across industry, to progress. Focus has been on T+1 implementation for legacy systems and processes and enhancing existing industry solutions rather than investment in the future look of securities finance.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-3">Item 4: Market update &ndash; Committee</h3>
<p>The Committee discussed the Bank of England discussion paper on measures to enhance gilt repo market resilience, covering gilt repo clearing and minimum haircuts. Members noted the difficulty of implementing haircuts with cross-product margining practices where banks apply haircuts across a managed client portfolio.</p>
<p>Members raised concerns around a deterioration in corporate action payment discipline noting focus may be redirected to implementing electronic solutions in other parts of the transaction chain. Drivers of the decline include mismatched instructions at important dates in the corporate action calendar. Vendor solutions are available and participants expect an improvement across the market as automated solutions are implemented and penalties take effect.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-4">Item 5: Securities financing vendors</h3>
<p>The Committee discussed the increased requirement for automation across the securities finance industry and vendor solutions. A diverse range of solutions is available, tailored to business requirements and budget with several new entrants into the market recently. Fragmentation of inventory and a reduction in liquidity remains a concern. It was noted that industry has a part to play in demanding best practice solutions and interoperability via purchasing power. This is seen as critical as firms increase use of automation and electronic solutions across products and jurisdictions. The Committee will consider the benefits of a digital sub-group to inform the Committee of change in this landscape.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-5">Item 6: SLC Tax &amp; Regs update</h3>
<p>The SLC Tax &amp; Regulations sub-committee provided an update to the group on regulatory changes for UCITs collateral arrangements, noting ESMA were in principle, content with collateral via pledge construct. Council approval is expected in the near term with further updates expected.</p>
<p>A new EU capital markets Savings &amp; Investments Union is expected to replace the Capital Markets Union, providing clearer strategy and overcoming barriers to a unified market, including low issuance and higher capital charges to funds. The new Union aims to create a deeper, more liquid market but proposals are yet to be published.</p>
<p>EU tax focus remains focused on competitiveness, harmonisation and simplification, reducing administrative burden and increasing faster payments.</p>
<p>The Swiss post-trade council has published draft T+1 recommendations for Switzerland and Lichtenstein and will open market consultation on 10 December 2025.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-6">Item 7: AOB</h3>
<p>No further business.</p>

<title>The EBA Commission’s Proposed Changes To The Technical Standards On Liquidity Requirements Of The Reserve Of Assets Under MiCA</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-eba-commissions-proposed-changes-to-the-technical-standards-on-liquidity-re-20251010/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-eba-commissions-proposed-changes-to-the-technical-standards-on-liquidity-re-20251010/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published two Opinions in response to the European Commission&rsquo;s (EC) amendments relating to the draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) specifying the composition and liquidity requirements of the reserve of assets under the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA). The EBA considers that the EC&rsquo;s proposed substantive amendments are not consistent with the prudential framework established by MiCA.</span></p>
<p>On 28 August 2025, the EC informed the EBA of its intention to endorse, with amendments, the draft RTS specifying the highly liquid financial instruments (HLFI) with minimal market, credit and concentration risk, and the liquidity requirements of the reserve of assets under MiCA.</p>
<p>The EC&rsquo;s amendments could be interpreted as allowing investments of issuance proceeds into non-highly liquid financial instruments (non-HLFI such, as commodities or crypto-assets), classifying all money market funds as HLFI while relaxing concentration and look-through limits, and removing undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities concentration rules. While supporting the proposed drafting clarifications, the EBA considers these substantive amendments inconsistent with Articles 36(1)(b) and 38(1) under MiCA, as they would introduce material liquidity risk, weaken alignment with the banking liquidity framework, and open scope for regulatory arbitrage.</p>
<p>With the publication of these two Opinions, the EBA reaffirms its close scrutiny of the implementation of the MiCA prudential framework for asset-referenced and e-money tokens, in particular regarding the liquidity, credit and concentration risks of the reserve of assets and their implications for financial stability.</p>
<p><span>Legal basis</span></p>
<p>This Opinion is based on Article 10(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, which requires the EBA to submit its response in the form of an opinion to amendments to draft regulatory technical standards (RTS) proposed by the European Commission.</p>
<p>On 13 June 2024, the EBA submitted its final draft RTS to the EC and on 28 August 2025, the EC sent a letter to the EBA about its intention to endorse the RTS with amendments and submitted a modified version of the RTS. The opinion constitutes the EBA&rsquo;s response to the EC.</p>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/eex-ag-concludes-full-acquisition-of-get-baltic-20251010/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The European Energy Exchange AG (EEX AG) today announces the full takeover of GET Baltic through the acquisition of the remaining 34 per cent of shares from Lithuania&rsquo;s gas transmission system operator, Amber Grid.</p>
<p>GET Baltic has been part of EEX Group since 2023, when EEX AG acquired a 66 per cent stake in the company. Subsequently, the Baltic-Finnish natural gas markets were integrated into the trading platform of European Energy Exchange (EEX) in September 2025, opening the markets to a wider network of participants and reaching high trading volumes from the start. In the course of the integration, EEX introduced physical derivatives contracts for all of these markets, in addition to the existing short-term markets, as well as location spread trading between Baltic-Finnish and other European gas markets of EEX and advanced clearing services.</p>
<p>Peter Reitz, CEO of EEX AG comments: &ldquo;<em>The full takeover further strengthens our presence in this region, and especially on the European natural gas markets. It also underpins our commitment to offering an extended range of trading opportunities for both our existing and newly admitted members. GET Baltic is a strong and trusted partner, and we are proud to have them as part of the wider EEX Group.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amber Grid Chief Executive Officer Nemunas Biknius says: &ldquo;<em>The integration of GET Baltic into EEX Group marks an important step in the natural gas market of our region&mdash;Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Finland. The joining of our exchange with one of the largest European energy exchanges has strengthened regional market liquidity and already increased competition. Advanced trading instruments have been implemented and access to a broader range of services provided. Since 2023, EEX has fulfilled all agreements, so this integration reflects the needs and interests of our region.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giedrė Kurmė, CEO of GET Baltic comments: &ldquo;<em>With this full acquisition, EEX becomes an integral part of the Baltic and Finnish energy landscape. Together, we can leverage the best of both organisations to accelerate regional integration, increasing market transparency and efficiency. The GET Baltic team will remain the regional competence center for further gas market development and will continue to work closely with customers on site.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>GET Baltic will continue to serve as the regional hub for gas market development, maintaining its strong local presence while benefitting from expanded technological and operational capabilities. The acquisition aligns with EEX&rsquo;s broader strategy to strengthen its position as the leading European energy exchange.</p>
<p>In order to leverage GET Baltic&rsquo;s in-depth expertise in the region, GET Baltic and EPEX SPOT, the power spot exchange within EEX Group, will additionally co-operate on the launch of an Intraday Continuous Market for the Baltic region from November 2025.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.eex.com/en/" target="_blank">European Energy Exchange (EEX)</a></span>&nbsp;is a leading energy exchange which builds secure, successful and sustainable commodity markets worldwide &ndash; together with its customers and partners. As part of EEX Group, it serves international power, natural gas, environmental, freight and agricultural markets, and provides data, reporting and registry services. EEX is an enabler of the energy transition and decarbonisation, advancing renewables integration through dedicated products and services, including those related to guarantees of origin.</p>

<title>FSB Outlines Next Steps For Authorities On AI Monitoring</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><span>FSB report sets out advice to authorities on how to tackle the challenges related to monitoring adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in the financial sector.</span></li>
<li><span>The report identifies a range of direct and proxy indicators to support monitoring of AI adoption and related vulnerabilities in the financial system.</span></li>
<li><span>The report includes a case study on recent developments in the AI supply chain and implications of financial institutions&rsquo; reliance on a few critical third-party providers. These include vulnerabilities related to criticality, concentration, and substitutability.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) today published a&nbsp;<a class="custom-internal-link processed-internal-link" href="https://www.fsb.org/2025/10/monitoring-adoption-of-artificial-intelligence-and-related-vulnerabilities-in-the-financial-sector/">report looking at how authorities are monitoring adoption of AI and related vulnerabilities in the financial sector</a>. The report builds on the FSB&rsquo;s 2024 report on the&nbsp;<a class="custom-internal-link processed-internal-link" href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/11/the-financial-stability-implications-of-artificial-intelligence/">Financial Stability Implications of Artificial Intelligence</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>While financial authorities have made progress in understanding AI uses cases and their benefits and vulnerabilities, monitoring efforts are still at an early stage. The report highlights challenges faced by authorities, including data gaps and lack of standardised taxonomies, and identifies a range of indicators to support monitoring AI adoption and related vulnerabilities in the financial system.</p>
<p>Third-party service providers play a critical role in helping financial institutions develop and deploy effective AI applications efficiently. However, such relationships expose financial institutions to operational vulnerabilities, and the growing use of generative AI (GenAI) could lead to critical third-party dependencies. The report highlights the dependence of GenAI on a small number of key suppliers such as specialised hardware, cloud infrastructure, and pre-trained models. This heavy reliance can create vulnerabilities if there are few alternatives available. A case study on GenAI explores these challenges, drawing on the FSB&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a class="custom-internal-link" href="https://www.fsb.org/2023/12/final-report-on-enhancing-third-party-risk-management-and-oversight-a-toolkit-for-financial-institutions-and-financial-authorities/">third-party risk management toolkit</a>&nbsp;and proposing indicators to assess criticality, concentration, substitutability, and the systemic relevance of third-party AI service providers. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The FSB encourages national authorities to enhance their monitoring approaches, leveraging the indicators presented in the report. To support these efforts, the FSB will facilitate alignment in taxonomies and indicators through cross-border cooperation.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Background</h2>
<p>The FSB coordinates at the international level the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies and develops and promotes the implementation of effective regulatory, supervisory, and other financial sector policies in the interest of financial stability. It brings together national authorities responsible for financial stability in 24 countries and jurisdictions, international financial institutions, sector-specific international groupings of regulators and supervisors, and committees of central bank experts. The FSB also conducts outreach with approximately 70 other jurisdictions through its six Regional Consultative Groups.</p>
<p>The FSB is chaired by Andrew Bailey, Governor of the Bank of England. The FSB Secretariat is located in Basel, Switzerland and hosted by the Bank for International Settlements.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The FSA published the English version of "FSA Analytical Notes (2025.6) vol.3&nbsp;".&nbsp;<img alt="PDF" class="pdf" src="https://www.fsa.go.jp/images/common/icon_pdf.gif" /><a href="https://www.fsa.go.jp/en/about/fsaanalyticalnotes/20250625/01.pdf">full text</a></p>
<p>As financial institutions&rsquo; business environments and profit structures change, it is important to understand economic and market trends based on data, and to accurately grasp the business conditions of individual financial institutions and also the resilience and vulnerabilities of the financial system as a whole. From this perspective, the FSA&nbsp;has been focusing on the utilization of granular data, such as transaction-level bank loan data and financial data on individual corporations. Some case examples of data analyses using such granular data are published as a series of reports titled &ldquo;FSA Analytical Notes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This issue contains "Attempt to Identify Early Warning Signals on Credit Risks using Regional Banks&rsquo; Loan Data and Macroeconomic Indicators".</p>
<div class="mt20"><img alt="PDF" class="pdf" src="https://www.fsa.go.jp/images/common/icon_pdf.gif" /><a href="https://www.fsa.go.jp/en/about/fsaanalyticalnotes/20250625/02.pdf">Attempt to Identify Early Warning Signals on Credit Risks using Regional Banks&rsquo; Loan Data and Macroeconomic Indicators</a></div>
<div class="mb20">
<p class="mt0 mb0">This paper presents a machine learning model designed to predict trends in credit risk by leveraging regional banks&rsquo; granular loan data combined with macroeconomic indicators, with the aim of detecting early warning signs potentially affecting the management of banks. The analysis targets downward transitions in borrower classifications and identifies indicators that appear useful for capturing such warning signs, as well as offering insights into the current economic environment compared to past crisis periods. With the full-scale launch of the Common Data Platform, we will keep on making efforts to expand the scope of analysis, refine indicator selection, enhance the model, and apply these findings in dialogues with financial institutions.</p>
</div>
<p class="mt20">Enhancing the use of data in financial supervision and policy-making is a medium- to long-term agenda. The FSA will continue to build its data analysis capabilities and data infrastructure.</p>
<div class="in-1hang mt20">
<p>* Unless otherwise noted, the figures and tables in this report were prepared by the FSA.</p>

<title>ASIC Flags Risks In Offshore Outsourcing After Review Identifies Governance Gaps</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-flags-risks-in-offshore-outsourcing-after-review-identifies-governance-gaps-20251010/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-flags-risks-in-offshore-outsourcing-after-review-identifies-governance-gaps-20251010/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC is calling on financial services entities to strengthen governance and risk management after a review found weaknesses in the use of offshore service providers (OSPs) exposing consumers and investors to potential harm.</p>
<p>The review into the use of OSPs by financial advice licensees and responsible entities (REs) of registered managed investment schemes found that the quality of risk management arrangements relating to their use varied significantly, with some entities failing to have a framework in place.</p>
<p>ASIC Commissioner Alan Kirkland said that Australian financial services (AFS) licensees are ultimately responsible for the operation of their businesses, even when they outsource to offshore service providers directly or through an intermediary.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Advice licensees and REs can outsource services but they cannot outsource their fundamental obligations,&rsquo; said Commissioner Kirkland.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When licensees neglect their responsibilities, consumers, investors, and financial services businesses can be exposed to harm, such as exposure of personal information through cyber incidents.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Commissioner Kirkland said Australian AFS licensees should have sufficient skills to independently identify material risks and to assess an OSP&rsquo;s performance and ongoing suitability.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The more critical the outsourced function, the greater the risks to consumers and investors,&rsquo; Commissioner Kirkland said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The risks can be exacerbated when outsourced functions are not supervised adequately, particularly if they are outsourced internationally.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Commissioner Kirkland also flagged critical risks associated with the loss of control over a businesses&rsquo; key functions to OSPs, disruptions to operational services, and conflicting obligations for OSPs subject to foreign laws.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Financial services firms cannot drop their guard. Cyber-attacks, for example, are more prevalent and growing in sophistication. All licensees must proactively review governance frameworks and address issues that threaten to undermine public confidence in their business and in turn, the financial system.&rsquo;</p>
<p>ASIC will continue to monitor the governance and risk management frameworks of financial services entities, and where necessary, hold them to account for failing to have the right processes in place to protect consumers and investors&rsquo; interests.</p>
<p>In relation to general concerns about cybersecurity, ASIC has taken enforcement action against&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-035mr-asic-sues-fiig-securities-for-systemic-and-prolonged-cybersecurity-failures/" title="25-035MR ASIC sues FIIG Securities for systemic and prolonged cybersecurity failures">FIIG Securities</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-143mr-asic-sues-fortnum-private-wealth-for-allegedly-failing-to-adequately-manage-cybersecurity-risks/" title="25-143MR ASIC sues Fortnum Private Wealth for allegedly failing to adequately manage cybersecurity risks">Fortnum Private Wealth</a>&nbsp;for alleged failures to adequately manage cybersecurity risks.</p>
<p>In 2022, the Federal Court also ruled in ASIC&rsquo;s favour in a landmark case against&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2022-releases/22-104mr-court-finds-ri-advice-failed-to-adequately-manage-cybersecurity-risks/" title="22-104MR Court finds RI Advice failed to adequately manage cybersecurity risks">RI Advice</a>, which was found to have breached its license obligations to act efficiently and fairly when it failed to have adequate risk management systems to manage its cybersecurity risks.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>As set out in ASIC regulatory guidance, it is open to AFS licensees to outsource functions. However, regardless of whether these functions are outsourced directly or via an intermediary business, licensees remain responsible for complying with their obligations.</p>
<p>Where functions are outsourced, licensees must:</p>
<ul>
<li>have measures in place to ensure that due skill and care is taken in choosing suitable service providers, </li>
<li>monitor the ongoing performance of service providers, and </li>
<li>appropriately deal with any actions by service providers that breach service level agreements or the licensee&rsquo;s general obligations (see ASIC&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/regulatory-guides/rg-104-afs-licensing-meeting-the-general-obligations/" title="RG 104 AFS licensing: Meeting the general obligations">Regulatory Guide 104</a>&nbsp;[paragraph 104.36]). </li>
</ul>
<p>Failing to adequately supervise outsourced functions could lead to detrimental effects on the operation of the licence, its compliance with legal obligations and cause harm to consumers.</p>

<title>Rebuilding After The Storm - Remarks By ASIC Commissioner Alan Kirkland At The Insurance Council Of Australia Annual Conference On 10 October 2025.</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/rebuilding-after-the-storm-remarks-by-asic-commissioner-alan-kirkland-at-the-i-20251010/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/rebuilding-after-the-storm-remarks-by-asic-commissioner-alan-kirkland-at-the-i-20251010/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul>
<li>The insurance industry has an enormous task ahead to rebuild trust with the Australian community following a challenging period of claims handling failures.</li>
<li>The development of a new General Insurance Code of Practice that will be enforceable by contract is an important step towards rebuilding trust. However, unless the provisions themselves improve overall levels of consumer protection, it will be a step backwards.</li>
<li>Our challenge to industry over the next year is to commit to a code that will make a real difference to your customers. Simple cannot be code for stripped out.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Acknowledgement of country</h2>
<p>I would like to begin by acknowledging the Traditional Owners, the Gadigal people of the Eora Nation, and their ongoing connection to and custodianship of the lands on which we meet today. I pay my respects to elders past and present and I extend that respect to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people here today.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>It is a pleasure to speak at this conference again, and to continue the tradition of ASIC and APRA appearing together. I know that we both view this an important forum for ensuring the insurance sector is ready for the challenges both at hand and ahead.</p>
<p>I want to acknowledge the efforts of Andrew Hall, Steve Johnston, and the ICA Board for your work in leading the industry through these challenges.</p>
<p>As a few examples, I was really pleased to see your recent report on artificial intelligence<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/rebuilding-after-the-storm/#fn1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>with the CSIRO and its focus on ensuring the adoption of AI in insurance does not lead to adverse outcomes or erode consumer trust.</p>
<p>I was also particularly pleased to be informed of the decision that your new General Insurance Code of Practice will be enforceable by contract. This is an important step from a consumer protection perspective. After all, insurance is a promise &ndash; and promises have to mean something. That&rsquo;s a point I will return to later in my remarks, but I wanted to congratulate you on your leadership here.</p>
<p>I note the last code review occurred during the Hayne royal commission, which some of you probably remember that former Insurance Council chief executive, Rob Whelan, referred to as &ldquo;trying to pitch a tent in the middle of a hurricane&rdquo;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/rebuilding-after-the-storm/#fn-1"><sup>[2]</sup></a><a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/rebuilding-after-the-storm/#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><span>&nbsp;</span></a>.</p>
<p>Six years on, and this analogy is probably still an apt one to describe the broader risk to the industry. While perhaps that particular hurricane has moved on, it does feel like there is always another storm either upon us, or upon the horizon.</p>
<p>For example, climate change is no longer just a risk to insurers &ndash; it's a risk to insurance itself.</p>
<p>The National Adaption Plan<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/rebuilding-after-the-storm/#fn3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>&nbsp;released last month by the Australian Government laid bare the vulnerabilities of the insurance sector and the financial system more broadly to be honest to climate change.</p>
<p>It has even been speculated by some that climate change could be the catalyst for the next financial crisis<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/rebuilding-after-the-storm/#fn4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In the past five years alone, there have been nearly one million insurance claims and more than $20 billion in insured losses in Australia<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/rebuilding-after-the-storm/#fn5"><sup>[5]</sup></a><a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/rebuilding-after-the-storm/#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"><span></span></a>.</p>
<p>And in the next five years, the Climate Council projects that one in 25 Australian homes will be uninsurable due to the effects of climate change<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/rebuilding-after-the-storm/#fn6"><sup>[6]</sup></a><a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/rebuilding-after-the-storm/#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"><span></span></a>.</p>
<p>Even ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred &ndash; which fortunately defied the catastrophic forecasts<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/rebuilding-after-the-storm/#fn7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>&nbsp;that we were all looking at &ndash; resulted in more than $1.4 billion in claims &ndash; the seventh most costly cyclone-related disaster on record in Australia<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/rebuilding-after-the-storm/#fn8"><sup>[8]</sup></a><a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/rebuilding-after-the-storm/#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"><span></span></a>.</p>
<p>These are big numbers with big implications. They impact every Australian household through rising premiums. They impact every Australian seeking timely support from their insurer by increasing pressure on claims handling. But they also impact how Australians view the insurance sector more broadly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to forget those who let you down when you&rsquo;ve had a hard time &ndash; and that was unfortunately the experience of many Australians in the aftermath of the 2022 floods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some people, who turned to their insurer in their darkest hour after paying premiums for years, felt that they became engaged in an adversarial situation with a company meant to be on their side."<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/rebuilding-after-the-storm/#fn9"><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>
<p>That quote is from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics report into claims handling failures after the 2022 floods, which was handed down almost a year ago.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fair to say that there remains a significant trust gap to be addressed following this report.</p>
<p>Reputation data from RepTrak<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/rebuilding-after-the-storm/#fn10"><sup>[10]</sup></a><a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/rebuilding-after-the-storm/#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"><span></span></a>&nbsp;and Roy Morgan<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/rebuilding-after-the-storm/#fn11"><sup>[11]</sup></a>&nbsp;suggests that insurance is among Australia&rsquo;s most distrusted industries &ndash; and you only need to look at the testimony of individuals impacted to understand why.</p>
<p>David Norris, whose family owned the Central Hotel in Eugowra, told the inquiry after more than 60 years with their insurer it was apparent that &ldquo;loyalty only goes one way<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/rebuilding-after-the-storm/#fn-1"><sup>[12]</sup></a><a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/rebuilding-after-the-storm/#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12"><span></span></a>.</p>
<p>This is the challenge that must be addressed by you as you try to &ldquo;pitch your tent&rdquo; in the middle of these storms &ndash; showing people like David that loyalty is a two-way street.</p>
<h2>Green shoots of recovery</h2>
<p>As insurers though, you are in the business of recovery. You know that rebuilding doesn&rsquo;t happen overnight. It takes continual effort and care. And we know from our latest review that some of you are putting in the work and starting to see some green shoots of recovery as a result of that work.</p>
<p>As noted recently by AFCA<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/rebuilding-after-the-storm/#fn13"><sup>[13]</sup></a>, the industry has made progress on reducing historically high complaint numbers, which should be commended.</p>
<p>And we have also observed some promising signs in our recent follow-up on Report 768 &ndash; which of course was the report that examined claims handling practices following the 2022 floods<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/rebuilding-after-the-storm/#fn14"><sup>[14]</sup></a><a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/rebuilding-after-the-storm/#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14"><span></span></a>.</p>
<p>When that report was published, we found that poor communications, poor resourcing, and poor treatment of vulnerable customers were endemic across the insurance industry.</p>
<p>But it is clear that a lot of work has happened in the past two years in response to those findings.</p>
<p>For example, every insurer we looked at this time around had established a program to improve their approach to claims handling.</p>
<p>Most had introduced a single point of contact for claims, so customers didn't have to tell their stories over and over again.</p>
<p>Some had gotten smarter about how they used their data to identify and support vulnerable customers, before and after major events.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And a few went beyond this &ndash; towards truly consumer-centric practices.</p>
<p>For example, we&rsquo;ve seen some insurers appoint a dedicated consumer advocate to be a voice for customers inside their company.</p>
<p>Some have established specialist new teams dedicated to the handling of vulnerable consumers, sometimes with the help of external experts, to plug gaps before people fall through them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve called out these two practices in particular because it is important to walk in your customers&rsquo; shoes when improving claims handling practices in order to learn where the real stumbling blocks are.</p>
<p>There is clearly more work to do. Progress is still too slow on some measures, and uneven on others. But the process of change has begun, and we want you to continue that momentum.</p>
<h2>Where to next</h2>
<p>And to help you focus your efforts, I'd like to talk about two projects ASIC will undertake within the next year.</p>
<p>The first will examine the accuracy and transparency of premiums &ndash; in particular car insurance premiums.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because this area is a clear pain point for your customers. According to ASIC&rsquo;s internal dispute resolution data that you provide to us, motor vehicle insurance is the most complained about general insurance product &ndash; and premiums are the biggest category of complaint.</p>
<p>And as our recently commenced enforcement action against RACQ shows<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/rebuilding-after-the-storm/#fn15"><sup>[15]</sup></a><a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/rebuilding-after-the-storm/#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15"><span></span></a>, we are particularly concerned where insurers don&rsquo;t make it easy for their customers to even understand how much their premium has changed from year to year.</p>
<p>ASIC can't set insurance premiums, but we can hold insurers accountable for their pricing practices and the accuracy of their communications with their customers.</p>
<p>Our review will examine how insurers communicate premiums, to understand whether they are complying with their legal disclosure requirements. We will also engage with consumers to understand the challenges they face when they buy or renew car insurance.</p>
<p>The other key area of focus for us is the use of cash settlements, which has already come up this morning.</p>
<p>The floods inquiry brought into sharp focus the challenges consumers can face when offered cash settlements.</p>
<p>Often inadequate settlements have left Australians holding the bag during what is a time of increased vulnerability for them<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/rebuilding-after-the-storm/#fn16"><sup>[16]</sup></a><a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/rebuilding-after-the-storm/#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16"><span></span></a>.</p>
<p>Some individuals have only accepted these settlements because they don&rsquo;t have the energy or the means to fight any longer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;To quote ARC Justice Chief Executive, Damien Stock, who gave evidence to the parliamentary inquiry:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We've heard some horrible stories of children not wanting to get up in the morning because the warmest part of the shed that they're living in is their bed and they don't want to get out of their bed and be in the cold shed. Now, I am a parent. If I was a parent in those circumstances&mdash;fighting an insurance company over 12 months&mdash;and I was offered cash to stop my child feeling like that, I'd take cash.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/rebuilding-after-the-storm/#fn17"><sup>[17]</sup></a><a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/rebuilding-after-the-storm/#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17"><span></span></a></p>
<p>So, the focus of our work this year will be to investigate the practices and disclosures surrounding these offers to better understand the risks to consumers during these periods of heightened vulnerability.</p>
<h2>Conclusion &ndash; commit to the code</h2>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s what you can expect from us over the next year &ndash; but for my final minute on the stage, I would like to talk about what we expect from you.</p>
<p>I said before that insurance is a promise. But promises without accountability are essentially empty commitments.</p>
<p>Think about people like David, who has lost all faith in his insurer after 60 years of loyalty from his family. It will take a lot more than words to restore his trust in insurance after what he has experienced. It will take teeth - specifically, teeth in your new code.</p>
<p>As I said earlier, it is a commendable step to make the general insurance code enforceable by contract. But if the provisions themselves do not improve overall levels of consumer protection, it will be a step backwards.</p>
<p>We often say at ASIC that simplicity equals enforceability, but at the same time, simple cannot be code for stripped out.</p>
<p>So my challenge to you over the next year is to get this new code right and to make it count. Commit to a code that will make a real difference to your customers.</p>
<p>Like the communities that you support, the insurance sector has shown remarkable resilience and capacity for rebuilding. But as the storms continue to swirl around us, it is critical that you build back better &ndash; and a meaningful code is the path towards this.</p>
<p>Thanks for the opportunity to speak today.</p>

<title>Keynote Address At The John L. Weinberg Center For Corporate Governance’s 25th Anniversary Gala, Paul S. Atkins, Chairman, SEC, Newark, DE, Oct. 9, 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. &nbsp;Thank you, Larry [Cunningham], for your generous introduction and your kind invitation for me to be here today.&nbsp; It is an honor and pleasure for me to participate in the Weinberg Center&rsquo;s twenty-fifth anniversary. &nbsp;Larry, I should also like to congratulate you on your recent appointment as director of the Center.&nbsp; I know that you are deeply devoted to the Center&rsquo;s mission, and I am confident that you will contribute to its work in extraordinary ways, consistent with the excellence that has defined your career.</p>
<p>Tonight marks my third time attending this forum, but my first as SEC Chairman. &nbsp;So, I am sure that you appreciate that the views I express here are in my capacity as Chairman and do not necessarily reflect those of the SEC as an institution or of my fellow Commissioners.&nbsp; With that disclaimer out of the way, it is a pleasure to return to the Weinberg Center&mdash;and a special privilege to do so tonight. &nbsp;For a quarter century, the Center has distinguished itself as one of the premier and longest-standing corporate governance institutions in academia. &nbsp;Its insights command the attention of practitioners in boardrooms and courtrooms alike. &nbsp;And tonight, we convene not only to honor the Center&rsquo;s legacy, but also to build on it.</p>
<p>As a leading venue for informed dialogue, the Weinberg Center commits itself to shaping and influencing corporate governance. &nbsp;In that spirit, I am delighted to discuss one of my top priorities as Chairman, which is to make being a public company an attractive proposition for more firms.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s face it:&nbsp; in many quarters and for many reasons, taking a company public is no longer so &ldquo;cool&rdquo; as it once was.&nbsp; There are approximately 4,700 exchange-listed companies today, compared to a high point of approximately 7,800 in 2007.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp; My goal is to reverse this trend&mdash;to &ldquo;Make IPOs Great Again&rdquo; &mdash;and it involves three pillars.&nbsp; First, we must simplify and scale the SEC&rsquo;s disclosure requirements to reduce the costs of preparing SEC filings and, at the same time, make them more comprehensible.&nbsp; Second, we must de-politicize shareholder meetings and return their focus to voting on director elections and significant corporate matters.&nbsp; Finally, we must reform the litigation landscape for securities lawsuits to eliminate frivolous complaints, while maintaining an avenue for shareholders to continue to bring meritorious claims.&nbsp; My remarks this evening will focus on the latter two pillars, each of which also implicates state corporate law.</p>
<p align="center">***</p>
<p>In the past few proxy seasons, perhaps nothing has epitomized the politicization of shareholder meetings more than shareholder proposals focused on environmental and social issues.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp; These proposals, which reflect views from both sides of the political aisle, generally call for actions that are not binding on the company&mdash;referred to as &ldquo;precatory proposals&rdquo;&mdash;and frequently involve issues not material to the company&rsquo;s business.&nbsp; When voted on at meetings, they almost always receive even lower support than shareholder proposals do generally.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp; Nonetheless, these proposals consume a significant amount of management&rsquo;s time and impose costs on the company.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp; However, is a company actually required to include these precatory shareholder proposals in its proxy materials?&nbsp; The answer to this question lies at the intersection of the Commission&rsquo;s Rule 14a-8 and state corporate law.</p>
<p>While Rule 14a-8 provides a mechanism for a shareholder to include its proposal in the company&rsquo;s proxy statement,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;the rule can only be used for proposals that can properly be brought before a shareholder meeting under state law.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a proposal is not permissible under state law&mdash;that is, if it is not a &ldquo;proper subject&rdquo; for action by shareholders&mdash;Rule 14a-8 permits a company to exclude the proposal from its proxy statement.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp; The original 1942 version of Rule 14a-8 embodied this concept,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;and it lives today in paragraph (i)(1) of the rule.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<p>State law governs whether a proposal is a &ldquo;proper subject.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp; So, are precatory proposals a &ldquo;proper subject&rdquo; for action by shareholders under Delaware law?&nbsp; The expertise and domain of the Commission and its staff is in the federal securities laws.&nbsp; Accordingly, it is appropriate for the agency to defer to those who practice Delaware law, including many of you in the room this evening, to answer this question.&nbsp; But at least one Delaware practitioner has recently concluded that precatory proposals are not a &ldquo;proper subject&rdquo; because Delaware law does not confer to stockholders an inherent right to vote on precatory proposals.<a name="_Ref210147503"></a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></p>
<p>The view that Delaware law does not provide shareholders the right to have their precatory proposals addressed by companies is not a new one.<a name="_Ref210137633"></a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking at an SEC roundtable on proxy rules and state corporate law in 2007, Leo Strine, who was Vice Chancellor [of the Delaware Court of Chancery] at the time and who I understand delivered the keynote address at the Symposium earlier today, said the following about precatory proposals under Delaware law: &ldquo;In Delaware, [we] vote on real things&hellip;We do not have imaginary voting. &nbsp;We do not have therapy for whoever&hellip;We do not have what I call &lsquo;pizza on the wall.&rsquo;&nbsp; That is precatory proposals.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></p>
<p>But if precatory proposals are not a &ldquo;proper subject&rdquo; for shareholder action under Delaware law&mdash;and more than two-thirds of S&amp;P 500 companies are incorporated in the state<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>&mdash;why have companies not sought to exclude precatory shareholder proposals pursuant to paragraph (i)(1)?&nbsp; At the same 2007 roundtable, the late Marty Dunn, a much-admired lawyer in the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Corporation Finance, posited exactly this question.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>&nbsp; In response, then-Chancellor Strine said, &ldquo;[the SEC] made&hellip;up [precatory proposals and Delaware is] fine with it.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a></p>
<p>The Commission, through the note to paragraph 14a-8(i)(1), contemplates whether precatory proposals are a &ldquo;proper subject.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a>&nbsp; The note reflects a codification of the Commission staff&rsquo;s views that there is a presumption that precatory proposals are a &ldquo;proper subject&rdquo; under state law.<a name="_Ref209970668"></a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a>&nbsp; However, the notion that Rule 14a-8 gives shareholders the right to present precatory proposals&mdash; when state law does not&mdash;is supported neither by the text of the note nor its history.&nbsp; In fact, the note expressly states that a company can overcome the presumption.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a>&nbsp; Furthermore, when the Commission amended the note in 1983,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a>&nbsp;the purpose was to &ldquo;make it clear that whether the nature of the proposal, mandatory or precatory, affects its includability is solely a matter of state law, and to dispel any mistaken impression that the Commission's application of paragraph [(i)](1) is based on the form of the proposal.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a></p>
<p>Pulling all of this together, if there is no fundamental right under Delaware law for a company&rsquo;s shareholders to vote on precatory proposals&mdash;and the company has not created that right through its governing documents&mdash;then one could make an argument that a precatory shareholder proposal submitted to a Delaware company is excludable under paragraph (i)(1) of Rule 14a-8.&nbsp; If a company makes this argument and seeks the SEC staff&rsquo;s views,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a>&nbsp;and the company obtains an opinion of counsel<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a>&nbsp;that the proposal is not a &ldquo;proper subject&rdquo; for shareholder action under Delaware law, this argument should prevail, at least for that company.&nbsp; I have high confidence that the SEC staff will honor this position.</p>
<p>In 2007, Delaware amended its constitution to give the SEC the ability to certify questions to its highest court for declaratory judgements.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a>&nbsp;So far, the Commission has taken advantage of this tremendous opportunity only once&mdash;in June of 2008,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a>&nbsp;shortly before I left the SEC as a Commissioner in my prior tour of duty.&nbsp; Interestingly, that certification also involved whether a shareholder proposal was a &ldquo;proper subject&rdquo; for shareholder action.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a>&nbsp; The court issued its decision just 20 days after the Commission&rsquo;s certification.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a>&nbsp; As I stated at the time, I salute the court for its speed in deciding the issue.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[28]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;If the need for the Commission to certify a question to the court arises in the future, I hope that both the agency and the court will continue to benefit from this unique partnership to expeditiously resolve matters of Delaware law that arise in the context of the federal securities laws.</p>
<p align="center">***</p>
<p>While we are on the topic of the role of states in shareholder proposals, I also want to discuss recent developments in Texas.&nbsp; Last month, the state's shareholder proposal law went into effect and added a new section to the Texas Business Organizations Code (&ldquo;TBOC&rdquo;).<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29">[29]</a>&nbsp; If a company opts into this section, then a shareholder must own at least $1 million in market value or three percent of the company&rsquo;s voting shares, among other requirements, to submit a shareholder proposal.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30">[30]</a>&nbsp; These thresholds are obviously significantly higher than those in Rule 14a-8.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31">[31]</a>&nbsp; Some commenters have raised the issue of whether submission thresholds established by a state are preempted by Rule 14a-8.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32">[32]</a></p>
<p>Two years ago, Commissioner Mark Uyeda addressed the concept of private ordering for shareholder proposals.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33">[33]</a>&nbsp; I agree with his view that &ldquo;[R]ule 14a-8&rsquo;s procedural bases for exclusion&hellip;should be viewed as default standards that apply only if companies decline to establish their own standards in their governing documents.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34">[34]</a>&nbsp; While Commissioner Uyeda&rsquo;s remarks were focused on standards contained in a company&rsquo;s governing documents, I see no difference if the standards are contained within a state&rsquo;s corporate law.</p>
<p>Shortly after the Commission adopted the original version of Rule 14a-8, then-SEC Chairman Ganson Purcell explained that &ldquo;[t]he right that [the rule is] endeavoring to assure to the stockholders are those rights that he has traditionally had under State law.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35">[35]</a>&nbsp; If a shareholder does not have a right to submit a proposal under state law&mdash;because it fails to satisfy requirements imposed by either state law or the company&rsquo;s governing documents&mdash;then what right is Rule 14a-8 assuring?</p>
<p>So, if a company has opted into the Texas law, or has otherwise properly established conditions in its governing documents, and receives a shareholder proposal from a proponent that does not satisfy the requirements in the Texas law or the governing documents, then the proposal should be excludable under paragraph (i)(1) of Rule 14a-8.</p>
<p align="center">***</p>
<p>While the interplay between paragraph (i)(1) and state corporate law&nbsp;<del cite="mailto:Mantell,%20Parker" datetime="2025-10-09T16:56">are&nbsp;</del><ins cite="mailto:Mantell,%20Parker" datetime="2025-10-09T16:56">is&nbsp;</ins>interesting, I believe a fundamental reassessment of Rule 14a-8 is in order.&nbsp; To that end, Shareholder Proposal Modernization is on the Commission&rsquo;s policy agenda,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36">[36]</a>&nbsp;and as part of this modernization effort, I have asked the staff to evaluate whether the Commission&rsquo;s original rationale for adopting Rule 14a-8 in 1942 still applies today, especially in light of developments in the proxy solicitation process and shareholder communications generally over the last 80 plus years.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37">[37]</a></p>
<p>Mindful that Section 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the &ldquo;Exchange Act&rdquo;), under which Rule 14a-8 is promulgated, is centrally concerned with disclosure,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38">[38]</a>&nbsp;the Commission should re-evaluate the rule&rsquo;s fundamental premise that shareholders should be able to force companies to solicit for their proposals&mdash;to the extent that a shareholder proposal is a proper subject for shareholder action under state law&mdash;at little or no expense to the shareholder.&nbsp; In fact, Chairman Purcell faced questions on this fundamental premise in a Congressional hearing over 80 years ago.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39">[39]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, it is only prudent for the Commission to review and reassess the original intent behind the rule and the role that it serves our capital markets today. &nbsp;Of course, the Commission must first propose changes, then gather and consider public feedback before adopting any changes.&nbsp; This process does not happen overnight.&nbsp; Until any changes are finalized, I encourage companies, shareholder proponents, and their advisors to consider the points that I have raised this evening.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40">[40]</a></p>

<p>Turning to my other topic for tonight&rsquo;s remarks&mdash;securities litigation reform and Delaware&rsquo;s role in it&mdash;while class action securities litigation can serve an important path for vindication of rights as well as a deterrence function,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41">[41]</a>&nbsp;meritless,&nbsp;<del cite="mailto:Mantell,%20Parker" datetime="2025-10-09T16:57">vexacious</del><ins cite="mailto:Mantell,%20Parker" datetime="2025-10-09T16:57">vexatious</ins>, or frivolous litigation also has the marginal effect of driving capital away from the U.S. public markets.<a name="_Ref210398121"></a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42">[42]</a>&nbsp; Press reports, conferences, and academic papers are replete with much commentary on this issue. &nbsp;It is incumbent on legislatures and regulators to ensure that their laws and rules are not being &ldquo;gamed&rdquo; or abused to support someone&rsquo;s business model. &nbsp;Reform may be needed to ensure that the &ldquo;cost&rdquo; of being a public company does not involve frivolous lawsuits and exorbitant plaintiffs attorneys&rsquo; fees masked as recoveries for shareholders.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43">[43]</a>&nbsp; All companies pay for these costs&mdash;even ones that are not subject to lawsuits&mdash;through increased D&amp;O insurance premiums.&nbsp; Absent federal legislative changes, states can have significant influence in shaping reform in securities litigation.&nbsp; Reform should not be equated with the elimination of lawsuits, but rather, it can mean providing companies with optionality for how best to resolve disputes with their shareholders.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, recent actions by the Delaware legislature suggest that the state is not only uninterested in reform, but instead, seems to embrace the litigation costs that abusive lawsuits impose on companies franchised in Delaware. &nbsp;As many of you in the room are aware, through Senate Bill 95 (&ldquo;SB 95&rdquo;), Delaware recently amended its General Corporation Law (the &ldquo;Corporation Law&rdquo;) with respect to a couple of matters related to intra-corporate affairs claims, which include federal securities law claims.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44">[44]</a>&nbsp; First, in permitting forum selection in Delaware for federal securities law claims, SB 95 also prohibited mandatory arbitration with respect to these claims.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45">[45]</a>&nbsp; Second, SB 95 extended the Corporation Law&rsquo;s prohibition on fee shifting to federal securities law claims.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46">[46]</a></p>
<p>I am disappointed by these two targets of SB 95.&nbsp; While mandatory arbitration and fee shifting are not without controversy,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47">[47]</a>&nbsp;they also have merits, including, with respect&nbsp;<ins cite="mailto:Mantell,%20Parker" datetime="2025-10-09T16:58">to&nbsp;</ins>mandatory arbitration, quicker payments to harmed shareholders and reduced litigation costs<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48">[48]</a>&mdash;and, with respect to fee shifting, fewer frivolous lawsuits.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49">[49]</a>&nbsp; Companies should have the ability to determine, after weighing the pros and cons, whether one, both, or neither of these provisions is appropriate for their business and shareholder base.</p>
<p>When the Commission articulated its views last month that mandatory arbitration provisions are not inconsistent with the federal securities laws,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50">[50]</a>&nbsp;I explained that the company, and not the Commission, should decide the particular method of resolving disputes with the company&rsquo;s shareholders.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51">[51]</a>&nbsp; Unfortunately, for public companies that consider mandatory arbitration to be a vital aspect of their dispute resolution strategy, SB 95 has effectively eliminated Delaware as an option for incorporation.</p>
<p>Turning to fee shifting, many of you here this evening are well aware of the history of fee shifting in the Delaware courts and legislature.&nbsp; In 2014, the Delaware Supreme Court held that the fee-shifting bylaw of ATP Tour, a non-stock corporation, was valid.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52">[52]</a>&nbsp; Within a year, more than 50 public companies adopted such bylaws.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53">[53]</a>&nbsp; However, in mid-2015, the Delaware legislature, through Senate Bill 75 (&ldquo;SB 75&rdquo;),<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54">[54]</a>&nbsp;declined to extend the&nbsp;<i>ATP</i>&nbsp;decision to stock corporations and instead, prohibited fee shifting for internal corporate claims.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55">[55]</a></p>
<p>Following SB 75, some commentators predicted an exodus of companies reincorporating to another state and the potential demise of Delaware as the leading state for corporate charters.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56">[56]</a>&nbsp; I was one who said at the time that SB 75 could be the proverbial straw that breaks the camel&rsquo;s back of Delaware&rsquo;s primacy as the chosen state of franchise.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57">[57]</a>&nbsp; Those predictions have not necessarily materialized over the past decade,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58">[58]</a>&nbsp;but the pressure on and alternatives to Delaware are growing.&nbsp; Moreover, this possibility of a &ldquo;DExit&rdquo; sprang back to life earlier this year, with one prominent venture capital firm publicly announcing its reasons for reincorporating in Nevada.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59">[59]</a></p>
<p>As part of an effort to halt &ldquo;DExit,&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60">[60]</a>&nbsp;Delaware passed Senate Bill 21 (&ldquo;SB 21&rdquo;) in March of this year to amend provisions of the Corporation Law related to controlling stockholder transactions and inspection of books and records.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-10092025-keynote-address-john-l-weinberg-center-corporate-governances-25th-anniversary-gala#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61">[61]</a>&nbsp; If SB 21 were one step forward by Delaware to modernize its Corporation Law, the prohibition of mandatory arbitration and fee shifting for federal securities law claims in SB 95 were two giant steps backward.</p>
<p>However, I recognize that SB 95 was developed and became law at a time when the Commission had not made its views on mandatory arbitration clear to the public.&nbsp; With the benefit of clarity under the federal securities laws, I hope that the Delaware legislature will revisit the prohibition of both mandatory arbitration and fee shifting with respect to federal securities law claims.&nbsp; Doing so can help Delaware be a leader in the reform of securities litigation.</p>
<p align="center">***</p>
<p>In closing, the declining number of public companies that I referenced at the outset of my remarks is not inevitable or irreversible. It is a signal that the costs of being a public company, coupled with the politicization of shareholder meetings, and ever-present specter of costly, frivolous litigation, have negatively impacted the vibrancy of our capital markets. Taken together, these forces have eroded American competitiveness; locked retail investors out of many of the most dynamic companies; and pushed entrepreneurs to seek capital elsewhere, either in the private markets or competing jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The chance to reverse these trends is well within your reach&mdash;and requires your renewed commitment to the principles that made the U.S. capital markets exceptional. For a quarter century, the Weinberg Center&rsquo;s scholarship and leadership have exemplified that commitment. The Center has left a profound imprint on corporate governance, and its legacy calls on everyone anew to reflect thoughtfully, but without delay, on how we can update rules and practices to better serve U.S. capital markets, investors, and business.</p>
<p>I commit that the SEC in the coming years will play its part, as well.&nbsp; We must do so to ensure that the American public capital markets remain the envy of the world through growth, vibrancy, innovation, and nimbleness.</p>
<p>The Weinberg Center has my sincere congratulations on attaining twenty-five years of achievement&mdash;and my gratitude, once again, for the privilege of celebrating them with you here tonight. It has been my pleasure speaking with you. You have been a very patient and indulgent audience, and I welcome your active involvement in the issues that I have raised for your consideration tonight.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<title>Comptroller Of The US Currency Issues Statement On Federal Reserve Board’s Action To Provide Clarity On Capital Instruments For Mutual Banking Organizations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Comptroller of the Currency Jonathan V. Gould issued the following statement today following the Federal Reserve Board&rsquo;s release of guidance to provide clarity on capital instruments for mutual banking organizations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The OCC commends the Federal Reserve Board for its recent action to support mutual banking organizations by providing clarification regarding mutual capital certificates and alternative mutual capital instruments. The OCC fully supports mutual banking organizations, including OCC-supervised federal mutual savings associations. The OCC recently authorized a federal mutual savings association to issue an innovative form of mutual capital certificate that qualifies as regulatory capital. This was the first approval for a mutual capital certificate for a federal mutual savings association in decades.</p>
<p>The OCC recognizes the unique role mutual banking organizations serve in their local communities and the challenges of raising capital. Community banks, including mutual banking organizations, play a critical role in lending to local communities and are vital to the strength of the U.S. economy. The OCC will continue to support OCC-supervised mutual savings associations by considering the specific needs of mutual associations through active engagement with the mutual industry.</p>

<title>Federal Reserve Board Announces Expanded Operating Days Of Two Large-Value Payments Services, Fedwire® Funds Service And The National Settlement Service (NSS), To Include Sundays And Weekday Holidays</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/federal-reserve-board-announces-expanded-operating-days-of-two-large-value-payme-2025109/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday announced expanded operating days of two large-value payments services, Fedwire<span>&reg;</span>&nbsp;Funds Service and the National Settlement Service (NSS), to include Sundays and weekday holidays. The Reserve Banks will implement this expansion in several years, no earlier than 2028 to ensure operational and industry readiness.</p>
<p>Currently, both the Fedwire Funds Service and NSS operate Monday through Friday, excluding holidays. Once the expansion announced today is implemented, the Reserve Banks will operate both services Sunday through Friday, including weekday holidays. The operating hours each day will remain the same, with the Fedwire Funds Service open 22 hours per day, and NSS open 21.5 hours per day.</p>
<p>Moving forward, the Board will monitor demand for a potential further expansion of operating hours to seven days per week. If the Board decides in the future to propose such an expansion, it will seek public comment in a new proposal.</p>
<p>The Fedwire Funds Service is a wholesale payment service that allows participating banks and credit unions to send and receive individual electronic funds transfers up to $10 billion. NSS is a settlement service for participants in private-sector clearing arrangements, such as check clearinghouses, a private-sector automated clearinghouse network, and securities settlement systems. The announcement does not include changes to the Fedwire Securities Service or the Federal Reserve's retail services including FedACH or FedNow<span>&reg;</span>&nbsp;Service.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As we wrap up today's conference, I would like to thank all of the moderators and presenters on today's panels. And of course, Secretary Bessent for sharing his perspectives on community banks, and the many community bankers, and state bank regulators and others who attended today's event in person or virtually. I would also like to recognize our staff whose hard work made today's conference possible.</p>
<p>Community banks drive local and regional economic growth, and they play a central role in the financial health of the customers and communities they serve.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20251009b.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;These banks often pursue unique business models&mdash;ones that are not easily replicated by larger banks, including the relationship banking model that is a central tenet of community banking. In today's environment, many community banks are embracing innovation and continuing to evolve to better serve their customers in the current and future financial system. The focus of today's conference has been on community banks, how they continue to innovate, and how they rise to the challenge to support their customers as the financial landscape continues to change.</p>
<p>Legislators and regulators are also rising to the challenge to ensure that the community banking system continues to thrive, through the critical task of ensuring that supervision and regulation are appropriately tailored. Our support for community banks cannot just be lip service; it must translate into specific actions that right-size regulation and apply appropriate supervisory standards, specifically in identifying the appropriate definition of a community bank, in establishing appropriately tailored regulatory thresholds, and in approaching supervision focused on material financial risk.</p>
<p>So, what is a community bank for this purpose? Generally, the regulatory framework uses the blunt tool of fixed asset thresholds. We know that relying solely on fixed asset thresholds is imperfect, at best. They fail to account for economic growth and inflation over time, resulting in firms with stable growth, consistent business models, and no change in risk profile crossing asset thresholds. These firms become subject to increasingly complex and burdensome regulatory requirements and supervisory expectations. This is clearly not the intended or desired outcome, in that crossing these fixed thresholds has the unintended consequence of "pushing down" standards designed for larger and more complex banks to smaller and less complex ones. Compounding this problem is the overlapping and inconsistent thresholds used to define banks of different sizes and engaged in different activities. We should ask whether this additional complexity is necessary or even helpful, and to what extent it impairs economic growth.</p>
<p>A simple fix would be for policymakers to adjust the community bank and other thresholds based on growth&mdash;and apply that adjusted threshold consistently&mdash;indexed to adjust for future growth. This approach would preserve the policy choice established when the threshold was initially set.</p>
<p>Defining a community bank is an important first step, but it is just that, a first step. The next question is how to appropriately tailor regulations for these and other firms. Over the years, I have supported an approach to regulation grounded in asking some simple&mdash;but critical&mdash;threshold questions. What problem does each new and existing regulation solve? What are the costs of this approach? And importantly, what alternative approaches are available? When we look back at existing regulations, we can clearly identify areas for improvement. For example, the community bank leverage ratio, or "CBLR," was designed as an optional&nbsp;<em>alternative&nbsp;</em>framework to risk-based capital requirements for community banks. A community bank that opts into the CBLR framework and complies with the established ratio is deemed to comply with risk-based capital requirements.</p>
<p>But if we look back at the history of the CBLR, the agencies approached the task of calibration primarily by evaluating how many banks would be eligible to opt in and calibrating the requirement to maintain the same high level of capital in this population of banks. In my view, this approach failed to achieve the relief Congress intended, and more fundamentally, failed to answer the critical questions we must consider in the rulemaking process.</p>
<p>Let me turn to another area that needs to be addressed, the applications process. This process can also negatively impact community banks. It requires banks to seek approval from the Federal Reserve and other state and federal regulators for regulatory permission to engage in a transaction or activity. But this process can be unpredictable in terms of timing and information necessary to be ripe for consideration and approval. The costs of delay can be significant, damaging the value of the target bank, creating uncertainty for bank employees and customers, and resulting in costly delays for critical systems, integration contracts, and service agreements, potentially damaging the reputation of both firms.</p>
<p>The remedy is simple&mdash;regulatory application review should be effective, timely, and efficient. Banks should have a clear understanding of the information they must provide to complete the application well in advance. The standards for approval must be clearly defined and available to the public. And regulators should be prepared to act on a complete application within the statutory time frames. We have an opportunity to take a new approach, and we are doing so. We cannot accept the opacity of the status quo, especially when the "fix" is as simple as clear standards, clear forms, and prompt attention to and action on applications.</p>
<p>One area where we have improved transparency relates to mutual bank capital, which I have spoken about a number of times. Yesterday, the Board issued a series of frequently asked questions and two templates for mutual banks to use as they consider engaging in raising capital. These provide options for mutual banks to issue capital instruments that could qualify as tier 1 common equity or as additional tier 1 equity. These approaches are just a start&mdash;we are open to further refinement and improvement once mutuals have an opportunity to review and work to implement this new approach.</p>
<p>I will conclude with a discussion about how we ensure that the supervisory process is appropriate for community banks. Regulators are once again working to incorporate "tailoring" to more effectively allocate supervisory and bank staffing resources. This allows the calibration of supervisory activities that are appropriate to a bank's size, risk, complexity, and business model. This approach is not new, but it has simply been ignored in recent years. Regulators have significant leeway in designing supervisory approaches, which may include issuing guidance that is technically non-binding but often plays a role similar to a regulatory requirement.</p>
<p>How do we address this problem?</p>
<p>First, through greater transparency. Supervisory practices often escape public and internal scrutiny. They are developed with little public input, and they are not subject to public notice and comment requirements under the Administrative Procedure Act. Supervisory practices are not scrutinized after an exam because of the activity's designation as "confidential supervisory information" (CSI). "CSI" includes a broad array of bank and supervisory materials and actions taken in an exam context. The Fed continues to revise and redirect our supervisory practices, including the shift in focus toward material financial risk. These efforts would be most effective if accompanied by revisions to the definition and scope of CSI, which would promote greater public transparency and accountability.</p>
<p>Second, calibration of supervisory standards. Supervisory findings inform bank ratings, which can have follow-on effects like limiting options for mergers and acquisitions activity; raising the cost of liquidity; or diverting resources away from other, more important bank management priorities. We need to ensure that supervisory practices are appropriately calibrated so that a bank's supervisory ratings reflect its financial condition and material financial risks.</p>
<p><span>Closing Thoughts</span><br />Before we close out today's conference, I would like to again thank all of our attendees, both those here with us and those online. We appreciate the continued support for community banks across the United States. I would especially like to thank the community bankers who work tirelessly to support their customers, businesses, and local economies. Thank you for joining us today.</p>
<p>In my role as the Vice Chair for Supervision, my responsibilities extend across banks of all sizes, from the largest GSIB to a single-branch community bank operating in an underserved rural market. The Fed's regulatory and supervisory approaches to this wide range of firms must be tailored to address the unique characteristics of each type and size of institution. A one-size-fits-all approach that pushes down requirements from the larger banks to the smallest ones results in overregulation and excessive supervision that is not appropriate for the size, risk, complexity, and business model of community banks. Today, we have the opportunity to right-size the frameworks for each size of institution, and I look forward to working together with my colleagues at the FDIC and OCC to accomplish this goal, through sensible reforms and more appropriate supervisory approaches.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>&nbsp;The Alberta Securities Commission (ASC), Edmonton Police Foundation (EPF) and Edmonton Police Service (EPS), today announced the winner of the ScamShield: Investor Protection Challenge. First place has been awarded to Stingray Security, a Canadian company, for its product that identifies risky website links and blocks potential threats in real time before they can do harm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prompted by the devastating impacts of fraud and scams, the ASC, EPF and EPS&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asc.ca/en/News-and-Publications/News-Releases/2024/09/sept-04-New-challenge-seeks-to-tackle-online-crypto-investment-fraud-with-innovation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">partnered in 2024</a>&nbsp;to launch the ScamShield: Investor Protection Challenge to find new and innovative solutions to tackle online crypto investment fraud. Fraudsters use a variety of tools, like AI-driven scams, fake investment platforms, deepfake social media content, paired with psychological tactics, such as romance scams, and financial grooming to deceive investors and cause harm. The challenge received more than 30 submissions, with&nbsp;<a href="https://stingray.security/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stingray Security</a>&nbsp;selected as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asc.ca/en/News-and-Publications/News-Releases/2025/01/28-Investor-Protection-Challenge-selected-to-move-forward" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one of two top concepts</a>&nbsp;to move forward in development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stingray Security protects users beyond identifying online crypto investment scams. Using in-browser technology, it flags and blocks phishing websites, fake investment platforms, and other malicious scams in real time. Stingray Security is available free of charge and can be downloaded in the Google Chrome Web Store.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm thrilled to see this innovation coming out of our Community Solutions Accelerator,&rdquo; said Ashif Mawji, EPF Board Member. &ldquo;The ScamShield: Investor Protection Challenge highlights our commitment to combatting financial fraud and fostering safe online environments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Online investment scams have emerged as a preferred method for fraudsters, exploiting the public&rsquo;s limited experience in the fast-changing world of digital finance,&rdquo; said Chief Innovation and Technology Officer Ron Anderson with the Edmonton Police Service Innovation and Information Bureau. &ldquo;These crimes are far from victimless &ndash; behind every fraudulent scheme are hardworking individuals whose savings have been compromised. As law enforcement, our mission goes beyond holding perpetrators accountable, we must also build public confidence in the integrity of our financial systems. The Stingray Security solution is another powerful tool that investors can use to safeguard themselves and avoid becoming victims of these devastating crimes.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Canadians lost approximately $310 million to investment scams in 2024, according to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre, and we know that the incidence of fraud is trending upward among many demographics,&rdquo; said Hilary McMeekin, Director of Communications &amp; Investor Education with the ASC. &ldquo;The ASC recognizes that stopping online investment fraud requires a comprehensive approach and we are pleased that Stingray Security will be another tool available to help investors spot the red flags of fraud and avoid potential harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone deserves to feel safe online. We built Stingray so anyone can start using state-of-the-art protection in seconds whether at work, at home, or to protect loved ones &ndash; all for free,&rdquo; says Ian MacKinnon, Stingray&rsquo;s co-founder and Chief Technology Officer. &ldquo;We have heard from people who want to protect technology used by parents, grandparents and children, giving peace of mind. We have also heard from employers who want to use Stingray at work, ensuring cost-effective safety for employees without requiring technical expertise. The AI renaissance has enabled us to deliver this online safety tool, and we&rsquo;re going to continue to evolve to build on that protection.&rdquo;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/canadian-securities-regulators-provide-temporary-relief-from-requirements-for-de-2025109/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) is providing temporary relief from requirements to deliver proxy-related materials for shareholder meetings in respect of certain annual matters during the postal service suspension. Such relief recognizes that the suspension of postal service may impact a reporting issuer&rsquo;s ability to deliver proxy-related materials to all shareholders.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The relief only addresses requirements under securities legislation and does not extend to delivery obligations under corporate law. The CSA continues to expect that reporting issuers, intermediaries and all other parties involved in the proxy-voting process will work collaboratively during the postal service suspension and take all reasonable steps to facilitate the voting process. This includes using alternate delivery methods where available and taking other measures to increase transparency to shareholders regarding how to access proxy materials, obtain individual control numbers and vote.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The terms of the relief are outlined in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asc.ca/-/media/ASC-Documents-part-1/Regulatory-Instruments/2025/10/6227198-CSA-Notice-Coordinated-Blanket-Order-51-932.pdf">Coordinated Blanket Order 51-932</a>&nbsp;<em>Temporary Exemption from requirements in National Instrument 51-102 Continuous Disclosure Obligations&nbsp;</em>and<em>&nbsp;National Instrument 54-101 Communication with Beneficial Owners of Securities of a Reporting Issuer to send certain proxy-related materials during a postal strike</em>. Reporting issuers should carefully review all the conditions and requirements in the coordinated blanket order.</p>
<p>The CSA has also published a CSA notice to provide additional guidance about the relief as well as information about circumstances where the relief cannot be relied upon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reporting issuers or shareholders who have questions should contact their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/about/contact-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">local securities regulator</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CSA, the council of the securities regulators of Canada&rsquo;s provinces and territories, co-ordinates and harmonizes regulation for the Canadian capital markets.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good morning. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s an honor to be with you today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the government is still shut down because members of the Senate refuse to support the clean government funding bill, which was passed by the House weeks ago.&nbsp; Across the Trump Administration, we are eager to get the government reopened so agencies can continue the work of the American people.&nbsp; This morning, I wish to focus on how we can better serve the American people, and the important role community banks play in that effort.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>To begin, I would like to express my appreciation to Vice Chair Bowman for arranging this conference.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She and I are committed to protecting the role of community banks in our financial system.&nbsp; This conference is a testament to that commitment.</p>
<p>As you all know better than most, regulation has gradually suffocated the banks that are closest to the men and women who work the jobs, pay the bills, and take out the loans that fuel growth in small-town America&mdash;banks that not only know their customers by name but also their financial hopes and dreams.&nbsp;In other words, banks like yours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To reverse course, early this year, I called for a fundamental reset of financial regulation.&nbsp; No longer will regulation serve to entrench big banks and empower Washington bureaucrats to the detriment of community banks and the clients they serve.&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Trump has charted a new course for our economy&mdash;one that strengthens both the shop floor and the trading floor.&nbsp; This is the era of Parallel Prosperity, where Main Street and Wall Street grow&nbsp;<em>together</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And who will turn this vision into reality?&nbsp; The men and women in this room.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Community bankers are laying the foundation for America&rsquo;s Golden Age&mdash;one loan, one family, and one small business at a time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My job as Treasury Secretary is to make it easier for you to do your job.&nbsp;To that end, we have worked hard the first eight months of this Administration to empower community banks to take back control of their own future.</p>
<p>This morning, I will discuss&nbsp;<em>why</em>&nbsp;the Trump Administration has sought to empower community banks,&nbsp;<em>how</em>&nbsp;we have done it, and&nbsp;<em>where</em>&nbsp;we go from here.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The President&rsquo;s Vision for Community Banks&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>First, why.</p>
<p>Community banks are&nbsp;essential to America&rsquo;s heartland.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They provide the capital that binds small towns together: Community banks make the charitable contribution for the new playground.&nbsp; They make the loans for small businesses, farmers, and first-time home buyers.&nbsp; They employ local leaders and teach financial literacy in our schools.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parallel Prosperity, as I mentioned before, is the idea that Main Street and Wall Street can grow together.&nbsp; And community banks play an instrumental role in&nbsp;driving growth on the Main Street side of the ledger.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To expand opportunity for all Americans, the banks that serve Main Street must have the same chance to succeed as the banks that serve Wall Street.&nbsp;But the post-crisis regulatory framework has instead become a threat to the community bank model.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since 2010, we&rsquo;ve lost 3,600 community banks, a reduction of over 45 percent.&nbsp; Community banks&rsquo; share of bank assets has fallen from 23 percent to 15 percent.&nbsp;Their share of outstanding bank loans has fallen from 27 percent to 20 percent.&nbsp; Their share of outstanding bank CRE loans has fallen from 52 percent to 41 percent.&nbsp; This represents an acceleration of trends that pre-date the 2008 financial crisis.&nbsp;And in a disturbing new development, de novo chartering has&nbsp;dropped precipitously, averaging just 6 new banks per year since 2010.&nbsp;For comparison, in the years prior to 2008, there were 100-plus new banks chartered each year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The post-crisis framework has left a trail of destruction in its wake by reinforcing the larger economic dynamics that have hollowed out the American heartland while enriching the money centers in coastal cities.</p>
<p>To be clear, the financial crisis underscored the need for new regulations.&nbsp; The purpose of Dodd-Frank was to end &ldquo;too big to fail.&rdquo;&nbsp; But it ended up creating &ldquo;too small to succeed.&rdquo;&nbsp; These new regulations entrenched the dominance of the largest banks by rewarding economies of scale and necessitating effective lobbying operations in Washington.&nbsp; What followed was a community bank bottleneck that left America&rsquo;s hometowns reeling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Trump and this administration have seen what the heavy hand of government has done to community banks and the families you serve.&nbsp;And he has set out to fix it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why?&nbsp; Because we know that the Main Street revival starts with a community bank comeback.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Progress Report&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>How have we positioned community banks to succeed?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the early wins.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just days after President Trump was sworn into office, the Administration began rolling back the regulatory excesses of the Biden years.&nbsp;The regulators ended the politicized use of reputation risk in supervision.&nbsp; They proposed to rescind an embarrassingly complicated 60,000-word Community Reinvestment Act rule.&nbsp; And they retracted a merger policy statement that was both bad policy and bad law.</p>
<p>The previous Administration pushed for rules and guidance that micromanaged corporate governance, entangled the bank regulators in climate-risk management, unduly restricted brokered deposits, precluded responsible bank innovation in crypto and other blockchain technologies, and imposed arbitrary restrictions on incentive compensation.&nbsp; These Biden-era proposals were bad for banks, bad for business, and bad for America.&nbsp; So President Trump slashed all of them.</p>
<p>To&nbsp;restore the strength of community banks, the new Administration has replaced this old, draconian agenda with a new, more constructive agenda.</p>
<p>The FDIC, for example, has recommitted to tailoring by proposing to raise and index asset thresholds.&nbsp; It has streamlined examination procedures and branch applications.&nbsp; And it has started work to reestablish a supervisory appeals body.</p>
<p>Not to be outdone, the OCC has implemented its own reforms.&nbsp; Comptroller Gould has been on the job for only 12 weeks.&nbsp;But he has already reduced assessments on smaller banks by 30 percent, reversed the plan to merge community bank supervision into large bank supervision, and replaced community banks&rsquo; formulaic examination schedules with a more risk-based approach.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vice Chair Bowman, meanwhile, has long advocated for revisiting the community bank leverage ratio.&nbsp; I expect that effort will soon culminate in a proposed reduction in the community bank leverage ratio.</p>
<p>The CFPB, for its part, has started to revamp the Section 1071 reporting requirements and reconsider the open banking rule.&nbsp; And it has withdrawn more than 60 interpretive rules and other guidance documents.</p>
<p>Following the Administration&rsquo;s example, Congress has also taken up the effort.&nbsp;It has nullified the CFPB&rsquo;s overdraft rule and prohibited the furnishing of mortgage-related trigger leads.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The House Financial Services Committee has likewise advanced two dozen important reforms to community bank regulation, while the Senate Banking Committee held a hearing and hopefully will soon mark-up an expansion of FDIC insurance on noninterest-bearing transaction accounts.</p>
<p>There is still much to look forward to on the regulatory front.&nbsp; This includes two new proposals that will reset the culture of supervision.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two days ago, the FDIC and the OCC proposed a rule that would codify the recently adopted prohibition on using reputation risk as a basis for supervisory criticism.</p>
<p>The FDIC and the OCC also proposed a rule that would define &ldquo;unsafe or unsound practice or condition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While simply defining a term might seem like a small thing, it&nbsp;marks a big step forward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only in the world of unaccountable regulators could a key concept have gone undefined for so long.&nbsp; The past failure to define this term led to supervisory criticisms focused on processes or documentation related to governance, model management, and third-party risk management.&nbsp; In other words, topics that often had little or nothing to do with a bank&rsquo;s actual financial condition.&nbsp; This regulatory myopia was the driving force behind the spring 2023 bank failures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once finalized, a clear focus on material financial risk will put an end to this nonsense.</p>
<p>I am also optimistic about AML/CFT reform.&nbsp; In my meetings with community bankers, they list CTR filings, structuring SARs, and process-focused examinations among their top concerns.</p>
<p>Today, FinCEN released FAQs to address pain points on some of these issues, including triggers for structuring SARs, continuing activity reviews, and the absence of any requirement to document a decision not to file a SAR.&nbsp; These are commonsense yet consequential reforms that will ease regulatory burdens without undermining law enforcement efforts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of our broader&nbsp;campaign to modernize illicit finance regulation, FinCEN and the bank regulators are hard at work on a new rule to define the requirements for an effective AML/CFT program.&nbsp; My expectation is that a proposal will re-center supervision where it should be: on the effectiveness of a bank&rsquo;s AML/CFT program.&nbsp; I likewise expect that that proposal will position FinCEN as a gatekeeper for AML/CFT enforcement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will be a significant departure from the past, with its zero-tolerance focus on process and documentation and wide latitude for supervisory expectations and judgments that are not always consistent with the law or our national security priorities.&nbsp; A focus on higher value activities will also better serve our law enforcement and national security objectives.</p>
<p><span>The Road Ahead</span></p>
<p>These are all important victories, to be sure.&nbsp; But much work remains.&nbsp; So where do we go from here?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Going forward, Treasury will continue to drive reforms to improve regulatory tailoring, re-focus the culture of supervision, and modernize our illicit finance regulation.</p>
<p>Specific priorities will include: reforms to the rating system; new processes for monitoring examiners&rsquo; compliance with supervisory policy; mechanisms for independent appeals of supervisory criticisms; coordination to avoid duplicative examinations by different regulators; and a review of the core platform providers, including contract terms that prevent community banks from innovating for the future.</p>
<p>For community banks to go back on the offensive, we need to take a closer look at the dynamics that have undermined the community bank model&mdash;and work to fix them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To that end, as I have said before, Treasury is focused on ensuring that modernization of our capital framework ends the capital arbitrage that drives bank lending to nonbanks.&nbsp; This will likely entail reduced capital requirements for large banks on mortgage loans, investment-grade corporate loans, and some other important exposures.&nbsp;We must therefore ensure parity by giving smaller banks at least the option to benefit from those reduced requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Treasury has also supported congressional efforts to modernize the deposit insurance framework.&nbsp; I am encouraged to see emerging bipartisan support for increasing FDIC insurance limits on noninterest-bearing transaction accounts.</p>
<p>In addition to these efforts, Treasury is taking an informed and careful approach to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.&nbsp; Any actions on the GSEs must not increase borrowing costs and must preserve what works in the current system.&nbsp; That includes the prohibition on volume-based discounts for large lenders, as well as the cash window and other features that preserve equal secondary market access for small lenders.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Conclusion</span></p>
<p>Now allow me to close with a call to action.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before President Trump took office, community banks spent decades on defense.</p>
<p>But under President Trump&rsquo;s leadership, the game has changed.&nbsp; The playing field will be more even.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ball is in your hands again.&nbsp; What happens next is up to you.</p>
<p>So my advice?&nbsp; Go on offense.&nbsp; Retake market share.&nbsp; Chase after customers.&nbsp; Champion technology.&nbsp; Leverage the new regulatory landscape to your advantage.&nbsp; And expand your role in the American economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The community bank comeback will help pave the way for America&rsquo;s Golden Age.&nbsp; Recognize the outsize role you play in this effort.&nbsp; And embrace it.&nbsp; Because if you lead the way, Main Street will follow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you to the Economic Club of Minnesota for the opportunity to speak to you today.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20251009a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;I'm happy to be here for several reasons, one of which is that I have roots in Minnesota. My grandmother was born and raised in Eveleth, where her parents ran a small clothing store they opened in 1906 to serve the growing population that came here in the iron ore mining boom of that era. That generation's hard work and dreams of a better future helped build this great state as well as the prosperous economy that this club and the Federal Reserve are both dedicated to fostering.</p>
<p>We are midway between the last meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and our next meeting at the end of this month. At our last meeting in September, we decided to reduce the policy rate by 25 basis points, a decision I supported. My FOMC colleagues and I also updated our projections for the economic outlook for the next couple of years and gave our assessments of the likely appropriate policy rate path as economic conditions evolve. In my remarks today, I will share my own thinking related to those decisions last month, and how incoming data and other developments have subsequently shaped my views as we head into the FOMC's next meeting in three weeks. That includes the economic implications of various developments in Washington including the federal government shutdown, which I imagine is on the minds of many of you today.</p>
<p>We are currently in a challenging position, because the risks to both sides of the FOMC's mandate&mdash;employment and inflation&mdash;are elevated. I agree with Chair Powell's succinct view that there is no risk-free path forward for monetary policy. While inflation has come down a great deal since 2021, it is still above our 2 percent target and is now rising. And although several data points indicate that the labor market may be roughly in balance, we also know there has been a sharp drop in job creation since May, which suggests risks to the labor market going forward. The most difficult circumstances for making monetary policy decisions are when both mandate variables are at risk.</p>
<p>Let me start with inflation. The latest data show that 12-month headline inflation based on personal consumption expenditures (PCE) rose again in August to 2.7 percent. Core PCE inflation, which has historically been a good guide to future inflation, was 2.9 percent. After falling from its high of 7.2 percent in mid-2022 to 2.3 percent in April of this year, PCE inflation has been rising since then.</p>
<p>That timing is no coincidence. Research by Federal Reserve staff and others indicates that the increase in inflation since April has likely owed largely to the sharp increase in tariffs that kicked in around then. There are various measures of the overall level of tariffs. For assessing how tariffs are affecting inflation, I find it helpful to look at tariff collections relative to imports, which gives us a measure of the real effective tariff rate paid as goods come into the country. This rate has risen sharply this year, reaching about 11 percent in August, and is likely to rise further in the near term.</p>
<p>The tariff hikes have boosted core goods inflation, and at the same time progress on core services inflation has stalled. I expect that core PCE inflation will end the year over 3 percent.</p>
<p>The median FOMC participant estimates that headline PCE inflation will not return to our 2 percent target until the end of 2027, more than two years from today and six and a half years since inflation began rising in 2021. This would be the longest period of PCE inflation above 2 percent since a seven-year stretch that ended in 1993. I recognize that the economy and the American people have been hit by a series of unusual economic shocks in recent years&mdash;the COVID-19 pandemic and related shutdowns, disrupted supply chains for goods and labor shortages, higher energy costs from Russia's war on Ukraine, and the sudden increase in tariffs this year. Even so, after the high inflation Americans have endured, two more years would be a long time to wait for a return to our target, and that possibility weighs on my judgment for appropriate monetary policy.</p>
<p>I am also concerned about further upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations. While the immediate effects of tariffs on inflation have been smaller than most economic forecasters had expected, the inventories built up in anticipation of the tariffs may have had a role in easing the immediate impact, as have compressed profit margins. While that is good news for inflation, the corresponding bad news is that firms will eventually run down those inventories and will only be able to compress margins for a while. Many importers, and firms affected by imports, are reporting that they are waiting as long as possible to pass on the costs from tariffs to their customers, mostly by temporarily reducing profit margins.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20251009a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;Normalizing margins over time implies a gradual, but longer, upward trajectory for inflation, a pattern of price increases that I fear could convince many consumers that higher inflation is going to be more of a permanent phenomenon. This is important because expectations of future inflation affect spending decisions in the near term and can drive a cycle of escalating inflation, as we saw after prices began rising in 2021.</p>
<p>With that experience in mind, I am skeptical of assurances that we should fully "look through" higher inflation from import tariffs. While, in principle, tariffs are a one-time increase in prices and should not sustainably raise inflation, that may not be the case if prices keep rising month after month and affect expectations. There has been nothing "one-time" or predictable about these tariff increases, which have ratcheted upward this year on particular countries and particular sectors in a series of steps. At some point, businesses and consumers could start to make pricing, spending, and wage decisions based on their belief in higher future inflation, thereby driving a cycle of persistence. Measures of near-term inflation expectations are down from peaks in April when tariffs were announced, but they are still higher than last year.</p>
<p>As a result, I believe the Federal Reserve's price stability goal faces significant risks. That said, there are some factors that mitigate these risks. In particular, the softer labor market could help keep inflation in check by making it harder for workers to bargain for higher wages even if people expect their cost of living to increase, and by making it harder for businesses to fully pass through price increases to consumers. In addition, the more gradual effect of tariffs on prices has not, to date, led to the type of supply chain dislocations that can have pronounced second-round effects on inflation. Also, longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.</p>
<p>So let's turn to the labor market. While we do not have the full complement of labor market data because the government shutdown has delayed the Bureau of Labor Statistics' employment report, we do know that the payroll services firm ADP found that private-sector employment shrank last month, in keeping with a slowdown in job creation since May. Part of the slowing surely reflects developments on the supply side&mdash;from both reduced net immigration and somewhat reduced labor force participation&mdash;but it is unclear exactly how much. As a result, it is challenging to gauge exactly how much labor demand has softened. Growth in labor supply has declined significantly, with perhaps as many as a million fewer people in the workforce than would have been expected based on the typical pattern of immigration that prevailed in the years prior to the pandemic. With a reduced supply of labor, what constitutes a healthy growth rate for employment would be smaller. One can see that slower labor supply growth has been an important factor in the weaker job creation, because over the period that job gains have slowed significantly, the unemployment rate has only edged up to 4.3 percent, a level typically associated with a sound labor market.</p>
<p>Other measures suggest that labor supply and demand remain in the same rough balance they have been in for more than a year. The ratio of job openings to the number of people looking for work is around 1, the level that has persisted since about the middle of 2024. Likewise, the rate of people losing their jobs is running at the same rate that it has for the past two and a half years, and there is no sign of an impending jump in the unemployment rate in the weekly reports of new claims for unemployment insurance. That said, even if the labor market is still roughly in balance, the fact that this balance is being achieved from simultaneous slowing in labor supply growth and in hiring suggests that the labor market is more vulnerable to negative shocks.</p>
<p>In addition, despite the low and relatively steady unemployment rate, household perceptions of the labor market have deteriorated and are below the level they reached in the strong labor market immediately before the pandemic. According to the New York Fed's survey of consumers, people's perceptions of their chance of finding a new job if they lost their current job fell sharply in August to the lowest reading since the survey started in June 2013. It rebounded somewhat in September, but remained at levels seen in 2013, when the labor market was weak. Also, components of the workforce that are usually an early indication of cyclical changes in the labor market have deteriorated. The unemployment rate for Black or African American workers, which reached a historic low in 2023, is back to its highest level since the pandemic. Unemployment rates for younger workers are also up.</p>
<p>One reason I take these signals seriously is that experience shows that when labor markets turn down, it can happen suddenly. With job growth near zero for the past several months, the labor market could decline precipitously if the economy is hit with another shock. Growth in gross domestic product (GDP) has slowed significantly this year; however, earlier concerns of a continued slowdown seem to be fading. After a negative reading in the first quarter, real GDP grew at a 3.8 percent rate in the second quarter&mdash;smoothing through to a rate of 1.6 percent for the first half of the year. Strong spending and other data for the third quarter indicate that GDP remained strong last quarter. While I expect that tariffs and lower labor supply have weighed on growth and will continue to do so, I do not yet see significant risks in the growth data, though I remain attuned to risks from a variety of factors. It is hard to judge at this point whether the federal government shutdown will leave a noticeable imprint on economic growth, because we don't know how long it will last, and whether it may result in sustained changes in government spending. Based on past shutdowns, it is most likely that a shutdown would reduce GDP growth in the quarter in which it occurs and then boost growth in the subsequent quarter by the same amount.</p>
<p>As I said earlier, this economic outlook, and the associated uncertainties that underlie it, pose challenges for judging the correct stance of monetary policy as well as the appropriate path forward, given that the risks to achieving both components of our mandate are elevated.</p>
<p>With the easing in output growth and the likelihood of tariffs and labor supply weighing on the economy in the months ahead, we need to be prepared for the possibility that the softening in the labor market will become something worse, especially if there is a further adverse shock to demand.</p>
<p>At the same time, inflation, which made steady progress last year toward the FOMC's 2 percent goal, has moved up in 2025, especially after the sharp increase in tariffs, which keep rising. I have laid out my reasons for believing that the so far modest impact of tariffs on inflation probably means a much longer-lasting rachet upward, potentially affecting expectations in a way that makes the job of taming inflation harder.</p>
<p>In balancing and managing these risks to the FOMC's goals, I supported the Committee's decision on September 17 to lower the federal funds rate by 25 basis points. Monetary policy was and remains modestly restrictive, so it seemed to me appropriate to move the rate a bit closer toward neutral, pending more data and further developments on the economy, the forecast, and the balance of risks. Since that meeting, we have learned that consumer spending has been on a notably stronger trajectory than previously indicated, leading most observers to revise up estimates of spending and GDP growth for the rest of the year. We also got confirmation that PCE inflation moved up as expected, and that core inflation remains well above the FOMC's target. Another development was the announcement of new tariffs on imports of heavy trucks, medicine, and furniture.</p>
<p>There was, and remains, considerable uncertainty about the future course of the economy. It is possible that recent low payroll growth is a harbinger of worse to come, or that payroll growth eventually strengthens, consistent with the low unemployment rate and sound growth. It is possible that tariffs will have only a modest impact on the course of prices and that progress resumes toward 2 percent inflation next year, but it is also possible that both inflation and expectations of future inflation escalate.</p>
<p>Common sense would indicate that when there is a lot of uncertainty, one should move cautiously. This is validated by past monetary policymaking experience, and a particular research insight from nearly 60 years ago. The Brainard principle, developed by economist William Brainard, holds that when there is considerable uncertainty about the consequences of a policy action, the recommended course is to move more gradually than would otherwise be the case.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20251009a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;I believe that principle applies now, and that the FOMC should be cautious about adjusting policy so that we can gather further data, update our forecasts, and better assess the balance of risks. If we see inflation moving further away from our target, then it may be necessary to keep policy at least modestly restrictive for longer. If we see heightened risks in the labor market, then we may need to move more quickly to ease policy. The FOMC can, and I believe would, act forcefully to stabilize the economy if necessary.</p>
<p>I think a cautious approach will help us to balance the risks to both sides of our mandate as we continue to assess the economic outlook.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published a Report on tackling money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF) risks in crypto-asset services, including issuance, trading, and service provision. The Report draws on lessons learnt from recent supervisory cases across the EU and highlights how competent authorities can strengthen their approaches to supervision in this fast-evolving sector.</span></p>
<p>The EBA has played a key role in strengthening the AML/CFT regulatory and supervisory framework for crypto-assets in the EU since 2018, when certain crypto-asset businesses were first brought within the EU framework. Through continuous engagement and cooperation with national supervisors, the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs), and third-country authorities, the EBA has gathered critical insights into the operations and risks of crypto-asset businesses, both before and after the implementation of the &nbsp;Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA). This has enabled the EBA to identify significant AML/CFT vulnerabilities across the sector and to provide targeted guidance to improve compliance and oversight.</p>
<p>The Report is intended to inform supervisory approaches to the authorisation and oversight of crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) and issuers and to strengthen AML/CFT frameworks. It summarises lessons learnt from actions taken by competent authorities and the EBA in identifying and managing ML/TF risks associated with crypto-asset businesses, both prior to and immediately after the implementation of the new regulatory framework. It also describes strategies used by some CASPs and issuers to sidestep national AML/CFT supervision, highlights the safeguards introduced by MiCA and the revised AML/CFT regime, and identifies key elements that will underpin the effective application of the new EU framework.</p>
<p>By consolidating these findings, the Report supports the effective implementation of MiCA and the enhanced AML/CFT framework, while promoting a robust and forward-looking approach to tackling financial crime risks in the sector.</p>
<p><span>Legal basis, background</span></p>
<p>Under Article 1(5) of the EBA Founding Regulation, the EBA has a general objective to ensure the integrity of financial markets and preventing the use of the financial system for the purposes of ML/TF. In the context of Article 8 (1) (1), the EBA shall do so by promoting consistent, efficient and effective application of legislative acts with regard to the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of ML/TF.</p>
<p>For that purpose, Article 9a gives the EBA a leading, coordinating and monitoring role in promoting integrity, transparency and security in the financial system. Article 31(1) of the EBA Regulation provides for the EBA a coordination role between competent authorities where adverse developments could potentially jeopardise the orderly functioning and integrity of financial markets or the stability of the financial system in the Union. Also, Article 31(2), point (ea) of that Regulation requires the EBA to take appropriate measures to coordinate actions undertaken by relevant competent authorities with a view to facilitating the entry into the market of actors or products relying on technological innovation.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li>European System of Central Banks publicly reaffirms commitment to updated FX Global Code</li>
<li>Code promotes robust, fair, liquid, open and appropriately transparent foreign exchange market</li>
<li>Code first published in 2017 and updated in December 2024</li>
</ul>
<p>The European System of Central Banks (ESCB) welcomes the latest update of the FX Global Code, published in December 2024. Initially published in 2017, the FX Global Code outlines global principles of good practice in the foreign exchange market, promoting integrity, effective functioning and high ethical standards. The Global Foreign Exchange Committee has updated the Code twice, in July 2021 and December 2024, to keep it relevant and aligned with the evolving foreign exchange market, and will continue to set the standard for good market practice. Well-functioning financial markets benefit all market participants and are important to central banks as they enable the smooth transmission of monetary policy to the real economy, ultimately benefiting the public at large.</p>
<p>All ESCB members, including the European Central Bank (ECB), have today renewed their Statements of Commitment to the Code. This demonstrates their strong commitment to adhere to its principles when acting as foreign exchange market participants, aligning their internal practices and processes with the updated principles and supporting broader adherence to the Code. With these Statements of Commitment, they underscore the importance of the Code&rsquo;s principles in ensuring the continued integrity and effective functioning of the foreign exchange market. The EU central banks urge all foreign exchange market participants in their jurisdictions to review the updated Code and renew their Statements of Commitment to support its objectives.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<ul class="ecb-small">
<li>The FX Global Code and related adherence mechanism materials can be found on&nbsp;<a class="link-inline external" href="https://www.globalfxc.org/">www.globalfxc.org</a>. The Code was first published in 2017 and received the&nbsp;<a class="link-inline arrow" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2017/html/ecb.pr171129_2.en.html">support of the ECB and ESCB national central banks</a>.</li>
<li>The ESCB comprises the ECB and the national central banks of all EU Member States.</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Switzerland&ndash;UK Financial Dialogue took place in Berne on 9 October 2025. This is the second financial dialogue to take place since the negotiations of the Berne Financial Services Agreement (BFSA) concluded in December 2023. Officials from HM Treasury and the State Secretariat for International Finance were joined by representatives from the respective supervisory authorities, including the Bank of England (BoE), Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), Swiss National Bank (SNB), and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).</p>
<p>The discussions emphasised the close and ongoing cooperation between Switzerland and the UK in financial services and focused on five main themes: (1) the economic outlook; (2) regulatory developments; (3) sustainable finance; (4) market access, including the remaining implementation elements of the BFSA; and (5) innovation.</p>
<p>The dialogue opened with a review of the Swiss, UK and global macroeconomic outlooks. Participants examined recent economic trends and market developments. Both parties shared their objective to deliver sustainable economic growth and recognised the role of stability and predictability in the financial services sector to bolster this. This includes continuing efforts to strengthen our international partnerships to enhance cross-border trade flows and shaping international standards as a driver for growth. Both sides presented updates on their priorities in multilateral fora.</p>
<p>Both sides expressed their support for multilateralism and recognized the importance of strong prudential standards for banks in safeguarding financial stability. They exchanged views on the Swiss parameters for strengthening the too big to fail regime and the proposed amendments to its legislative framework. Switzerland also presented its implementation of the final Basel III framework with effect from 1 January 2025, and the UK reaffirmed their commitment to the implementation of the Basel III framework. The UK set out Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey&rsquo;s priorities as Financial Stability Board (FSB) Chair. These include continuing the work to mitigate risks from the Non-Banks Financial Institution (NBFI) sector, and the importance of effective surveillance tools to identify vulnerabilities in the financial system. &nbsp;</p>
<p>On sustainable finance, Switzerland and the UK discussed current initiatives in their jurisdictions. Both explained their approach to sustainability reporting standards, including transition planning, and transition finance, and updates to their supervisory approaches.</p>
<p>On the BFSA, the finance ministries presented the progress made on the outstanding implementation steps. They welcomed the signing of the BFSA Memorandum of Understanding by FINMA, BoE and FCA and agreed on the establishment of the Joint Committee and the procedures for regulatory cooperation. FINMA and the FCA reported on their work to finalise supervisory guidance, which will be published in early November. All participants took note of ongoing industry events and reaffirmed their commitment to complete the remaining steps as quickly as possible in order to allow the agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2026. Participants also discussed potential opportunities to further develop the agreement.</p>
<p>Participants also exchanged views on regulatory developments including capital market reforms, senior management regimes, and the regulatory treatment of tokenised assets, stablecoins and other crypto-assets. On innovation, participants shared information on respective work to advance digital asset innovation, including in capital markets and payments.</p>
<p>The two sides agreed to hold the next Financial Dialogue in the second half of 2026. They also agreed to continue regular exchanges at working level and underlined the importance of maintaining an open and constructive dialogue.</p>
<p>The Dialogue was followed by an industry-led UK-Switzerland business roundtable on 9 October with participation from industry representatives.</p>

<title>UK Digitisation Taskforce: Terms Of Reference For Dematerialisation Market Action Taskforce (DEMAT)</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-digitisation-taskforce-terms-of-reference-for-dematerialisation-market-actio-2025109/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-digitisation-taskforce-terms-of-reference-for-dematerialisation-market-actio-2025109/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<ul>
<li>On 15 July 2025 the Digitisation Taskforce published its&nbsp;<a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/688383b1ac2c821a74bbeba2/Digitisation_Taskforce_Final_Report.pdf" rel="external">final report</a>, which recommended a staged approach to removing paper share certificates and ultimately moving to a fully intermediated system of shareholding in the UK. The government accepted the recommendations made in the report and set out in its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/digitisation-taskforce-july-2025/government-response-to-digitisation-taskforce-final-report">response</a>&nbsp;how it intends to take these forward. The report recommended a three step process: 
<ul>
<li>Step 1 &ndash; Firstly, existing paper-based or &lsquo;certificated&rsquo; share registers will be replaced by &lsquo;digitised&rsquo; share registers, temporarily replicating the system as it exists today but without paper share certificates. This will happen before the end of 2027.</li>
<li>Step 2 &ndash; Secondly, improvements will be made to the intermediated system, in which most shares are already held, to facilitate the ability of beneficial owners of shares to exercise their rights effectively and efficiently through intermediaries. These improvements will be made over the course of this Parliament.</li>
<li>Step 3 &ndash; Finally, once these improvements have been made, shares on the temporary digitised registers will transition into the intermediated system. The report recommended considering methods for delivering this transition, such as making the digitised registers a &lsquo;one-way street&rsquo;, with shares moving into the intermediated system when shareholders take corporate actions, and/or setting a &lsquo;sunset date&rsquo; by which all shares need to move.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A key recommendation in the report was to establish a &lsquo;Technical Group&rsquo; to work with industry stakeholders to deliver Step 1, including setting a precise date before the end of 2027 for this to take place, and creating a detailed plan for the changes which the market will need to make as part of Steps 2 and 3.</li>
<li>The government has appointed Mark Austin to establish and chair the new Dematerialisation Market Action Taskforce (DEMAT). Mark is a corporate partner at Latham &amp; Watkins, specialising in capital markets, and is a member of the Capital Markets Industry Taskforce. He delivered the Secondary Capital Raising Review in 2022 and was a member of the Digitisation Taskforce.</li>
<li>DEMAT forms one part of the government&rsquo;s wider&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wholesale-financial-markets-digital-strategy/wholesale-financial-markets-digital-strategy#market-transformation">Wholesale Financial Markets Digital Strategy</a>. The government will separately appoint an industry expert as Digital Markets Champion, who will provide leadership from, and for, the sector on wider wholesale market digitalisation, looking at how digital technologies (such as tokenisation) could transform our financial markets. The Digital Markets Champion will be announced in due course.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="objectives-and-timeline">Objectives and timeline</h2>
<p>1) The government has asked the Chair to report back by Summer 2026 with a recommended &lsquo;go-live&rsquo; date for Step 1, which should be before the end of 2027, and an implementation plan for the actions industry participants need to take to deliver this. This plan should include the Taskforce working with industry to implement and communicate the move to all stakeholders, making them aware of how the process will affect them.</p>
<p>2) The government also asks the Taskforce to begin working with market participants to identify and implement the actions they need to take as part of Step 2, including providing any further detail that may be required by firms &ndash; with the aim of the market being ready for Step 3 to begin by the end of this Parliament. These actions should include firms communicating and explaining any changes made in Step 2 to affected stakeholders. The Taskforce may also highlight to the government and/or the regulators any actions beyond those already set out in the Digitisation Taskforce report which it identifies that the government and/or regulators need to pursue under Step 2.</p>
<p>3) The Taskforce is also asked to assess progress in implementing Step 2 and to recommend a detailed plan for all shares to transition into the intermediated system in Step 3. The government has set out below the key principles which it considers to be the criteria for Step 3 to take place. The Taskforce should set out its recommended transition plan for Step 3, which should include a decision on the optimal method and timing for transitioning all remaining shares into the intermediated system, including whether a &lsquo;one-way street&rsquo; and/or a &lsquo;sunset date&rsquo; should be implemented or not.</p>
<h2 id="governance">Governance</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Chair will decide the composition and structure of the DEMAT and determine the processes that will be followed in order to meet the objectives set out by the government.</li>
<li>The Chair may invite any relevant stakeholders to be part of the Taskforce as appropriate, ensuring it properly engages the different interested stakeholder groups. It is also important that the views of vulnerable and older investors are considered and accounted for.</li>
<li>Representatives from the government, the Financial Conduct Authority, the Bank of England and other relevant public bodies may attend meetings of the Taskforce as observers.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="criteria-for-assessing-readiness-for-step-3">Criteria for assessing readiness for Step 3</h2>
<p>The government has set the following key principles which can be used to assess progress on Step 2:</p>
<p>1) Beneficial owners can exercise their rights effectively and efficiently through intermediaries, based on the &lsquo;baseline service&rsquo; recommended in the Digitisation Taskforce report</p>
<p>2) Beneficial owners can receive information promptly and transparently through intermediaries</p>
<p>3) Arrangements are in place for intermediaries to onboard remaining shareholders effectively and efficiently</p>
<p>4) Investors benefit from choice and transparency on the services that they wish to receive from intermediaries based on their different preferences</p>
<p>5) Relevant stakeholders are informed about the transition, how it affects them and what they need to do &ndash; and appropriate solutions are in place where the investor cannot be identified or contacted</p>
<p>6) The interests of vulnerable and older investors are considered and accounted for in the transition plan</p>

<title>Federal Reserve Vice Chair For Supervision Michelle W. Bowman, At The Community Bank Conference, Hosted By The Board Of Governors Of The Federal Reserve System, Washington, D.C.</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good morning, everyone and welcome. It's a privilege to be here today at the Federal Reserve Board with so many of our nation's community bank CEOs. I want to start by thanking our bankers for the essential work you do every day&mdash;serving your communities, supporting small businesses and families and keeping local economies strong and growing. Today's event provides us an opportunity to come together and discuss the future of community banking.</p>
<p>This great nation hosts the largest and most effective financial system in the world, ensuring that capital flows to those who need it and can put it to productive use. I think of community banks as the foundation of our financial system. You are often the first call for small businesses seeking to grow, for families looking to buy homes, and for anyone seeking to achieve their financial goals. At a time of rapid technological change, a shifting regulatory landscape, and evolving consumer expectations, your work has never been more vital or more challenging.</p>
<p>The purpose of this conference is about&nbsp;<span>looking ahead</span>, at the opportunities, risks and innovations that will shape the future of community banking. It's also about&nbsp;<span>telling the community bank story</span>: not only the services you provide and impact you have in your communities but also the value of having strong, profitable and well-managed companies as the foundation of the banking system. There's a story to tell here and we want to ensure&nbsp;<span>community banks tell it and create their own their narrative</span>.</p>
<p>This conference brings together more than a hundred community bank CEOs in person and many more attending virtually. Our panels will include CEOs from across our diverse financial system. I look forward to hearing directly from these leaders to share what they are seeing&mdash;emerging trends, economic shifts and innovations that are shaping the financial system, including the impact of artificial intelligence and fraud, and which may affect your businesses. This conference also brings a broader perspective, from our Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, to new technologies with Paxos CEO Chad Cascarilla to private credit and global outlook with Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman, and consumer digital platforms with Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev. These leaders will help us think more broadly about how economic and industry developments intersect with community banking.</p>
<p>Another special guest joining us today is CNBC host Jim Cramer, who will moderate a panel of experienced community bank CEOs who have a combined century of banking leadership. Today, we will showcase how community bankers have consistently adapted, innovated, and outperformed while staying true to their mission. These efforts do not necessarily make headlines on the front page of the business section, but they should. And there's no one better to help elevate the community bank narrative and amplify the value that community banks bring to America's economy than CNBC's Jim Cramer.</p>
<p>Finally, we will also host a traditional policy panel, featuring community bank CEOs discussing capital and liquidity regulation. This session will provide an opportunity for a thoughtful, candid discussion about how our regulatory frameworks affect your institutions and your ability to serve your communities. These conversations are essential to help shape our thinking and inform how we as regulators work to ensure that policies are effective, fair, and balanced.</p>
<p><span>The goal and the theme running through all of today's panels is clear: there is tremendous support from the public and private sector for a strong, resilient, thriving community banking industry</span>. Each of our sessions today reflects a shared belief in the importance of community banks to America's economic future.</p>
<p>Thank you for being with us today. Now I would like to thank our Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent for taking time from his busy schedule to be here to discuss community banking, and I will now invite him to share his insight with us.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good morning and welcome to the Federal Reserve Board. I am sorry that I'm traveling and could not be with you today. Thank you to Vice Chair for Supervision Miki Bowman for hosting this conference. Thank you also to all the Board staff that made this event possible.</p>
<p>Community banks play a vital role in the U.S. financial system because they have strong links to the people and businesses they serve, and direct knowledge of local economic conditions. These close ties allow community bankers to better understand their customers, and the ensuing products and services for those they serve. I saw this clearly when I led the Board's community and regional bank subcommittee as a governor. I have also seen the critical role of community banks in the communities where I have lived, including as a community-bank customer.</p>
<p>Today's event is a helpful opportunity for Fed leaders to hear from community bankers and learn more about the issue you face. We are committed to understanding these issues. And we have long been committed to tailoring our supervisory practices as appropriate for community banks to reduce unnecessary burden, while still ensuring that community banks continue to operate in a safe and sound manner.</p>
<p>Thank you for being here today to share your knowledge and experience. And thank you for being such a vital part of the communities you serve.</p>

<title>LME Sets Out Roadmap For Modernising Its Options Offering</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/lme-sets-out-roadmap-for-modernising-its-options-offering-2025109/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/lme-sets-out-roadmap-for-modernising-its-options-offering-2025109/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The London Metal Exchange (LME) has today published a roadmap setting out its proposed plan to modernise its options market. It provides clarity on the immediate plans to automate the expiry process and deliver electronic options, both of which will help enhance liquidity and transparency, ultimately broadening market participation.</p>
<p>Options are used by a wide range of LME market participants, including producers, consumers, intermediaries and financial participants, to help manage risk. Currently, they are only traded through the inter-office market, but the launch of the LME&rsquo;s new trading platform has laid the foundation to build an electronic options market and the functionality that it requires.</p>
<p>The LME intends to take a phased approach to implementing the changes, although the final timetable and proposals will remain subject to further consultation and regulatory engagement:&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Early H2 2026</span></p>
<ul>
<li>The first step will be the introduction of automated expiry for LME options, the consultation for which will be published later this year. This will simplify and standardise the expiry process, removing the operational risk and complexity of the current manual processes. It will also align the LME with global best practice and provide greater certainty for participants.</li>
<li>Previous market feedback indicated support to move from the current American expiry style (that can be exercised on any day up to the expiry day) to a European expiry style that only allows the option to be exercised on the expiration date. The LME proposes to make this change at the same time as automated expiry.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Late 2026</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Outright options, quoted in premium terms, will become available on screen. The LME believes that this will complement the existing bilateral inter-office market and align the LME with other markets. Electronic options will provide greater standardisation and intraday transparency, reducing barriers to entry and making the market more attractive to a broader range of market participants.</li>
<li>The launch of onscreen options will be accompanied by a number of features including mass quotes and market maker protections. The LME will also introduce a liquidity provider programme to support onscreen liquidity and intraday price transparency.</li>
</ul>

<title>FSB Calls For Enhanced Policy Implementation To Achieve Tangible Improvements In Cross-Border Payments</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/fsb-calls-for-enhanced-policy-implementation-to-achieve-tangible-improvements-in-2025109/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/fsb-calls-for-enhanced-policy-implementation-to-achieve-tangible-improvements-in-2025109/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><span>The FSB and partner organisations have completed most of the international policy work under the G20</span>&nbsp;<span>Roadmap for enhancing cross-border payments.</span></li>
<li><span>Policy initiatives have not yet translated into the desired real-world gains for end-users, though there have been improvements in some areas.</span></li>
<li><span>In order to fulfil the G20 objectives, the FSB and partner organisations will work with key stakeholders to support implementation of actions under the Roadmap at the jurisdictional level. &nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) today published a&nbsp;<a class="custom-internal-link processed-internal-link" href="https://www.fsb.org/2025/10/g20-roadmap-for-cross-border-payments-consolidated-progress-report-for-2025/">consolidated progress report for 2025&nbsp;</a>on the actions taken by the FSB, the Bank for International Settlements Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) and other partner organisations under the&nbsp;<a class="custom-internal-link processed-internal-link" href="https://www.fsb.org/2020/10/enhancing-cross-border-payments-stage-3-roadmap/">G20 Roadmap for Enhancing Cross-Border Payments</a>. To more effectively monitor progress, the annual progress report has been integrated with the report on key performance indicators (KPIs).</p>
<p>Over the past year several significant milestones have been achieved. These include the FSB&rsquo;s recommendations to&nbsp;<a class="custom-internal-link" href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/12/recommendations-for-regulating-and-supervising-bank-and-non-bank-payment-service-providers-offering-cross-border-payment-services-final-report/">level the playing field between bank and non-bank payment services providers</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a class="custom-internal-link" href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/12/recommendations-to-promote-alignment-and-interoperability-across-data-frameworks-related-to-cross-border-payments-final-report/">to mitigate data-related frictions in cross-border payments</a>, and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)&rsquo;s revision of standards for data in cross-border payments (Recommendation 16 on Payment Transparency). While the majority of the Roadmap actions have been completed, these efforts have not yet translated into tangible improvements for end-users at the global level.</p>
<p>It is unlikely that satisfactory improvements at the global level will be achieved in line with the 2027 Roadmap timetable. The global speed of wholesale payments has increased, possibly laying the foundation for faster retail payments and remittances in the future. The speed of remittances has also improved globally, which means those end-users relying on financial support from family members abroad are receiving payments more quickly. However, the average global cost of such payments remains high, notwithstanding some improvements in the most expensive regions.</p>
<p>There continues to be significant variations across regions. More needs to be done at the regional and jurisdictional level to turn the international policy work into real-world gains for end-users and to support economic growth. Individual jurisdictions need to take practical steps to implement measures that will have downstream benefits. Private sector stakeholders should also explore and implement changes to improve the end-user&rsquo;s cross-border payments experience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The FSB and South African G20 Presidency remain committed to achieving the goals of the Roadmap and urge the public and private sectors to make tangible improvements to domestic payment systems as the first and last mile of a cross-border payment depend on domestic payment rails&rdquo;, said Lesetja Kganyago, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank and Co-Chair of the FSB Cross-border Payments Coordination Group.</p>
<p>Over the coming year, the FSB and other partner organisations will focus on enhancing monitoring and supporting implementation of the agreed policy recommendations under the G20 Roadmap. &ldquo;We are committed to facilitating implementation of agreed policy recommendations and to engage actively with the private sector, G20 and non-G20 jurisdictions to make this happen,&rdquo; said Fabio Panetta, Governor of Banca d&rsquo;Italia, Chair of the CPMI and Co-Chair of the FSB Cross-border Payments Coordination Group.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Background</h2>
<p>In 2020, the Saudi Arabian G20 Presidency made enhancing cross-border payments a priority and asked the FSB to develop and coordinate a G20 Roadmap. To give impetus to this work, the FSB, in collaboration with the CPMI and other partner organisations, developed a&nbsp;<a class="custom-internal-link processed-internal-link" href="https://www.fsb.org/2023/02/g20-roadmap-for-enhancing-cross-border-payments-priority-actions-for-achieving-the-g20-targets/">prioritisation plan</a>&nbsp;that focused on actions that would most effectively contribute to achieving the goals of the Roadmap for faster, cheaper and more transparent and accessible cross-border payments. To give ambition and accountability to the Roadmap&rsquo;s goals, in 2021, the G20 endorsed&nbsp;<a class="custom-internal-link processed-internal-link" href="https://www.fsb.org/2022/11/developing-the-implementation-approach-for-the-cross-border-payments-targets-final-report/">a set of global quantitative targets</a>, the majority of which are set for end-2027. To more effectively monitor progress, the annual progress report has been integrated with the report on KPIs measuring the end-user experience.</p>
<p>The FSB coordinates at the international level the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies and develops and promotes the implementation of effective regulatory, supervisory, and other financial sector policies in the interest of financial stability. It brings together national authorities responsible for financial stability in 24 countries and jurisdictions, international financial institutions, sector-specific international groupings of regulators and supervisors, and committees of central bank experts. The FSB also conducts outreach with approximately 70 other jurisdictions through its six Regional Consultative Groups.</p>
<p>The FSB is chaired by Andrew Bailey, Governor of the Bank of England. The FSB Secretariat is located in Basel, Switzerland and hosted by the Bank for International Settlements.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Nasdaq (</strong><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/ndaq" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>NDAQ</strong></a><strong>) announces that Valstybės Investicinis Kapitalas, a Lithuanian state-owned company, has become the first to list its bonds under Nasdaq&rsquo;s new European defense bond framework. The bonds are listed on the Nasdaq Baltic Bond List by the Nasdaq Vilnius Stock Exchange.</strong></p>
<p>According to the EU Commission (White Paper for European Defence &ndash; Readiness 2030), access to finance is a major concern for 44% of defense SMEs, compared to civilian SMEs. With increasing interest from the financial sector, the defense industry is positioned for significant growth, as investment policies evolve to support this emerging market.</p>
<p>To improve transparency and provide clear guidelines for funding defense projects, Nasdaq has introduced the Nasdaq Defense, Resilience, and Infrastructure Bond Criteria&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.nasdaq.com/docs/2025/06/10/0718-25_Bond_Criteria_Factsheet.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">(NDRI</a>). The NDRI acts as a voluntary transparency standard and criterion for obtaining the NDRI label on Nasdaq&rsquo;s European Bond Markets.</p>
<p>Valstybės Investicinis Kapitalas (VIK) completed a &euro;25 million public offering, marking the first tranche of its medium-term note program guaranteed by the Republic of Lithuania. The bonds have a 4-year maturity and carry a yearly interest rate of 3.119%. VIK&rsquo;s entire bond program is valued at &euro;400 million. Of this total funding, up to &euro;71 million will be dedicated to the construction of the Rheinmetall factory in Lithuania. The remaining funds will be allocated to various other defense and security initiatives, with further details to be disclosed in future tranches.</p>
<p>"We are honored to see that the capital markets are opening to defense projects. The current geopolitical situation encourages investors to increasingly trust these projects, recognizing their importance and potential. Investor confidence is a crucial factor in ensuring long-term security and stability in the region," said&nbsp;<strong>Vaidas Daktariūnas, CEO of VIK.</strong></p>
<p>VIK acts as a strategic investor, attracting private capital by issuing debt securities to fund projects of national importance, including economic resilience, national defense, and security, thereby contributing to the development of capital markets in Lithuania.</p>
<p><strong>Roland Chai, President of European Market Services at Nasdaq</strong>, commented, "Helping vital companies access public capital is at the heart of what we do at Nasdaq Europe. We commend VIK for utilizing Nasdaq Europe's bond market and leading the way for other defense-related projects to secure market funding. The added criteria provide investors with the insights needed for confident decisions and ensure efficient capital deployment for issuers. Financial markets must adapt to the evolving needs of economies and societies, and Nasdaq is committed to this adaptation."</p>
<p>The NDRI framework offers a transparent platform for companies and governments to raise capital efficiently, supporting defense capabilities and resilience. For investors, the NDRI provides detailed insights into the defense industry, facilitating informed decisions and aligning with their investment goals.</p>
<p>To qualify under the NDRI, the proceeds of the bond issue must be allocated to projects benefiting the defense, resilience, or infrastructure of EU or NATO member states, or non-member states formally participating in EU or NATO&rsquo;s frameworks of cooperation. Eligible categories include, but are not limited to, cybersecurity, weapons and ammunition, infrastructure, dual-use technologies, civil resilience programs, and aerospace.</p>

<title>Securities Commission Malaysia Charges Ex-MD For Causing Wrongful Loss To AT Systematization Berhad</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/securities-commission-malaysia-charges-ex-md-for-causing-wrongful-loss-to-at-sys-2025109/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) yesterday charged a former Managing Director of AT Systematization Berhad (ATS) (currently known as Erdasan Group Berhad), at the Kuala Lumpur Sessions Court for causing wrongful loss amounting to RM16.35 million to the company.</p>
<p>Choong Lee Aun (Choong), 59, faced 41 charges under section 317A(1) of the Capital Markets and Services Act 2007 (CMSA) for allegedly making payments totalling RM16.35 million to two companies, Delta Million Dynamic Sdn Bhd and Midas Mode Sdn Bhd, with the intention of causing wrongful loss to ATS.</p>
<p>The offences took place between June 2020 and November 2021 in Petaling Jaya, Selangor.</p>
<p>Under section 317A(1) of the CMSA, a director or officer of a listed corporation or any of its related corporations shall not do anything with the intention of causing wrongful loss to the listed corporation or its related corporations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If convicted, Choong faces a jail term of not less than two years and not exceeding 10 years and is also liable to a fine not exceeding RM10 million.</p>
<p>Choong claimed trial to all 41 charges in three separate courts and was granted bail at RM420,000 in total.</p>
<p>Before Sessions Court judge Puan Suhaila binti Haron, Choong was granted bail at RM200,000 with two local sureties. He was also ordered to surrender his passport to court and to report to the SC&rsquo;s investigating officer on a monthly basis as additional bail condition by the court.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Separately, Choong was granted bail of RM100,000 and RM120,000 respectively before Sessions Court judges Tuan Azrul bin Darus and Puan Norma binti Ismail. Both courts imposed similar additional bail conditions as the earlier court against Choong.</p>
<p>The charges preferred against Choong yesterday were made possible through the close cooperation and collaboration between the SC and both domestic and international law enforcement agencies. The joint efforts reflect the commitment in ensuring that perpetrators of securities laws are brought to justice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SC wishes to record its appreciation to the International Criminal Police Organisation (INTERPOL) and Malaysia Airports Aviation Security (AVSEC) for their invaluable assistance.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Taiwan Futures Exchange (TAIFEX) delivered solid growth in the third quarter of 2025, with total trading volume exceeding 97 million contracts and an average daily volume (ADV) of around 1.5 million contracts.</p>
<p>TXO activity surged following the launch of the Friday series, which quickly gained traction among investors. The quarterly ADV of TXO rose by over 20% from the previous quarter, reaching more than 720 thousand contracts. From its debut in late June through September, Friday TXO averaged close to 200 thousand contracts per day, with 30% traded on Thursdays and 51% on Fridays. The Friday contracts accounted for around 28% of total TXO activity, with 35% executed during the night session. By participant type, retail investors accounted for 49% of Friday TXO volume, while foreign institutions contributed 13%.</p>
<p>Additionally, the strong momentum in Taiwan&rsquo;s equity market boosted trading activity in TAIFEX&rsquo;s Single Stock Futures (SSF). The ADV for SSF climbed 30.3% from Q2 to 300 thousand contracts, driven by active trading in contracts linked to blue-chip stocks or theme-based stocks reflecting prevailing market trends, such as mini TSMC (QFF), Nanya Technology (CYF), Winbond Electronics (FZF) and TS Financial Holding (CMF).</p>

Shield&rsquo;s new data process is designed to free institutions from data pipeline opacity and blind spots through zero-gap ingestion, full transparency, and full data accessibility at every stage of its lifecycle.<br /><br />Regulators are placing increasing scrutiny on data completeness and accessibility, adding pressure to already overworked compliance teams. The stakes are significant: The average cost of noncompliance exceeded $4.88 million per incident in 2024, according to Gartner. This growing compliance burden is reflected in recent research by GreySpark, which found that 83% of surveyed global banks reported data issues in capture, retention, and auditability. Financial firms struggle with fragmented systems that create compliance vulnerabilities and operational inefficiencies. Even minor gaps in data completeness early on can lead to significant downstream impact across a firm&rsquo;s risk management, including stalled insights, eroded trust, missed regulatory requirements, all of which create vulnerability to significant fines.<br /><br />&ldquo;Shield is helping the world&rsquo;s leading financial institutions break through legacy barriers and fragmented data by unifying the full communications lifecycle,&rdquo; said Tamar Sharir Beiser, Chief Product Officer at Shield. &ldquo;With our transparent, AI-powered platform, firms gain complete data integrity, eliminate blind spots, and respond to regulatory demands with confidence. For too long, organizations have struggled with limited visibility into their data. Shield is changing that by setting a new standard of clarity, with a fully unified data flow, transparency, and accessibility at every stage of the lifecycle.&rdquo;<br /><br /><b>Unified End-to-End Data Lifecycle Approach</b><br />Shield&rsquo;s native end-to-end DCGA platform handles the complete data lifecycle from capture through archiving, delivering clarity and trust across the entire data process.<br /><br />At the heart of Shield&rsquo;s new standard are three key pillars:<br />-&nbsp;<b>Zero data loss</b>: Comprehensive monitoring and validation ensures no communication escapes capture, with real-time alerts when issues arise so that institutions can meet strict traceability and completeness standards with confidence.<br />-&nbsp;<b>Complete transparency</b>: Full visibility into data status at every stage enables proactive compliance management and audit readiness. Unmatched completeness reporting, with built-in granularity and flexibility, helps compliance teams spot gaps early and stay audit-ready.<br />-&nbsp;<b>Advanced customer access</b>: Instant access to data with no vendor lag, exit fees, or hidden costs. Flexible exports can be run on demand or scheduled through UI or API, across metadata, audit trails, alerts, and communications.</div>
<div></div>
<div>&ldquo;With Shield&rsquo;s new data integrity capabilities, we&rsquo;ve been able to close audit findings and mature our reconciliation process. The access to dedicated reporting metrics gives us the confidence that our data integrity is intact, and that we can demonstrate compliance with clarity.&rdquo; &ndash; IT Project Lead, Global Wealth Fund<br /><br />Shield&rsquo;s robust technological data approach is backed by real-time human monitoring and proactive anomaly resolution. With data at its core, Shield&rsquo;s platform provides a single source of truth across the portfolio of products, working in tandem with Shield Archive for secure retention and preservation of original communications. This unified, scalable framework supports firm-specific data needs and regulatory obligations with self-service visibility and full chain of custody for verifiable evidence at every stage.</div>

<title>Ontario Securities Commission Takes Action To Increase Transparency And Encourage Compliance In The Exempt Market – Introduces AFS Non-Delivery List And Focused Compliance Examinations</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ontario-securities-commission-takes-action-to-increase-transparency-and-encourag-2025108/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) today announced recent activities to increase transparency and foster compliance in the exempt market, a segment of Canada&rsquo;s capital markets where securities can be sold without the protections associated with a prospectus. These activities align with our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/en/about-us/role-osc/osc-strategic-plan">Strategic Plan</a>&nbsp;that identified the ongoing growth of the private markets. We are approaching this work from two perspectives. We are enhancing awareness of our requirements and monitoring the use of the offering memorandum prospectus exemption (OM exemption) under section 2.9 of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/en/securities-law/instruments-rules-policies/4/45-106">National Instrument 45-106&nbsp;<em>Prospectus Exemptions</em></a><em>,&nbsp;</em>as well as increasing transparency for retail investors who participate in the exempt market and may be exposed to heightened investment risks such as the risk of loss, limited liquidity, and lack of information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The aim is to advance investor protection for all investors by increasing transparency about the business activities of non-reporting issuers raising capital in the exempt market using the OM exemption and limiting the distribution of non-compliant non-reporting issuers,&rdquo; said Sonny Randhawa, Executive Vice President, Regulatory Operations at the OSC. &ldquo;Exempt market does not mean<span>&nbsp;</span>unregulated market. Within Regulatory Operations, the OSC&rsquo;s Corporate Finance and Registration, Investigations and Examinations divisions are working in tandem to encourage compliance with regulatory requirements by both issuers and dealers in the exempt market to support investor protection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As part of these efforts, the OSC&rsquo;s Corporate Finance division is introducing an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/en/industry/companies/selling-securities-ontario/exempt-market/companies-have-not-delivered-annual-financial-statements">AFS non-delivery list</a>, a list of non-reporting issuers that have relied on the OM exemption in Ontario but have not delivered annual financial statements to the OSC. Delivery of financial statements to the OSC is a condition of the OM exemption. Publishing this list on the OSC website provides greater transparency about the exempt market by notifying investors and other market participants of companies that have not delivered their annual financial statements to the OSC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The OSC&rsquo;s Registration, Investigations and Examinations division (RIE) will be examining exempt market dealers (EMDs) involved in the distribution of certain non-reporting issuers that failed to deliver their annual financial statements to the OSC. RIE&rsquo;s examinations will consider the know-your-product practices of registrants when distributing securities of these issuers. As part of its ongoing work to oversee EMDs, RIE recently identified significant compliance deficiencies that led to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/en/securities-law/orders-rulings-decisions/ternion-financial-services-inc-and-alison-travers">the suspension</a>&nbsp;of an EMD and its chief compliance officer.</p>
<p>The mandate of the OSC is to provide protection to investors from unfair, improper or fraudulent practices, to foster fair, efficient and competitive capital markets and confidence in the capital markets, to foster capital formation, and to contribute to the stability of the financial system and the reduction of systemic risk. Investors are urged to check the registration of any persons or company offering an investment opportunity and to review the OSC investor materials available at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/">https://www.osc.ca</a>.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The California Public Employees&rsquo; Retirement System (CalPERS) today announced that it has hired June Kim as its new Deputy Chief Investment Officer for Public Markets. Kim has nearly three decades of investing experience, most recently as senior investment director of total fund management at the California State Teachers&rsquo; Retirement System (CalSTRS).</p>
<p>&ldquo;June brings a proven track record of success in both the public and private sectors, and we are thrilled to welcome her to the CalPERS team,&rdquo; said Chief Executive Officer Marcie Frost. &ldquo;We look forward to June&rsquo;s leadership and insight as she brings a wealth of investing knowledge to help CalPERS fulfill its mission to deliver retirement security to our members.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At CalPERS, Kim will report to Chief Investment Officer Stephen Gilmore and work closely with the agency&rsquo;s managing investment directors to lead decision-making across the portfolio. Her appointment will be effective December 1.</p>
<p>"We searched the globe for the right mix of experience and leadership and found the best person for the job right in our own backyard,&rdquo; Gilmore said. &ldquo;CalPERS will benefit from June&rsquo;s knowledge of global public markets, her understanding of long-term horizons, and her experience in managing high-performing teams.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>At CalSTRS, Kim oversaw asset allocation, balance sheet management and investment risk across the fund, which was valued at $374.3 billion as of Aug. 31, 2025. Prior to that role, Kim served as the investment director of global equity at CalSTRS for 10 years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am honored to join the team at CalPERS and continue the important work of providing a strong and secure retirement for those who have served California,&rdquo; Kim said. &ldquo;The mission at CalPERS is so crucial as we deliver on the promise of supporting the financial future of our members.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To say that June has made a huge contribution to CalSTRS&rsquo; investment success would be an understatement. She has been invaluable," said CalSTRS Chief Investment Officer Scott Chan. "Her recent efforts to develop the Total Fund Management division have laid the foundation for future growth. We will miss her deeply, but we're happy she has joined our colleagues at CalPERS to serve public sector workers in California."</p>
<p>Before joining CalSTRS, June served as head of equities for the Los Angeles County Employees Retirement Association. She also worked as an investment officer for the City of Los Angeles. Kim worked in the private sector before joining public service, with experience at Northern Trust Global Investments, Citibank, Barclays Global Investors, and Wilshire Associates.</p>
<p>She graduated with a degree in business economics from the University of California at Los Angeles and is a 2019 Finance Leaders Fellow of the Aspen Institute and a member of the Aspen Global Leadership Network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kim will succeed Dan Bienvenue, who left CalPERS in April to become managing director of the private equity firm General Atlantic.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The FINRA Investor Education Foundation (FINRA Foundation) and the Association for Financial Counseling and Planning Education<span>&reg;</span>&nbsp;(AFCPE<span>&reg;</span>) are excited to announce the 2025 cohort of the FINRA Foundation Military Spouse Fellowship. This year, 30 military spouses will take steps toward achieving their Accredited Financial Counselor<span>&reg;</span>&nbsp;(AFC<span>&reg;</span>) designation, setting the foundation for meaningful careers in financial counseling.</p>
<p>Since 2006, the FINRA Foundation Military Spouse Fellowship has successfully prepared over 700 military spouses to obtain their AFC certification while building a thriving global network of more financially confident and empowered military families.</p>
<p>Heather Walrath, an AFC and prior Fellowship recipient, offered her insights on what the opportunity has meant to her and her clients: &ldquo;The AFC has been crucial in my ability to really empower military families. There are a lot of people operating in this space without the proper training. Having the AFC credential shows my clients that I am committed to continual learning to better support their unique needs. The designation is also very recognized within the DOD community. As an AFC, I've really valued the networking and being part of a community that wants to uplift - not only financial counseling professionals - but also the people we serve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By equipping military spouses with the expertise required for flexible, rewarding careers in financial counseling, the Fellowship strengthens financial security and enhances overall readiness across military communities.</p>
<p>"Our Military Spouse Fellows continue to demonstrate the profound impact that targeted financial education can have on military families," said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/about/executives/gerri-walsh">Gerri Walsh, President of the FINRA Foundation</a>. "As this program enters its 20th year, we've seen how empowering military spouses with professional skills creates a multiplier effect&mdash;strengthening both their own career prospects and the financial resilience of the entire military community."</p>
<p>&ldquo;This year marks the 20th anniversary of the FINRA Foundation Military Spouse Fellowship,&rdquo; said Rachael DeLeon, Executive Director of AFCPE. &ldquo;Our latest class joins a passionate and supportive community that is dedicated to improving the financial well-being of military service members and their families. To date, FINRA Fellows have served more than 280,000 individuals, positively impacting military communities across the United States and around the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The FINRA Foundation Military Spouse Fellowship is open to qualifying spouses of active-duty or retired Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Space Force, Coast Guard, and Army or Air National Guard or reserve component service members, as well as spouses of the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Professionals.

All of us benefit from the research presented here, which helps us understand the opportunities for banks to strengthen communities, and the challenges that community banks face. So, I want to thank the researchers presenting. Thank you also to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS) for co-sponsoring this gathering, and to the Federal Reserve staff who each year do their part to bring it about. More broadly, I very much appreciate the close and longstanding collaboration between the Federal Reserve, the CSBS, and the FDIC.</p>
<p>Throughout my career, a major focus of my work has been building stronger communities. To do much of that building, households and small businesses need access to credit, and I have known for a long time that community banks and community bankers play an indispensable role in the towns, rural areas, and cities they serve. Stronger community banks mean stronger communities.</p>
<p>Community banks, sometimes the only banking option in a community, offer a consequential difference in customer experience. Even in communities that may also have local branches of larger banks, there is often a considerable, and I think meaningful, differentiation in the customer satisfaction at a community bank. At branches of larger banks, the customer experience can be subject to layers of authorizations involving phone calls and approvals (or denials) from people who are not part of the community and may lack a deep understanding of local industries and conditions. Much of this relates to the understandable need for larger institutions to adopt more standardized and centralized processes, powered by technology, to boost efficiency and lower costs. It is easier than ever before to apply for an increasing variety of loans online, and this is something that community banks are taking advantage of as well. But this is where the benefit that community banks provide really shows.</p>
<p>Community bankers are part of their communities. They know and care about their customers. They have an inherent advantage in understanding the needs and the challenges of local businesses and households. This is not just a matter of being friendly and welcoming to customers. Beyond the numbers on a loan application, what community bankers understand about their neighbors is "soft information" that can be used to make better credit decisions. Relationship banking, especially with local business owners, is critical for those businesses&mdash;but also for community banks&mdash;because it gives them an ongoing edge in the ever-intensifying competition from larger banks and nonbank lenders. Knowing your customer is also crucial in preventing crime, such as fraud, which remains a top concern for community bankers.</p>
<p>The pressure of competition is a very real challenge for community banks, but the advantages I speak of are real as well. I know you heard yesterday from several banks, including those that are modestly sized and have competed very effectively with much larger banks. Community banks have earned the trust and the business of people in their communities because of an understanding that the banks' successes depend on their communities succeeding. Those common interests are a powerful force that drives customer retention amid all the competition.</p>
<p>What is the future of community banking? I note that the session immediately after my remarks today is "Innovation and Technology in Small Business Lending." Indeed, technology is a big part of this year's conference, so you won't be surprised to hear me say that I believe it is a big part of what will determine the future of community banking. I know you've already gotten the results of this year's Annual Survey of Community Banks by CSBS, where "technology and related costs" ranked second as a concern, behind only cybersecurity, which is itself largely about technology. Most respondents said that the adoption of new or emerging technologies was very or extremely important, and not a single banker said it wasn't important at all.</p>
<p>Until fairly recently, the big technological disruption in banking came from fintech and an onslaught of new lending from nonbanks. This year's CSBS survey reported the largest-ever increase in respondents who saw heightened competition from nonbank payment services firms. Larger banks are also competing with community banks online. Increased choice for small businesses and consumers is a good thing, but community banks have had to continue to innovate to compete. Community banks often turn to third-party service providers to help them offer products and services to compete with larger banks and fintechs. Managing the risks related to these third-party arrangements has been a considerable job for community banks. The Fed and other regulators have offered guidance about this task, to serve as a resource and to make the supervisory implications of third-party risk management as predictable as possible.</p>
<p>As with many of the big questions facing community banking, technology represents risk and opportunity. It allows community banks to reach customers more effectively and to offer new products and services, but it also demands investment and vigilance. One of the challenges for community banks is to adopt technologies or form partnerships that allow them to deepen customer relationships but not attenuate or replace them. In interactions with Federal Reserve supervisors about third-party services, banks tell us that they hear a lot of sales pitches for algorithmic lending, outsourcing customer service, and the like, when what they are really looking for is an app that can enhance relationship banking: their natural advantage.</p>
<p>Any discussion about technological advances has to give prominent attention to artificial intelligence, and I note that later this morning a paper on the use of AI technology will be part of an upcoming session. Before I get into what AI might mean for community banking, let me say that AI has been of particular interest to me, and I have spoken about it several times this year, because of the technology's potential to transform both our economy, and in other fundamental ways, how we live and interact with each other in society.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20251008a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;While there is high uncertainty about these outcomes, I believe that the speed at which AI is being implemented means that we should all be thinking about the full range of possibilities and be prepared for any one of them to come to pass, perhaps sooner than we think.</p>
<p>AI was included for the first time in the CSBS survey in 2024, when AI for customer support was an important focus for 31 percent of respondents, a share that jumped to 47 percent in this year's survey. Of course, earlier forms of AI have been used by larger banks in customer service for many years, and the big development for community banks seems to be that newer forms of GenAI could be lowering costs and expanding access enough to make it cost-effective for smaller institutions.</p>
<p>Customer service is one obvious area where AI could change community banking, but there are others. Cybersecurity and fraud have been and continue to be leading concerns for community bankers, and AI represents new opportunities for addressing these concerns. It is my understanding that automated fraud detection, in particular, hasn't been cost effective for some community banks, which haven't been able to compete with larger banks that have the economies of scale to deploy these services. But the huge buildout in AI capacity now underway, along with the explosion in the number of firms seeking to get into AI-based services, may have the potential for driving down costs enough to make AI-based fraud detection more feasible for community banks.</p>
<p>Yet, AI represents new risks as well as new opportunities.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20251008a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;In addition to community banks worrying about criminals defrauding them or their customers with forgeries on checks or in credit card transactions, they face a new threat from entirely forged identities, with so-called "deepfakes." Deepfakes use GenAI to recreate voices and images of real people, allowing fraudsters to hold convincing conversations using simulated voices that sound like the individual they are impersonating, responding in ways that person might realistically respond. Using only a brief sample of audio and access to information about individuals on the internet, criminals employing GenAI can impersonate a close relative in a crisis or a high-value bank client seeking to complete a transaction at their bank. What was once the stuff of movies is now a reality, and a lot is at stake. The direct and indirect costs of all cybercrimes have already grown from 1 percent to 10 percent of global gross domestic product.<a name="f3"></a><a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20251008a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;The use of deepfakes in cybercrime is growing very quickly. According to one source, there has been a twentyfold increase in deepfake attacks over the last three years.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20251008a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a></p>
<p>Community bankers also need to be aware of the potential for AI to affect customers' livelihoods. I tend to be an optimist about the potential for AI to make workers more productive, raise living standards, and create more jobs in new industries, but I am realistic in my expectation that it could cause considerable dislocation of workers and businesses, at least in the short run.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20251008a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;Communities dependent on a small number of employers or a single industry that is significantly affected by AI could experience these dislocations. At the same time, the large investments underway in data centers, many of them in remote or rural areas where electricity is less expensive, could bring new business for community banks. For example, during the most recent Community Advisory Council (CAC) meeting, the Federal Reserve Board heard about a major data center built in Ellendale, North Dakota, a community of less than 1,500 people. The CAC member noted that the addition of a major data center had vastly increased the community's needs for services. At this point it is hard to tell how much AI will truly transform the economy and banking, but I think that community bankers will need to be prepared to change, as ever, if your communities are affected.</p>
<p>I have covered a couple topics so far today. I have spoken about the advent of fintech, and the way it is transforming banking and competition between community banks and larger banks&mdash;risks and opportunities. I have spoken about technology more generally, and specifically about how artificial intelligence may change the economy and banking. Many of these uncertainties echo those that most workers and businesses are facing in our fast-evolving economy. One group of people that I believe have dealt very effectively with a changing economy are community bankers. Considering the changes that have swept over our banking and financial system over the decades, if you are a community banker sitting here today, that itself is a testament to your ingenuity, resilience, and adaptability. But I would be remiss if I didn't discuss a further challenge to community banks in this regulatory environment&mdash;deregulation of large banks.</p>
<p>As community bankers well know, it was not community banks that fueled the 2008 financial crisis&mdash;it was the largest, most complex firms whose excessive risk-taking nearly brought down the system. In the years since, strong reforms&mdash;higher capital, tougher liquidity requirements, and rigorous stress testing&mdash;have helped to safeguard our economy. Yet recent proposed rollbacks in capital standards for the largest banks, in the supervisory framework for large financial institutions, and in the rigor of stress testing of large banks threaten to erode those protections. These shifts would not make the system safer; they would leave community banks once again exposed to the fallout if the largest players stumble. Because we cannot afford to repeat those mistakes, I have spoken out against weakening standards for large banks, and I will continue to do so.</p>
<p>In closing, I'll note my admiration for community bankers who know how to confront uncertainty, to sort out the risks and the opportunities, and make the decisions and investments that have allowed community banks to continue to play the indispensable role you serve for your customers and communities. We all share an interest in responsible regulation, which means promoting the safety and soundness of community banks and compliance with applicable law but also ensuring that regulation is appropriate to the size, business model, and risk profile of regulated institutions. We all want community banks to succeed and continue to play their important role in the communities they serve. One reason that I believe community banking has a bright future is that all the people here today recognize the unique and essential function of community banks in our financial system and are helping to support community banking.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<ul>
<li><i>World&rsquo;s first Sustainability-Linked Financing Sukuk by Emirates Islamic successfully listed on Nasdaq Dubai</i></li>
<li><i>This listing drives the total value of outstanding Sukuk on Nasdaq Dubai past the USD 100 billion mark</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Nasdaq Dubai welcomed the successful listing of Emirates Islamic&rsquo;s USD 500 million Sustainability-Linked Financing Sukuk, marking the world's first Sukuk issuance of its kind.</p>
<p>Issued under Emirates Islamic&rsquo;s USD 4 billion Sukuk Programme, the landmark Sukuk underscores the bank&rsquo;s leadership in sustainable Islamic finance and its role in advancing the UAE&rsquo;s sustainability agenda.</p>
<p>The Sukuk attracted strong international investor demand, highlighting the increasing appeal of sustainable Islamic finance, with orders reaching USD 1.2 billion, an oversubscription of 2.4 times. This enabled the bank to tighten the profit rate to 4.540% per annum, at a spread of 95 basis points over 5-year US Treasuries.</p>
<p>To mark the successful listing, Hesham Abdulla Al Qassim, Chairman of Emirates Islamic and Vice Chairman and Managing Director of Emirates NBD, rang the bell at Nasdaq Dubai&rsquo;s market-opening ceremony alongside Hamed Ali, CEO of Nasdaq Dubai and Dubai Financial Market (DFM).</p>
<p><b>Hesham Abdulla Al Qassim, Chairman, Emirates Islamic and Vice Chairman and Managing Director of Emirates NBD</b>, said: "The listing of our pioneering Sustainability-Linked Financing Sukuk on Nasdaq Dubai underscores Emirates Islamic&rsquo;s financial strength and our commitment to achieving the UAE&rsquo;s Net Zero 2050 ambitions. This landmark transaction, a global first, demonstrates our ability to deliver advanced, Shari&rsquo;ah-compliant solutions that resonate with a diverse international investor base, reflecting the growing appetite for sustainable Islamic finance.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Hamed Ali, CEO of Nasdaq Dubai and DFM</b>, added: "The listing of Emirates Islamic&rsquo;s USD 500 million Sustainability-Linked Financing Sukuk represents a landmark moment for Nasdaq Dubai and the wider Islamic finance industry. It highlights Dubai&rsquo;s growing role as a leading global hub for Islamic and sustainable capital markets, while reinforcing our commitment to providing issuers and investors with innovative financing solutions that support the UAE&rsquo;s long-term economic development and climate ambitions."</p>
<p>Following this listing, Emirates Islamic Sukuk's total outstanding listings on Nasdaq Dubai have reached USD 2.77 billion. This brings the total value of all outstanding Sukuk listed on the exchange to over USD 100 billion, further cementing Nasdaq Dubai's position as a leading global hub for Islamic fixed-income products.</p>
<p>As a premier platform for both fixed income and ESG instruments, Nasdaq Dubai now hosts USD 140 billion in fixed income and USD 28.7 billion in ESG listings, including USD 1.55 billion in sustainability-linked issuances.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4526828-1&amp;h=4224525151&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eventus.com%2F&amp;a=Eventus" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eventus</a>, a leading provider of comprehensive, at-scale trade surveillance and financial risk solutions, today announced the launch of Frank AI, its artificial intelligence solution purpose-built for financial compliance teams and surveillance analytics. Eventus' use of deterministic AI for the trade surveillance solution ensures that clients achieve secure, repeatable and transparent results &ndash; a necessity for regulatory inquiries and audits.</p>
<p>Harnessing technologies including natural language processing (NLP) and large language models (LLMs) and fully integrated into the firm's Validus platform, Frank includes a suite of AI tools and behavioral analytics to help clients automate complex processes, improve accuracy, dramatically reduce alert noise and enhance operational efficiency, as well as identify nuanced patterns of misconduct more effectively in their trade surveillance and risk monitoring programs. Frank is compatible with many public LLMs, including OpenAI, Anthropic and Google, enabling it to continually leverage updates from the world's foremost AI companies to remain at the cutting edge of performance and capability. Enterprise-grade security &ndash; including an on-premise deployment option &ndash; with comprehensive data protection is a fundamental part of the offering.</p>
<p>Travis Schwab, Eventus CEO, said: "We're excited about the groundbreaking nature of Frank AI and the power it puts into our clients' hands for compliance and risk analysis. It provides extreme flexibility, adapting to different analytical needs and user expertise levels. We've spent the past year investing significantly in processing infrastructure to provide us with much greater scale to handle the needs of the world's largest financial institutions. As we transition our clients to the new architecture, they can deploy Frank AI within hours, enjoy seamless integration with their existing technology infrastructure and leverage the full range of capabilities it will provide. Clients in beta testing have been enthusiastic about its effectiveness and potential."</p>
<p>Frank AI enables queries using conversational English as a chat interface into Validus data, allowing users to transform their daily workflow and interact on-demand with their real-time data intuitively without compromising on transparency, repeatability or security. They can ask free-form questions without needing advanced programming or coding expertise and generate reports as well as extract insights and deterministic results from their queries. Users can automate manual tasks, including report generation and query building.</p>
<p>For example, instead of navigating complex database queries or multiple system interfaces, an analyst can say: "Show me all cross-market wash trading patterns involving equity and futures for Client XYZ in the past 30 days, including related party analysis." Frank AI processes this request, analyzes the relevant data across multiple asset classes and presents comprehensive results with full audit trails &ndash; a task that previously required hours of manual investigation across multiple systems.</p>
<p>Unlike generic generative AI models which interpret existing text and provide probabilistic answers, Frank AI was designed specifically for financial compliance and surveillance analytics. Repeatable querying ensures accuracy, reducing the risk of AI "hallucinations," or incorrect, unpredictable or misleading responses common in generative AI. Data never leaves the secure host, enabling full compliance and protection of sensitive information. The AI is trained on Validus-specific data tables for contextual accuracy and relevant results, with users able to retrieve, analyze and interact with live data, returning precise, fact-based results. Frank AI assists users in generating reports with structured, actionable insights rather than open-ended text interpretation.</p>
<p>Martina Rejsj&ouml;, Eventus Vice President, Product Management, said: "Frank AI sets a new standard for AI in financial compliance by solving the fundamental challenge that has prevented widespread AI adoption in regulated environments &ndash; the need for deterministic, auditable and secure AI responses. Frank AI delivers consistent, traceable results that compliance teams can trust and regulators can verify. Our commitment to the need for explainability and regulatory readiness has defined our AI roadmap. This breakthrough enables our clients to harness the power of AI while maintaining full regulatory compliance and operational control."</p>
<p>Eventus has used machine learning for many years, primarily for alert remediation. No competitor combines advanced analytics with procedural automation, preserving supportable information and explainability that compliance professionals need to satisfy any audit or regulatory inquiry. Frank AI takes the firm's advanced intelligence capabilities to an entirely new level, Schwab said.</p>

<title>EEX’s Nordic Power Liquidity Programme Drives Volume Growth In First Month</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/eexs-nordic-power-liquidity-programme-drives-volume-growth-in-first-month-2025108/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/eexs-nordic-power-liquidity-programme-drives-volume-growth-in-first-month-2025108/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The European Energy Exchange (EEX) has seen a significant traded volume growth on its Nordic Power derivatives market following the start of the comprehensive liquidity programme on 1 September.</p>
<p>The total monthly volume exceeded 2 TWh, a 334% growth compared to the same period last year, which was the highest reported monthly volume in 2025. In September alone, trading volumes exceeded the volume level of the total first half of the year (January &ndash; June 2025; 1.8 TWh) The first month of the programme also saw the first trade in the Norwegian NO3 zone trade, in addition to several trades concluded with System Price and other Danish and Swedish Zonal futures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The EEX member base on the Nordic power derivatives market covers Scandinavian, continental European and US-based market participants. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Peter Reitz, CEO of EEX, comments: &ldquo;<em>While the market is just starting to kick off, it&rsquo;s positive to see that the Nordic trading community, including international and local trading participants, is ready to restore the volumes and thus liquidity on this market. We are delighted to see the significant growth over the first month of our initiatives and looking forward to working together to drive this trend forward.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>EEX&rsquo;s product offering for the region includes both Nordic System Price contracts, the so-called Zonal Futures with price determination for each Nordic delivery area, and Implied EPADs, a combination of Zonal Futures and the Nordic System Price Futures, which provide the benefit of the location spread effect.

<title>Bank Of England: Financial Policy Committee Record – October 2025</title>

<p><span>The Financial Policy Committee (FPC) meets to identify risks to financial stability and agree policy actions aimed at safeguarding the resilience of the UK financial system.</span></p>
<div class="section-heading">
<h2 id="chapter-0">Record of the Financial Policy Committee meeting on 2 October 2025</h2>
<div class="box-highlight">
<h3><a id="_Hlk193965425"></a>Headline judgements and policy actions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Risks associated with geopolitical tensions, global fragmentation of trade and financial markets, and pressures on sovereign debt markets remain elevated. The risk of a sharp market correction has increased. A crystallisation of such global risks could have a material impact on the UK as an open economy and global financial centre.</li>
<li>Despite persistent material uncertainty around the global macroeconomic outlook, risky asset valuations have increased and credit spreads have compressed. Measures of risk premia across many risky asset classes have tightened further since the last FPC meeting in June 2025. On a number of measures, equity market valuations appear stretched, particularly for technology companies focused on Artificial Intelligence (AI). This, when combined with increasing concentration within market indices, leaves equity markets particularly exposed should expectations around the impact of AI become less optimistic.</li>
<li>There have been some notable credit defaults in the US automotive sector since the last meeting. These underscore some of the risks the FPC have previously highlighted around high leverage, weak underwriting standards, opacity, and complex structures.</li>
<li>Term premia in sovereign bond markets have increased in many advanced economies, driven in part by expectations of higher debt issuance. Some key jurisdictions have experienced political uncertainty over the level and pace of reforms to improve the fiscal outlooks (e.g. political deadlocks in France and Japan). This increases the vulnerability of sovereign debt markets and adds to pressure on governments&rsquo; capacity to respond to shocks.</li>
<li>In the US, there has been continued commentary about Federal Reserve independence. Central bank operational independence underpins monetary and financial stability &ndash; and therefore lowers borrowing costs for households and businesses. A sudden or significant change in perceptions of Federal Reserve credibility could result in a sharp re-pricing of US dollar assets, including in US sovereign debt markets, with the potential for increased volatility, risk premia, and global spillovers.</li>
<li>Uncertainty around the global risk environment increases the risk that markets have not fully priced in possible adverse outcomes, and a sudden correction could occur should any of these risks crystallise. A sharp correction could interact with vulnerabilities in the system of market-based finance, adversely affecting the cost and availability of finance for households and businesses. As an open economy with a global financial centre, the risk of spillovers to the UK financial system from such global shocks is material.</li>
<li>Domestically, the Committee judged that UK households and corporates have remained resilient but face continued pressure from higher costs of living and the continued adjustment to higher borrowing costs.</li>
<li>The FPC maintains its judgement that the UK banking system has the capacity to support households and businesses even if economic and financial conditions were to be substantially worse than expected.</li>
<li>The FPC decided to maintain the UK countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) rate at 2%.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>1: The Financial Policy Committee (FPC) seeks to ensure the UK financial system is prepared for, and resilient to, the wide range of risks it could face, so that it is able to absorb rather than amplify shocks, and serve UK households and businesses, thus supporting stability and long-term growth in the UK economy.</p>
<p>2: The Committee met on 2 October 2025 to agree its view on the outlook for UK financial stability. The FPC discussed the risks faced by the UK financial system and assessed the resilience of the system to those risks. On that basis, the Committee agreed its intended policy actions.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-0-0">The overall risk environment</h3>
<p>3: Risks associated with geopolitical tensions, global fragmentation of trade and financial markets, and pressures on sovereign debt markets remained elevated. The risk of a sharp market correction had increased. A crystallisation of such global risks could have a material impact on the UK as an open economy and global financial centre.</p>

<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-1">Global risk outlook and vulnerabilities in financial markets</h3>
<p>4: Measures of risk premia across many risky asset classes had further tightened since the last FPC meeting in June 2025, and credit spreads remained compressed despite high levels of uncertainty.</p>
<p>5: Equity market valuations had increased since Q2, to near all-time highs, partly driven by strong Q2 earnings of US technology firms. The price appreciation of the largest technology firms this year had increased the concentration within US equity indices to record levels. The market share of the top 5 members of the S&amp;P 500, at close to 30%, was higher than at any point in the past 50 years.</p>
<p>6: Equity valuations appeared stretched, particularly in backward-looking metrics in the US. For example, the earnings yield implied by the Cyclically-Adjusted Price-to-Earnings (CAPE) ratio was close to the lowest level in 25 years &ndash; comparable to the peak of the dot com bubble. Forward-looking valuation metrics and compression in US equity risk premia also remained elevated relative to historical levels, with the S&amp;P 500 at a one-year forward price-to-earnings ratio of 25 times, but remained below the levels reached during the dot com bubble. Some technology companies were trading at valuation ratios which implied high future earnings growth, and concentrations within US equity indices meant that any AI-led price adjustment would have a high level of pass-through into the returns for investors exposed to the aggregate index.</p>
<p>7: The Committee noted the future outlook for valuations was uncertain, with both downside and upside risks. Downside factors included disappointing AI capability/adoption progress or increased competition, which could drive a re-evaluation of currently high expected future earnings. Material bottlenecks to AI progress &ndash; from power, data, or commodity supply chains &ndash; as well as conceptual breakthroughs which change the anticipated AI infrastructure requirements for the development and utilisation of powerful AI models could also harm valuations, including for companies whose revenue expectations are derived from high levels of anticipated AI infrastructure investment.</p>
<p>8: Many measures of risk premia had compressed further since the Q2 meeting, with global credit spreads getting close to historically low levels and leveraged loan spreads remaining in the bottom quartile. The risk of sharp corrections in asset prices remained high. There had been some notable credit defaults since the last meeting. These involved two US corporates active in the automotive sector. While operating different business models, their financing appeared to display several common factors including high leverage, weak underwriting standards, opacity, complex structures, and the degree of reliance on credit rating agencies, illustrating how corporate defaults could impact bank resilience and credit markets simultaneously. These events highlighted some of the risks the FPC had previously set out.</p>
<p>9: Existing vulnerabilities in market-based finance set out in the July 2025 Financial Stability Report (FSR) remained, and could amplify price moves across markets, potentially affecting the availability and cost of credit in the UK.</p>
<p>10: The economic impacts of US tariffs, and reciprocal tariffs on US goods in other jurisdictions, had not yet been fully realised. The impact on businesses in heavily impacted industries &ndash; such as manufacturing, automotives and construction &ndash; remained unclear. Uncertainty around further developments in trade policy posed a risk to the global macroeconomic outlook. While measures of correlation between the dollar and US assets had returned to within historical norms, this could change as investors reassess their positions.</p>
<p>11: In the US, there had been continued commentary about Federal Reserve independence. Central bank operational independence underpins monetary and financial stability &ndash; and therefore lowers borrowing costs for households and businesses. A sudden or significant change in perceptions of Federal Reserve credibility could result in a sharp re-pricing of US dollar assets, including in US sovereign debt markets, with the potential for increased volatility, risk premia, and global spillovers. The consequences for other sovereign borrowing costs, which had tended to be correlated with US interest rates, would be a key uncertainty in such a scenario.</p>
<p>12: World and Advanced Economies Gross Debt to GDP ratios increased to 92.3% and 108.5%, respectively, in 2024 and were forecast to increase each year to 2030 &ndash; peaking at 99.6% and 113.3%, respectively.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financial-policy-committee-record/2025/october-2025#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[1]</a></sup>&nbsp;Term premia in sovereign bond markets had increased in many advanced economies, driven in part by higher real interest rates as the outlook for debt issuance was high. Some key jurisdictions had experienced political uncertainty over the level and pace of reforms to improve the fiscal outlook (e.g. political deadlocks in France and Japan). These challenges had been reflected in sovereign debt yields.</p>
<p>13: As highlighted in the July FSR, there were a number of risk channels through which pressures on sovereign debt globally could affect financial stability, including in the UK via cross-border spillovers. These channels included: higher interest rates leading to tighter global financial conditions; increased market volatility interacting with vulnerabilities in market-based-finance; the reduced ability of governments to respond to future shocks; and the potential for capital outflows from overseas investors. Correlations between movements in yields across sovereign issuers could act to transmit and amplify stress in government bond markets.</p>
<p>14: Global geopolitical risks remained elevated. Conflicts in Europe and the Middle East had raised concerns about global energy supply. There had been concerns that these conflicts might escalate and create supply chain volatility. However, oil prices and shipping costs had moderated since the Q2 meeting.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-2">UK Household and corporate debt vulnerabilities</h3>
<p>15: The Committee judged that UK households and corporates had remained resilient, but faced continued pressure from the adjustment to higher debt servicing costs and the cost of living.</p>
<p>16: The outlook for households was gradually improving as the share of households expected to refix at higher rates was falling. The aggregate household debt to income ratio was at its lowest level since 2001. Lenders had changed their behaviour following the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) statement on mortgage stress rates in March. A number of lenders had recently taken up the Prudential Regulatory Authority's (PRA) option to modify their loan-to-income (LTI) flow limit, following the FPC&rsquo;s updated Recommendation in Q2, but the full impact of these policy changes had not yet been felt in the mortgage market.</p>
<p>17: Aggregate measures of UK corporate debt remained significantly below their pandemic peaks. Some highly leveraged corporate borrowers relying on market-based finance remained particularly exposed to global shocks. But the share of vulnerable borrowers with low interest coverage ratios had remained steady since Q2. The FPC was considering the availability of finance for high growth potential SMEs as part of its work on supporting economic growth and welcomed the publication of a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/bank-overground/2025/unlocking-growth-what-can-the-literature-tell-us-about-whats-holding-back-high-growth-firms">staff literature review</a>. The FPC would present its conclusions on this work in Q4.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-3"><a id="_Hlk194308082"></a>Banking sector resilience</h3>
<p>18: The FPC maintained its judgement that the UK banking system had the capacity to support households and businesses, even if economic and financial conditions were to be substantially worse than expected.</p>
<p>19: The UK banking system remained appropriately capitalised, had high levels of liquidity and asset quality remained strong. Aggregate resilience for the major UK banks across the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) risk-weighted capital ratio, Tier 1 leverage ratio and the liquidity coverage ratio were broadly unchanged compared to Q1 results at 14.5%, 5.1% and 151%, respectively. Major UK banks continued to report robust earnings, with return on tangible equity above their cost of equity and the aggregate Price to Tangible Book ratio reaching 1.3 times.</p>
<p>20: The FPC discussed its setting of the UK CCyB rate. The Committee&rsquo;s principal aim in setting the UK CCyB rate was to help ensure that the UK banking system was better able to absorb shocks without an unwarranted restriction in essential services, such as the supply of credit, to the UK real economy. Setting the UK CCyB rate enabled the FPC to adjust the capital requirements of the UK banking system to the changing scale of risk of losses on banks&rsquo; UK exposures over the course of the financial cycle. The approach therefore included an assessment of financial vulnerabilities and banks' capacity to absorb such losses, including the potential impact of shocks.</p>
<p>21: In considering the appropriate setting of the UK CCyB rate, the FPC discussed its judgements around underlying vulnerabilities that could amplify economic shocks. The Committee noted that while the global risk environment remained elevated, UK households and corporates remained resilient in aggregate and credit conditions reflected the macroeconomic outlook. The UK banking system also remained resilient, maintaining appropriate levels of capital.</p>
<p>22: In view of these considerations, the FPC decided to maintain the UK CCyB rate at 2%. Maintaining a neutral setting of the UK CCyB rate in the region of 2% would help to ensure that banks continued to have capacity to absorb unexpected future shocks without an unwarranted restriction in essential services, such as the supply of credit, to the UK real economy.</p>
<p>23: The Committee would continue to monitor the evolution of financial conditions closely, as well as reviewing the results of the 2025 Bank Capital Stress Test, to ensure the setting of the CCyB remained appropriate.</p>
<p>24: In line with its statutory obligations, the FPC reviewed its Direction to the PRA on the leverage ratio, issued in September 2022.</p>
<p>25: The FPC continued to consider a leverage ratio to be an essential part of the framework for capital requirements for the UK banking system, and judged that the leverage ratio set out in the 2022 Direction should remain unchanged.</p>
<p>26: Having regard to the interaction between monetary and macroprudential policy, the Committee confirmed the appropriateness of continuing to exclude central bank reserves from the leverage ratio, and of not recalibrating the minimum leverage ratio requirement of 3.25% to reflect an increase in reserves since 2016. The FPC would keep this under review as part of future reviews of the leverage ratio framework.</p>
<p>27: More generally, as noted in the 2025 Q2 Record, the Committee would refresh its assessment of the overall level of capital requirements in the UK banking system and provide an update on progress and next steps in the December 2025 FSR. Given it is an important part of the capital framework, the leverage ratio would form part of the considerations. The Committee agreed that robust prudential standards and a resilient financial system supported growth and competitiveness by ensuring a continuous supply of financing to the real economy even in times of stress or high uncertainty, and by providing firms, customers, and counterparties with reassurance that they could do business in the UK safely and with confidence.</p>
<p>28: The FPC welcomed the commencement of the Bank Resolution (Recapitalisation) Act 2025 on 16 July. The Act introduced a new recapitalisation payment mechanism, primarily designed to facilitate UK small bank resolution if that was in the public interest. The FPC supported this targeted enhancement of the UK bank resolution regime which had helped to ensure the regime remains fit for purpose and ready for use.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-4">Resilience of the gilt repo market</h3>
<p>29: The FPC welcomed the publication of the Bank&rsquo;s Discussion Paper&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/paper/2025/discussion-paper/enhancing-the-resilience-of-the-gilt-repo-market">Enhancing the resilience of the gilt repo market</a>. The Discussion Paper seeks views from market participants on the effectiveness and impact of a range of potential reforms to enhance the resilience of the gilt repo market in stress. It focuses on greater central clearing of gilt repo and minimum haircuts on non-centrally cleared gilt repo transactions, as well as views on a broader range of other potential initiatives. The Committee noted that this work would help advance a finding of last year&rsquo;s System Wide Exploratory Scenario exercise that there was merit in exploring market structure reforms to improve resilience in this area.</p>
<p>The following members of the Committee were present at the 2 October Policy meeting:</p>

<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span lang="EN-GB">The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the financial markets regulator and supervisor for the EU, has announced the upcoming publication of SMS for equity and equity-like financial instruments. This announcement is intended to assist market participants with their preparations to apply the new quoting requirements, even though the official implementation date has not yet been specified.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<div>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span lang="EN-GB">The Markets in Financial Regulation Review (MIFIR) has introduced lower and upper limits to the new quoting obligations for SIs. The revised regulatory technical standard (RTS) 1, once published in the Official Journal (OJ) in the coming weeks, will introduce several provisions. Although the exact publication date is not yet known, ESMA is reminding some of these changes now to enable market participants to prepare in advance.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span lang="EN-GB">Among the provisions applicable 20 days after publication are:&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;- the minimum quoting size for SIs and</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span lang="EN-GB">- the threshold up to which transparency obligations apply to SIs.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span lang="EN-GB">Both thresholds depend on the standard market size (SMS), determined by the average value of transactions (AVT) liquidity bands which has been recalibrated in the RTS 1. The day before the application date of the revised RTS 1, ESMA will publish the SMS for liquid equity and equity-like financial instruments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span lang="EN-GB">The full list of new SMS will be available through&nbsp;</span><a href="https://registers.esma.europa.eu/publication/searchRegister?core=esma_registers_fitrs_files"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">FITRS in the XML</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;and through the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://registers.esma.europa.eu/publication/searchRegister?core=esma_registers_fitrs_nonequities"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Register web interface</span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">. </span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span lang="EN-GB">Another important provision applying 20 days after the publication in the OJ is the exclusion of give-up and give-in transactions from post-trade transparency reporting when executed off venue.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span lang="EN-GB">The remaining RTS 1 provisions, including a new set of pre-trade transparency requirements and amended post-trade transparency details, will take effect on 2 March 2026.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<title>US Federal Agencies Issue Proposal To Focus Supervision On Material Financial Risks</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/us-federal-agencies-issue-proposal-to-focus-supervision-on-material-financial-ri-2025108/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the agencies) today issued a joint notice of proposed rulemaking that would continue their effort to focus supervision on material financial risks. Among other things, the proposal would define the term &ldquo;unsafe or unsound practice&rdquo; for purposes of section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and revise the supervisory framework for the issuance of matters requiring attention (MRAs) and other supervisory communications.</p>
<p>By establishing a uniform definition for the term &ldquo;unsafe or unsound practice&rdquo; for the purposes of the agencies&rsquo; enforcement and supervisory authority under 12 U.S.C. 1818, the proposed rule would promote greater clarity and certainty regarding certain enforcement and supervision standards and ensure bank supervisors prioritize concerns related to material financial risks over those regarding policies, process, documentation, and other nonfinancial risks. The proposed rule would also establish uniform standards for when and how the agencies may communicate MRAs and non-binding supervisory observations as part of the examination process. Finally, the proposal would provide for the tailoring of enforcement actions and MRAs.</p>
<p>Comments on the attached proposal are due 60 days after the date of publication in the&nbsp;<em>Federal Register</em>.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the agencies) today issued a joint notice of proposed rulemaking that would codify the elimination of reputation risk from their supervisory programs.</p>
<p>The proposed rule would define &ldquo;reputation risk&rdquo; and prohibit the agencies from criticizing or taking adverse action against an institution on the basis of reputation risk. The proposed rule would also prohibit the agencies from requiring, instructing, or encouraging an institution to close customer accounts or take other actions on the basis of a person or entity&rsquo;s political, social, cultural, or religious views or beliefs, constitutionally protected speech, or solely on the basis of politically disfavored but lawful business activities perceived to present reputation risk.</p>
<p>This proposed rulemaking would also respond to concerns expressed in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/08/12/2025-15341/guaranteeing-fair-banking-for-all-americans" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Executive Order 14331,&nbsp;<em>Guaranteeing Fair Banking for All Americans</em></a>, that the use of reputation risk can be a pretext for restricting law-abiding individuals&rsquo; and businesses&rsquo; access to financial services on the basis of political or religious beliefs or lawful business activities.</p>

<title>US Comptroller Of The Currency Issues Statement On Areas Of Focus As FDIC Board Member</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/us-comptroller-of-the-currency-issues-statement-on-areas-of-focus-as-fdic-board-2025107/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/us-comptroller-of-the-currency-issues-statement-on-areas-of-focus-as-fdic-board-2025107/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Comptroller of the Currency Jonathan V. Gould issued the following statement today at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation&rsquo;s (FDIC) board meeting about his areas of focus in his capacity as an FDIC board member:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for the warm welcome to the FDIC board. I am very excited to work with Acting FDIC Chairman Hill and Director Vought to advance the President&rsquo;s agenda on matters both interagency and FDIC-specific. With respect to the former, we will be considering several interagency initiatives today in which the OCC and FDIC teams worked collaboratively and that exemplify how the interagency process works best. With respect to FDIC-specific matters, I intend to focus on and look forward to working with the Acting Chairman on the following areas:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Rebuilding resolution execution capabilities. I want to distinguish specifically here between resolution &ldquo;execution&rdquo;&mdash;the ability to take actions that facilitate orderly resolution&mdash;and resolution &ldquo;planning&rdquo;&mdash;the hypothetical exercise of how an organization would or should fail. I am skeptical of the efficacy of the latter as well as, in some cases, the legality of related agency requirements and expectations. On the other hand, resolution execution is one of the FDIC&rsquo;s core functions, and I will be focused on ensuring that the FDIC has the capabilities to carry out these core functions effectively. Relatedly, and as I have previously said in Congressional testimony following the bank failures of 2023, I believe greater transparency into the FDIC&rsquo;s actions during that time should inform our efforts to improve its resolution execution in the future.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Clarifying the agency&rsquo;s approach to the management of the Deposit Insurance Fund. The methodologies employed by the agency to calculate insurance premiums or determine ratings that affect premiums, whether in the ordinary course or for special assessments, have, at times, lacked clarity and have spawned litigation, gaming or both. Insurance premiums should be clear, fair, and designed to limit market distortions.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Addressing remaining issues around agency culture. I know the FDIC has already taken a number of steps under Acting Chairman Hill&rsquo;s leadership to address these past abuses and restore a culture of accountability. I look forward to supporting his continued reform efforts.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;Reforming the FDIC&rsquo;s process for evaluating deposit insurance applications. The agency&rsquo;s approach since the Financial Crisis has been an impediment to the chartering of new banks in this country. This needs to change if we want to restore a dynamic banking system. As the statutory factors for granting deposit insurance are largely taken into account by the chartering authority, the FDIC should perform a circumscribed review, as it did in the years following the enactment of FDICIA. The OCC is committed to collaborating with the FDIC to align and improve upon our de novo bank application process. It is vitally important for all federal banking agencies to have clear and transparent application processes with established timeframes that are actually followed absent extraordinary circumstances, whether for chartering, deposit insurance, business combinations, or other applications.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;Supporting state bank preemption rights. Federal preemption is not the exclusive purview of the federal banking system. In the 1997 amendments to the Riegle-Neal Act, Congress put state banks on parity with national banks when it comes to preemption of state laws affecting host state branches. Similarly, state banks benefit from interest rate preemption under Section 27 of the FDI Act. State banks should get the benefit of this federal preemption, and I encourage the FDIC to take additional steps to support these Congressionally-granted rights.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;Updating our understanding of bank funding. The FDIC, like the OCC, still utilizes funding and deposit categories that do not have clear predictive value when it comes to managing liquidity risk. We should re-examine these antiquated notions and develop a more flexible predictive framework going forward, including for assessments.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;Supporting community banks. The FDIC supervises more community banks than any other federal banking agency. These institutions are vitally important to our economy and our local communities. For too long, regulation and supervision have been insufficiently tailored for community banks, which has hampered their ability to serve our communities and drive economic growth. The Acting Chairman is already taking steps to deliver relief on this front. I support these efforts, and the OCC is moving in similar fashion.</p>
<p>I thank the Acting Chairman for his indulgence in letting me outline my areas of focus, and I look forward to working with him and Director Vought on these and other matters. I am confident that the FDIC is now back on track under the Acting Chairman&rsquo;s leadership.</p>

<title>14m Unfair Motor Loans Due Compensation Under UK Financial Conduct Authority-Proposed Scheme</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/14m-unfair-motor-loans-due-compensation-under-uk-financial-conduct-authority-pro-2025107/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Payouts on an expected 14m unfair motor finance agreements could start next year, under an industry-wide compensation scheme proposed by the FCA.</p>
<div class="fca-about"><section class="copy-block fca-about">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA estimates people would receive around &pound;700 per agreement, on average. Based on the number of consumers the FCA estimates could take part in the scheme, lenders could pay out &pound;8.2 billion in compensation.</p>
<p>Motor finance companies broke laws and regulations in force at the time by failing to disclose important information. This led to unfairness, with consumers denied the chance to negotiate or find a better deal and, in some instances, paying more for their loan. &nbsp;</p>
<p>A compensation scheme is the best, most efficient way of getting compensation to those owed it and would make it simpler for those who would otherwise struggle to claim. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Research commissioned by the FCA shows almost half of those aware of possible compensation, but who had not yet made a claim, (46%) cite a lack of clarity on whether a claim would be eligible as a barrier, and nearly a quarter (24%) say uncertainty about the level of compensation makes it less likely they would seek compensation. However, 81% of those who were considering making a claim say a compensation scheme would give them the confidence to do so.</p>
<p>Nikhil Rathi, chief executive of the FCA, said:</p>
<p>'Many motor finance lenders did not comply with the law or the rules. Now we have legal clarity, it&rsquo;s time their customers get fair compensation. Our scheme aims to be simple for people to use and lenders to implement. &nbsp;</p>
<p>'We recognise that there will be a wide range of views on the scheme, its scope, timeframe and how compensation is calculated. On such a complex issue, not everyone will get everything they would like. But we want to work together on the best possible scheme and draw a line under this issue quickly. That certainty is vital, so a trusted motor finance market can continue to serve millions of families every year.'</p>
<p>The scheme would be free to access for consumers and cost-effective for firms. Without a scheme, many cases would go through the courts or the Financial Ombudsman Service, resulting in significantly higher legal and administrative costs for firms and consumers, lengthy delays and uncertain outcomes for all involved. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The FCA is now asking for feedback. It has sought to balance several principles to deliver an easy-to-access and simple-to-deliver scheme, providing fair compensation promptly while ensuring the continued integrity of the motor finance market. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>How the scheme would work</h2>
<p>The scheme would cover motor finance agreements taken out between 6 April 2007 and 1 November 2024 where commission was payable by the lender to the broker. &nbsp;Those who are concerned they weren&rsquo;t told key details about their motor finance arrangement &ndash; for example, about commission payments &ndash; should complain to their lender now if they haven&rsquo;t done so already. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Four in 10 (41%) of those who've had motor finance agreements and know about possible compensation are unaware they needn&rsquo;t use a claims management or law firm to make a claim. However, there&rsquo;s no need as people can&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/consumers/car-finance-complaints" title="Car finance claims">submit their own complaint</a>&nbsp;using a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/documents/template-motor-finance-complaint-letter.docx" title="template-motor-finance-complaint-letter.docx">template letter (DOCX)</a>&nbsp;on the FCA&rsquo;s website. Those who choose to use a claims manager or law firm could lose a significant amount of any compensation owed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the proposed scheme goes live, lenders will contact those who have already complained. If they don&rsquo;t hear back after 1 month, lenders will assume they should review the case. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Those who have already complained before the scheme gets up and running are likely to receive compensation faster. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Those who haven&rsquo;t complained will be contacted by their lender within 6 months of the scheme starting. People will be asked if they want to opt-in to the scheme to have their case reviewed. They&rsquo;ll have 6 months to decide. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Those motor finance borrowers who don&rsquo;t receive a letter &ndash; for example, because lenders no longer have their details and can&rsquo;t trace them - will have a year from the scheme starting to make a claim. They will be able to do so by making a claim to their lender directly. If consumers don&rsquo;t know who their lender was, there&rsquo;s information on how to check on the FCA website. The FCA will run an advertising campaign to raise awareness of the scheme. &nbsp;</p>
<p>People will only receive compensation under the scheme proposed if they weren&rsquo;t told details of at least one of 3 arrangements between the lender and the broker who sold the loan, often a car dealer, which are found in some motor finance agreements:</p>
<ol>
<li>A discretionary commission arrangement, which allowed the broker to adjust the interest rate the customer would pay to obtain a higher commission.</li>
<li>A high commission arrangement (35% of the total cost of credit and 10% of the loan).</li>
<li>A contractual arrangement or tie between the lender and broker, which provided exclusive or near exclusive rights to lenders to provide credit. &nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>There could be rare circumstances in which a lender may be able to show that even if one or more of these features was undisclosed, that there was no unfairness. Where evidence is missing about what was disclosed, lenders must presume that they didn&rsquo;t give borrowers enough information.</p>
<p>The FCA will monitor if firms are meeting the proposed scheme's rules and will act if they&rsquo;re not. If people disagree with their firm's decision, the Financial Ombudsman will be on hand to assess whether the scheme rules have been followed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Those with a motor finance complaint about inadequate disclosure of a commission or tie that doesn&rsquo;t fall within the 3 features above &ndash; and who are therefore not owed compensation under the proposed scheme &ndash;would only get a different outcome from the Financial Ombudsman if it decides the scheme rules weren&rsquo;t followed. People in this situation could still make a claim in court if they believed they had lost out. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Consumers can choose not to take part in the FCA's compensation scheme and instead go to court, where they may get more or less compensation, based on the facts of their case. However, the outcome of a court claim is uncertain and accounting for legal fees they may pay, many consumers could end up with less. The FCA's scheme is also likely to be faster and simpler than going to court.</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Consults On Motor Finance Compensation Scheme</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We are consulting on an industry-wide scheme to compensate motor finance customers who were treated unfairly between 2007 and 2024.</p>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-why-are-we-proposing-a-scheme-" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/consultation/cp25-27.pdf" title="CP25/27">compensation scheme</a>&nbsp;is the best way to ensure consumers who have lost out receive fair compensation in an orderly, consistent, quick, and efficient way, while ensuring a well-functioning and competitive motor finance market.</p>
<p>An alternative to a compensation scheme would require consumers to complain to firms, then to the Financial Ombudsman Service if dissatisfied with the firm&rsquo;s response, or through the courts. This would result in significantly higher administrative and legal costs for firms and consumers, lengthy delays and uncertain outcomes for all involved.</p>
<h2>Why are we proposing a scheme?</h2>
<p>Many firms broke laws and regulations in force at the time by failing to disclose important information. Our extensive review, covering data from 32m agreements, found widespread failures to adequately disclose the existence and nature of commission and contractual ties between lenders and brokers.</p>
<p>Of the agreements reviewed involving a discretionary commission arrangement (DCA) - where the broker could adjust the interest rate offered to a customer to obtain a higher commission - there was no evidence that the customer had been told about the DCA.</p>
<p>On 1 August 2025, the Supreme Court found a lender acted unfairly &ndash; and therefore unlawfully - because of the high, undisclosed commission paid to the broker and the failure to disclose a contractual tie. On 17 December 2024, the High Court ruled that the Financial Ombudsman was entitled to find that a dealer and lender did not adequately disclose a discretionary commission arrangement and that meant the relationship between the lender and the borrower was unfair.</p>
<p>Inadequate disclosure means consumers were unable to make informed decisions and less likely to negotiate or shop around. Consequently, many may have overpaid on car finance.</p>
<p>There is now sufficient legal clarity to move ahead with a compensation scheme.</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-scope-and-design-of-redress-scheme" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Scope and design of redress scheme</h2>
<p>The scheme would cover regulated motor finance agreements taken out between 6 April 2007 and 1 November 2024 where commission was payable by the lender to the broker.</p>
<p>The Financial Ombudsman and courts consider complaints from 6 April 2007 and therefore firms&rsquo; liabilities arising from their breaches of the law and regulation already exist. The end date is based on when we know firms moved to more transparent practices following the Court of Appeal judgment on 24th October 2024 that was subsequently appealed to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>The majority of motor finance agreements will not qualify for compensation. We estimate 14.2m agreements &ndash; 44% of all agreements made since 2007 &ndash; will be considered unfair because they involve inadequate disclosure of one or more of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>a discretionary commission arrangement</li>
<li>high commission (where the commission is equal to or greater than 35% of the total cost of credit and 10% of the loan)</li>
<li>contractual ties that gave a lender exclusivity or a right of first refusal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our 35%/10% threshold is the point at which our analysis best indicates that borrowing costs may have been more strongly affected by the commission, such that its size would likely to have been a major consideration in the consumer's mind had they been aware of it when they took out the loan. We are inviting feedback on the proposed definition of high commission for the scheme and providing data on alternative thresholds.</p>
<p>We make clear that these thresholds are solely for the purpose of the design of this redress scheme and should not be read across to any other retail financial services market.</p>
<p>We propose enabling lenders to rebut the presumption of unfairness in some limited circumstances. For example, lenders would be entitled to determine there was no unfair relationship under the scheme if:</p>
<ul>
<li>there is evidence of adequate disclosure of the relevant arrangement in question, or</li>
<li>in cases only featuring a DCA, the lender can provide evidence that the broker selected the lowest interest rate at which they would not have made any additional commission, or</li>
<li>disclosure of the relevant arrangement in question was inadequate, but the lender can provide evidence that the consumer was sufficiently sophisticated to have nonetheless been aware of the relevant feature(s).</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, those with a motor finance complaint about inadequate disclosure of a commission or tie that doesn&rsquo;t involve one of the three features above would therefore not receive compensation under the scheme. They would have the right to test this with the Financial Ombudsman, but would only get a different outcome if it decides the scheme rules weren&rsquo;t followed. They could still make a claim in court.</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-opt-in-opt-out" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Opt in / opt out</h2>
<p>We estimate there are already just over 4 million complaints with firms. We propose lenders contact consumers who complained before the scheme starts within 3 months. They will be included in the scheme unless they opt out. If consumers opt out of the scheme, they cannot opt back in.</p>
<p>Consumers who have not complained when the scheme starts would be contacted within 6 months, where lenders can identify them, and asked if they would like to opt-in.</p>
<p>Any consumers who have not been contacted can ask their firm to review their case at any time within one year of the scheme start date. We will run an advertising campaign to raise awareness of the scheme.</p>
<p>Consumers who have already been compensated for complaints covered by the scheme would be excluded. The Financial Ombudsman will resolve complaints they have already received and not through the scheme. Consumers who have had their complaints rejected and not taken them to the Financial Ombudsman will be contacted by lenders and invited to opt in.</p>
<p>While many complaints have been paused since 11 January 2024, and others from December 2024, firms have still been required to progress investigations of complaints. When the scheme goes live, we expect firms to resolve promptly those complaints they already have &ndash; so customers who have already complained are likely to have their case dealt with sooner.</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-redress-calculation" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Redress calculation</h2>
<p>We propose that compensation is calculated in a way which balances the Supreme Court&rsquo;s approach and our evidence of consumer loss, to provide fairness and consistency.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<em>Johnson&nbsp;</em>case considered by the Supreme Court was a very serious case and we do not think that courts would necessarily award the same high level of compensation in all motor finance cases. But consumers whose cases align closely with the&nbsp;<em>Johnson&nbsp;</em>case would under the scheme receive the commission plus interest. We define these as cases involving an undisclosed contractual tie and commission equal to, or greater than, 50% of the total cost of credit and 22.5% of the loan. These serious cases will be relatively rare.</p>
<p>For all other cases, we propose consumers are compensated the average of what we estimate they have overpaid, or lost, and the commission paid, plus interest.</p>
<p>Our estimation of loss is based on economic analysis, drawing on independent statistical advice, that there was a difference in the interest rate charged on loans with discretionary commission arrangements compared to those with flat fee arrangements. For example, it is estimated that a loan with an interest rate of 10% charged to the consumer should have carried a market-adjusted interest rate of 8.3% (an adjustment of 17%). We believe we can also use this estimation as a reasonable proxy for losses in the relatively small number of non DCA cases covered by our scheme that do not align closely with the&nbsp;<em>Johnson&nbsp;</em>case.</p>
<p>We consider the average of the two approaches as the fairest way to reflect the Courts&rsquo; judgments and our legal obligation to consider evidence of loss. We welcome feedback on our proposed approach and provide data on alternative approaches in the consultation.</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-interest" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Interest</h2>
<p>We propose that simple interest should be paid on the compensation, based on the annual average Bank of England base rate per year plus 1% from the date of overpayment to the date compensation is paid. Consumers will be able to challenge this with evidence if they feel this is unfair. We now estimate the weighted average interest rate payable will be 2.09% and have used this for modelling purposes.</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-total-cost-of-redress" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Total cost of redress</h2>
<p>We estimate around 85% of eligible consumers would take part in the scheme, which would mean estimated redress of &pound;8.2bn (including interest). This estimate of 85% is based on participation rates in past redress schemes and our consumer research which shows 14% of past and current motor finance holders do not intend to make a claim. In the very unlikely event of 100% take-up, firms would owe up to &pound;9.7bn in redress. And if there was a lower 70% take up, the redress owed would be &pound;6.8bn. If there is 85% take-up of the scheme, the estimated costs to firms of implementing and operationalising the scheme would be &pound;2.8bn, taking the total cost to &pound;11bn.</p>
<p>We estimate that this would result in consumers being compensated an average of around &pound;700 per agreement.</p>
<p>Inevitably, given the scale and complexity of such a scheme and limitations in the data we have spanning such a long time period, the estimates remain highly indicative and susceptible to change. The consultation sets out the details underpinning these estimates and an accompanying cost-benefit analysis (CBA), reviewed by our independent CBA panel, as well as sensitivity analysis which means estimates could in some circumstances be either higher or lower.</p>
<p>Many firms have raised the possibility of highly automated approaches to paying compensation and we will work closely with them on these and this may help reduce estimated non-redress costs. We will continue to refine all our estimates during the consultation as we receive more precise data and will publish updated estimates alongside our final rules.</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-market-impact" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Market impact</h2>
<p>The motor finance market continues to function well, including after the Supreme Court judgment and our announcement of an intention to consult on a scheme on 3 August 2025. Our detailed analysis concludes there will continue to be good product availability and competition among lenders in the finance market for new and used vehicles. While we cannot rule out some modest impacts on product availability and prices, we estimate the cost of dealing with complaints would be several billion pounds higher in the absence of a redress scheme. In that scenario, impacts on access to motor finance and prices for consumers could be significantly higher with uncertainty continuing for many more years.</p>
<p>We have heard concerns about the impact of paying redress on non-bank, non-captive lenders focused on non-prime markets. Some of these lenders are smaller and have less access to funding than larger motor finance firms focused on other parts of the market. Access to funding for such non-prime lenders had been a challenge even before the motor finance commissions issue became prominent.</p>
<p>Some non-prime lenders have told us they did not engage in discretionary commission or tied arrangements. If that is the case, they are less likely to have to pay redress under the scheme.</p>
<p>These lenders may also be able to rebut the presumption of loss or&nbsp;damage proposed at the liability assessment stage if they have clear evidence that the consumer would not have secured a better offer from any other lender the broker had arrangements with at the time of the transaction. If the presumption of loss or damage is rebutted, the lender would not have to pay any redress to the consumer.</p>
<p>While these non-prime lenders represent a small share of the overall motor finance market, we will remain vigilant to the effect on them as the consultation progresses and as we make final rules.</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-complaints-deadline" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Complaints deadline</h2>
<p>We are also consulting on extending the deadline for firms to send a final response to certain motor finance complaints to 31 July 2026. This will help ensure consistent and orderly outcomes for consumers and minimise disruption to firms and the market. We may shorten the period to align with the timetable of our compensation scheme if confirmed.</p>
<p>We propose no extension to handling complaints about leasing agreements as they are not caught by the legislation relating to unfair relationships and so are not covered by the scheme. Firms need to start sending final responses to any motor leasing complaint from 5 December 2025.</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-our-expectations-of-firms" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Our expectations of firms</h2>
<p>We propose that lenders deliver the scheme, rather than brokers. This will be simpler and ensure more timely and comprehensive redress, given there are many more brokers than lenders. Brokers played a part in the failings and will have to cooperate, providing information lenders need to operate the scheme promptly.</p>
<p>We have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/dear-ceo-letters/motor-finance-action-lenders-brokers.pdf" title="Dear CEO letter">written to motor finance lender and broker CEOs</a>, outlining the preparatory steps we expect them to take now, as well as when the scheme starts.&nbsp;<br />We would expect firms to:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>accurately identify and effectively contact impacted consumers (with support from third parties where required)</li>
<li>gather information to assess whether cases are in scope of the scheme and liability (with support from brokers as required) and reach appropriate decisions</li>
<li>ensure compensation calculations are accurate, and payments are made quickly</li>
<li>ensure no undue delay at any stage of the proposed redress scheme.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-the-principles-underpinning-a-redress-scheme" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>The principles underpinning a redress scheme</h2>
<p>In designing this proposed scheme, we have sought to balance key principles so that the scheme would:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be simpler for consumers than bringing an individual complaint, meaning more consumers, particularly vulnerable ones, receive compensation they are owed.</li>
<li>Provide timely and fair compensation to consumers, with clear communication about how their claim is being dealt with, as we will set rules firms must follow and will act if they don&rsquo;t.</li>
<li>Be comprehensive so consumers do not need to go through the courts to secure compensation.</li>
<li>Be free to access for consumers and cost effective for firms. Without a scheme, many cases would go through the courts or the Financial Ombudsman, resulting in significantly higher administrative costs for firms and lengthy delays. Consumers do not need to use a claims management company or law firm to make a claim. We set out on 6 October 2025 how we have joined forces with other regulators to deal with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/regulators-join-forces-tackle-poor-claims-management-practices" title="Regulators join forces to tackle poor claims management practices">some poor claims management practices</a>.</li>
<li>Protect the integrity of the market. Our analysis shows the motor finance market will continue to function well, as it has been since we announced our intention to propose a scheme, and will continue to attract investment, with limited disruption to competition. We continue to monitor securities and funding markets for motor finance firms, and these remain orderly and functioning.</li>
<li>Give affected consumers certainty that they have had the opportunity to secure compensation, and firms and investors finality by drawing a line under this issue.</li>
</ul>
<p>To achieve this balance on such a complex issue has required us to make regulatory judgments on trade-offs. We recognise that not everyone will get everything they would like from a scheme. We welcome views on our proposals and potential alternatives. This feedback will enable us to further enhance our evidence base, assumptions and estimates to ensure a robust and operationally effective scheme. Our aim is to resolve this matter as quickly as possible, in the interest of consumers, firms, the long-term health of the market and investors.</p>
</div>
</section></div>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default" id="section-next-steps" tabindex="-1">
<div class="container">
<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>We are seeking comments on extending the complaint handling rules by 4 November 2025.</p>
<p>The consultation on the proposed redress scheme closes on 18 November 2025.</p>
<p>If we introduce a redress scheme, we expect to publish our policy statement and final rules by early 2026. This timetable depends on the feedback we receive and firms and other parties working constructively together and with us. The scheme would launch at the same time, with consumers starting to receive compensation later in 2026.</p>

<title>FINRA Foundation Releases Findings On Fraud Awareness Among Investors - Half Of Investors Do Not Recognize Warning Signs Of Fraud; Findings Released In Light Of World Investor Week</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In light of World Investor Week (Oct. 6-12), the FINRA Investor Education Foundation (FINRA Foundation) released today first-look findings from its forthcoming report, &ldquo;Investors in the United States: A Report of the National Financial Capability Study,&rdquo; which will be published in December. The report provides an in-depth exploration of the attitudes, behaviors, knowledge and experiences of retail investors in the United States.</p>
<p>As part of the study, researchers asked a sample of investors across the United States a question about investment fraud:</p>
<p class="indentItem"><em><strong>If you heard about an investment opportunity that promises a guaranteed, risk-free 25% annual return every year for the next 5 years, would you invest in it?</strong></em><br /><em><span class="indentItem"><strong>1. Yes</strong></span></em><br /><em><span class="indentItem"><strong>2. No</strong></span></em><br /><em><span class="indentItem"><strong>3. Don&rsquo;t know</strong></span></em><span class="indentItem">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Despite describing guaranteed and very high investment returns, two hallmarks of investment fraud, half of respondents (50%) indicated they would invest in the hypothetical offer, indicating a lack of recognition about the warning signs of fraud. Investors who are younger, less experienced and less knowledgeable about investing are even more likely to say they would invest in the &ldquo;opportunity.&rdquo; The data further reveals that investors who engage with investments that can carry greater risk, such as cryptocurrencies and meme stocks, as well as those who rely on social media for financial information, are particularly open to a hypothetical investment that promises much more than it can deliver.</p>
<p class="text-align-center"><strong>Would invest in a &ldquo;guaranteed high-return&rdquo; opportunity</strong></p>
<p class="text-align-center"><img alt="Examples of Would invest in a &ldquo;guaranteed high-return&rdquo; opportunity" height="249" src="https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/2025-10/nfcs-news-img1-100625.png" width="678" /></p>
<p>Notably, the differences by income in the proportion of investors willing to invest in the hypothetical offer were less pronounced, with only four percentage-points separating those earning under $50,000 and those earning $100,000 or more. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-center"><strong>Would invest in a &ldquo;guaranteed high-return&rdquo; opportunity</strong></p>
<p class="text-align-center"><img alt="Example of Would invest in a &ldquo;guaranteed high-return&rdquo; opportunity" height="226" src="https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/2025-10/nfcs-news-img2-100625.png" width="383" /></p>
<p>&ldquo;These findings reveal that a concerning number of investors might be vulnerable to investment fraud,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/about/executives/gerri-walsh">Gerri Walsh, President of the FINRA Foundation</a>. &ldquo;All investments involve some level of risk, and investors must understand their own risk tolerance to make informed decisions. At the same time, investors must learn to spot the red flags of investment fraud&mdash;including the promise of little to no risk with unusually high returns,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>The full report, part of the FINRA Foundation&rsquo;s triennial&nbsp;<a href="https://finrafoundation.org/national-financial-capability-study" target="_blank">National Financial Capability Study</a>, will provide comprehensive insights to help financial professionals, educators, regulators and others serve and protect investors of all backgrounds and experience levels.</p>
<p><strong>Additional findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investing knowledge:</strong>&nbsp;Investors with high investing knowledge were less likely to invest in the hypothetical opportunity than those with low investing knowledge. Thirty-six percent of those with high investing knowledge report they would invest, compared to 49% of those with low investing knowledge.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto and meme stock investors:</strong>&nbsp;More crypto investors report they would invest in this &ldquo;opportunity&rdquo; than non-crypto investors (65% vs. 44%, respectively), while those who have purchased a meme-stock or viral investment are even more likely to look favorably upon the hypothetical investment than those who have not purchased a meme stock (77% vs. 45%, respectively).</li>
<li><strong>Influenced by social media personalities:</strong>&nbsp;Almost three-quarters (72%) of study respondents who at least sometimes make investing decisions based on the advice of a social media personality said they would invest in the hypothetical opportunity. The survey found those relying on social media would be much more likely to invest than those who don&rsquo;t (69% vs. 42%, respectively).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About the National Financial Capability Study</strong></p>
<p>In 2009, the FINRA Investor Education Foundation launched the first national study of financial capability of adults in the United States. Since its start, the National Financial Capability Study has provided data on multiple indicators of capability&mdash;including financial behaviors, attitudes and knowledge.</p>
<p>National Financial Capability Study survey data is collected every three years. The Investor Survey is an online survey of 2,861 U.S. adults who have investments outside of retirement accounts. The data provides detailed information on a wide range of investing topics, such as attitudes towards risk and investing, investor knowledge, and reliance on so-called &ldquo;finfluencers.&rdquo;</p>

<p><section class="page-section">
<div class="section-heading">
<h2 id="chapter-0">Minutes</h2>
<p>Date: 11 June 2025</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-0">Item 1: Welcome</h3>
<p>Nick McLaren (chair) welcomed members to the fifth meeting of the CBDC Academic Advisory Group. He gave a brief update on the upcoming&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/events/2025/september/boe-innovation-money-and-payments">Innovation in Money and Payments Conference</a>&nbsp;highlighting the aim was to bring together academics, central bankers, and industry participants. He noted that the call for papers was open and encouraged members to consider participating and to share amongst their networks.</p>
<p>The chair highlighted recent Bank publications: a design note focusing on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/report/2025/intermediary-roles-and-scheme-rulebook-design-note">digital pound intermediaries</a>&nbsp;and an experiment report on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/report/2025/digital-pound-experiment-report-offline-payments">offline payments</a>.</p>
<p>The chair outlined the agenda for the meeting where each of the five subgroups would give presentations updating the group on their work since the last meeting.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-1">Item 2: Subgroup presentation &ndash; Financial &amp; Monetary Stability</h3>
<p class="span text-highlight">Subgroup headline question: Is a digital pound consistent with the BoE&rsquo;s statutory objectives?</p>
<p>The subgroup explained that a key theme from their work has been considering the risks of low adoption and around a failure to incentivise enough intermediaries to offer digital pound services. But set against that, there are also considerable risks around inaction and not developing a digital pound. In their view it was, therefore, right for the Bank to take a proactive but cautious approach to the design phase. They introduced insights from existing surveys and models, particularly focusing on the topic of adoption and disintermediation of the banking sector.</p>
<p>On adoption, the subgroup highlighted challenges in CBDC-related modelling. Some approaches in the literature rely on theoretical assumptions based on other forms of money, or they use existing banking data. However, the subgroup proposed conducting surveys of households and businesses to improve the accuracy of models of CBDC adoption.</p>
<p>It was noted that early adopters of CBDC are likely to be individuals already using digital assets. This is reflected by some responses to consumer research summarised in the Annex of the digital pound Consultation Paper. They also cited findings from a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bundesbank.de/en/bundesbank/research/survey-on-consumer-expectations-bop-hh/survey-on-consumer-expectations-794568" target="_blank">survey by The Bundesbank<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external">&nbsp;</span></a>, which suggested adoption would vary across the population, influenced by factors such as inflation expectations, demographics, and trust. Bank for International Settlements&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/work1147.pdf" target="_blank">research<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external"></span></a>&nbsp;highlighted that privacy expectations could also be a key determinant of adoption.</p>
<p>Turning to bank disintermediation, the subgroup noted an emerging consensus that CBDC could be welfare-enhancing, though it may also pose risks to financial stability. Two types of disintermediation were identified in the existing literature: slow (linked to CBDC substituting for bank deposits in normal times) and fast (associated with increased withdrawal risks during financial stress). The latter would pose greater risks to financial stability.</p>
<p>To explore these dynamics in greater detail, the subgroup presented a UK-focused agent-based model, aiming to identify likely CBDC adopters, estimate expected adoption, and therefore support an assessment of systemic risk implications.</p>
<p>The model does not include interoperability costs between different forms of money, as they are assumed to be zero. The model adopts Myerson&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s001820050079" target="_blank">binomial framework<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external"></span></a>, where individuals make a binary choice whether to adopt CBDC or not based on an initial probability of successful adoption. Therefore, there is a need to reach a critical mass of adoption before network effects can take over in driving further adoption.</p>
<p>The subgroup summarised their suggestions for further considerations. These included exploring whether limits and remuneration of a digital pound could be tailored to support financial inclusion. They emphasised a need to balance the trade-off between mitigating disintermediation risks through the use of limits and not remunerating a digital pound, versus the public good benefits from universal provision of a new risk-free form of retail money. The group also suggested collaboration between central banks to ensure research and analysis are shared.</p>
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>Members<span>&nbsp;</span>questioned the model&rsquo;s assumption that CBDC is primarily a store of wealth and not a means of payment, as this framing could overstate the risk of bank disintermediation. Members also discussed the differences between switching an account into a digital pound wallet versus the choice of whether to make an individual payment in a digital pound or alternative form of payment.</p>
<p>They also discussed the impact a digital pound would have on existing digital asset markets, and the likelihood of secondary market pricing. Members determined that without full knowledge of banks&rsquo; liquidity positions, it is not possible to fully determine the financial stability risks of CBDC adoption.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-0-2">Item 3: Subgroup discussion &ndash; Security</h3>
<p class="span text-highlight">Subgroup headline question: Does the digital pound design proposition meet best practice for a secure provision?</p>
<p>The subgroup presented an overview of privacy and governance considerations for a digital pound, raising questions around benchmarks, safeguards, and the Bank&rsquo;s role in protecting both individual and collective privacy.</p>
<p>One member challenged the assumption that current UK bank accounts and payment systems are the appropriate benchmark for a digital pound. The subgroup proposed that cash, particularly for everyday transactions, may offer a more meaningful standard, given its anonymity and public trust. They introduced a framework distinguishing between personal privacy (control over one&rsquo;s own data), third-party privacy (where one person&rsquo;s data may reveal information about others), and collective privacy (where aggregated data can shape societal or political outcomes). The subgroup highlighted that even though the Bank and HMT will not have access to personal information, there may still be implications to privacy due to data aggregation by private intermediaries.</p>
<p>The subgroup questioned whether PIPs and ESIPs would be held to equivalent privacy standards and called for stronger safeguards on how these entities collect, use, and monetise data. They emphasised the need for users to be empowered to make informed choices, while also underlining the limitations of individual consent-based models. Instead, they supported structural protections, such as default privacy-preserving settings and regulatory mechanisms, to address the broader externalities of data sharing.</p>
<p>The subgroup supported the Bank&rsquo;s proposal for full anonymity at the core ledger level. They noted that pseudo-anonymity, seen in some blockchain systems, would not be sufficient. Examples from OpenCBDC and Project Hamilton were referenced to illustrate how transaction data can be anonymised effectively. The subgroup also highlighted challenges related to the UK&rsquo;s lack of a national digital ID infrastructure, contrasting it with the EU&rsquo;s progress on EUID.</p>
<p>The subgroup raised concerns about the effectiveness in PIPs being able to carry out sufficient KYC and AML checks in the case where users can hold multiple wallets at different PIPs &ndash; although it was noted banks face similar challenges today. They encouraged the Bank to consider this as part of the design phase and consider the benefits of system-wide fraud analysis.</p>
<p>Finally, the subgroup addressed the challenges and opportunities of offline and cross-border payments. They supported the introduction of offline payments for resilience and privacy, with the potential to replicate the anonymity of cash. However, cross-border use cases were flagged as complex, involving regulatory, enforcement, and data protection challenges. While the Bank&rsquo;s consultation proposed that non-UK residents would be able to hold digital pounds, the subgroup called for greater clarity on the role of non-UK intermediaries and the need for international coordination to manage associated risks.</p>
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>One member asked whether there was a tension between regulatory KYC requirements and the use of privacy-enhancing technologies such as zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). It was clarified that while a user&rsquo;s PIPs would know their customers&rsquo; identities, ZKPs could be used to validate transactions without exposing personal data to the core ledger, maintaining a balance between compliance and privacy.</p>
<p>A discussion followed on whether the system should aim for perfection from the outset. One view stressed the importance of pragmatism &ndash; arguing that the current system already fails to protect privacy and that a &lsquo;good enough&rsquo; solution could still offer meaningful improvements. Others cautioned that launching with an imperfect model could embed foundational flaws that are difficult to correct later.</p>
<p>Concerns were raised about how restrictions on data use and monetisation might affect the competitiveness of PIPs, particularly in comparison to traditional payment systems. The potential impact on innovation and market dynamics was noted. Additionally, the balance of privacy for low-value transactions was questioned, with one member suggesting low value prepaid cards may be warranted.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-3">Item 4: Sarah Breeden Q&amp;A session</h3>
<p>Sarah Breeden, Deputy Governor for Financial Stability, joined the meeting to provide members with her perspective on the Bank&rsquo;s work on a digital pound and how this related to broader work on the future of retail and wholesale payments. She opened the session by expressing her appreciation for the work of the group, highlighting the value of its multidisciplinary expertise and diverse perspectives. She emphasised that the Bank deeply values the AAG&rsquo;s contributions, particularly in areas outside our core areas of expertise, such as privacy, AML/KYC, and behavioural economics.</p>
<p>The AAG&rsquo;s work informs the Bank and HM Treasury&rsquo;s assessment of the case for a digital pound. This includes evaluating the digital pound within the broader payments ecosystem. Sarah noted that the digital pound design phase is part of the Bank&rsquo;s work across the payments landscape, including work on new forms of money such as retail and wholesale CBDC, tokenised deposits and stablecoins, as well as innovation in existing domestic and cross-border payment infrastructure. Sarah noted that the Bank&rsquo;s work aligns with global developments and is being coordinated with other UK authorities, notably HM Treasury. She stressed the importance of supporting innovation, resilience, and effective governance across the financial system.</p>
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>One member asked whether the digital pound should be considered in isolation or as part of a wider account-to-account payments strategy. Sarah agreed that the Bank&rsquo;s work is considering the full payments ecosystem, including improvements to account-to-account infrastructure, tokenised deposits, and stablecoins. A key area of focus was how to achieve interoperability across these different forms of money and infrastructures.</p>
<p>Members also raised concerns about public understanding and the implications for adoption of a digital pound. Anecdotal evidence illustrated the high cost of current payment methods and the need for simpler, more affordable alternatives. The importance of early public education was emphasised, with examples showing how informed debate can shift public opinion. Sarah agreed that public engagement was an important part of the digital pound work, noting citizen panels and academic outreach are being used to gather public perspectives. At this stage engagement was focused on payments industry and more expert audiences, but if a decision were made to progress with a digital pound, then further engagement with the broader public would be necessary.</p>
<p>Questions were also raised about the benefits and costs of disintermediation of the banking sector. One member argued that a digital pound could enhance stability by offering the public a risk-free alternative to commercial bank money and reducing systemic risk. Sarah noted it&rsquo;s also important to consider the impact on lending and the cost of credit.</p>
<p>Members asked about the sequencing of payments innovation, and how the Bank would define success or failure. Sarah responded that the Bank&rsquo;s focus was on achieving public policy objectives such as stability, innovation, and resilience.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-4">Item 5: Subgroup discussion &ndash; Innovation</h3>
<p class="span text-highlight">Subgroup headline question: Is a digital pound likely to meet the core objective of payments innovation?</p>
<p>The subgroup presented findings from their literature review to explore whether a digital pound could catalyse innovation in the UK. The presentation focused on two key themes: payment system efficiency and financial inclusion. Kyeyoung Shin (Sa&iuml;d Business School, University of Oxford) was invited to join this session, reflecting his contribution to research conducted for the subgroup.</p>
<p>In terms of payment system efficiency, the subgroup highlighted that CBDCs could streamline payments by reducing intermediation, enabling faster settlement, supporting 24/7 availability, and fostering competition and innovation. They also offer potential for improved cross-border functionality and user driven programmability. However, challenges include high development costs, the presence of existing digital payment systems, private sector inertia, and risks related to interoperability and cybersecurity.</p>
<p>The subgroup observed that while CBDCs have potential to improve financial inclusion, they are not a universal solution. Their impact depends heavily on design and implementation. Opportunities identified include enabling offline functionality, tiered KYC to reach unbanked populations, reducing merchant acceptance costs, and using smart contracts to support inclusive financial tools. CBDCs could also serve as gateways to broader financial services such as credit, savings, and insurance. However, barriers remain which may limit adoption, particularly among marginalised groups.</p>
<p>The subgroup discussed which potential use cases for a digital pound might prove of most unique value. In particular, they noted that offline capabilities could support digital resilience. It recommended evaluating innovations based on their time to impact, and their alignment with public policy goals.</p>
<p>The presentation also included a case study on China&rsquo;s retail CBDC, e-CNY, which launched in 2020 and has since expanded to 28 cities. Despite promotion &ndash; including salary payments, discounts, and giveaways &ndash; adoption remains relatively limited, with e-CNY accounting for just 0.16% of China&rsquo;s cash-equivalent money supply. Platforms like AliPay and WeChat Pay, which already offer low transaction fees, have limited the incentive to use e-CNY.</p>
<p>The subgroup also raised&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/othp59.htm" target="_blank">Project mBridge<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external"></span></a>, where cross-border CBDC transactions have demonstrated significant efficiency gains compared to SWIFT. These developments were presented as valuable international lessons for the UK&rsquo;s own exploration of cross-border functionality.</p>
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>Members discussed &lsquo;multi-homing&rsquo;, referring to consumers using multiple digital payment platforms simultaneously. It was noted that merchants are generally open to accepting multiple forms of payment, especially when integration is seamless. While platforms like AliPay and WeChat Pay charge fees, these are often lower than other forms of payment system, making them attractive to merchants.</p>
<p>One member questioned the relevance of China&rsquo;s experience for countries like the UK, where debit cards are more common. The issue of interoperability between e-CNY and private platforms was also discussed. It was confirmed that transfers between platforms are now possible. Greater transferability is seen as key to driving adoption and reducing platform dominance. It was suggested that mBridge&rsquo;s effectiveness may be limited without broader CBDC adoption.</p>
<p>Members also discussed tiered wallet access, particularly for foreign users. It was explained that KYC requirements for lower-value wallets may be lower, though a fixed mobile number is typically required. This requirement may be a constraint on foreign users, who often rely on disposable numbers.</p>
<p>The discussion concluded with broad agreement that a digital pound has strong potential to support payments innovation in the UK. However, its success will depend on thoughtful design, ecosystem readiness, and overcoming barriers such as public trust and the dominance of existing platforms. It was also noted that there may be other ways to achieve these goals, through existing or other new digital payments platforms and infrastructure.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-5">Item 6: Bank presentation on the Digital Pound Lab</h3>
<p>The Bank presented an update on the newly launched Digital Pound Lab, a significant step in its practical experimentation phase. The Lab is designed to test real-world use cases in a controlled environment and is intended to inform, but not determine, the final design of a digital pound.</p>
<p>It was emphasised that the Lab is not a pilot and does not involve real money or users. Instead, it serves as an experimental platform for industry participants to explore potential use cases and business models. The Lab&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a id="_Int_teTgiRHV"></a>objectives include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Co-creating and testing use cases with industry</li>
<li>Assessing the viability of emerging business models</li>
<li>Identifying features that support or hinder innovation</li>
<li>Informing the Bank&rsquo;s broader thinking on digital currency technology</li>
</ul>
<p>The infrastructure of the Lab is based on the platform model. The Lab will&nbsp;<a id="_Int_CclOVBym"></a>operate in two phases. The first phase will last up to three months and involve up to six firms. Phase one will test predefined use cases, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Point-of-sale payments</li>
<li>Micro-merchant acceptance</li>
<li>Omnichannel payments</li>
<li>Tourist wallets</li>
<li>Salary payments</li>
<li>Business-to-business conditional payments</li>
<li>Tiered wallets</li>
</ul>
<p>The second phase is a broader call for participation, inviting firms to propose their own innovative use cases. Applications for this phase will open in July, and the second phase is expected to last around 9 months. Findings from the Lab will be shared through demo events, experiment reports, and public statements from participating firms.</p>
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>Members asked whether data generated in the Lab could be shared with academics. The Bank confirmed that only synthetic data would be used, but noted the potential for academic collaboration with participants in the Lab.</p>
<p>Clarification was sought on the distinction between third-party initiation and smart contracts, particularly given the instant nature of digital pound payments. It was explained that the Lab will include functionality to support atomic settlement between tokenised assets in a smart contract platform and digital pound payments in the core system.</p>
<p>The role of software development kits (SDKs) was also discussed. The Bank noted that the Lab would help assess how easily firms can innovate using the infrastructure, and feedback from participants may inform future SDK development.</p>
<p>One member asked whether participants in the Lab are incentivised to participate. The Bank confirmed that participants would not be paid but that the Bank is interested in understanding their business perspectives and motivations.</p>
<p>The potential for the Lab&rsquo;s infrastructure to support broader account-to-account payments was also discussed. It was suggested that, even if a digital pound is some way off, the Lab could help inform improvements to the wider payments system. The Bank agreed that while the architecture may differ, lessons from the Lab could support broader payments innovation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-6">Item 7: Subgroup discussion &ndash; Uniformity &amp; Alternatives</h3>
<p class="span text-highlight">Subgroup headline question: Is a digital pound likely to meet the core objective of money uniformity, and is it the best option?</p>
<p>The subgroup first set out their working definition of uniformity, defined as a fixed 1:1 exchange rate between different forms of money. It was clarified that, in their definition, uniformity does not imply identical features across money types, but rather equal valuation at the margin.</p>
<p>The group noted that full uniformity requires at least one side of the market (supply or demand) to be highly elastic. This has implications for proposed design features such as holding limits, which may restrict elasticity and undermine uniformity, in extremis. In contrast, remuneration was suggested as a tool that could help maintain indifference between forms of money.</p>
<p>The subgroup argued that uniformity is desirable because it reduces transaction costs, supports the public good function of the unit of account, and reinforces the central bank&rsquo;s role in maintaining monetary sovereignty.</p>
<p>They explored the trade-offs involved in pursuing uniformity. While some view it as an all-or-nothing concept, the group noted that economists typically consider marginal trade-offs and that there are some historical monetary regimes where uniformity did not hold at all times and across all forms of money. A key question raised was whether the acceptable trade-off should be determined by the market or by government policy.</p>
<p>The group also examined whether retail access to central bank money is necessary to support uniformity. While the academic literature is not conclusive on whether it plays an essential role in underpinning public trust e, it may play a role in reinforcing the unit of account and monetary sovereignty. The subgroup concluded that the more channels available for converting between different forms of money, the stronger the reinforcement of uniformity.</p>
<p>In closing, the subgroup stated that while they do not believe a digital pound is not strictly necessary to achieve uniformity, it could significantly support it. They proposed three areas for further research:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the critical margins needed to safeguard a fixed exchange rate?</li>
<li>Does retail access to central bank money foster trust in the monetary system?</li>
<li>What are the indirect effects of a digital pound on uniformity?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>One member suggested that uniformity should be considered in both normal and stressed conditions. In times of stress, differences in the attributes of various forms of money could amplify instability, particularly for less-informed users who may struggle to distinguish between them.</p>
<p>The role of a digital pound in enhancing monetary and financial stability was discussed, particularly in contrast to emerging non-bank payment solutions like stablecoins. Members discussed how limits and the existence of deposit insurance may influence how a digital pound was viewed. The chair suggested members consider a state of the world where a broader range of new digital monies emerge.</p>
<p>Members agreed on the importance of a stable and trusted unit of account. It was argued that the long-term case for a digital pound lies in providing a simple, reliable unit of account without relying on a complex network of regulated institutions. The Bank has a role to ensure public access to a trusted benchmark to anchor the monetary system. Others noted that while a digital pound could support growth as a base settlement asset, near-term priorities should focus on solving practical issues, such as high transaction costs for small businesses.</p>
<p>The discussion also touched on international comparisons. It was noted that India&rsquo;s UPI system has achieved significant digitisation without a CBDC, although the Reserve Bank of India was still considering the adoption of a retail CBDC as part of the UPI. The session concluded with reflections on the broader implications of uniformity. Some members questioned whether the existing system was the right benchmark. Current approaches may not be optimal, and the future may demand new solutions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-7">Item 8: Subgroup discussion &ndash; Public and Private</h3>
<p class="span text-highlight">Subgroup headline question: Can a digital pound be financially viable for the public sector and private sector participants?</p>
<p>The subgroup presented their analysis on the financial viability of a digital pound, reframing the question beyond infrastructure costs and revenue models to focus on adoption dynamics, market competition, and incentive structures from both public and private sector perspectives.</p>
<p>The presentation was structured around eight key themes:</p>
<p><span>Adoption and scalability</span>&nbsp;&ndash; it was emphasised that widespread adoption by both consumers and merchants is essential for a digital pound to achieve the scale necessary to justify investment. The interdependence between consumer and merchant uptake was identified as a central challenge, with demand-side behaviours playing a critical role.</p>
<p><span>Current and future payments landscape&nbsp;</span>&ndash; the group highlighted the growing complexity of the payments ecosystem, driven by mobile wallets, buy-now-pay-later services, peer-to-peer platforms, and embedded payments. Large platforms create lock-in effects that pose challenges for new entrants like a digital pound.</p>
<p><span>Geopolitical and regulatory drivers</span>&nbsp;&ndash; communications by policymakers on the digital euro have emphasised the importance of maintaining monetary sovereignty and reducing reliance on non-European payment providers. Initiatives like the digital euro and regulatory frameworks such as the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) are shaping the future of digital payments infrastructure in the EU.</p>
<p><span>Consumer behaviour and preferences</span>&nbsp;&ndash; research suggests UK consumers value real-time payments, cross-device accessibility, simplicity, and customisation. Trust and privacy remain essential. While transactional use of cash is declining, it remains very important for certain groups and continues to be held by a large portion of the population. Data-driven services, such as budgeting tools and loyalty programmes, are becoming standard expectations and should be considered in the digital pound&rsquo;s design.</p>
<p><span>Merchant incentives and barriers to adoption</span>&nbsp;&ndash; research suggests merchants are motivated by lower transaction fees, reduced chargebacks, and operational efficiency. However, integration costs, technical complexity, and lack of interoperability with existing systems remain significant barriers. Adoption is likely to vary by sector, with retail and hospitality showing higher potential.</p>
<p><span>Design and communication&nbsp;</span>&ndash; design features such as privacy, user defined programmability, settlement speed, and budgeting tools were identified as key levers for adoption. Communication strategies, particularly short educational videos, can improve consumer understanding and willingness to adopt. Behavioural economics suggests that awareness, trust, and perceived utility often outweigh rational cost-benefit analysis.</p>
<p><span>Chicken-and-egg problem&nbsp;</span>&ndash; the group addressed the two-sided market dilemma: consumers won&rsquo;t adopt without merchant acceptance, and vice versa. Three potential solutions were proposed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interoperability with existing payment systems</li>
<li>Incentives for early adopters</li>
<li>Strategic partnerships with incumbent players</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Policy and strategic considerations&nbsp;</span>&ndash; the subgroup suggested a digital pound should be positioned as a strategic asset for the UK&rsquo;s financial infrastructure. Delays in developing a digital pound could risk entrenching private alternatives and weakening public control over digital money ecosystems. Financial viability will depend on clear purpose, robust ecosystem design, and targeted adoption strategies.</p>
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>Members discussed that merchant service charges in the UK vary significantly by merchant size. Additional fees from facilitators can often increase costs for small businesses. One member noted the potentially regressive nature of the current system, where high-income consumers often benefit more from credit card rewards which are paid for through merchant fees, and ultimately consumers. This dynamic may partly reinforce a payment structure that favours cards over lower-cost alternatives such as a digital pound.</p>
<p>Concerns were raised about the business model for PIPs. Without clear revenue streams, participation may be unattractive for both incumbents and new entrants. The failure of PayM in the UK was cited as a cautionary example.</p>
<p>The importance of a balanced value proposition across consumers, merchants, and intermediaries was emphasised. It was noted that achieving lower fees for merchants, value-added services for consumers, and commercial viability for intermediaries is essential. The challenge of the Day 1 proposition, when user numbers and features could be limited, was also highlighted.</p>
<p>Members discussed the timeline for the potential launch of a digital pound. It was argued that too long a timeline risks entrenching private digital money solutions and weakening the UK&rsquo;s strategic position. Some members felt a digital pound should be seen as a response to global competition and a tool for monetary sovereignty, not merely a technical upgrade.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-8">Item 9: Closing remarks</h3>
<p>The chair thanked all presenters and participants for their contributions throughout the day, noting the ability to draw connections across the different subgroups had been especially valuable.</p>
<p>The chair noted the forthcoming Innovation in Money and Payments conference in September and said the group would likely meet again towards the end of the year to summarise the work.</p>

<title>Welcome Remarks, Federal Reserve Vice Chair For Supervision Michelle W. Bowman, At The 2025 Community Banking Research Conference, St. Louis, Missouri (Via Pre-Recorded Video)</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/welcome-remarks-federal-reserve-vice-chair-for-supervision-michelle-w-bowman-2025107/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Welcome to the 2025 community banking research conference.&nbsp;While I regret that I cannot join you in person this year, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge the contributions this conference has made and continues to make in promoting research on community banking and related issues.</p>
<p>Since 2013, this conference has synthesized insights and perspectives from research and regulatory and banking communities with a single goal: deepening our understanding of the community bank business model in order to better inform future policy decisions.</p>
<p>We share this goal, and the sponsorship of this event with the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). We are proud of this ongoing partnership with CSBS and FDIC and the effort to further actionable bank industry research.</p>
<p>As the former Kansas state bank commissioner and a community banker, I very much appreciate the goals of this conference. And again this year, the organizers have included valuable research and created a conference program that includes a wide range of perspectives that create an opportunity for discussion and debate.</p>
<p>Ensuring the future and viability of the community banking industry continues to be a top priority, especially as the President appointed me to serve as the Vice Chair for Supervision of the Federal Reserve Board.</p>
<p>This position, which was created under the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010, requires the Vice Chair to "develop policy recommendations for the Board regarding supervision and regulation of depository institution holding companies and other financial firms supervised by the Board" and to also "oversee the supervision and regulation" of these firms.</p>
<p>It is an honor and an absolute privilege to be entrusted with these important responsibilities, and I look forward to working with all of our stakeholders in the financial industry to modernize supervision and regulation that allows for continued economic growth and innovation in the banking system and that enhances the critical role of community banks.</p>
<p>Community banks are the cornerstone of local economies, providing credit to local customers and businesses with few alternatives for accessing financial services. The community bank relationship model requires just that relationship. Direct knowledge of and a connection with the community, which makes this banking model truly unique and even more valuable.</p>
<p>But this model continues to face challenges&mdash;challenges that I am confident this conference will explore in greater detail that will help us to inform future policy developments.</p>
<p>When I spoke at this conference last year, I described a framework for community banking regulation for the future.</p>
<p>In those remarks, I discussed the necessary building blocks for building an effective framework, which include</p>
<ul>
<li>reviewing, reconsidering, and indexing the asset size thresholds that are used throughout our current supervisory and regulatory framework;</li>
<li>gaining a better understanding of the tradeoffs of regulation;</li>
<li>identifying the hidden costs of supervision and supervisory guidance;</li>
<li>streamlining the mergers and acquisitions review and approval process; and</li>
<li>identifying ways to promote new bank formation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since that time, the Federal Reserve has already launched several initiatives to advance these goals, but there's more work ahead.</p>
<p>We are refocusing supervisory efforts on core material financial risks, reviewing the CAMELS ratings framework, revising the community bank leverage ratio, and considering ways to improve the treatment of mutual banks. We are also prioritizing work to assist in the fight against fraud.</p>
<p>In the coming years, this conference will be an important mechanism for continuing to explore challenges facing the banking industry, and especially community banks. And with the work we are undertaking, we will continue to prioritize changes to the community bank regulatory and supervisory framework that will allow community banks to continue to thrive.</p>
<p>Over the years, this conference has highlighted the important role community banks play in our economy, the impacts of regulation on our banks, the disproportionate cost burden from regulation on our nation's smallest banks, and the importance of having a strong diversified network of community banks. It is critical that our regulatory and supervisory framework continues to support a network of these banks across and throughout the country so that they are positioned to support the economy and to meet the credit needs of their communities.</p>
<p>As I work with staff across the Federal Reserve to enhance the Fed's supervision of banks, I'm reminded how the research presented at this conference over the years, along with the findings from the CSBS annual survey of community banks, has consistently demonstrated the need for regulatory tailoring. This has given us a better perspective to understand and measure the cost of compliance.</p>
<p>In short, this conference truly matters.</p>
<p>Each year, the research presented here moves us forward; improves our understanding; and, combined with other insights from key stakeholders and our own experiences, enables us to make better regulatory and supervisory decisions.</p>
<p>From the first year of the conference in 2013, we've seen a number of changes in the banking and financial systems, in our economy, and in our supervisory and regulatory structures. The research presented here each year has evolved with these changes and has delivered critical and timely insights.</p>
<p>I'm so pleased that this conference has not strayed from its original mission and continues to provide a forum for the discussion of thoughtful, timely research into our country's unique community banking business model.</p>
<p>Community banks are vital to the U.S. economy and to the thousands of smaller local economies they serve across the country. It's important that we continue to study and understand the important role they play.</p>
<p>This conference helps to increase this understanding.</p>
<p>In addition to presenting thoughtful research, it provides an opportunity for open dialogue between community bankers, academics, regulators, and policymakers.</p>
<p>In these ever-changing times, the unique combination of research presented in combination with real-world perspectives provides insights that help to ensure that the community banking model endures well into the future.</p>
<p>This conference is just one aspect of the Federal Reserve System's engagement on issues affecting community banks. Outreach to banks of all sizes, including community banks, has been a top priority for my work because your voices must be a part of the conversation in Washington. In a few days, the Board will host a Community Bank Conference in D.C., bringing together bankers, industry experts, and other stakeholders to discuss and identify the most relevant issues facing the industry.</p>
<p>This event will be live-streamed on the Board's website and will include several unique and exciting speakers and panelists, covering a number of current issues.</p>
<p>Thank you for your continued interest and engagement in supporting this conference.</p>
<hr align="left" size="1" width="33%" />
<p>1. The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today, ACER initiates the review of its&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsOAg4JBVJQBkxaVANWHVYNDAcdUw8IAxoEB1JTBVcMVlAJAwgdUlNSAFpTA1AdBghQDx0GAVJVGg1cAgEZCgBVAlMFVFFTAltZRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Decision 30/2020</a>&nbsp;on the electricity redispatching and countertrading cost sharing methodology for the Core capacity calculation region. &nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is a capacity calculation region?</span></p>
<p>A capacity calculation region is a set of electrically interdependent bidding zone borders, where capacity calculation, regional operational security, redispatching and countertrading costs sharing tasks are coordinated by that region&rsquo;s transmission system operators (TSOs).</p>
<p>The Core capacity calculation region involves the TSOs and bidding zone borders of Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia. It is the biggest European region, involving 13 Member States, 16 TSOs and 19 bidding zone borders.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is the methodology about?</span></p>
<p>The cost sharing methodology allocates the costs from redispatching and countertrading remedial actions within a capacity calculation region. These actions are triggered to solve network congestions occurring within the region.</p>
<p>Specifically, this methodology tracks how each action affects congested network elements and assigns the related costs to the responsible TSOs, based on the order of flow types (loop, internal, allocated&nbsp;and power-shifting transformer flows). Loop flows are charged first, however according to the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsECQ5XWQNcV0wPVwxUHVYJBVMdUFgJUBpTBAMDUAYNBVMJBAkdUlNSAFpTA1AdBghQDx0GAVJVGg1cAgEZCgBVAlMFVFFTAltZRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Electricity Regulation</a>, its portion below a given threshold is exempted.</p>

<title>CME: Farmers Say Current Conditions On U.S. Farms Are Weakening</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Farmer sentiment held steady in September, as the&nbsp;<a href="https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4525552-1&amp;h=124970029&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fageconomybarometer%2F&amp;a=Purdue+University%2FCME+Group+Ag+Economy+Barometer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span class="xn-org">Purdue University</span>/CME Group Ag Economy Barometer</a>&nbsp;rose just 1 point to a reading of 126. However, there was a shift in producers' perceptions of current conditions and their expectations for the future. The Index of Current Conditions fell 7 points to 122, while the Index of Future Expectations climbed 5 points to 128. The survey was conducted following the U.S. Department of Agriculture's release of the September Crop Production report and the World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates&nbsp;report. These reflected farmers' concerns about current conditions, particularly over record-high corn and soybean yields, which were pressuring crop prices. At the same time, optimism about the future was supported by farmers' belief that U.S. policy is "headed in the right direction" and by expectations that potential government support, like the 2019 Market Facilitation Program (MFP), will provide payments to farmers in compensation for lower commodity prices. The barometer survey took place&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">Sept. 15-19</span>.</p>
<p>The September Farm Financial Performance Index dropped 3 points to a reading of 88, marking the third consecutive month farmers have lowered their expectations for 2025 compared with 2024. Consistent with this more cautious outlook, fewer producers said now is a good time to make major investments in their operations, pushing the Farm Capital Investment Index down 8 points to 53.</p>
<p>Producers' short-term outlook for farmland values weakened for the fourth month in a row, as the Short-Term Farmland Values Expectations Index fell 6 points to 106. The index now stands 18 points below its 2025 peak from May of 124. The shift was driven by fewer producers expecting farmland values to rise and more anticipating farmland values to remain about the same, with 58% of respondents saying they expect farmland values to hold steady over the next year, up from 54% in August.</p>
<p>Policy changes appear to continue to shape farmers' perspectives in September. A substantial majority (71%) of farmers in this month's survey reported that things in the U.S. are "headed in the right direction," similar to the July and August survey results. However, confidence in the long-run impact of tariffs has weakened. Just over half of respondents (51%) said they expect tariffs to strengthen the U.S. agricultural economy, down from 63% of June's survey respondents and 70% of respondents in both the April and May surveys who said they expect the use of tariffs to have a long-term positive impact. At the same time, 30% now believe tariffs will weaken the agricultural economy, and 19% are uncertain &mdash; more than double the number of respondents who were uncertain in the spring.</p>
<p>Amidst growing concerns about tariffs, most farmers expect potential government support to help cushion the impact. In September, 83% of producers said a program similar to the 2019 MFP is likely if a trade war drives commodity prices lower, with 62% calling it "very likely" and another 21% saying it is "likely."</p>
<p>Each September since 2021, the Ag Economy Barometer survey has included several questions focused on cover crop usage by corn and soybean farmers, and just over half (53%) of farmers surveyed this month reported using cover crops on at least some of their acreage, a share that has ranged between 52% and 57% over the past five years. Among cover crop users, 40% said they adopted the practice within the last five years, while 9% have used cover crops for more than two decades. Survey trends also point to broader adoption across acreage: This year, 57% of cover crop users planted them on 26-50% of their acres, compared to only 25% in 2021 who reported planting cover crops on more than one-fourth of their acreage.</p>
<p>"High production costs and weak crop prices are pressuring farm incomes on U.S. crop farms," said&nbsp;<a href="https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4525552-1&amp;h=2349699818&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fhome%2Fteam%2Fmichael-langemeier%2F&amp;a=Michael+Langemeier" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span class="xn-person">Michael Langemeier</span></a>, the barometer's principal investigator and director of&nbsp;<span class="xn-org">Purdue's</span>&nbsp;<a href="https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4525552-1&amp;h=2473468075&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fag.purdue.edu%2Fcommercialag%2Fhome%2F&amp;a=Center+for+Commercial+Agriculture" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Center for Commercial Agriculture</a>. "A large majority of U.S. farmers expect government support to bolster farm incomes if crop prices remain weak."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Under the terms of the agreement, ICE will invest up to $2 billion in Polymarket, reflecting a valuation of approximately $8 billion pre-investment.</p>
<p>Alongside its investment, ICE will become a global distributor of Polymarket&rsquo;s event-driven data, providing customers with sentiment indicators on topics of market relevance. Additionally, ICE and Polymarket have also agreed to partner on future tokenization initiatives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our investment blends ICE, the owner of the New York Stock Exchange, which was founded in 1792, with a forward-thinking, revolutionary company pioneering change within the Decentralized Finance space,&rdquo; said Jeffrey C.

<p>Polymarket allows users to express their views on events by buying and selling shares of potential outcomes, with every trade matched peer-to-peer through smart contracts. Markets grow in size and scale based on the number of users participating. Founded by Shayne Coplan in 2020, Polymarket has gained momentum from users globally interested in expressing their opinions on current events, politics, business moves, culture and sports. The platform has gained prominence for the accuracy of its markets and is now the Official Prediction Market Partner of X, and Stocktwits, among others.</p>
<p>The investment consideration will be in cash and is not expected to have a material impact on ICE&rsquo;s 2025 financial results or expected capital return plans.

<title>SET Market Report For September 2025</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/set-market-report-for-september-2025-2025107/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/set-market-report-for-september-2025-2025107/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) Index closed at 1,274.17 points in September 2025, up 3.0% from the previous month, driven by investor expectations of government economic stimulus measures that bolstered the Thai stock market. Meanwhile, concerns over the U.S. economy and its monetary and fiscal policies led global investors to increase their holdings in safe-haven assets, particularly gold, the price of which surged to record highs in global markets. Regarding the U.S. government shutdown, which has occurred multiple times in the past and typically been short-lived, investors remained largely unfazed by the situation. This was reflected in the resilience of the U.S. stock market, which did not decline significantly during the period.</p>
<p><b>SET Senior Executive Vice President Soraphol Tulayasathien</b> said that the U.S. government shutdown is expected to have limited impact on the SET Index, as investors largely perceive it as a temporary external factor that may create short-term volatility in capital flow. More significant factors to watch include the new government's policy execution focused on "short-term stimulus, long-term gains, broad distribution" through the "Big Quick Win" initiative, alongside multi-stakeholder cooperation in economic and capital market reforms. The SET Index is expected to continue its recovery through the remainder of 2025, supported by a resurgence in fundraising activities among listed companies in both debt and equity markets over the past two months, while strong first-day performance of newly listed securities reflects improving investor sentiment and selling pressure from Long-term equity funds (LTF) has begun to ease.</p>
<p><b>Key highlights for September 2025</b><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<ul>
<li>At the end of September 2025, the SET Index increased 3.0 percent MoM to close at 1,274.17 points, narrowing the YTD decrease to 9.0 percent. Compared to the end of 2024, industry groups that outperformed the SET Index were Technology, Financials, Industrials, Resources, and Property &amp; Construction.</li>
<li>SET&rsquo;s and Market for Alternative Investment (mai)&rsquo;s average daily trading value dropped 31.0 percent YoY to THB 43.16 billion (approx. USD 1.34 billion), with the first nine months average daily trading value of THB 43.03 billion, </li>
<li>Foreign investors sold a net THB 11.86 billion, with THB 96.24 billion in net selling for the January-September period of 2025. </li>
<li>Foreign investors continued to dominate trading activity, accounting for 47.06 percent of the month&rsquo;s total trading value. Retail investors represented 37.63 percent, up from 33.98 percent in the preceding month. </li>
<li>There was one newly listed company on SET: Ngernturbo Plc (TURBO) and another one on mai: SKIN Laboratory&nbsp;Pcl (SKIN).</li>
<li>SET&rsquo;s forward P/E ratio at the end of September 2025 was 13.9 times, below the Asian stock markets&rsquo; average of 14.1 times. The historical P/E ratio stood at 14.7 times, lower than the Asian stock markets&rsquo; average of 16.0 times.</li>
<li>Dividend yield ratio at the end of September 2025 was 3.86 percent, higher than the Asian stock markets&rsquo; average of 3.02 percent.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Derivatives Market</b></p>
<ul>
<li>At the end of September 2025, Thailand Futures Exchange (TFEX)&rsquo;s daily trading volume averaged 457,290 contracts, up 23.7 percent from the previous month largely due to the higher trading volume of Single Stock Futures, Gold Online Futures, and Currency Futures. The YTD average daily trading volume in 2025 was 423,887 contracts, down 12.4 percent due to the decline in trading volume of Single Stock Futures and Gold Online Futures.</li>

<title>ASIC Approves Cboe’s Listing Application To Bolster Competition In Public Markets</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC has approved Cboe Australia&rsquo;s (Cboe) listing market application. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Cboe will now be able to list new companies on its platform in direct competition with existing market operators, including the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX).</p>
<p>As a result, Australian investors will have access to more investment options, initial public offerings (IPOs) and dual listed foreign entities.</p>
<p>This decision reinforces ASIC&rsquo;s commitment to promote&nbsp;a vibrant and attractive local listing market.</p>
<p>ASIC Chair Joe Longo said, &lsquo;Australia&rsquo;s capital markets are strong and resilient, but they must continue to adapt to evolving global market dynamics and meet the future needs of our economy. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This move will provide more choice for companies to list in Australia, build more links to offshore markets and create more options for investors, which is good news for the Australian economy.'&nbsp;</p>
<p>Competition in Australian equities markets to date has resulted in trading costs and access to more investment products, particularly exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which are already available under Cboe&rsquo;s existing Australian Market licence.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>ASIC announced it was considering Cboe&rsquo;s application in August&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-154mr-enhancing-competition-and-innovation-in-australia-s-evolving-capital-markets/" title="25-154MR Enhancing competition and innovation in Australia&rsquo;s evolving capital markets">Enhancing competition and innovation in Australia&rsquo;s evolving capital markets (25-154MR).</a></p>
<p>Formerly known as Chi-X Australia, Cboe was launched in Australia in 2011 as a competitor to the ASX, introducing an alternative trading venue for ASX-listed securities and contributing to increased competition and innovation in the Australian equities market. It was acquired by&nbsp;Cboe Global Markets&nbsp;in&nbsp;2021, becoming&nbsp;Cboe Australia.</p>
<p>Cboe Australia currently has 20% of Australia&rsquo;s equity market turnover, representing almost $2 billion of trades each day.</p>
<p>On 22 September,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/news-items/advancing-australia-s-public-and-private-markets-progress-update/">ASIC shared its progress update on Advancing Australia&rsquo;s public and private markets.</a>&nbsp;This followed on from ASIC&rsquo;s discussion paper in February which explored the changing dynamics in capital markets in Australia and abroad.</p>
<p>ASIC called for actionable ideas to enhance the operation of Australia&rsquo;s capital markets and announced in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-096mr-asic-clears-path-for-faster-ipos/">June an initiative to fast track IPOs (25-096MR)</a>.</p>
<p>On 25 February 2025,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-019mr-asic-makes-new-clearing-and-settlement-rules-to-promote-competition/">ASIC used its new powers under the Competition in Clearing and Settlement (CiCS) (25-019MR)</a>&nbsp;services reforms to promote competitive outcomes in clearing and settlement (CS), requiring the ASX to provide its CS services on a transparent and fair basis, with a requirement to publish a comparison of fees against international providers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On 11 September 2024, ASIC granted an Australian clearing and settlement facility license to FinClear Pty Ltd (trading as FCX) which connects buyers and sellers of shares in private companies during intermittent trading events.</p>
<p>There are now four markets, including Cboe, licensed to list securities in Australia, ASX, National Stock Exchange of Australia (NSX) and Sydney Stock Exchange (SSX).</p>

<title>ASIC Finds Many Auditors Failing To Demonstrate Compliance With Auditor Independence Obligations</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-finds-many-auditors-failing-to-demonstrate-compliance-with-auditor-independ-2025107/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Multiple auditors from audit firms of all sizes were unable to effectively demonstrate compliance with independence and conflict of interest obligations, a new ASIC review has revealed.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The findings, outlined in</span>&nbsp;<span>Report 817</span><em>&nbsp;<span>Building trust: Auditor compliance with independence and conflict of interest obligations&nbsp;</span></em><span>(REP 817), follow ASIC action against several auditors and audit firm identified as in likely breach of their obligations through this review.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>ASIC Commissioner Kate O'Rourke said that the audit sector directly contributes to the quality and integrity of financial reporting by companies and that it needs to observe independence requirements.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>'Auditor independence underpins stakeholder trust and confidence in the audit process and the reliability of the financial information being audited.&nbsp; Unfortunately, our review found that many auditors failed to meet the basic independence requirements, and others failed to identify and critically evaluate potential threats to their independence.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&lsquo;It is not enough for auditors to adopt a tick-a-box approach to complying with these important obligations. They must think more critically about whether they are independent and be alive to even the perception that their independence is compromised,' said Ms O'Rourke.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>ASIC&rsquo;s review found a disappointing number of likely breaches of prescriptive independence requirements. Fifteen auditors were found to be in likely breach of rotation requirements, relationship prohibitions or providing a prohibited non-audit service.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Nine auditors failed to demonstrate how they complied with mandatory rotation requirements that prevent auditors from auditing a listed client for more than five consecutive years.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Five auditors appeared to hold prohibited relationships with clients, including one auditor who was also an officeholder of their client.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>None of the 15 auditors flagged by ASIC as having breached their obligations had proactively reported the potential breaches to ASIC, despite receiving a reminder from&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-240mr-asic-releases-fy-2023-24-financial-reporting-and-audit-report-and-launches-auditor-independence-surveillance/" title="24-240MR ASIC releases FY 2023&ndash;24 financial reporting and audit report and launches auditor independence surveillance"><span>ASIC in October last year</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>'The failure of these auditors to report breaches to ASIC, including of the longstanding prescriptive independence obligations, is concerning,' said Ms O'Rourke.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>As a result of this review, ASIC accepted the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-195mr-asic-accepts-cancellation-of-company-auditor-registration-for-independence-failures/" title="25-195MR ASIC accepts cancellation of company auditor registration for independence failures"><span>cancellation of a company auditor&rsquo;s registration</span></a>&nbsp;<span>for independence failures,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-221mr-nexia-perth-audit-pays-penalty-because-of-alleged-prohibited-non-assurance-services-provided-by-firm/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Nexia%20Perth%20Audit%20pays%20penalty%20because%20of%20alleged%20prohibited%20non-assurance%20services%20provided%20by%20firm&amp;utm_content=Nexia%20Perth%20Audit%20pays%20penalty%20because%20of%20alleged%20prohibited%20non-assurance%20services%20provided%20by%20firm+CID_68c13cebe75749c6d0795bf938636187&amp;utm_source=CampaignMonitor&amp;utm_term=View%20the%20full%20media%20release" title="25-221MR Nexia Perth Audit pays penalty because of alleged prohibited non-assurance services provided by firm"><span>issued a $78,250 infringement notice to Nexia Perth</span></a><span>&nbsp;over prohibited services, and&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-223mr-asic-accepts-three-court-enforceable-undertakings-for-auditor-rotation-failures-at-hall-chadwick-nsw/" title="25-223MR ASIC accepts three court enforceable undertakings for auditor rotation failures at Hall Chadwick (NSW)"><span>entered into three court enforceable undertakings</span></a><span>&nbsp;with auditors associated with Hall Chadwick (NSW)and the firm over audit rotation failures.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>ASIC is conducting additional inquiries into potential breaches identified during this review.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&lsquo;Auditor independence is fundamental to audit quality and integrity. A strong focus on independence not only builds trust, it also fosters more rigorous challenge in the audit process thereby enhancing the preparation of high-quality financial information.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&lsquo;We expect auditors to carefully consider this report and use its findings to address gaps in their compliance,&rsquo; Ms O&rsquo;Rourke said.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span>Background</span></h2>
<h3><span>How ASIC selected its review cohort</span></h3>
<p><span>The 48 auditors and 19 audit firms that were the subject of ASIC&rsquo;s review were selected using a risk based, data driven methodology. This involved reviewing data relating to 2,900 auditors for indicators of potential threats to independence arising from: </span>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span>the provision of non-audit services to audit clients </span>&nbsp;</li>
<li><span>long association with clients (including rotation), and </span>&nbsp;</li>
<li><span>relationships between auditors and clients or their officeholders (including explicitly prohibited relationships). </span>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><span>The final review cohort of 48 auditors included individual auditors as well as auditors from the following firms:&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span>BDO Audit Pty Ltd&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>BDO Audit (WA) Pty Ltd&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Connect National Audit Pty Ltd&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Ernst &amp; Young&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Grant Thornton Audit Pty Ltd&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Hall Chadwick (NSW)&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Hall Chadwick WA Audit Pty Ltd&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Kelly Partners (Sydney) Audit Partnership&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>KPMG Australia&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Pitcher Partners&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Nexia Perth Audit Services Pty Ltd&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>PKF Melbourne Audit &amp; Assurance Pty Ltd&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>PricewaterhouseCoopers&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>RSM Australia Partners&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Stantons International Audit and Consulting Pty Ltd&nbsp;</span></li>

<li><span>William Buck (QLD) Pty Ltd&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>William Buck Audit (WA) Pty Ltd&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>REP 817 is the second report from ASIC&rsquo;s expanded program of work to improve financial report and audit quality. It follows&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/reports/rep-816-accounting-for-your-super-asic-s-review-into-the-financial-reporting-and-audit-of-super-funds/" title="REP 816 Accounting for your super: ASIC&rsquo;s review into the financial reporting and audit of super funds"><span>Report 816</span></a>&nbsp;<em>Accounting for your super: ASIC's review into the financial reporting and audit of super funds.&nbsp;</em><span>It highlights that</span>&nbsp;<span>ASIC is particularly concerned to ensure auditors are vigorously testing information on investments including asset valuations, especially when those assets are impaired or valuations are under pressure.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>An annual report on our financial reporting and audit surveillance of companies and auditors will be published later in October. </span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>ASIC announced this expanded program of work to support financial report and audit quality last year (</span><a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-101mr-asic-announces-30-june-2024-focus-areas-and-expanded-program-to-support-financial-reporting-and-audit-quality/" title="24-101MR ASIC announces 30 June 2024 focus areas and expanded program to support financial reporting and audit quality"><span>24-101MR</span></a><span>). </span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>For 2025-26, ASIC&rsquo;s financial reporting and audit program will increase the number of audit surveillances and include audit files where there are potential independence concerns.</span>&nbsp;</p>

<title>US Office Of The Comptroller Of The Currency Announces Actions To Reduce Regulatory Burden For Community Banks</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/us-office-of-the-comptroller-of-the-currency-announces-actions-to-reduce-regulat-2025106/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) today announced guidance to banks and proposed rulemakings to reduce regulatory burden for community banks.</p>
<p>These actions build upon the OCC&rsquo;s continued efforts to tailor its regulatory and supervisory frameworks to minimize burden for its regulated institutions and promote economic growth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Community banks have an outsized impact on lending and are vital to the strength of the U.S. economy. Today&rsquo;s actions relieve these banks of regulatory burden and unproductive reporting requirements, so they are better positioned to support their communities and drive economic growth,&rdquo; said Comptroller of the Currency Jonathan V. Gould. &ldquo;The OCC will continue to tailor our risk-based supervision to focus on material financial risk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In two bulletins, the OCC clarified examination procedures for community banks. The OCC announced it is removing fixed examination requirements for community banks and instead tailoring the examination scope and frequency to be consistent with risk-based supervision. This approach reduces supervisory burden, maintains the value of the federal charter and preserves banks&rsquo; safety and soundness while ensuring regulatory oversight does not distract banks from serving their communities. The OCC also announced that it will only use the core assessment standards in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.occ.treas.gov/publications-and-resources/publications/comptrollers-handbook/files/community-bank-supervision/index-community-bank-supervision.html" title="Community Bank Supervision">Community Bank Supervision booklet</a>&nbsp;of the Comptroller&rsquo;s Handbook to examine for retail nondeposit investment products.</p>
<p>In a separate bulletin, the OCC clarified its expectations that community banks should tailor model risk management practices commensurate with the bank&rsquo;s risk exposures, its business activities, and the complexity and extent of its model use. In particular, the bulletin highlights that the OCC&rsquo;s model risk management guidance does not impose prescriptive requirements, such as annual model validations. The OCC is also considering additional steps to enhance flexibility and reduce burden related to model risk management. This bulletin is just the first step in refining model risk management guidance for all of the OCC&rsquo;s regulated institutions.</p>
<p>The OCC also requested comments on two proposed rules. The OCC proposed rescinding its Fair Housing Home Loan Data System regulation, removing largely duplicative data collection requirements for national banks. The proposal would eliminate regulatory burden for banks without having a material impact on the availability of data necessary for the OCC to conduct its fair housing-related supervisory activities. The OCC also proposed broadening eligibility for expedited or reduced licensing procedures to community banks. This proposal would reduce the burden for community banks and tailor requirements to the size and risk profile of an institution. These proposed changes are intended to facilitate an increase in corporate activities and transactions by community banks.</p>
<p>The OCC will continue to prioritize reforms targeted to community banks ahead of broader reforms for the industry. Ongoing work includes adjusting the community bank leverage ratio framework and a simplified strategic plan process for community banks to comply with the Community Reinvestment Act.</p>

<title>Finansinspektionen Reciprocates The Norwegian Risk Weight Floors</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/finansinspektionen-reciprocates-the-norwegian-risk-weight-floors-2025106/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Finansinspektionen (FI) has passed a decision to reciprocate the Norwegian Ministry of Finance&rsquo;s decision of risk weight floors of 25 per cent for retail exposures collateralised by real estate in Norway and of 35 per cent for corporate exposures collateralised by real estate in Norway.</span></p>
<div class="editor-content">
<p>Through national measures pursuant to Article 458 of the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR), Norway has since 2020 introduced risk weight floors for real estate exposures in Norway. The Norwegian Ministry of Finance has decided to extend the risk weight floor of 35 per cent for corporate exposures collateralised by real estate and to adjust the level of the risk weight floor applicable to residential real estate from 20 per cent to 25 per cent. The risk weight floors applies for institutions that are authorized to use an internal ratings-based approach for the calculation of their capital requirements for credit risks.</p>
<p>FI will apply the threshold of NOK 37.8 billion for retail exposures collateralised by real estate and NOK 9.3 billion for corporate exposures collateralised by real estate, as stated by the Norwegian Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>FI:s decision means that Swedish credit institutions with permission to use the internal ratings-based approach, and which have exposures in Norway that exceed the specified thresholds, are covered by the Norwegian risk weight floors.</p>
<p>FI:s decision applies from the 31st of December 2025 to the 31st of December 2026.</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority: Daniel Pugh Sentenced To 7 And A Half Years In Prison For £1.3m Ponzi Scheme</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-financial-conduct-authority-daniel-pugh-sentenced-to-7-and-a-half-years-in-p-2025106/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-financial-conduct-authority-daniel-pugh-sentenced-to-7-and-a-half-years-in-p-2025106/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Daniel Pugh has been sentenced to 7 years and 6 months in prison for running a &pound;1.3m Ponzi scheme, following a prosecution brought by the FCA.</p>
<p>Pugh, aged 35, set up a Ponzi scheme with another individual that netted over &pound;1m. Run from his bedroom in Devon, the fraudulent Imperial Investment Fund (IIF) took money from 238 investors Pugh targeted largely through Facebook adverts. Investors were offered impossibly high returns of 1.4% a day, 7% a week or 350% a year.</p>
<p>Pugh received &pound;96,000 from the scheme. He used the money to support his lifestyle, including designer clothes, restaurants and withdrawing &pound;18,000 in cash.</p>
<p>The returns investors were promised did not materialise. Pugh duped investors into believing he was successfully trading and their money was safe. Even at the point he knew the scheme was collapsing, Pugh continued to try to attract more investors into the scheme.</p>
<p>Steve Smart, executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said:</p>
<p>'Pugh made outlandish claims to hook in victims but in reality this was nothing more than a massive fraud. Fighting financial crime is a priority for the FCA. We will take action to ensure criminals face repercussions for their actions, including being denied access to any ill-gotten gains.</p>
<p>'People&rsquo;s online personas are often at odds with reality, as was the case with Pugh. Claims that sound too good to be true, are usually just that. Check the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/consumers/check-if-firm-fca-authorised" title="FCA Firm Checker">FCA Firm Checker</a>&nbsp;before you invest.'</p>
<p>In sentencing, His Honour Judge Weekes said there were 'persistent and knowing breaches of the regulatory framework' by Pugh and that any remorse for his actions came 'woefully late'.</p>
<p>He added: 'The consequences for them [the victims] are marked and apart from financial loss they feel embarrassment.'</p>
<p>The FCA is pursuing confiscation proceedings to deprive Pugh of the proceeds of his crimes and compensate the victims.</p>
<p>Pugh was disqualified from being a Director of a company for 8 years, effective upon release from custody.</p>
<p>A further individual is wanted in relation to the same offences.</p>
<p>In the last 6 months alone, the FCA has secured criminal convictions in relation to 6 individuals for a range of financial crime offences including money laundering, insider dealing, and fraud.</p>
<p>Unauthorised investment schemes pose a huge risk to consumers, and can offer little or no protection. Many will not realise their investments are at risk until it is too late. Use our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/consumers/check-if-firm-fca-authorised" title="FCA Firm Checker">FCA Firm Checker</a>&nbsp;to see whether a firm is authorised by us.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ol>
<li>Daniel Pugh&rsquo;s date of birth is 19 April 1990.</li>
<li>The FCA has attempted to contact investors who lost out. Anyone who was scammed by IIF and has not heard from the FCA should email&nbsp;<a href="mailto: ophainesconsumercontact@fca.org.uk">ophainesconsumercontact@fca.org.uk</a>.</li>

<li>The sentencing was made up as follows:<ol>
<li>Seven years and 6 months of imprisonment for conspiracy to defraud.</li>
<li>Twenty four months of imprisonment for 2 offences of carrying on a regulated activity in the UK without FCA authorisation or an exemption, to be served concurrently.</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>TRG Screen, the leading provider of market data management solutions, today announced the acquisition of Crizit, a New York-based fintech company specializing in reference data optimization. The acquisition unites monitoring and real-time automation to transform how the financial services industry addresses one of its biggest market data management challenges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Financial institutions incur significant avoidable costs on reference data through redundant requests, suboptimal vendor routing, and lack of real-time visibility and cost optimization capabilities. TRG Screen tools give firms visibility into data consumption, but until now they haven&rsquo;t been able to automatically implement cost saving measures without disrupting operations.<br /><br />&ldquo;Financial institutions have long recognized the gap between visibility into their data and the ability to act on it in real time. Crizit&rsquo;s capabilities accelerate our product roadmap and deliver what our clients have been asking for - the ability to go beyond monitoring and achieve real-time optimization of their reference data spend,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span>Leigh Walters, Chief Executive Officer of TRG Screen.</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not just showing clients where inefficiencies occur, we&rsquo;re enabling them to act on those insights automatically.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.crizit.com/" rel="noopener">Crizit's</a>&nbsp;solutions provide intelligent data caching that eliminates redundant requests and optimizes vendor routing, delivering measurable cost reductions for market data consumption.&nbsp;<br /><br />Integrated with TRG Screen's monitoring and analytics engine, the combination delivers the industry's only comprehensive reference data optimization platform, enabling clients to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove duplicate requests automatically</li>
<li>Optimize routing and retrieving data from the most cost-efficient source</li>
<li>Lower costs with minimal disruption to operations</li>
</ul>
<p>"Crizit has spent four years building trust with top-tier clients by delivering exceptional software, deep expertise, and measurable ROI," said Ethan Shen, Crizit Managing Partner. "Teaming up with TRG Screen is an ideal complement to our innovation-driven approach. Their reach, scale&nbsp;and reputation will supercharge our mission to set new standards for the industry. We're excited about what we can accomplish together."<br /><br />With Crizit now part of TRG Screen, the company strengthens its leadership in supporting financial institutions to control costs, enhance efficiency, and innovate in data management. This move underscores TRG Screen&rsquo;s commitment to delivering solutions that set a new benchmark for how reference data is managed and optimized.</p>

<p>Today, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury and Acting Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service Scott Bessent announced that Commissioner of the Social Security Administration Frank Bisignano will serve as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the IRS.

<p>&ldquo;Frank is a businessman with an exceptional track record of driving growth and efficiency in the private and now public sector,&rdquo; said Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent. The IRS and SSA &ndash; two of the most public-facing and broadly impactful federal agencies &ndash; also share many of the same technological and customer service goals. This makes Mr. Bisignano a natural choice for this role. &ldquo;Under his leadership at the SSA, he has already made important and substantial progress, and we are pleased that he will bring this expertise to the IRS as we sharpen our focus on collections, privacy, and customer service in order to deliver better outcomes for hardworking Americans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frank J. Bisignano, the 18th Senate-confirmed Commissioner of the U.S. Social Security Administration, is a proven leader with more than four decades of experience guiding some of the world&rsquo;s largest financial institutions and technology companies through transformation and growth. Prior to leading SSA, Bisignano served as Chairman and CEO of Fiserv, the world&rsquo;s largest financial services and payment technology company. In 2019, he led the merger of Fiserv and First Data while he was serving as CEO of the latter company. While at J.P. Morgan Chase in the 2000&rsquo;s, Bisignano was the co-Chief Operating Officer and served as the CEO of its Mortgage Banking unit. He also previously held several roles at Citigroup, including Chief Administrative Officer and CEO of the company&rsquo;s Global Transaction Services unit.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Tradeweb Markets Inc. (Nasdaq: TW), a leading, global operator of electronic marketplaces for rates, credit, equities and money markets, today reported record total trading volume for the month of September 2025 of $63.7 trillion (tn)<a href="https://www.tradeweb.com/newsroom/media-center/news-releases/tradeweb-reports-record-september-2025-total-trading-volume-of-$63.7-trillion-and-record-average-daily-volume-of-$2.9-trillion#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span>[1]</span></a>. Average daily volume (ADV) for the month was a record $2.9tn, an increase of 10.0 percent (%) year-over-year (YoY). For the third quarter of 2025, total trading volume was a record $172.8tn and ADV was a record $2.6tn, an increase of 11.8% YoY (14.5% YoY excluding the impact of ICD), with preliminary average variable fees per million dollars of volume traded of $2.16 and total preliminary fixed fees for rates, credit, equities and money markets of $95.5 million (mm)<a href="https://www.tradeweb.com/newsroom/media-center/news-releases/tradeweb-reports-record-september-2025-total-trading-volume-of-$63.7-trillion-and-record-average-daily-volume-of-$2.9-trillion#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><span>[2]</span></a>.</p>
<p>Tradeweb CEO Billy Hult said: &ldquo;Tradeweb reported record ADV for both September and the third quarter, with double-digit growth in each over the year-ago period. September was active across all asset classes, helping us finish the quarter with strong momentum. Our markets remained resilient despite depressed rate volatility, with strong client engagement across various tools and protocols including RFQ and our automated solution AiEX.&rdquo;</p>

<ul>
<li>U.S. government bond ADV was up 3.5% YoY to $240.2 billion (bn). European government bond ADV was up 27.3% YoY to $63.0bn. 
<ul>
<li>U.S. government bond ADV was led by growth in the institutional client channel, which achieved its second highest month ever. Robust European government bond ADV was driven by strong volumes across our institutional and wholesale client channels. Strong activity in the U.S. and Europe was supported by an increased number of clients trading across a diverse set of trading protocols.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Mortgage ADV was up 21.5% YoY to $291.9bn.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> 
<ul>
<li>Record To-Be-Announced (TBA) activity was primarily driven by elevated trading from real-money accounts and a sharp increase in dollar-roll activity YoY. Tradeweb&rsquo;s specified pool platform reported strong volumes supported by higher origination activity and broader client adoption.</li>

<ul>
<li>Fully electronic U.S. credit ADV was down 0.9% YoY to $8.6bn and European credit ADV was up 4.2% YoY to $2.9bn. 
<ul>
<li>U.S. credit volumes were driven by continued client adoption of Tradeweb protocols, most notably in Tradeweb AllTrade&reg; and request-for-quote (RFQ), which were offset by a decline in Portfolio Trading (PT). Tradeweb captured 18.0% and 7.2% share of fully electronic U.S high grade and U.S. high yield TRACE, respectively, as measured by Tradeweb. We also reported 25.2% total share of U.S. high grade TRACE and 9.5% total share of U.S. high yield TRACE. European credit volumes were driven by record Tradeweb Automated Intelligent Execution (AiEX) activity. Cash credit PT ADV decreased by 12.6% YoY, with non-comp PT ADV down 35.9% YoY. PT carries a relatively lower FPM as compared to the broader cash credit average, with non-comp PT carrying a lower FPM than PT overall.</li>

<li>Municipal bonds ADV was up 35.3% YoY to $521 mm.

<li>U.S. ETF ADV was up 34.4% YoY to $10.2bn and European ETF ADV was up 22.2% YoY to $3.7bn. 
<ul>
<li>Strong global ETF volumes were driven by robust activity in our institutional and wholesale channels, as more clients continued to embrace the RFQ protocol, as well as our Tradeweb AiEX solution, which reached a record in adoption in the U.S.</li>

<ul>
<li>Repo ADV was up 19.2% YoY to $811.7bn. 
<ul>
<li>Record global repo trading activity was supported by increased client participation across the platform. In the U.S., strong growth was driven by the effects of the Fed&rsquo;s balance sheet unwind. Additionally, balances in the Fed&rsquo;s reverse repo facility (RRP) remained at relatively low levels throughout most of the month, despite a small increase into month-end. In Europe, central banks deployed repo operations more aggressively to provide liquidity amid tightening macro conditions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other Money Markets ADV was down 11.5% YoY to $267.7bn. 
<ul>
<li>Other money markets activity was lower YoY, driven by certain ICD clients continuing to rebuild their money market fund balances following share buyback activity in the market and increased business-related spend earlier this year. This decline was partially offset by the addition of new clients.</li>

<p>On 26 September 2025, ACER received a&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsPCQ4DA1hRVUxYV1FSHVYNAgEdC10DUxoDUQtUVQEGUlVXAgUdVFNaU19SBFEdUFxTDx0GD1AFGgxcUQ8ZAgUPBlUHBVRXV1RXRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">proposal</a>&nbsp;from the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) to amend the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsHBwEJWQMCAExcAVUAHVYABlUdUA4FURoHBAJVAgFXA1AHUgUdVFNaU19SBFEdUFxTDx0GD1AFGgxcUQ8ZAgUPBlUHBVRXV1RXRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">methodology for the regional procurement of balancing capacity</a>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is the methodology about?</span></p>
<p>Transmission system operators (TSOs) must always keep the power system in balance. TSOs usually procure the balancing capacity needed at national level, but to lower procurement costs, they may opt for utilising available voluntary balancing bids from other countries (e.g. made available when local capacity exceeds national needs). &nbsp;If transmission capacity is expected to be available across bidding zones during balancing, these bids can also be used to reduce balancing capacity needs.</p>
<p>The methodology for the regional procurement of balancing capacity enables regional coordination centres (RCCs) to evaluate how voluntary balancing bids can be utilised effectively across borders. Following this evaluation, regional coordination centres provide TSOs with recommendations to reduce the volume of procured balancing capacity, hence utilising the flexibility of the EU electricity system.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why amend the methodology?</span></p>
<p>As&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtXAgEJAlRcVkxfVFUHHVZcBQQdClxQBRoDAFcADVEBVQ5XBgAdVFNaU19SBFEdUFxTDx0GD1AFGgxcUQ8ZAgUPBlUHBVRXV1RXRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">requested by ACER</a>, European TSOs propose to update the reliability parameters used by regional coordination centres to assess the availability of cross-zonal capacity and voluntary balancing bids. This is important as reliability parameters need to reflect the most relevant data, enabling TSOs to procure balancing capacity efficiently, and at the same time managing their operational risks. This change should foster a more transparent and coordinated process and improve the balancing of EU power system.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the next steps?</span></p>
<p>ACER will decide by 5 January 2026.</p>
<p>Interested parties may submit comments or questions to&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">ACER-ELE-2025-009@acer.europa.eu</a>&nbsp;by 31 October 2025.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>IOSCO&rsquo;s World Investor Week (WIW) is a week-long global campaign to raise awareness of the importance of investor education and protection, and to highlight the various initiatives of securities regulators in these two critical areas.</p>
<p>Kicking off on 6 October 2025, and with the support of the G20 Presidency, WIW2025 brings together organizations from over 100 jurisdictions to drive awareness around trending issues which impact investors around the world.</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s main themes include&nbsp;<strong>Digital Finance</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Crypto Assets</strong>, the impact of&nbsp;<strong>new Technologies and AI</strong>, prevention from&nbsp;<strong>Fraud &amp; Scam</strong>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<strong>Basics of Investing</strong>. They align with IOSCO&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iosco.org%2F%3FIOSCO-Roadmap-to-Retail-Investor-Online-Safety&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cmailing-lists%40iosco.org%7C9b7e7a0b017444d1eb6508de04c36994%7Cbcc6c66cdb3b48328af2cc363a097444%7C0%7C0%7C638953434481893895%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=3P7w%2B4p5awlfEOnZalG7DLNAiLNd03gYfU%2F6GUjCyOo%3D&amp;reserved=0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Roadmap for Retail Investor Online Safety</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In today&acute;s fast-paced markets, technology is transforming how people invest. For students and young investors, digital platforms are now often the gateway into the world of investing, and very convenient. But convenience is not enough. Smart investors stick to the basics: doing careful research, staying diversified, and being prepared for unexpected events.&rdquo; -&nbsp;<em>IOSCO Board Chair&nbsp;<strong>Jean-Paul Servais</strong>, who also serves as Chair of the Belgium Financial Services &amp; Markets Authority</em></p>
<p>Mr&nbsp;<strong>Camille Beaudoin</strong>, Director, Financial Education Expertise and Partnerships, AMF Qu&eacute;bec and Chair of IOSCO&rsquo;s Committee leading this year&rsquo;s campaign, added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where scams are concerned, relationship investment scams in particular are estimated to have caused people to lose tens of billions of dollars globally. WIW 2025&rsquo;s anti-fraud relationship investment scams campaign, made possible by the support of many well-established organisations around the globe, aims to inform investors about the warning signs of these scams and help empower them with information to protect themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As in previous years, WIW2025 will be supported by a number of partner organizations including the Financial Standards Planning Board&rsquo;s (FSPB) bespoke &lsquo;World Financial Planning Day&rsquo; (October 8) and the World Federation of Exchanges who encourage members to &lsquo;Ring the Bell&rsquo; for WIW2025.</p>

<title>ICE Mortgage Monitor: Falling Rates Lead To Best Homebuying Affordability In 2.5 Years - Home Prices Begin To Firm As Affordability Improves And Inventory Tightens</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ice-mortgage-monitor-falling-rates-lead-to-best-homebuying-affordability-in-25-2025106/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ICE Mortgage Technology, neutral provider of a robust end-to-end mortgage platform and part of Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE: ICE), today released its October 2025 ICE Mortgage Monitor Report. ICE data reveals that home affordability has reached its best level in 2.5 years, driven by easing mortgage rates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The recent pullback in rates has created a tailwind for both homebuyers and existing borrowers,&rdquo; said Andy Walden, Head of Mortgage and Housing Market Research at ICE. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re seeing affordability at a 2.5-year high, which is beginning to bolster purchase demand, while creating more opportunities for homeowners to lower their monthly payments with a rate-and-term refinance loan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Key findings from the October Mortgage Monitor include:</p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li><span>Affordability reaches best level since early 2023</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="bwmarginl1">With 30-year mortgage rates averaging 6.26% in mid-September, the monthly principal and interest (P&amp;I) payment on an average-priced home has fallen to $2,148, or 30% of the median U.S. household income. Though still more than five percentage points above its long-run average, P&amp;I costs have declined from 32% earlier this summer and significantly improved from their 35% peak in late 2023.</p>
<p class="bwmarginl1">While roughly a dozen of the nation&rsquo;s 100 largest housing markets &mdash; primarily in the Midwest &mdash; are near long-term average affordability levels, coastal markets remain significantly stretched. For example, in Los Angeles, 62% of the median income is required to afford an average-priced home, underscoring the disparity in markets.</p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li><span>Home prices firm as affordability improves and inventory tightens</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="bwmarginl1">Annual home price growth rose to +1.2% in September after eight months of slowing, driven by falling inventory and improved affordability. Nationally, listings remain 17&ndash;19% below 2017&ndash;2019 norms, as sellers in previously oversupplied markets delay sales to avoid price cuts.</p>
<p class="bwmarginl1">The Northeast and Midwest lead in annual price gains, fueled by low inventory and stronger affordability. In September, 80% of markets saw price increases &mdash; the highest share in nine months &mdash; while only 20% declined, down from 55% two months ago. Still, nearly half of major markets remain below recent peaks, with 25% over 2% off and 10% more than 5% below their highs.</p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li><span>Borrower profiles reflect improved financial stability</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="bwmarginl1">The average credit score for purchase locks has climbed above 736, the highest recorded in the six-year history of ICE&rsquo;s origination dataset, indicating a shift toward a more credit-qualified borrower mix. At the same time, debt-to-income (DTI) ratios for purchase rate locks have dropped to 38.5%, marking their lowest level in 2.5 years as affordability continues to improve. For rate-and-term refinances, the average DTI has fallen to 34.1%, a 3.5-year low, while the average credit score has risen to 722, a nine-month high.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As affordability improves and homeowners gain the ability to refinance, lenders and servicers need to be ready to act quickly,&rdquo; said Tim Bowler, President of ICE Mortgage Technology. &ldquo;Our integrated MSP&reg; servicing and Encompass&reg; loan origination systems, combined with robust data and analytics, enable our customers to identify and engage borrowers at the right moment &mdash; whether they&rsquo;re looking to purchase, refinance or tap into their equity. By leveraging ICE&rsquo;s technology, our clients can deliver a modern experience and capture opportunities as market dynamics shift.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The full October Mortgage Monitor report contains a deeper analysis of August mortgage payment performance, mortgage origination trends, and housing market trends featuring September ICE Home Price Index (HPI) data.</p>
<p>Further detail, including charts, can be found in<i>&nbsp;</i><a href="https://mortgagetech.ice.com/publicdocs/mortgage/imt-october-2025-mortgage-monitor-report-7tZGfFsYkUxV.pdf" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">this month&rsquo;s Mortgage Monitor report</a>.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ACER encourages European associations of energy market participants to engage in stakeholder activities supporting REMIT implementation from 2026 to 2028.</p>
<p>We welcome associations with expertise in the areas of electricity, natural gas, liquified natural gas (LNG) and hydrogen, dealing with supply, transportation and storage, including energy derivatives (where relevant for REMIT reporting framework). &nbsp;</p>
<p>Deadline to apply is 31 October 2025.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What&rsquo;s behind this?</span></p>
<p>The Regulation on Wholesale Energy Market Integrity and Transparency (<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsDUAcDAlQGUkwABAVTHVYBVAMdUFhXAxoGUQoGVwJTAVNUAQcdVQdUUF0FUVodUVsAVR0GDlAHGgxcAVYZBgAGBFQCAQUDBwFXRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">REMIT</a>) is the EU framework that aims to prevent wholesale energy market abuse and support fair competition. The Regulation was&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsEUgZVBwddVUxaUARXHVZcDA8dCwkEAhoMBlZUBQIFUw4HDwMdVQdUUF0FUVodUVsAVR0GDlAHGgxcAVYZBgAGBFQCAQUDBwFXRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">revised</a>&nbsp;in 2024 to keep pace with evolving market dynamics.</p>
<p>To ensure the revised Regulation is implemented effectively and consistently, ACER works closely with different stakeholders across the EU. European associations of energy market participants are key to bringing practical experience and sector-wide perspectives that help align implementation with real market practices.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;will associations contribute?</span></p>
<p>Associations participating in ACER&rsquo;s stakeholder activities will:</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The European Supervisory Authorities (EBA, EIOPA and ESMA &ndash; the ESAs) today issued a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2025-10/Joint_ESAs_revised_warning_on_crypto-assets.pdf">warning</a>&nbsp;to consumers, reminding that crypto-assets can be risky and that legal protection, if any, may be limited depending on which crypto-assets they invest in. This warning is accompanied by a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2025-10/Joint_ESAs_Factsheet_on_crypto-assets.pdf">factsheet</a>&nbsp;explaining what the new EU regulation on Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) means for consumers. The ESAs recommend concrete steps consumers can take to make informed decisions before investing in crypto-assets, such as checking if the provider is authorised in the EU.</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>Since December 2024, MiCA applies to certain types of crypto-assets and establishes a consistent supervisory regime at both national and European level for issuers and providers of crypto-assets services across the EU.</span></p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>While innovative financial products, including crypto-assets, may enhance the efficiency, resilience, and competitiveness of the EU&rsquo;s financial system, consumers should be mindful that not all crypto-assets are the same. They should also be warned that their consumer protection (if any) might be limited depending on the types of crypto-assets and crypto-asset services they are using (e.g. lack of access to comprehensive information or a transparent and uniform claims handling procedure).</span></p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>Consumers are recommended to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>learn about the product or service and evaluate the risk before investing,</span></li>
<li><span>check the provider of crypto-asset services is authorised in the EU and,</span></li>
<li><span>make sure any wallets used to store their crypto-assets are sufficiently secured.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>Those steps are particularly important at a time when consumers&rsquo; interest in such products and services is on the rise, in part due to aggressive promotion on social media by finfluencers.</span></p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>The Joint ESAs factsheet &ndash; also available in all EU languages &ndash; provides an overview of what crypto assets are, which ones are regulated under MiCA and which ones are not, and the providers consumers may encounter.</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul class="rte--list">
<li>Eurex trading volumes down 4 percent in September reflecting calmer market conditions.&nbsp;</li>
<li>OTC Clearing posted strong momentum, with notional outstanding volumes climbing 37 percent.</li>
<li>Eurex Repo reported solid growth, fueled by a 56 percent surge in GC Pooling transactions.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Eurex &mdash; Europe&rsquo;s leading derivatives exchange and, together with Eurex Clearing, one of the world&rsquo;s leading central counterparties &mdash; reported lower trading volumes in September as market activity cooled. The exchange handled 188.3 million contracts during the month, down 4 percent from the 196.0 million contracts recorded a year earlier. Interest rate derivatives stood out, rising 10 percent year-on-year to 104.2 million contracts. By contrast, equity derivatives fell 14 percent to 23.5 million contracts, while index derivatives dropped 16 percent to 60.2 million contracts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>OTC Clearing posted strong growth in September, with notional outstanding volumes up 37 percent year-on-year to EUR 46,699 billion, compared with EUR 34,115 billion in the same month of 2024. The surge was driven largely by overnight index swaps, which leapt 52 percent to EUR 6,084 billion. Interest rate swaps also contributed significantly, rising 29 percent to EUR 19,814 billion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eurex Repo, Eurex&rsquo;s leading electronic market for secured funding and financing, posted another strong month in September 2025, with average term-adjusted volumes climbing 52 percent year-on-year to EUR 462.2 billion. Growth was led by the GC Pooling segment, which jumped 56 percent, while the Repo Market segment also advanced, rising 48 percent. The results underline Eurex Repo&rsquo;s continued upward momentum in secured funding and financing.&nbsp;</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority: Regulators Join Forces To Tackle Poor Claims Management Practices</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA, Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA), Information Commissioner&rsquo;s Office (ICO) and the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) are joining together to tackle misleading advertising and inadequate information provided by some claims management companies (CMCs) and law firms working on motor finance claims, and the risk that excessive fees are charged to clients.</p>
</div>
</section></p>
<div class="default"><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>Alison Walters, director, consumer finance, at the FCA, said:</p>
<p>'Misleading advertising and inadequate disclosure have meant that people are signing contracts with some firms without the facts. When they try to exit, they face high fees. We&rsquo;re acting where we see bad practice and, through our own advertising, we&rsquo;re ensuring consumers can make informed choices.'</p>
<p>Paul Philip, chief executive of the SRA, said:</p>
<p>'The risks and issues facing consumers in this area of the market are unprecedented, and we are using all the levers at our disposal to protect consumers, identify poor practices and hold law firms to account.'</p>
<p>Using&nbsp;powers under the Consumer Rights Act 2015 and, for the first time, under the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024,&nbsp;the FCA, working closely with the SRA, has required 9 law firms to provide information about their exit fees. Two FCA regulated CMCs have agreed to change their exit fee policies.</p>
<p>Two others have agreed not to take on clients or to advertise until they&rsquo;re able to show the FCA they comply with FCA rules. We&rsquo;re expecting to write to FCA regulated CMCs involved in motor finance claims this week to reiterate our expectations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FCA&rsquo;s increased proactive monitoring has led to the removal or amendment of more than 740 misleading adverts by FCA regulated CMCs since January 2024.&nbsp;This number increased significantly following the Johnson judgment. Concerns include unrealistic claims about success rates and the value of potential compensation.</p>
<p>The FCA has launched a &pound;1m ad campaign to make people aware they don&rsquo;t need to use a CMC or law firm to seek motor finance compensation, and that they stand to lose a chunk of any compensation they&rsquo;re owed if they choose to. Research shows 4 in 10 people don&rsquo;t know they can receive motor finance compensation without using a CMC or law firm. The campaign will run online and on radio.</p>
<p>The SRA is investigating 76 law firms involved in high-volume claims and has closed five firms to protect the public.&nbsp;Its recent Thematic Review set out the key issues,&nbsp;and it has made clear its expectations on termination fees. The FCA and SRA continue to work closely, given that many FCA regulated CMCs refer motor finance claims to law firms.</p>
<p>Since January 2025, the ICO has received over 230,000 complaints via the spam reporting service regarding unsolicited and unlawful direct marketing practices linked to motor finance claims. In response, the ICO has multiple investigations ongoing and is actively considering further regulatory action against several organisations.</p>
<p>The ASA is also reviewing advertising practices in this sector.</p>
<h2>Consumer guidance</h2>
<p>Consumers who believe they have been misled by advertising, signed up without their consent, charged unreasonable fees, had their data mishandled, or otherwise feel they have been treated unfairly by a CMC or law firm should first complain to the firm. If dissatisfied with the response, they should take their complaint to the&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://cmc.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/consumers/complain" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)">Claims Management Ombudsman<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.legalombudsman.org.uk/how-to-complain/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)">Legal Ombudsman<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>.</p>
<p>To support the public, the SRA has also published guidance on&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.sra.org.uk/consumers/choosing/motor-finance-compensation-claims/__;!!NpgLxcn0NwQP6K3JyhKAL1gv!qnbNLx_J8aorAaWvn718rSD-gmHHWRMiakudb7alvvRcedWsXAHwQIOEy3qc1gVuN-ZDDT3iZyLyPi0aaQWOkWDXJn7s$" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)">motor finance claims<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>, and on&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.sra.org.uk/consumers/choosing/no-win-no-fee/__;!!NpgLxcn0NwQP6K3JyhKAL1gv!qnbNLx_J8aorAaWvn718rSD-gmHHWRMiakudb7alvvRcedWsXAHwQIOEy3qc1gVuN-ZDDT3iZyLyPi0aaQWOkSW_9CDn$" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)">no-win, no-fee agreements<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>.</p>

They can also report spam text messages to the ICO by forwarding the message for free to 7726 (which spells out SPAM).</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ol>
<li>To require information from law firms it does not regulate, the FCA is using its powers under the Consumer Rights Act 2015. This is the first time the FCA has used these powers as a public designated enforcer under the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024.</li>

<title>Spanish Stock Exchange Opens The Session With A Bell Ringing For Financial Literacy - The Event Took Place At The Barcelona Stock Exchange</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>BME joins the celebration of Financial Education Day with a&nbsp;<span>Bell Ringing</span>&nbsp;at the Barcelona Stock Exchange. The event is part of the &ldquo;Ring the Bell for Financial Literacy&rdquo; initiative, a project promoted by the&nbsp;<span>World Federation of Exchanges (WFE)</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span>IOSCO&nbsp;</span>as part of World Investor Week, in which stock exchanges around the world participate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Bell Ringing was led by&nbsp;<span>Al&iacute;cia Romero,</span>&nbsp;Minister of Economy and Finance of the Generalitat of Catalonia, accompanied by<span>&nbsp;Juan Flames</span>, Chief Executive Officer of BME.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Minister of Economy and Finance of the Generalitat of Catalonia,&nbsp;<span>Al&iacute;cia Romero</span>, has stressed the importance of providing tools that enable citizens to achieve good financial literacy. In this regard, she warned that a lack of such training can leave families in a vulnerable position when it comes to making financial decisions. She also defended the culture of hard work at a time when the prevailing discourse on social media promotes the idea of &ldquo;easy and immediate money.&rdquo; &ldquo;We must provide the tools to be able to invest,&rdquo; she concluded.</p>
<p>For his part, Juan Flames stated that fostering financial literacy is a priority to encourage retail investors to return to the stock market. &ldquo;BME is working intensively with regulators and the broader financial industry to support the creation of the pan-European account. This new savings or investment product with tax incentives seeks to make it easier for citizens of the European Union to save and invest cross-border in the single market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition to the Bell Ringing, BME complements the activities for Financial Education Day with a series of webinars organized by Instituto BME, as a collaborating entity of &ldquo;Finanzas para Todos.&rdquo; This initiative is driven by the CNMV, the Bank of Spain, and the Ministry of Economy, Industry and Enterprise. This year&rsquo;s motto is &ldquo;Get informed. Plan. Decide.&rdquo; The program reaches its eleventh edition and it is the second time that the day&rsquo;s central event is held in Barcelona.</p>

<p>My aim today is to explain the conduct of monetary policy in the euro area.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251006~0adce2b3d4.en.html#footnote.1" id="fn1">1</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;I will first outline the approach to monetary policy that is embedded in our monetary policy strategy statement.

</p>
<h2>The monetary policy strategy of the ECB</h2>
<p>Our recently-updated monetary policy strategy statement provides a comprehensive strategic framework for many dimensions of monetary policy.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251006~0adce2b3d4.en.html#footnote.2" id="fn2">2</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;Here, I will focus on the elements that are most directly relevant for monetary policy decision making.</p>
<p>Paragraph five of our monetary policy strategy statement states:</p>
<p><em>The Governing Council considers that price stability is best maintained by aiming for two per cent inflation over the medium term. The Governing Council&rsquo;s commitment to this target is symmetric. Symmetry means that the Governing Council considers negative and positive deviations from this target as equally undesirable. The two per cent inflation target provides a clear anchor for inflation expectations, which is essential for maintaining price stability.</em></p>
<p>The point target of 2.0 per cent provides valuable clarity; the symmetric commitment reinforces this clarity by treating positive and negative deviations as equally undesirable. Such clarity would not be provided by a zonal inflation target, which would require households, firms and market participants to continuously re-assess which part of the zone constituted the de facto current operational target for monetary policy.</p>
<p>Of course, a clear target does not mean that the ECB seeks to deliver inflation at two per cent at all times. In particular, paragraph seven explains:</p>
<p><em>The Governing Council confirms the medium-term orientation of its monetary policy strategy. This allows for inevitable short-term deviations of inflation from the target, as well as lags and uncertainty in the transmission of monetary policy to the economy and to inflation. The flexibility of the medium-term orientation takes into account that the appropriate monetary policy response to a deviation of inflation from the target is context-specific and depends on the origin, magnitude and persistence of the deviation. Subject to maintaining anchored inflation expectations, it also allows the Governing Council in its monetary policy decisions to cater for other considerations relevant to the pursuit of price stability.</em></p>
<p>In terms of origin, different types of shock may move inflation and real economic activity in the same direction (as in the case of demand shocks) or create a temporary trade-off (as in the case of supply shocks): the medium-term orientation provides flexibility to look through temporary shocks to inflation that may dissipate on their own accord, thus avoiding unnecessary volatility in activity and employment.<sup></sup><span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251006~0adce2b3d4.en.html#footnote.3" id="fn3">3</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;In terms of magnitude and persistence, a small, transitory shock clearly poses less risk to the medium-term anchor than a larger, more persistent shock. In any event, the lags in the transmission of monetary policy mean that it would not be practical to respond to inflation shocks that are expected to dissipate quickly.</p>
<p>In turn, paragraph eight ties the setting of monetary policy to delivering the two per cent target over the medium-term:</p>
<p><em>The Governing Council is committed to setting monetary policy to ensure that inflation stabilises at the two per cent target in the medium term.</em></p>
<p>That is, the ECB follows an inflation targeting regime, but with substantial flexibility provided by the medium-term orientation. This means that monetary policy decisions are firmly grounded by the commitment to stabilise inflation at two per cent over the medium term, with due regard for the value of flexibility under the circumstances that prevail at any given point in time.</p>
<p>Paragraph nine&nbsp;<a class="link-inline" id="_Hlk210550846"></a>elaborates on the inputs into these monetary policy decisions:</p>
<p><em>The Governing Council bases its monetary policy decisions, including the evaluation of the proportionality of its decisions and potential side effects, on an integrated assessment of all relevant factors. In particular, it takes into account not only the most likely path for inflation and the economy but also surrounding risks and uncertainty, including through the appropriate use of scenario and sensitivity analyses.</em></p>
<p>The second sentence in paragraph nine is new and is an important articulation that monetary policy decisions are made under uncertainty, such that it is essential to take a wide-angled perspective that incorporates not only the baseline path but also the surrounding risks and uncertainty. This sentence also reflects the reality that much of the policy debate is about risk management, especially under current conditions of elevated uncertainty.</p>
<p>Indeed, an important conclusion of the 2025 update of our monetary policy strategy is that an array of structural changes is likely to make uncertainty a defining characteristic of inflation environment for the rest of this decade. In particular, paragraph one states:</p>
<p><em>Ongoing structural shifts related to geopolitics, digitalisation, artificial intelligence, demography, the threat to environmental sustainability and changes in the international financial system suggest that the inflation environment will remain uncertain and potentially more volatile, with larger target deviations in both directions, posing challenges for the conduct of monetary policy.</em></p>
<p>Finally, paragraph six highlights that the biggest threat to the medium-term inflation target comes from large, sustained deviations from the target. In particular, paragraph six states:</p>
<p><em>To maintain the symmetry of its inflation target, the Governing Council recognises the importance of appropriately forceful or persistent monetary policy action in response to large, sustained deviations of inflation from the target in either direction, to avoid deviations becoming entrenched through de-anchored inflation expectations. In the event of significant disinflationary shocks, the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates needs to be taken into account. In the event of significant inflationary shocks, possible non-linearities in price and wage setting need to be taken into account.</em></p>
<p>Taken together, these elements of the monetary policy strategy statement provide essential foundations for the conduct of monetary policy. Still, at any given point in time, these strategic principles have to be converted into an operational approach to making monetary policy decisions.</p>
<p>In particular, there is a clear difference between &ldquo;standard&rdquo; phases in which there may be inflation shocks but not to the degree that would constitute &ldquo;large, sustained deviations of inflation from the target&rdquo; and &ldquo;acute&rdquo; phases in which the central bank must act with appropriate force or persistence to avoid deviations becoming entrenched through de-anchored inflation expectations. If a deviation of inflation from the target is in the intermediate range that is neither &ldquo;small and transitory&rdquo; nor &ldquo;large and sustained&rdquo;, the appropriate monetary policy response will be nonzero but will also necessarily be more restrained than the scale that constitutes &ldquo;appropriately forceful or persistent&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In this range, the optimal calibration of monetary policy is a question of cyclical adjustment within a more narrow interval for the policy rate. By and large, the monetary policy literature has primarily focused on such cyclical adjustments, with many models examining the optimal monetary policy response to relatively &ldquo;small&rdquo; shocks that can be captured by linearised treatments of the dynamic adjustment of the economy and inflation.</p>
<p>In contrast, the frequency of &ldquo;large, sustained&rdquo; deviations of inflation from the target is relatively rare. Indeed, in the absence of an extraordinary constellation of shocks (such as the combination of the pandemic&nbsp;<a class="link-inline" id="_Hlk210551005"></a>and Russia&rsquo;s unjustified invasion of Ukraine), a large and sustained deviation of inflation from the target would most likely result from a persistent failure in the conduct of monetary policy, with an insufficient response to cyclical shocks fostering an incremental, cumulative drift away from the target that de-anchored inflation expectations through a lack of policy responsiveness to material inflation shocks.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251006~0adce2b3d4.en.html#footnote.4" id="fn4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>In what follows, I turn to analysing the current inflation outlook before outlining some considerations for the conduct of monetary policy in the near term.</p>
<h2>The baseline inflation outlook</h2>
<p>In this section, I discuss some features of the baseline in the&nbsp;<a class="link-inline" id="_Hlk210551306"></a>September 2025 staff macroeconomic projections. I turn to the surrounding risks in the final section.</p>
<p>As a preliminary caveat, the baseline is conditioned on the prevailing economic and financial data at the time the projections are constructed, including the expected path for short-term policy rates that is embedded in the market curve. Since the projection exercises are comprehensive in scope, it is only of limited value to attempt &ldquo;real-time updates&rdquo; in between projection exercises that are based on the mechanical impact of shifts in individual variables, since a shift in any given variable may reflect a broader underlying dynamic process that jointly affects many variables. For this reason, I focus on the September projections rather than attempting to comment on the subsequent data flows.</p>
<p>Under the baseline, inflation is projected to average 2.1 per cent in 2025, 1.7 per cent in 2026 and 1.9 per cent in 2027. Compared to the 2021-2024 inflation rates of 2.6 per cent, 8.4 per cent, 5.4 per cent and 2.4 per cent respectively, the current inflation outlook is much more benign. At the same time, the projected downward deviations from the 2.0 per cent medium-term target warrant close examination.</p>
<p>It is analytically helpful to differentiate between energy inflation and non-energy inflation (the aggregate of food, goods and services inflation).<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251006~0adce2b3d4.en.html#footnote.5" id="fn5">5</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;Under the baseline, non-energy inflation is projected to stand at 2.5 per cent in 2025, 2.0 per cent in 2026 and 1.9 per cent in 2027 (see Chart 1). Relative to the 2021-2024 non-energy inflation rates of 1.5 per cent, 5.1 per cent, 6.3 per cent and 2.9 per cent, we can interpret the baseline as indicating that further non-energy disinflation will take place in the coming quarters before stabilising at around two per cent.</p>
<p>Within the non-energy category, Chart 2 shows that further disinflation is projected both for the food and services categories. Food inflation is projected at 2.9 per cent in 2025, 2.3 per cent in 2026 and 2.3 percent in 2027; services inflation is projected at 3.4 per cent in 2025, 2.7 per cent in 2026 and 2.3 per cent in 2027. The inflation rate for non-energy industrial goods (the NEIG category) is relatively flat at 0.6 per cent in 2025, 0.4 per cent in 2026 and 0.8 per cent in 2027.</p>
<p>The projected further ongoing disinflation in non-energy inflation can primarily be connected to the anticipated further deceleration in wage growth: growth in compensation per employee is expected to decelerate from 3.4 per cent in 2025 to 2.7 per cent in 2026 and 2027. This profile of wage growth deceleration is cross-validated by the ECB wage tracker and an array of survey evidence. In turn, wage deceleration reflects the recovery in real wage levels after several years of above-average nominal wage increases and the softening in labour market conditions.</p>
<p>Ongoing disinflation also reflects euro appreciation, the spillover from energy deflation, and the deflationary impact of lower export prices from China. Furthermore, the 2024-2025 inflation rates were also pushed up as governments reversed the array of fiscal subsidies that were introduced to mitigate the surge in the cost of living in 2022-2023; these effects wash out of the inflation data in 2026. The lagged impact of our past phase of a restrictive monetary policy stance contributed to disinflation by moderating domestic demand, which&nbsp;<a class="link-inline" id="_Hlk210551558"></a>put downward pressure on both wage growth and profit growth.</p>
<p>In combination, these forces are projected to level out in 2026-2027, such that non-energy inflation is projected to stabilise at around two per cent. The switch from a disinflation dynamic to a projected stable inflation rate around the target has been supported by the 200 basis points in rate reductions since June 2024 and, of course, is conditional on delivering a target-consistent monetary policy stance over the projection horizon.</p>
<p>The baseline for energy inflation presents quite a different profile. Energy inflation is projected at -1.6 per cent in 2025, -1.1 per cent in 2026 and 2.4 per cent in 2027. The projected 3.5 per centage point jump in energy inflation in 2027 is in part related to the impact of the scheduled introduction of&nbsp;<a class="link-inline" id="_Hlk210551830"></a>the EU Emissions Trading System 2 (ETS2) in 2027, which should have a one-off impact on the energy price level.</p>
<p>This profile for energy inflation should be understood in the context of the extraordinary surge in energy inflation during 2021-2022 (Chart 3). Having initially declined during the first year of the pandemic to -6.8 per cent in 2020, energy inflation rose to 13.0 per cent in 2021 and 37.0 per cent in 2022. Subsequently, there has been a mild deflation pattern, with energy inflation at -2.0 per cent in 2023 and -2.2 per cent in 2024. Accordingly, we can interpret the energy inflation projections for 2025 and 2026 as reflecting ongoing-albeit-weaker energy deflation in the aftermath of the extraordinary surge in the relative price of energy during 2021-2022.</p>
<p>An important open question is whether the projected jump in energy inflation in 2027 reflects the end of this energy deflation episode or is rather just a one-time deviation from an ongoing correction process by which the relative price of energy re-attaches to its trend line after the extraordinary 2021-2022 surge. In turn, the level and direction of energy inflation has spillover implications for food, goods and services inflation rates: a material departure from the baseline energy inflation path would also trigger a material departure from the baseline non-energy inflation path.</p>
<p>I will return to the discussion of energy inflation in the context of the risk assessment in the next section.</p>

<h2><a id="_Hlk210552444"></a>The near-term conduct of monetary policy</h2>
<p>Striking the balance between the baseline assessment and the risk assessment in determining the monetary policy decision at any given meeting is not straightforward and the guidance from the research literature on the setting of monetary policy under uncertainty is highly nuanced, with no universal results. In particular, it is highly&nbsp;<a class="link-inline" id="_Hlk210552520"></a>context-specific as to: (i) whether the risk assessment should call for a &ldquo;wait and see&rdquo; approach or, alternatively, trigger an immediate response due to insurance-type risk management considerations; and (ii) whether a rate move should be attenuated or amplified by risk considerations.</p>
<p>In the coming weeks and months, it makes sense to follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate monetary policy stance, with no-precommitment to a particular rate path. In particular, our interest rate decisions will be based on our assessment of the inflation outlook and the risks surrounding it, in light of the incoming economic and financial data, as well as the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. In addition to the evolution of the baseline inflation outlook, shifts in the risk distribution will also matter for our rate decisions: an increase in the likelihood or intensity of downside risk factors would strengthen the case that a slightly-lower policy rate might better protect the medium-term inflation target; alternatively, an increase in the likelihood or intensity of upside risk factors would indicate that maintaining the current policy rate would be appropriate in the near term.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251006~0adce2b3d4.en.html#footnote.6" id="fn6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>The downside risks highlighted in our September 2025 inflation risk assessment include: a stronger euro; the risk that higher tariffs could lead to lower demand for euro area exports and induce countries with overcapacity to further increase their exports to the euro area; the risk that trade tensions lead to greater volatility and risk aversion in financial markets, which would weigh on domestic demand and would thereby also lower inflation.</p>
<p>By contrast, inflation could turn out to be higher under some upside scenarios: a fragmentation of global supply chains could push up import prices and add to capacity constraints in the domestic economy; a boost in defence and infrastructure spending could also raise inflation over the medium term; extreme weather events, and the unfolding climate crisis more broadly, could drive up food prices by more than expected.</p>
<p>More broadly, we also assess the risks to economic growth, in view of the relation between economic slack and medium-term inflation pressures and, especially if inflation is close to target and subject to maintaining anchored inflation expectations, the consideration that the flexibility of our medium-term orientation also allows us in our monetary policy decisions to cater for other considerations relevant to the pursuit of price stability.</p>
<p>In September, we assessed that risks to economic growth have become more balanced, especially relative to the downside risks of more severe configurations of policy-induced trade and financial fragmentation that were much debated in the April-May period. While recent trade agreements have reduced uncertainty somewhat, the overall impact of the change in the global policy environment will only become clear over time. Moreover, a renewed worsening of trade relations could further dampen exports and drag down investment and consumption. A deterioration in financial market sentiment could lead to tighter financing conditions, greater risk aversion and weaker growth. Geopolitical tensions, such as Russia&rsquo;s unjustified war against Ukraine and the tragic conflict in the Middle East, remain a major source of uncertainty.</p>
<p>By contrast, higher than expected defence and infrastructure spending, together with productivity-enhancing reforms, would add to growth. An improvement in business confidence could stimulate private investment. Sentiment could also be lifted and activity spurred if geopolitical tensions diminished, or if the remaining trade disputes were resolved faster than expected.</p>
<p>In thinking about these risk factors, two important considerations are the impact on energy prices and the impact on the euro. In relation to the former, the&nbsp;<a class="link-inline" id="_Hlk210552605"></a>above analysis of recent energy inflation serves to underline the high amplitude of energy prices and the possible spillovers from energy inflation to food inflation, goods inflation and services inflation. At the same time, it is clear that the sensitivity of overall inflation to energy inflation is state dependent and will be lower under subdued demand conditions than if demand were buoyant. In the current context, a further open question is the extent to which the substantial increase in the relative price of energy during 2021-2022 will bear down on energy inflation in the coming years due to the &ldquo;error correction&rdquo; mechanism by which deviations from the long-term trend relative price are reversed over time.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251006~0adce2b3d4.en.html#footnote.7" id="fn7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>Similarly, in relation to the exchange rate, a persistent movement in the euro on average has a multi-year impact on economic activity and inflation. However, these effects will be larger than the average if euro appreciation is more due to external factors (such as weakness in main trading partners or portfolio rebalancing due to an increase in the risk premium in overseas financial markets) and smaller than the average if more due to domestic factors (such as a surge in domestic demand or a decline in the domestic risk premium). In particular, the pricing power of domestic firms will be lower in the former case (such that euro appreciation induces firms to cut prices in an attempt to protect market share) than in the latter case (such that euro appreciation might be taken as an opportunity to boost profits).</p>
<p>In addition to the inflation outlook and the risk assessment, monetary policy decisions also turn on the strength of the transmission mechanism and, more broadly, overall financial conditions. In this context, ongoing assessments of the strength of monetary transmission remains of central importance, especially in view of shifts in the structure of the financial system and the complex relation between aggregate credit dynamics and aggregate demand conditions.<sup></sup><span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251006~0adce2b3d4.en.html#footnote.8" id="fn8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>The incoming data flow will help us assess the relative likelihoods, timing and impact of these alternative risks, in addition to providing guidance on possible future revisions to the staff baseline projections. In addition to the financial and macroeconomic data, we will also learn from the latest editions of an array of internal and external surveys. In relation to our internal surveys, these include: the Corporate Telephone Survey (CTS); the Bank Lending Survey (BLS); the Survey on Access to Finance (SAFE); the Consumer Expectations Survey (CES); the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF); and the Survey of Monetary Analysts (SMA).</p>
<p>Procedurally, our approach to monetary policy must remain open-minded if we are to properly incorporate the evolving information on the inflation outlook and the surrounding risks. In particular, as stated by President Lagarde at the Bank of Finland conference last week: &ldquo;<span>For our part, we cannot pre-commit to any future rate path, whether one of action or inaction. We must remain agile, and ready to respond to the data as they come in</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Listing the Schroder ETFs ICAV Global Equity Active UCITS ETF USD ACC on SIX Swiss Exchange enables Schroders to leverage the distribution network of the Swiss stock exchange to access the Swiss market with its unique combination of domestic and international, institutional and private investors. As one of the first in Europe to launch an ETF segment in the year 2000 and having admitted the first active ETFs in 2011, SIX has an extensive track record of fostering ETF growth through innovation and its commitment to diversity and quality in its ETF marketplace.</p>
<p>By entering the Swiss market, Schroders is expanding its active ETF capability in Europe, demonstrating its ability to develop and offer clients actively managed and relevant products which meet their evolving needs. Their launch builds on Schroders&rsquo; existing ETF capabilities in the US and Australia, providing wider global access to its market-leading active management expertise. Schroders launched its first active ETFs in Australia in 2016, before launching its first active ETF with its US partner Hartford Funds in 2018.</p>
<p>Johanna Kyrklund, Group Chief Investment Officer, Schroders, said: &ldquo;Schroders is bringing more than 220 years of active investment expertise into European active ETFs for the first time. In today&rsquo;s dynamic market environment, access to market-leading active management expertise is crucial. This launch will ensure our clients can benefit from the potential returns delivered by our active investing edge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meagen Burnett, Chief Financial Officer, Schroders, said: &ldquo;This key milestone demonstrates our ability to harness the scale of Schroders&rsquo; investment and operating platforms to enhance the distribution access points for existing and new clients. Our European active ETF launches will enable us to reach more investors and further reinforce our commitment to moving at pace and offering the variety of investment tools and differentiated returns our clients increasingly expect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David Smith, Head ETF Sales, Exchanges, SIX commented: &ldquo;A very warm welcome to Schroders and their first ETF on our exchange. We're keen to support their growth ambitions in Europe and are looking forward to further listings which will broaden the investment opportunities of investors trading on SIX Swiss Exchange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this launch, SIX now hosts 34 ETF issuers offering a total of 2,098 ETFs &ndash; making it one of Europe&rsquo;s most dynamic and diverse ETF marketplaces. So far this year, 246 new ETFs have been listed at SIX Swiss Exchange of which 1/3 are actively managed products. ETF trading turnover has reached CHF 94.4 billion year-to-date (per 30 September 2025), marking an 65.8% increase over the first nine months of the previous year.&nbsp;</p>

<title>Thai Fiscal Policy Office, Thai Securities And Exchange Commission , SET And Federation Of Thai Capital Market Organizations Launch Initiative To Boost Thai Capital Market Attractiveness With Four Key Measures</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/thai-fiscal-policy-office-thai-securities-and-exchange-commission-set-and-fed-2025106/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><b>The Fiscal Policy Office (FPO), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET), and the Federation of Thai Capital Market Organizations (FETCO) have jointly announced the launch of the "Thai Capital Market Attractiveness Initiative," featuring four key measures: Quality Demand, Attractive Supply, Trusted Market and Supportive Ecosystem, to strengthen investor confidence, enhance competitiveness, and increase the attractiveness of the Thai capital market on the global stage.</b></p>
<p>The Taskforce for a Competitive and Attractive Market (Taskforce), which consists of representatives <br /> from the FPO, the SEC, the SET, and the FETCO, has recently convened a joint meeting to gather opinions, analyze issues, and seek approaches to enhance the capabilities of the Thai capital market so that it remains competitive and resilient in the face of challenges, while continuing to play an important role in supporting the Thai economy. The Taskforce reached a consensus and proposed the &ldquo;Thai Capital Market Attractiveness Initiatives,&rdquo; highlighting four main measures along with key urgent action plans for each measure, as follows:</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Quality Demand</span></b>: (1) Cultivate long-term investment culture through individual investment accounts to enable investors to convert their savings into long-term investments and diversify their portfolios across various assets, and expand new investor base, enhance investment services in the stock market and securities company products, as well as create a wealth aggregator for investors&rsquo; portfolios, and (2) Enhance domestic institutional investors&rsquo; role to increase Thai equity allocation;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Attractive Supply</span></b> (1) Attract quality listing to drive new growth into the Thai capital market, (2) Scale up listed firms&rsquo; quality to enhance value through the Jump+ and Value Up Program, (3) Streamline IPO and foreign listing process to boost fundraising and competitiveness in the regional markets, (4) Facilitate funding and strengthen the potential of SMEs and the new economy, and (5) Drive ESG performance disclosure in accordance with ISSB standard, focusing on actual implementation to attract investors who prioritize ESG responsibility at the international level;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Trusted Market:</span></b> (1) Strengthen corporate governance of listed firms and law enforcement, (2) Elevate standards for the supervision of gatekeepers to prevent inappropriate conduct, and (3) Leverage technology to broaden access to financial information of small-and medium-sized listed firms;<b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Supportive Ecosystem</span></b>: (1) Enhance capacities of domestic capital market participants in creating diverse investment products, (2) Utilize technology to increase retail investors&rsquo; access to investment and a transition of a digital capital market, (3) Review market microstructure to align with trading behaviors and ensure fairness across investor types, and (4) Facilitate foreign investors&rsquo; more convenient use of e-proxy voting rights.<b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></b></p>
<p><b>Warothai Kosolpisitkul, Ph.D. International Economic Advisor, FPO, said:</b> &ldquo;This set of measures to enhance the attractiveness of Thailand&rsquo;s capital market not only aims at strengthening the market&rsquo;s capabilities, but also at laying a solid foundation for the country&rsquo;s long-term economic growth. By attracting high-potential businesses to raise funds, the market creates greater opportunities to drive growth across various sectors and broaden the investor base. This will make the Thai capital market a more efficient fundraising platform for national development. These measures are also in line with the 4<sup>th</sup> Capital Market Development Plan (2022&ndash;2027), which capital market agencies have been consistently implementing. At the same time, the measures serve as &lsquo;Quick Win&rsquo; initiatives that will generate tangible short-term results while catalyzing long-term economic restructuring. As the agency responsible for national economic policy and overall capital market development, the FPO stands ready to cooperate with and support all sectors in advancing and sustaining these measures to deliver concrete benefits for the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Pornanong Budsaratragoon, Ph.D., SEC Secretary-General, said: </b>"The SEC has initiated the establishment of the Taskforce, which is a collaboration between government agencies and private sector organizations, to jointly drive concrete measures for developing the Thai capital market, promote sustainable long-term competitiveness aligned with the changing economic conditions and global context, and enhance confidence in the Thai capital market. We believe that driving systematic change requires collaborative efforts from all sectors in the capital market. The Thai Capital Market Attractiveness Initiative proposed by the Taskforce covers both the demand and supply sides, and working groups will be established to monitor and continuously advance the measures to accelerate tangible short-term results. Concurrently, in the next phase, the SEC will proceed with developing other areas of the capital market, including the bond market, investment units, as well as the transition toward a digital capital market, with additional taskforces to be established. The SEC stands ready to serve as a key mechanism in creating concrete cooperation among various agencies."<b></b></p>
<p><b>Mr. Asadej Kongsiri, SET President, </b>said: &ldquo;This Taskforce collaboration marks a significant turning point in elevating the potential, competitiveness, and attractiveness of Thailand&rsquo;s capital market. The SET is fully committed to driving forward the Capital Market Attractiveness Initiative to enhance market appeal &mdash;from attracting high-potential New Economy businesses to list on the exchange, and upgrading the quality of listed companies through the Jump+ program, to leveraging technology to improve investor access to information, diversifying investment products to serve all investor segments, and developing essential infrastructure. SET is determined to position Thailand&rsquo;s capital market as a vital engine for robust economic growth, equipped to weather global economic volatility and regional competition. We will focus on enhancing market quality, building credibility, and elevating governance standards to ensure that Thailand&rsquo;s capital market serves as an efficient fundraising platform.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Dr. Kobsak Pootrakool, FETCO Chairman, </b>said: &ldquo;Driving the Thai Capital Market Attractiveness Initiative is an important collaboration among all sectors within the capital market. This collective effort will strengthen Thailand&rsquo;s stock market competitiveness, enabling it to address emerging challenges while maintaining its pivotal role in supporting the Thai economy. In particular, the strategic focus on establishing tangible Quality Demand will serve as a key foundation for cultivating a long-term investment culture. This includes the development of individual investment accounts which will empower investors to transform their savings into sustainable long-term investments, preparing for the country&rsquo;s transition toward an aging society. Additionally, an investor data hub will provide comprehensive wealth management tools, functioning as a wealth aggregator for investors. Moreover, strengthening the role of domestic institutional investors will help drive stable and sustainable investments in the Thai capital market. These measures will ensure Thailand&rsquo;s stock market remains fundamental to the nation&rsquo;s sustainable economic growth.&rdquo;<br /> <br /></p>

<li><span>Euronext has received regulatory approval to launch a voluntary exchange offer to acquire all common registered ATHEX shares</span></li>
<li><span>Acceptance Period commences on 6 October 2025 and will end on 17 November 2025</span></li>
<li><span>A significant step towards a more integrated and more competitive capital market in Europe, establishing ATHEX as a financial hub in the Southeast Europe region</span></li>
<li><span>ATHEX to join Euronext&rsquo;s best-in-class trading and post-trade technology, boosting the visibility and attractiveness of the Greek market on an international scale</span></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify"><span>Euronext, the leading European capital market infrastructure, announces that all required regulatory approvals have been received for the commencement of the voluntary share exchange tender offer (&ldquo;</span><span>Tender Offer</span><span>&rdquo;) to acquire all common registered shares of HELLENIC EXCHANGES-ATHEX STOCK EXCHANGE S.A. (&ldquo;</span><span>ATHEX</span><span>&rdquo;) in consideration for ordinary shares newly issued by Euronext (&ldquo;</span><span>Consideration Shares</span><span>&rdquo;) at an exchange ratio of one (1) Consideration Share for twenty (20) ATHEX shares in accordance with Greek Law 3461/2006 (&ldquo;</span><span>Law</span><span>&rdquo;).</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>Strategic rationale for the Tender Offer</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>ATHEX&rsquo;s integration into Euronext&rsquo;s Group would allow Greek financial market participants to join a network of over 1,800 listed companies with a combined market capitalisation exceeding &euro;6 trillion. The interest of Euronext in ATHEX reflects Euronext&rsquo;s strong confidence in the positive development of the Greek economy and the growth potential resulting from further integration of Greek capital markets into the Eurozone and improved access to international investors. The combination would:</span></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><span>Embed ATHEX within Europe&rsquo;s largest liquidity pool:&nbsp;</span><span>Euronext aims to roll out its single liquidity pool, enabled by a single order book and empowered by its single trading platform &ldquo;Optiq&reg;&rdquo; to deepen the efficiency of the Greek financial market through access to the largest European pool of liquidity.</span> 
<ul type="disc">
<li><span>Strengthen access to financing for Greek corporates:&nbsp;</span><span>Greece will become a key hub for listings under a harmonised framework, offering greater scale, visibility, and access to European liquidity. Euronext will bolster financing of Greek SMEs through the pan-European pre-IPO educational programme &ldquo;IPOready&rdquo; and provide a platform for Greek companies to list debt, diversifying their financing sources.</span></li>
<li><span>Position ATHEX as the cornerstone of Euronext in Southeast Europe:&nbsp;</span><span>As part of the Euronext Group, ATHEX will be the cornerstone to lead Euronext&rsquo;s growth in the region, creating a hub for listing South-Eastern European companies in Athens.</span></li>
<li><span>Create a unified post-trade infrastructure</span><span>: Euronext relies on a single clearing house, clearing all of its European market flows across cash and derivatives products. As part of the combined Group, Euronext intends to expand Euronext Clearing, to cover Greek securities and to position Euronext Securities as the CSD of choice for Europe. With the acquisition of ATHEX, Euronext will expand its CSD platform and further consolidate the European post-trade market.</span></li>
<li><span>Unlock long-term value for shareholders</span><span>:</span><span>&nbsp;Euronext&rsquo;s offer provides a compelling opportunity for ATHEX shareholders to become investors in a leading pan-European business, benefitting from the integration of ATHEX within the Euronext ecosystem. Euronext's unique and proven track record in delivering significant benefits to every of the market infrastructures it has acquired over the past years is reflected in its impressive share price performance, which has increased by more than 600% since its IPO in 2014. Euronext shares furthermore provide additional liquidity benefits following the integration in the CAC 40&reg; index.</span><br /><br /></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p align="justify"><span>Unanimous support from ATHEX Board of Directors</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>The Board of Directors of ATHEX stated to ATHEX shareholders its unanimous support for the Tender Offer, and entered into a cooperation agreement with Euronext on 30 July 2025. All Directors of the Board owning shares, including the CEO of ATHEX, have signed undertakings to tender their shares, subject to the issuance of a reasoned opinion by the Board in favour of the Tender Offer as mandated by Greek law.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>St&eacute;phane Boujnah, CEO and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext, said:&nbsp;</span><span>&ldquo;</span><span>Europe is entering a new strategic phase in building more integrated European capital markets that serve local economies within the framework of a Savings and Investments Union. Greece&rsquo;s robust economic growth, supported by rising investment, growing international confidence, and solid fundamentals, makes this the right moment to strengthen its market. Through the integration of ATHEX into Euronext&rsquo;s ecosystem, Greece will play a key role in this European project.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>This move will enhance the visibility and international appeal of the Greek market, supporting the shared European goal of stronger, integrated and more efficient capital markets. The initiative has received strong and positive feedback from leading stakeholders who recognise the value of combining best-in-class infrastructures, technologies, and practices across Europe to convey investments to the real economy.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>Details of the Tender Offer</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>Commencing on&nbsp;</span><span>6 October 2025, at 08:00 (EEST) and ending on 17 November 2025, at 14:00 (EEST)</span><span>&nbsp;(&ldquo;</span><span>Acceptance Period</span><span>&rdquo;), holders of ATHEX Shares may accept the Tender Offer by submitting a relevant written declaration of acceptance to the participant or their intermediary that is a certified member of the Greek Dematerialised Securities System (the &ldquo;</span><span>DSS Participant</span><span>&rdquo; and the &ldquo;</span><span>DSS</span><span>&rdquo;, respectively) with which their ATHEX Shares are registered.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>The closing of the Tender Offer is subject to the prerequisite that, as at the end of the Acceptance Period, at least a minimum number of shares must have been lawfully and validly tendered to Euronext, namely 38,759,500 ATHEX Shares, corresponding to 67.0% of ATHEX&rsquo;s total voting rights whose exercise is not subject to suspension (the &ldquo;</span><span>Minimum Number of Shares</span><span>&rdquo;). This condition may be amended in accordance with the provisions of the Law.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>The completion of the Tender Offer is also subject to the customary regulatory approvals linked to the change of control of ATHEX and its subsidiaries.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>If, at the end of the Acceptance Period and subject to the fulfilment of the conditions, the relevant threshold is reached and, consequently, at closing, Euronext holds at least 52,065,000 ATHEX Shares representing at least 90.0% of ATHEX&rsquo;s voting rights, Euronext will exercise its squeeze-out right by filing an application to the Hellenic Capital Market Commission (&ldquo;</span><span>HCMC</span><span>&rdquo;) in accordance with the Law. Those shareholders who have not accepted the Tender Offer will, in such scenario, have the right to exercise their sell-out rights in accordance with the Law.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>The Consideration Shares carry the right to dividends, capital returns, distributions from distributable reserves or other distributions that may be made by Euronext after the date on which settlement of the Tender Offer is completed. Detailed information in relation to, among other matters, Consideration Shares and the rights of the holders of Consideration Shares is included in the Information Circular (</span><span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://connect-eu.notified.com/Tracker?data=nIykxSMjCgfoGAQGjmsp1NsPh7zi8aq_VUTiV04ewZNx-QPxjX5m7of3ZzYlZ_SpDchleCr1gGhzwDWREG9J4nalBR-zoQ4AvxKVJu2Ur3rpEIwt9i8XJZ4Jb60KVH7YSdd-16x2P10ILYddwLt5xA==000343557921" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">www.euronext.com/en/athex-offer</a></span><span>).</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>Financial impact and integration plan</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>Euronext expects to deliver significant synergies from the integration of ATHEX into its European market infrastructure. Annual run-rate cash synergies of &euro;12 million are targeted by the end of 2028, notably through (i) the migration of Greek trading to Optiq, and (ii) the harmonisation of central functions. Implementation costs to deliver those synergies are expected to amount to &euro;25 million. The transaction is expected to be accretive for Euronext shareholders after the delivery of synergies in year 1.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>The transaction is in line with Euronext&rsquo;s investment criteria of ROCE above WACC in years 3 to 5 after the acquisition. The proposed Tender Offer enables Euronext to preserve spare debt capacity to finance further diversification deals and to enhance the free float liquidity of the stock.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>In line with Euronext&rsquo;s federal model, the CEO of ATHEX would be proposed to join the Managing Board of Euronext N.V., and an independent representative from the Greek financial ecosystem would be proposed for the Supervisory Board of Euronext at the 2026 annual general meeting, replacing one of the current independent members of the Supervisory Board. The HCMC would remain the primary supervisory authority for Greek markets and would be invited to join Euronext&rsquo;s College of Regulators, becoming part of the supervision of the Euronext Group.</span></p>

<title>New Zealand Financial Markets Authority: IAG To Make Pecuniary Penalty Payment Of $19.5 Million For Widespread Failures</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Insurance company IAG New Zealand Limited has admitted to fair dealing breaches and the Court has imposed a final pecuniary penalty of $19,500,000.</p>
<p>Following an investigation by the Financial Markets Authority (FMA) &ndash; Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko - IAG has admitted making false and/or misleading representations in relation to its insurance products. &nbsp;</p>
<p>FMA Executive Director, Response and Enforcement Louise Unger said: &ldquo;The nature and scale of IAG&rsquo;s contraventions was greater than those present in any other fair dealing case the FMA has to date taken to Court, and the judgment confirms they warrant a significant penalty. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;IAG is New Zealand&rsquo;s largest insurer. It is a large and sophisticated market leader and accordingly plays a vital role in upholding market standards, yet its significant underinvestment led to widespread failures of its systems and processes, to the detriment of its customers. &nbsp;It also failed to respond to and report many of the issues in an appropriate timeframe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Justice Andrew found that &ldquo;nature and extent of IAG&rsquo;s contraventions to be the most aggravating feature of its conduct&rdquo; and that the &ldquo;penalty must be set at a level that sends a clear message to the financial market &ndash; and particularly similarly large and well-resourced institutions &ndash; as to the importance of investing in robust systems and making good on the promises to customers&rdquo;. &nbsp;His Honour also observed that &ldquo;IAG&rsquo;s knowledge of the breaches and the delay in reporting them to the FMA, particularly following the culture and conduct review, is an aggravating factor&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The penalty reflects discounts for IAG&rsquo;s self-reporting, its early offer of admissions, its exemplary cooperation with the FMA&rsquo;s investigation, and the steps taken to remediate its customers.</p>
<p>IAG breached the Financial Markets Conduct Act (FMCA) by failing to correctly price the premiums charged to customers, and by failing to correctly apply important discounts to its insurance products sold via its business divisions and distribution partners.</p>
<p>Between September 2021 and December 2024, IAG self-reported 41 issues to the FMA. of which ten of the most significant (and earlier reported) issues were pleaded as eight causes of action against IAG.</p>
<p>The breaches to which IAG has admitted affected approximately 269,000 customers and resulted in overcharges of approximately $35,000,000. The remaining 31 issues, which involve an estimated total remediation of $21 million, did not form part of the pleaded claim, however, they are recorded in a schedule to it and provide crucial context to IAG&rsquo;s conduct. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The penalty has been set at a level that sends a clear message to the financial market &ndash; and particularly similarly large and well-resourced institutions &ndash; as to the importance of investing in robust systems and making good on the promises made to customers,&rdquo; said Louise Unger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will continue to respond to misleading practices to ensure New Zealand has a fair financial system.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<title>New Zealand Financial Markets Authority: Pump And Dump Scam Nets Kiwi Investors</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/financial-markets-authority-pump-and-dump-scam-nets-kiwi-investors-2025106/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/financial-markets-authority-pump-and-dump-scam-nets-kiwi-investors-2025106/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Kiwi investors are being caught by a new &ldquo;pump and dump&rdquo; scam, says the Financial Markets Authority (FMA) &ndash; Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko. &nbsp;</p>
<p>FMA Director of Markets, Investors and Reporting, John Horner says: &ldquo;As we start World Investor Week, aimed at educating and protecting investors, it is timely to remind Kiwi investors about this latest version of the deepfake impersonation scam. We have issued a new warning.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This current scam uses social media scam advertisements featuring an impersonated business leader, encouraging investors to join a fake investor chat group. The FMA first raised its concerns about the impersonations in a public warning issued 19 August 2025, and has received further information showing the scam is part of a global network of scams aimed at market manipulation.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A pump and dump occurs when a person buys shares in a company and starts an organised campaign to increase (or 'pump') the share price. They then sell (or 'dump') their shares and make a profit, while the other shareholders suffer financial losses as the share price falls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Often those running a 'pump and dump' use social media and online forums to create a sense of excitement about buying a company&rsquo;s shares by spreading false information about the company's prospects. This excitement and interest artificially drives the share price up as they lure investors. &nbsp;This is considered a form of market manipulation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The pump and dump scam uses Facebook and Instagram ads impersonating a variety of well known Kiwi business leaders to target Kiwi investors, inviting them to join a chat group on a messaging platform such as WhatsApp. There, they are encouraged to use reputable trading platforms to buy low-value shares in companies listed on overseas exchanges, to artificially inflate the share price. The scammers sell their own shares at the inflated price and, when the price later drops, the victims are left bearing the loss. &nbsp;</p>
<p>After a victim suffers a loss, the scammers often claim, falsely, that the victim is entitled to compensation or reimbursement. The scammers then collect personal information and further payments from the victims. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have received a number of complaints, with multiple victims having lost significant amounts,&rdquo; said John Horner.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These complaints are likely only the tip of the iceberg. Because these impersonation pump and dump scams play out over days and weeks, it&rsquo;s possible there are others happening in New Zealand right now, with the scammers potentially pivoting to another company&rsquo;s shares. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We encourage New Zealanders to take extra care when considering investment decisions and seeking out investment advice. If an organisation is offering investment tips through social media, be cautious. Report any suspicious activity to the social media channel, to the company involved and to the FMA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We urge extreme caution to investors impacted by this or other scams which may include &lsquo;opportunities&rsquo; to trade out of this position or support to recover funds lost, these are also likely to be scams.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the FMA&rsquo;s functions is to promote the confident and informed participation of businesses, investors, and consumers in the financial markets. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have therefore taken steps to urgently issue an updated public warning to raise awareness of how this scam impacts investors and educate the general public on how to avoid being scammed.</p>
<p><span class="button-link--green-dark"><a href="https://www.fma.govt.nz/library/warnings-and-alerts/suspected-pump-and-dump-schemes/" title="Link to Warnings and alerts page">Investment advice group chats used in suspected pump-and-dump schemes</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Our aim is to make New Zealand an unattractive place for scammers to operate, by raising awareness of scam methods and encouraging investors to stop and think carefully before making investment decisions that might be driven by a scam.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMA is also sharing case details with the relevant overseas financial regulators, given some of the pumped shares are listed on a US exchange (NASDAQ) and some of the pumped companies are based in China.  &ldquo;There are currently similar scams operating overseas, with a warning recently issued by the FBI</p>

<p>The FMA has also alerted New Zealand banks and businesses being impersonated to let them know the impersonation scam has pivoted and is using new tactics, and is encouraging them to share the FMA warning.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>How the scam works</h3>
<ul>
<li>Scammers promote investment club group chats through social media. Often, the scammers will publish ads impersonating business leaders or financial commentators to promote the group chats. In some cases, the scammers send unsolicited invitations to the group chats through messaging platforms like WhatsApp.&nbsp;</li>
<li>In the group chats, an &lsquo;investment mentor&rsquo; provides trade recommendations to group members. The group chats appear to have dozens of members, but they are populated primarily with bot accounts controlled by the scammers.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The scammers may initially recommend purchasing shares of a large, well-known company such as Nvidia or Tesla. This is a tactic to build trust before drawing potential victims into the pump-and-dump scheme.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Eventually, the scammers will recommend shares in a smaller company. Members are often encouraged to message the investment mentor or their assistant directly, who will guide them through the investing process.</li>
<li>Over several weeks or months, the victims&rsquo; investments artificially inflate (or &lsquo;pump&rsquo;) the company&rsquo;s share price. The scammers then sell (or &lsquo;dump&rsquo;) their holdings at the inflated price. When the share price collapses, victims are left bearing the loss.&nbsp;</li>
<li>After the share price drops and the victims suffer a loss, the scammers may tell investors they are entitled to compensation or reimbursement. The scammers may ask victims to complete an online form, provide copies of their ID, or pay an application fees in order to gain access to the funds. This is a recovery scam, and is an attempt to harvest victims&rsquo; personal information or extract further funds.&nbsp;</li>

<title>New Zealand Financial Markets Authority: Former Financial Adviser Sentenced For “Gross Breach Of Trust”</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-former-financial-adviser-sentenced-for-2025106/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-zealand-financial-markets-authority-former-financial-adviser-sentenced-for-2025106/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Murray McClune, a former financial adviser, has been sentenced to three years and seven months&rsquo; imprisonment for two charges of theft by person in a special relationship. The charges followed an investigation by the Financial Markets Authority (FMA) &ndash; Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Judge also permanently banned Mr McClune from holding directorships, management positions, and providing financial advice and client money and property services under ss 517-518 of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 (<span>FMCA</span>), which Mr McClune did not oppose. No reparation order was made because the Judge considered to do so would be futile.</p>
<p>Mr McClune&rsquo;s sentence arises out of his theft of approximately $1.7m from elderly advice clients over the course of two years starting in 2016.</p>
<p>FMA Head of Enforcement Margot Gatland said Mr McClune had committed serious offences. &ldquo;His conduct was both deliberate and dishonest, and involved a gross breach of trust. The conduct arose in the course of his role as a financial adviser, a position he used to take advantage of his clients.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Banning Mr McClune ensures protection of the public and deters others from committing breaches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Between 2016 and 2018, while working as a registered financial adviser, Mr McClune offered investment opportunities to two couples who had known him for over 40 years, and were in their retirement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rather than invest the funds he had received, he spent them on various personal and business expenses, including purchasing a home in his and his wife&rsquo;s name. Funds were also spent on food and entertainment, travel and overseas expenses, wills and funeral planning and cash withdrawals. While much of the funds were eventually returned to the investors, in one case the investors had to pursue court action to secure the return of some of their funds, and both investors were left with some money owing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr McClune was a trusted financial adviser of over 40 years&rsquo; experience and his clients were entitled to trust their adviser, particularly considering his long-standing experience, his profession, and his registration on the Financial Service Provider Register,&rdquo; said Margot Gatland.</p>
<p>Mr McClune has a previous conviction for a charge of obtaining by deception. His victim in that case was well-known to him as a good family friend, and Mr McClune was a financial adviser to her and her late husband for over 40 years. Her husband died in 2007, and Mr McClune advised her that he could make an increased gain on her superannuation savings which would be ready for her when she turned 65 in 2015. Between 2009 and 2010, Mr McClune made withdrawals from his victim&rsquo;s investment funds. The total amount taken over an eight-month period was $203,500. Mr McClune used those funds for his and his wife&rsquo;s personal expenses, and to pay other business associates.</p>
<p>The current offending occurred before he was charged and convicted for the previous offending.&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Mr McClune was registered on the Financial Service Providers Register as an insurance broker from 26 March 2011 to 2 November 2016. He was registered as a financial adviser between 26 March 2011 and 26 April 2022. Mr McClune offered his services primarily through his business Insurance Plus Ltd.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Highlighting the company&rsquo;s strategic role in Iran&rsquo;s industrial and economic development, the CEO stated: &ldquo;Kaveh South Kish Steel Company is currently one of the largest producers of steel and sponge iron in the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He added, &ldquo;Fortunately, KSK successfully implemented its &ldquo;continuous production&rdquo; plan in the current year, achieving higher output levels and enhanced productivity across its steel production cycle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hatami emphasized that the company&rsquo;s integrated strategies and cohesive planning in production and sales have significantly enhanced Kaveh&rsquo;s standing in the Iran Mercantile Exchange (IME), so that KSK secured the top rank in IME this year according to the key indicators, including supply, demand, and trading value.</p>
<p>Established in 2007 in Hormozgan Province, KSK benefits from a strategic geographic location, easy access to southern ports, efficient North-South rail transit capabilities, reliable water resources, and proximity to valuable metallic mines - and ensures collectively strong economic viability.</p>
<p>The company listed at TSE in 2017 and currently holds a market capitalization around IRR 180 trillion.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Dean Madan. I appreciate the opportunity to speak here at Drexel University and to visit Philadelphia, an area where I have spent much of my personal and professional life.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20251003a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;I will not go on too much about the City of Brotherly Love other than to say I am considering jogging up the steps of the art museum before I catch my train home.</p>
<p>It is an honor to take part in the inaugural Drexel Economic Forum and to meet some of the students, researchers, and business leaders who are here. It is an important time for these groups to hold this event because there is much to discuss about the quickly evolving economy. For my part, as a Federal Reserve policymaker, I am committed to achieving the dual mandate given to us by Congress of promoting maximum employment and stable prices. Delivering on these goals matters to communities, families, and businesses across the country, including right here in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>To inform our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-20251003-slide2.jpg" id="fig2">discussion</a>&nbsp;today, I will share with you my economic outlook and offer my current view of monetary policy before sharing with you some highlights from the Federal Reserve's newly revised monetary policy framework. After my remarks I look forward to answering a few questions.</p>
<p><span>Economic Outlook</span><br />Looking broadly across the U.S. economy, I see that growth has moderated this year, and the risks to both sides of our dual mandate have shifted. Employment growth has slowed because of weaker growth in labor supply and a softening in labor demand. The uptick in the unemployment rate relative to the start of the year suggests that demand has fallen by a bit more than supply and that the downside risks to employment are rising. Meanwhile, higher tariffs are showing through to higher inflation for some goods. I expect that the effects of tariffs on inflation, employment, and economic activity will further show through in coming months.</p>
<p>In the first half of 2025, U.S.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-20251003-slide3.jpg" id="fig3">GDP</a>&nbsp;grew at a 1.6 percent annual rate, which reflects a marked cooling from last year's 2.4 percent growth rate. The slowdown in economic activity in the first half of this year was primarily driven by weaker consumer spending. That said, U.S. retail spending picked up over the summer. Overall, I expect the U.S. economy to maintain the first half's rate of growth through the remainder of the year.</p>
<p>In terms of the labor market, we did not receive the September jobs report this morning because of a lapse in federal government funding. While this is less than ideal, I never focus on a single report; rather, I look across an array of indicators to assess the labor market and the economy.</p>
<p>The available data from both government and private-sector sources point out that labor supply and demand are slowing together, as reflected in the ratio of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-20251003-slide4.jpg" id="fig4">job openings to unemployed</a>&nbsp;Americans seeking work. A few years ago, available jobs well exceeded the unemployment level. That came back into balance over the past year or so. Data released earlier this week showed the unemployment level slightly exceeded openings this summer, but what economists call the V/U ratio remains near 1. Similarly, last week the Labor Department reported that initial jobless claims continue to mostly trend sideways. Net immigration into the U.S., an important contributor to workforce growth, has dropped sharply, and that is a factor restraining a more significant increase in unemployment.</p>
<p>Turning to the other side of our dual mandate, it is notable that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-20251003-slide5.jpg" id="fig5">inflation</a>&nbsp;has slowed considerably from the highs that occurred when the economy reopened after pandemic disruptions. Inflation, however, remains somewhat above our 2 percent target, and the tariffs that have been announced and implemented so far are showing up in some goods prices. Overall, personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices rose 2.7 percent over the 12 months ending in August. Core PCE inflation&mdash;which removes volatile food and energy prices&mdash;was 2.9 percent in August.</p>
<p>Often, it is helpful to study the three major&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-20251003-slide6.jpg" id="fig6">components of core PCE inflation</a>&nbsp;to better understand what is driving overall price measures. Currently, core goods prices, which declined modestly last year, have been rising, reflecting tariff effects, although it is also notable that the increase so far has been smaller than what many forecasters predicted this spring. Meanwhile, core services inflation, outside of housing, has generally trended sideways this year, while housing inflation appears to be on a gradual downward trend.</p>
<p>I view the uncertainty around my baseline outlook as especially high, mainly due to the changes in government policies and the challenges around assessing their net effects on employment and inflation. As the changes in these policies are finalized and we have more time to judge how they are affecting the economy, I expect some of the broader uncertainty around the U.S. economy to diminish.</p>
<p><span>Monetary Policy</span><br />Considering the outlook I described, I see the risks to employment as tilted to the downside and risks to inflation to the upside. It follows that both sides of our mandate are under pressure.</p>
<p>While tariff-related inflation is apparent in the prices of goods, tariff increases typically represent a one-time change in the price level. The scope and persistence of the related rise in inflation will be determined by several factors&mdash;including the final tariff rates, the extent of pass-through to consumer prices, the effects on supply chains, overall economic conditions, and what happens to longer-run inflation expectations. Short-term inflation expectations have come down from the peaks reached in the second quarter, and most measures of longer-term inflation expectations have been largely stable, suggesting that the American people understand our commitment to returning inflation to our 2 percent target. As such, I expect the disinflation process to resume after this year and inflation to return to the 2 percent target in the coming years.</p>
<p>As I noted above, trends across several data series indicate that the labor market is softening, which suggests that, left unsupported, it could experience stress. To balance the risk of persistent above-target inflation and the risk of a deteriorating labor market, I supported a 25 basis point cut in our target range at the last FOMC meeting. This change moved our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-20251003-slide7.jpg" id="fig7">policy rate</a>&nbsp;closer to a more neutral stance while maintaining a balanced approach to promoting our dual-mandate objectives.</p>
<p>With respect to the path of the policy rate going forward, I will continue to evaluate the appropriate stance of monetary policy based on the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.  I will also consider and assess information about government policies and their effects on the economy.</p>
<p><span>The Fed's Revised Framework</span><br />Now that I have discussed my outlook and the latest policy decision, I want to turn to an important document that I use to guide those decisions: the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-20251003-slide8.jpg" id="fig8">Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy</a>. This statement is designed to give the public a clear sense of how we think about monetary policy. As Chair Powell discussed at his Jackson Hole speech, a revised version of that document was issued in August.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20251003a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a></p>
<p>The framework document, often called the consensus statement, was first issued in 2012, under Chair Ben Bernanke's leadership. The Fed's dual mandate, established by Congress, to foster maximum employment and stable prices underpins this framework. Our commitment to delivering on our dual mandate is unwavering. The revisions to our framework will support that mission across a broad range of economic conditions.</p>
<p>The FOMC revised its consensus statement after conducting a public review. That review consisted of three elements: first, Reserve Banks hosted&nbsp;<em>Fed Listens</em>&nbsp;events; second, the Board hosted a research conference; and third, we convened a series of policymaker discussions at FOMC meetings this year, supported by staff analysis. The changes implemented as a result of this review were a logical progression, not a change in course, grounded in our ever-evolving understanding of our economy. I will make note of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-20251003-slide9.jpg" id="fig9">four adjustments</a>&nbsp;to the consensus statement and discuss each in turn.</p>
<p>First, the revised consensus statement removed language emphasizing the effective lower bound (ELB) as a defining feature of the economic landscape. Instead, it states that our monetary policy strategy is designed to promote maximum employment and stable prices across a broad range of economic conditions. This revision, reflecting a move away from the post&ndash;financial crisis era of historically low interest rates, makes our framework more robust. It is useful to recall that at the time of the FOMC's previous framework review, during 2019 and 2020, policymakers were considering an economy that had for many years demonstrated low growth, low inflation, and a very flat Phillips curve&mdash;meaning that inflation was not very responsive to slack in the economy. The overarching concern for central bankers at that time was how to operate when short-term interest rates are near the ELB. Today, of course, we are operating in a very different environment, at least in part brought on by the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Second, the revised framework embraces a flexible inflation-targeting approach at all times and eliminates a "makeup" strategy that would be employed in certain circumstances. The experience of the U.S. economy since the pandemic highlights different challenges to achieving our inflation mandate&mdash;such as supply shocks, sectoral developments, and nonlinear inflation dynamics. The flexible inflation-targeting strategy outlined in our revised framework allows us to take a balanced approach in promoting our goals by considering the extent of departures from them. The revised framework appropriately emphasizes the Committee's commitment to ensuring that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.</p>
<p>Third, the revised consensus statement provides clarity on how the Committee thinks about its legislated goal of maximum employment. The 2020 version of the statement indicated that the Fed would mitigate "shortfalls" from maximum employment. This shortfalls strategy was partly motivated by our recognition that real-time assessments of the natural rate of unemployment&mdash;and hence of "maximum employment"&mdash;are highly uncertain. However, the use of the word "shortfalls" created some communications challenges, as it was not intended to be a commitment that the Committee would never follow preemptive policy actions or ignore tight labor market conditions. As a result, we have removed it from the consensus statement. Instead, the revised document more precisely states that "the Committee recognizes that employment may at times run above real-time assessments of maximum employment without necessarily creating risks to price stability."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20251003a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;As Chair Powell pointed out, preemptive action could well be warranted if tightness in the labor market or other factors pose risks to price stability. The revised statement defines maximum employment as "the highest level of employment that can be achieved on a sustained basis in a context of price stability."</p>
<p>Fourth, and closely aligned with the change I just discussed, the FOMC clarified the approach that it would take to monetary policy in times when the employment and inflation sides of our mandate may be at odds. The revised statement says that, in such periods, the Committee will follow "a balanced approach in promoting them, taking into account the extent of departures from its goals and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with its mandate." The revised language more closely aligns with the original 2012 statement. It is also consistent with the Committee's actions during the 2022&ndash;24 period, when the departure from our 2 percent inflation target was the overriding concern.</p>
<p>I have just highlighted a series of changes that we made to the framework statement, but it is also important to note the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-20251003-slide10.jpg" id="fig10">continuity</a>&nbsp;with past versions of our statement. The document continues to explain how we interpret the mandate Congress has given us and describes the policy framework that we believe will best promote maximum employment and price stability. We also continue to believe that monetary policy must be forward looking and consider the lags in its effects on the economy. We have never set a numerical goal for employment because the maximum level of employment is not directly measurable and changes over time for reasons unrelated to policy. Likewise, we maintained our commitment to a 2 percent inflation objective because that is a key factor helping keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored, thus supporting both sides of our dual mandate. And we remain committed to conducting a public review roughly every five years.</p>
<p><span>Conclusion</span><br />The FOMC remains fully committed to fulfilling its statutory mandate, and the revisions to the framework will support that mission across a broad range of economic conditions. Thank you for allowing me to share with you details of the revised monetary policy framework and my views on the current economic outlook. I hope both will serve as jumping-off points for your discussions over the rest of the afternoon. Once again, I am honored to take part in this inaugural event and look forward to our conversation.</p>

<p>Following the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dfs.ny.gov/reports_and_publications/press_releases/pr250929" id="menurra1" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" title="https://www.dfs.ny.gov/reports_and_publications/press_releases/pr250929">announcement</a>&nbsp;on Monday, September 29, that Superintendent Harris has decided to leave DFS, external stakeholders have reached out to congratulate the Superintendent and recognize the work of the Department in improving the lives of New Yorkers over the last four years.</p>
<p><span>Congressman Gregory Meeks:&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Superintendent Harris has led DFS with vision, integrity, and an unwavering commitment to protecting consumers while fostering innovation in the financial services sector. By championing Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) and expanding minority banking access, she has opened doors for small businesses, families, and communities that have long been underserved. I thank her for her service and lasting contributions to New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Congressman Ritchie Torres:&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Superintendent Harris has been a true partner in protecting consumers and strengthening New York&rsquo;s financial system. Under her leadership, DFS pushed for innovation, expanded access to financial services, and worked to make our markets fair. I&rsquo;m grateful for her service and proud of what we&rsquo;ve been able to accomplish together for New Yorkers. I wish her nothing but the best in what comes next.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>State Senator Liz Krueger,&nbsp;Chair of the New York State Senate Finance Committee</span>:&nbsp;&ldquo;It has been an honor working together with Superintendent Harris throughout her tenure at DFS. She has been a champion for the needs of New Yorkers, whether through safeguarding access to the full spectrum of reproductive care, standing up for older New Yorkers in the face of insurance company malfeasance, or, most recently, protecting New Yorkers' access to that COVID vaccine. I wish her the best of luck in her next role.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>State Senator James Sanders Jr., Chair of the New York State Senate Banks Committee:&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;I want to heartily congratulate New York State Department of Financial Services Superintendent Adrienne Harris for serving honorably and professionally during her tenure as the chief regulator of the State that is a global leader in banking. Superintendent Harris&rsquo; leadership has addressed many emerging issues including cryptocurrency, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, climate change, as well as the long-term issues of banking discrimination, a sound banking system, and many others. I wish Superintendent Harris well on her future endeavors. As Chair of the Senate Banks Committee, I look forward to working with the incoming Acting Superintendent Kaitlin Asrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>State Senator Zellnor Myrie,&nbsp;Chair of the New York State Senate Codes Committee</span>: &ldquo;As Superintendent, Adrienne Harris has fought to ensure financial services work for all New Yorkers. In a moment when consumers are especially vulnerable to fraud and manipulation,&nbsp;Superintendent Harris and DFS have worked to build an equitable, fair and transparent financial system. I'm grateful for her service to our state and look forward to continuing the work of keeping more money in New Yorkers' pockets.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>State Assembly Majority Leader Crystal Peoples-Stokes:</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;I want to thank Superintendent Harris for her steadfast commitment to the people of the State of New York during her tenure leading the Department of Financial Services. Superintendent Harris&rsquo; many notable accomplishments ensured New York remained the trusted financial capital of the world while always looking out for the consumers&rsquo; best interests. She will be missed, and I wish her all the best in her future endeavors.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>State&nbsp;Assemblymember David Weprin, Chair of the New York State Assembly Insurance Committee:</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;I want to thank Superintendent Adrienne Harris for her partnership and her dedication to protecting consumers and strengthening New York&rsquo;s insurance market.

<p><span>State Assemblymember John T. McDonald</span>&nbsp;<span>III, RPh,&nbsp;Chair of the New York State Assembly Governmental Operations Committee</span>: &ldquo;Superintendent Harris has been a true breath of fresh air during her four years as Superintendent of the Department of Financial Services (DFS).&nbsp; We immediately connected on the issue of governing Pharmaceutical Benefit Managers (PBMs) and we have had a strong start in regulating this area which is important to consumers, providers, and payors.&nbsp; That being said, I do not believe many people understand the full breadth and depth of the range of topics DFS covers and I have been with Adrienne in many different forums over the past four years and am amazed at the depth of her knowledge on even the most minor of issues.&nbsp; This is a reflection of her commitment to the people of New York and the close working relationship with the team and staff she has worked hard to develop over her time as Superintendent. Her presences and expertise will be missed, but I am comforted by the fact that she leaves DFS in a much better place than she found it.&nbsp; I wish her the best in her next chapter.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>State Assemblymember Clyde Vanel,&nbsp;Chair of the New York State Assembly Banks Committee:&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Protecting consumers and safeguarding the stability of our financial system are at the very heart of the Department of Financial Services&rsquo; mission, and under Superintendent Adrienne Harris&rsquo;s leadership, those priorities were elevated to new heights. From day one, she demonstrated a bold vision for what responsible and forward-looking regulation should look like in an age of rapid technological and economic change. During her tenure, she drove significant progress in areas such as cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence, advanced cybersecurity protections, and championed efforts to secure restitution for victims harmed by financial institutions.<span>&nbsp;</span>I am confident that the strong foundation she built will continue to benefit both consumers and the financial services industry for years to come. I wish her nothing but success as she takes the next steps in her remarkable career, and I have no doubt Acting Superintendent Kaitlin Asrow will make a fantastic successor.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Assemblymember Alex Bores</span>: "I am sad to see Superintendent Harris leave her role at DFS, where she has been invaluable to the protection of New York&rsquo;s consumers. Leading from the front, when a constituent of mine was affected by a specific DFS stance, Superintendent Harris gave the issue her personal attention to resolve the matter and changed DFS policy to properly accommodate. I look forward to working with the new superintendent, who will be tasked with filling the shoes of one of the most capable public servants I have had the pleasure of working with."</p>
<p><span>Elisabeth R. Benjamin, Vice President of Health Initiatives at the Community Service Society of New York, leader of the statewide #EndMedicalDebt campaign, and member of the DFS Consumer Protection Advisory Council</span>: &ldquo;Under Superintendent Adrienne Harris&rsquo; tremendous leadership, New York was able to achieve important strides for health care affordability. The Hochul Administration and Superintendent Harris led the way on abolishing co-payments for insulin and expunging medical debt from tens of thousands of credit reports.&nbsp; These policies help tens of thousands of New York healthcare consumers maintain their economic security in these turbulent times.&nbsp; We look forward to continuing to improve health insurance affordability under Acting Superintendent Kaitlin Asrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Mike Pierce, Executive Director of Protect Borrowers and member of the DFS Consumer Protection Advisory Council:</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Superintendent Harris fought for New Yorkers as they've struggled to shoulder rising costs and navigate a shifting and risky financial services market.

<p><span>Kathryn Wylde, President &amp; CEO, Partnership for New York City:</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Adrienne has transformed the Department of Financial Services from an obscure bureaucracy into a smart, responsive regulator.

<p><span>Brandon Milhorn, President &amp; CEO of the Conference of State Banking Supervisors:</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Superintendent Harris has been a strong advocate for state authority and expertise, particularly in digital assets. Her leadership on the CSBS Board and FSOC strengthened the state system and advanced a more dynamic and resilient financial system.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span>Karen Ignani, Chair of Emblem Health and&nbsp;member of the DFS&nbsp;Insurance Advisory Board: &ldquo;</span>Superintendent Harris&rsquo; efforts have ensured that New York has set the regulatory bar on critical national issues, such as cybersecurity and the use of artificial intelligence.&rdquo;</p>

<ul>
<li>Over the past 12 months, the final Basel III standards came into effect in more than 40% of the Basel Committee's 27 member jurisdictions.</li>
<li>The revised credit risk and operational risk standards as well as the output floor are now in effect in around 80% of member jurisdictions.</li>
<li>The Committee will continue to closely monitor and assess the full and consistent implementation of Basel III standards.</li>
</ul>
<p>Member jurisdictions of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision have made significant progress in implementing the Basel III reforms over the past year, according to the Committee's latest&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/implementation/rcap_reports.htm"><span class="firstword">progress</span>&nbsp;update</a>&nbsp;published today.</p>
<p>The update and monitoring dashboard set out the jurisdictional adoption status of the Basel III standards as of end-September 2025 and show where the standards are already implemented by banks. They cover the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d424.htm"><span class="firstword">final</span>&nbsp;elements of Basel III</a>&nbsp;published by the Committee in December 2017 and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d457.htm"><span class="firstword">finalised</span>&nbsp;minimum capital requirements for market risk</a>&nbsp;of January 2019. The implementation date for these reforms was 1 January 2023,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/press/p200327.htm"><span class="firstword">as</span>&nbsp;announced by the Governors and Heads of Supervision (GHOS) &ndash; the Basel Committee's oversight body &ndash; in March 2020</a>.</p>
<p>Since the previous annual update, the final Basel III standards came into effect in more than 40% of the 27 member jurisdictions. Consequently, the revised credit risk and operational risk standards, as well as the output floor are now in effect in around 80% of member jurisdictions, the CVA standard in nearly 70%, and the revised market risk standards in nearly 40%.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The monitoring dashboard provides the implementation history of Basel standards by member jurisdictions, including the publication and implementation dates of their domestic regulations.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor, has today published its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2025-10/ESMA22-50751485-1604_Annual_Work_Programme_2026.pdf">2026 Annual Work Programme</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify">Guided by its multi-annual strategy for 2023&ndash;2028 which sets out three strategic priorities and two thematic drivers, ESMA&rsquo;s 2026 work programme focuses on delivering on core policy and supervisory mandates while contributing to ambitious reforms for more integrated, accessible, and innovative EU capital markets.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>Verena Ross, Chair of ESMA, said:&nbsp;</span></p>
<h6 class="text-align-justify"><em>&ldquo;A core focus in 2026 is ESMA&rsquo;s ambitious, and at the same time pragmatic, approach to simplification and burden reduction. We are pursuing a holistic strategy to streamline rules, enhance risk-based supervision and ensure proportionate reporting requirements across the ESMA remit.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span>In that spirit, we will continue the work linked to three landmark consultations already launched in 2025, on integrated funds reporting, transactional reporting and the investor journey.&nbsp;</em></h6>
<h6 class="text-align-justify"><em>We also stand ready to play a central role in the legislative initiatives set out in the upcoming SIU Strategy, including the removal of barriers in trading and post-trading, facilitating cross-border provision of funds, and strengthening supervision across the EU single market.&rdquo;</em></h6>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>Natasha Cazenave, Executive Director of ESMA, said:&nbsp;</span></p>
<h6 class="text-align-justify"><em>&ldquo;ESMA&rsquo;s ongoing supervisory responsibilities will expand in 2026, through the authorisation and supervision of Consolidated Tape Providers (CTPs), external reviewers under the European Green Bond framework (EUGBR), ESG rating providers, and the extension of third-country benchmark supervision. ESMA and its fellow European Supervisory Authorities will also, for the first time, jointly exercise the oversight of critical third party providers under the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA).</em></h6>
<h6 class="text-align-justify"><em>These new responsibilities will complement our existing mandates and be subject to our risk based, data driven and outcome focused supervision. Through extensive outreach and preparatory work, ESMA supervisory teams are gearing up to take on these new responsibilities."&nbsp;</em></h6>
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span>Supporting the Saving and Investments Union (SIU)</span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify">In 2026, ESMA will continue to build on existing priorities, supporting the forthcoming strategic developments set out by the Commission&rsquo;s Saving and Investments Union (SIU) Strategy. This includes aligning supervisory practices across Member States, enhancing market data capabilities, and actively contributing to upcoming reforms designed to create a more integrated and globally competitive EU financial system.&nbsp;<span>ESMA also aims at seizing opportunities arising from digitalisation, for example by facilitating the simplification and use of clear language in disclosures.</span></p>
<p class="text-align-justify">ESMA&rsquo;s activities will remain closely aligned with the agenda of the European Commission and co-legislators, maintaining the agility needed to address evolving regulatory, economic, and technological landscapes. This responsiveness is crucial as volatility, uncertainty, and rapid change shape the global environment and impact EU financial markets. Given the significance of the forthcoming proposals under the Savings and Investments Union, ESMA stands ready to provide its technical expertise and support to the preparation and implementation of the new legislative files that will be launched.</p>
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span>Other regulatory and supervisory priorities for 2026</span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify">Beyond the priorities coming from the SIU strategy, ESMA will continue supporting implementation of key legislative files agreed under the previous legislature, notably the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR 3) and the European Single Access Point (ESAP).&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>Other ongoing legislative files which, depending on progress, may require ESMA&rsquo;s attention in 2026 are the Retail Investment Strategy (RIS), as well as the review of the PRIIPS, SFDR and Securitisation Regulation.&nbsp;ESMA will ensure that it integrates the principles of Simplification and Burden Reduction across all its activities and will follow up on the 2025 &lsquo;flagship&rsquo; projects seeking simplification and efficiencies in disclosure and reporting frameworks.</span></p>
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span>Driving data innovation and market integration</span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify">ESMA will focus on enhancing data capabilities and promoting innovation across the EU financial sector. Key projects for 2026 include the rollout of the ESMA Data Platform, centralisation studies, and the development of AI-powered supervisory tools. These initiatives will bring common benefits to both ESMA and the National Competent Authorities, improving market efficiency and transparency through the support that data provides for risk-based and data-driven supervision across Europe.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>In the digital finance sector ESMA will continue to focus on the effective implementation of MiCA, as it is key to ensuring investor protection and the orderly functioning of crypto-asset markets. ESMA&rsquo;s supervisory convergence efforts will remain focused notably on the authorisation and supervision of CASPs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>Finally, i</span>n line with the EU&rsquo;s ambition to accelerate the settlement cycle to T+1 by 11 October 2027, ESMA will also coordinate closely with market participants to ensure the smooth transition and preparedness of the financial sector for this event.</p>

</div>
</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At today&rsquo;s symposium, we are saying a fond farewell to an outstanding colleague and friend. Klaas, you can look back on a remarkable career in public service at the national, European and global levels.</p>
<p>You were at the helm of De Nederlandsche Bank for over 5,000 days.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.1" id="fn1">1</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;In that time, you were a gifted communicator, conveying complex themes to the Dutch public in clear but never simplistic terms.</p>
<p>As a member of the Governing Council, you participated in over 330 meetings, overseen by three different ECB Presidents. I won&rsquo;t put you on the spot by asking you who your favourite was. You can tell me later &ndash; no pressure.</p>
<p>Being one of the elders on the Governing Council, your voice carried a weight that helped to forge policy consensus at the most critical of moments &ndash; be it during the pandemic or during the sharpest inflation shock in a generation.</p>
<p>And with experience comes wisdom. As Chair of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), you used that wisdom to advance the global agenda on financial stability, shaping international standards and coordination.</p>
<p>Klaas, you are known for reminding colleagues who tend to talk at length to be more &ldquo;impactful&rdquo; in their interventions. Well, now the pressure is on me. I promise to be as &ldquo;impactful&rdquo; as I can.</p>
<p>So today, I would like to focus on the two themes that have defined your career: monetary policy and financial stability.&nbsp;<a class="link-inline" id="_Hlk209781803"></a>And in so doing, I will discuss the powerful role that regulation and supervision can play in reducing the potential trade-offs between them.</p>
<h2>The interaction between monetary policy and financial stability</h2>
<p><a class="link-inline" id="_Hlk210203869"></a>Financial stability and price stability are preconditions for each other.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.2" id="fn2">2</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;Yet history shows that in the pursuit of price stability, monetary policy can face two key trade-offs with implications for financial stability.</p>
<p>The first can occur when monetary policy rapidly tightens. Higher interest rates help to curb inflation, but they can put pressure on banks by eroding asset values and asset quality, even as rising net interest margins offer them some relief.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.3" id="fn3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>We saw this during the 1980s, when the Federal Reserve rapidly tightened monetary policy to bring down high inflation.</p>
<p>Combined with US deregulation in the late 1970s, which encouraged riskier lending and weaker oversight, this monetary tightening was one of the key factors in the emergence of the savings and loan crisis. That led to the failure of roughly 1,300 savings institutions owing to the maturity mismatch on their balance sheets.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.4" id="fn4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>The second trade-off for monetary policy can arise during or following an extended period of monetary accommodation.</p>
<p>When inflation is below target, low rates can help stimulate demand and push inflation back towards target. But in an environment where regulation is relatively weak and especially where rates remain low for an extended period, they can also encourage borrowing, risk-taking and the build-up of financial imbalances.</p>
<p>These dynamics highlight how monetary policy can affect financial stability not only through banks&rsquo; balance sheets but also via market valuations and investor risk appetite.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.5" id="fn5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>Crucially, financial vulnerabilities may keep building even&nbsp;<em>after</em>&nbsp;rates begin to rise. We saw this in the lead-up to the global financial crisis of 2008.</p>
<p>Low rates earlier in the decade fed the US credit and housing boom that later unravelled &ndash; years after the Federal Reserve had begun to gradually tighten. And in the euro area, the sharp rise in private debt in some countries was a key driver of imbalances that built up before the crisis.</p>
<p>The lesson for policymakers was clear. Insufficient regulation and supervision had allowed risks to build unchecked, leaving monetary policy as&nbsp;<em>de facto</em>&nbsp;the only tool available to confront the fallout.</p>
<p>This placed an undue burden on central banks, forcing them to shoulder responsibilities that could have been better managed through stronger safeguards in the first place. That insight powered the construction of a stronger regulatory and supervisory framework after 2008.</p>
<p>The post-2008 regulatory and supervisory framework was a turning point for the interaction between monetary policy and financial stability. It served as a powerful lever in mitigating the trade-offs between them and, accordingly, increased monetary policy&rsquo;s room for manoeuvre.</p>
<h2>Monetary policy in extraordinary times</h2>
<p>This was most visible during two extraordinary periods for monetary policy that followed in the wake of the global financial crisis.</p>
<p>The first period was when inflation was too low.</p>
<p>Central banks across advanced economies turned to a set of new &ndash; and, at the time, unconventional &ndash; tools to meet their price stability mandates, including large-scale asset purchase programmes and the introduction of negative interest rates.</p>
<p>These were significant measures to fight a significant challenge. And at the time, there were vocal concerns that these measures would fuel financial instability.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.6" id="fn6">6</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;Certainly, asset prices and housing valuations&nbsp;<em>did</em>&nbsp;rise notably during this period.</p>
<p>But crucially, given the stronger regulatory and supervisory regime, rising asset prices did&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;translate into excessive leverage<span>&nbsp;</span>in the banking system. In fact, banks in the euro area deleveraged in the decade after the global financial crisis. Similarly, private sector debt as a share of GDP also fell during that time.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.7" id="fn7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>And here in the Netherlands, we saw how macroprudential policy acted as the first line of defence against financial imbalances.</p>
<p>Under your leadership, Klaas, the DNB strengthened the macroprudential framework, introducing higher capital buffers and stricter risk weight requirements to guard against housing market risks. These measures kept in check vulnerabilities that might once have spilled over into broader financial instability.</p>
<p>After years of below-target inflation, the second period came unexpectedly &ndash; when euro area inflation surged to record highs after the pandemic and the energy shock sparked by Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>In the Netherlands, for example, inflation rose rapidly, peaking just above 17% in September 2022 &ndash; almost six times the rate recorded a year earlier.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.8" id="fn8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>Once again, we faced an extraordinary situation &ndash; and the ECB had to step up. Alongside the unwinding of its asset purchases, it raised rates ten times by a cumulative 450 basis points, the fastest tightening in its history.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.9" id="fn9">9</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>And once again, there were concerns about the financial stability implications of such a rapid tightening.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.10" id="fn10">10</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>Tighter financing conditions risked straining borrower debt service and triggering market repricing. That, in turn, could have exposed financial institutions to vulnerabilities from falling asset values, maturity mismatches and weaker asset quality.</p>
<p>While there were some notable bank failures during this period, the global financial system overall remained broadly resilient to rising rates.</p>
<p>In the euro area, for example, banks were supported by stronger capital and ample liquidity buffers. Strong supervision also helped. Even before the inflation shock hit in full, the Single Supervisory Mechanism had factored interest rate risks into its supervisory work programme.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.11" id="fn11">11</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>Moreover, in line with the outcome of its strategy review, the ECB&rsquo;s Governing Council was regularly assessing the links between monetary policy and financial stability as part of its policy deliberations.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.12" id="fn12">12</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>The experience across these two monetary policy eras confirmed the lessons of 2008. Stronger regulation and supervision were able to contain financial exuberance and limit vulnerabilities. They allowed monetary policy to focus on its job of delivering price stability.</p>
<p>In this regard, Klaas, you have a knack for good timing. When you left the Governing Council last July, inflation had fallen substantially from its historic peak and stood at our target of 2% that same month.</p>
<h2>A global financial system in transformation</h2>
<p>Does the progress we have made in strengthening the regulatory and supervisory framework mean that policymakers can now let their guard down? The answer, of course, is no.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s global financial system looks very different from the one that stood on the brink in 2008.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.13" id="fn13">13</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;Two key shifts<span>&nbsp;</span>stand out compared with then.</p>
<p>The first has been the massive structural transformation that has taken place, the most striking change of which has been the growing footprint of non-banks in financial intermediation.</p>
<p>In the euro area, non-banks &ndash; ranging from investment funds and insurance corporations to money market funds and securitisation vehicles &ndash; have grown from about 250% of GDP in 2008 to more than 350% today.</p>
<p>Non-banks are also highly interconnected with the banking sector.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.14" id="fn14">14</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;In the euro area, banks&rsquo; asset exposures to non-banks are sizeable, averaging around one-tenth of significant institutions&rsquo; total assets.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.15" id="fn15">15</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>At the same time, a second key shift is becoming increasingly evident &ndash; namely, signs of regulatory fatigue, which is creating an uneven playing field for financial institutions.</p>
<p>In particular, investment funds, despite their increasing systemic importance, operate under far lighter rules compared with the banking sector. That has in part helped to fuel their growth.</p>
<p>One of the reasons behind this regulatory fatigue is that the post-2008 global regulatory framework has arguably been a victim of its own success.</p>
<p>In policymaking, 17 years is a long time. Not only do painful memories fade, but so too does the recognition that the financial stability the world now enjoys is thanks to the robustness of that global regulatory framework established back then.</p>
<p>This fading sense of urgency, together with concerns that banks&rsquo; competitiveness vis-&agrave;-vis non-banks is threatened by the uneven playing field, has ignited calls to revisit the existing set of financial rules and regulations.</p>
<h2>The importance of levelling up regulation and supervision</h2>
<p>So how should policymakers react to these shifts in the financial system?</p>
<p>In short, it is vital that policymakers adapt regulation and supervision to this challenging environment. They should do so not by&nbsp;<em>lowering</em>&nbsp;standards for banks, but by&nbsp;<em>levelling them up</em>&nbsp;for non-banks that are involved in bank-like activities, or with significant links to the banking sector.</p>
<p>That helps to address banks&rsquo; concerns about the uneven playing field. And better supervision of non-banks would make potential financial stability risks that have lain dormant in darker corners of the economy more visible, allowing policymakers to pre-empt them.</p>
<p>Klaas, as FSB Chair, you have been a powerful voice in warning against the dangers of regulatory rollback.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.16" id="fn16">16</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;And under your leadership, the FSB advanced ambitious policy recommendations on strengthening rules for non-banks.</p>
<p>They covered money market fund resilience<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.17" id="fn17">17</a>]</sup></span>, liquidity mismatches in open-ended funds<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.18" id="fn18">18</a>]</sup></span>, margin preparedness<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.19" id="fn19">19</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;and, most recently, leverage in non-banks.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.20" id="fn20">20</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;This is not to mention the FSB&rsquo;s important work on other areas of financial stability risk.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.21" id="fn21">21</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>As a central banker, I cannot pretend to be an unbiased observer in these discussions. Because if the regulatory and supervisory spotlight were to be broadened to non-banks, monetary policy would benefit too.</p>
<p>If risks were to build outside the banking system, beyond the current reach of regulators and supervisors, the trade-offs that were evident before 2008 may re-emerge, with monetary policy&nbsp;<em>de facto</em>&nbsp;being the only tool to &ldquo;get in all of the cracks&rdquo; and rein in financial exuberance.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.22" id="fn22">22</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>That would be a suboptimal outcome, one that potentially constrains central banks&rsquo; full freedom to defend price stability.</p>
<p>So as referees on the playing field, it is vital that policymakers resist regulatory fatigue and redouble their efforts to extend stronger global rules to non-banks involved in bank-like activities, or with significant links to the banking sector.</p>
<p>At the same time, after a decade of adding regulation, this is a good moment to take stock and assess how regulation can be simplified to avoid duplication and unnecessary burdens on financial institutions.</p>
<p>In this respect, the ECB High-Level Task Force on Simplification is developing proposals for simplifying the European prudential regulatory, supervisory and reporting framework for the European Commission&rsquo;s consideration.</p>
<p>The goal is not to relax rules, nor undo what has been achieved. Instead, the task force is exploring how to reduce undue complexity in selected aspects of the capital structure, reporting and supervision, while also maintaining the resilience of banks and fostering greater integration and harmonisation in EU frameworks.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Let me conclude.</p>
<p>I have spoken this evening about one Dutch elder &ndash; you, Klaas. Hopefully I have done so in a relatively impactful manner. But I would like to finish by citing another Dutch elder.</p>
<p>In his&nbsp;<em>Adagia</em>, the humanist Erasmus gathered the wisdom of past centuries for the benefit of those living in the present. Among the proverbs that still resonate today is, &ldquo;Prevention is better than cure&rdquo;.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.23" id="fn23">23</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>In the Netherlands in particular &ndash; often said to have witnessed the world&rsquo;s first financial bubble, though historians debate its true scale<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.24" id="fn24">24</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;&ndash; that lesson endures: vigilance is wiser than complacency.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>This principle lies at the heart of sound regulation and supervision. As the financial system evolves, regulators and supervisors must retain visibility of potential risks, since preventing instability is always less costly than repairing the damage afterwards. It also helps to limit the potential trade-offs between monetary policy and financial stability.</p>
<p>Policymakers should not wait for another financial crisis to be reminded of how high the stakes are. It is imperative to extend oversight to non-banks involved in bank-like activities, or with significant links to the banking sector &ndash; and policymakers must do so sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>Speech</h2>
<p>It is a great pleasure to be here today to celebrate Klaas&rsquo;s time as President of De Nederlandsche Bank and Chair of the Financial Stability Board. But more than that, to recognise Klaas as a very good friend and colleague.</p>
<p>Klaas&rsquo;s time as Governor covered most of the period since the financial crisis. But his career goes further back, both at the DNB and the Ministry of Finance here in the Netherlands. He has seen it all, and has been at the heart of rebuilding financial stability. It is I think therefore appropriate to concentrate on the theme of financial stability.</p>
<p>I am going to focus on a number of key questions. What has been achieved in the time since the crisis? What appears to be the challenge today to these achievements? And where do we go from here? There have been times in recent years when we might have treated these questions as matters of more academic speculation, that&rsquo;s not so today. They are real questions up for debate and challenge. I know that Klaas will want to be part of answering them. And Klaas, you need no encouragement from us, please do get stuck in, with your trademark elegance and force, the hallmark of Dutch football that you are such a keen supporter of.</p>
<p>What has been achieved in the field of financial stability since the financial crisis? Answer &ndash; a lot. Yes, today&rsquo;s world is a highly uncertain and unpredictable place sadly. We have experienced very large shocks &ndash; a pandemic, the longest war in Europe since 1945, I could go on.</p>
<p>But we have come through, so far at least, without a crisis of financial stability of the sort that has been seen in the past. Likewise, we have not had a major and lasting recession during these recent shocks.</p>
<p>But, this all reminds us that bad things happen in the world, and they can affect financial stability, this is always possible. That said, we start with a financial system that is much more resilient, which is a much better place to be. We have a banking system that after a long-haul post-crisis appears to be sustainably earning its cost of capital in terms of returns. This is reflected in market pricing, with market price-to-book value more consistently above unity.</p>
<p>Another lens through which to look at this point is to examine arrears and loan losses across the recent period of economic shocks. The evidence points to resilience here &ndash; such losses have been low by historical standards. Of course, this benefits banks and their shareholders, but it also helps consumers as customers and economies generally. Customers get better outcomes and particularly when they avoid having their business closed, losing their job, or having their home repossessed. The benefits of financial stability are real and tangible. Yes, but they may not be perceived as such. One of the challenges of financial stability is that it is a state of being in which success comes when things don&rsquo;t happen, and don&rsquo;t go wrong. It is therefore susceptible to the problem of &ldquo;out of sight, out of mind&rdquo;, in other words under-appreciated.</p>
<p>But, I am conscious that this story alone leaves open the charge that we have achieved the so-called stability of the graveyard. Nothing moves, there are no big dramas, because the system is moribund. Not true, is my response. The financial system has evolved and continues to do so. The record of the last 15 years indicates that the financial system has played its part in supporting economies through a series of severe shocks, and has acted to absorb rather than amplify these shocks. I would emphasise here that financial stability is not an end in itself. Rather, the goal is to support economic activity, a point I will come back to later.</p>
<p>When we look at the developments of the last 15 years or so we should also recognise how the financial system has changed, and it certainly has. I am not going to give an extensive review of the changes, but rather pick out a small number of key points and seek to explain their broader significance.</p>
<p>The first major change that we have seen is a rebalancing of the overall scale of global financial intermediation with an increase in the non-bank sector relative to banks. The non-bank sector is not, of course, homogenous, a point I will come back to. I think it is worth drawing out a number of closely related points that underline this shift in balance between banks and non-banks. The first is one that, I think, was clear during the financial crisis, and provides a backdrop to the changes that were to come. It is that the financial crisis was severely exacerbated by the concentration of assets and exposures on the balance sheets of banks which were too volatile and hard to value in a stress, and thus created too much uncertainty around the stability and ultimately solvency of banks.</p>
<p>One of the eternal questions that gets posed during such a stress is whether for banks it is a solvency or liquidity event. The presumption is that the latter is ok in the sense of manageable while preserving going concern, while the former is not. But the problem is that we only know the answer to this question ex-post. Illiquidity is a symptom which tends to point towards doubt around future solvency, but does not answer the question conclusively, either ex-ante or contemporaneously. The question is better put as whether there is sufficient uncertainty around future solvency to cause stress through illiquidity. The answer to this question in many, if not all, problem cases during the crisis was yes. From that answer, it is a logical step to conclude &ndash; as we did &ndash; that the tools of liquidity assistance available to central banks &ndash; let&rsquo;s call them the traditional Bagehot tools &ndash; should be reinforced and supplemented by tools of resolution, and this rightly became an important part of the post-crisis agenda for national authorities and the FSB, an agenda that Klaas has played a major part in leading.</p>
<p>We have made huge progress on the resolution agenda. Alongside that, we have also made huge progress on the Basel agenda for reforming the prudential regulation of banks. At this point, I must make the - obvious I hope but it has to be made anyway &ndash; comment that we must finish off implementation. Linking this back to the re-balancing of the bank and non-bank financial sectors, these developments help to explain why the re-balance has been a sensible and logical development. It has been a foundation reducing the probability of crisis in the banking system.</p>
<p>But, some of the argument for this was apparent at the time of the crisis, and some was less apparent. I think what has become more obvious over the last 15 years is why this change matters for financial stability, and what it tells us about the future. For me at least, this is where the concept of the singleness of money, and trust in money, comes in, and how it underpins the regulation of banks. Put simply, why were some assets problematic for banks in the crisis, and why did it matter?</p>
<p>The distinctive feature of banks is that their liabilities are typically substantially in the form of money deposits. In the regulatory world, it is deposit taking that is unique to banks. Most of the stock of money in our systems is commercial bank deposits.</p>
<p>These deposits underpin the functions of money &ndash; its role as store of value, unit of account and means of exchange or payment. The critical property of money is trust in its nominal value.</p>
<p>Put simply, a Pound or euro in my account has the same value as a Pound or euro in another account, and thus when we make payments we do not have to worry about variable nominal value. This is a key foundation of financial stability, and thus of public trust. In the crisis it was the uncertainty about the future solvency of banks that undermined this trust and thus ended financial stability itself. The underlying issue here was increasing doubts on whether the liabilities of banks did satisfy the properties of the singleness of money. So, a key objective of the post crisis reforms has been to rebuild confidence in the singleness of, and trust in, money.</p>
<p>However, if I stopped the account here, it would fall into the trap of adapting an old-fashioned view of banks that they are only deposit-takers, and not involved in activities which get loosely called investment banking. In what I regard as one of the best books on financial crises, Gary Gorton described the 2008 crisis in the US as a run on repo, prime broker balances, and asset-backed commercial paper.<sup><sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/october/andrew-bailey-keynote-speech-at-klaas-knott-farewell-symposium#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[1]</a></sup></sup></p>
<p>At first sight, this appears critically to muddy the distinction between banks and non-banks. Can we be confident we know where the boundary lies? The lessons here are that the critical feature of banks is the singleness of money and the public&rsquo;s trust in the assured nominal value of their money. Moreover, since banks are ultimately single entities, their reputation and that trust depends on confidence in their balance sheets as a whole (which is not, of course, to ignore that their capital structures must involve loss-bearing in both going and gone concern states). In other words, we must be very focused on the money system in our economies and its stability.</p>
<p>That said, our economies rely on financial risk taking, and that is essential to support investment and growth. To achieve this, it&rsquo;s crucial in large parts of the non-bank system that there is not assured nominal value for the liabilities so that risky investment proceeds. It is critical that we maintain this distinction between banks and non-banks, and it is well understood by the public.</p>
<p>I will, however, add two important qualifications.</p>
<p>First, banks must of course take risks &ndash; that should not need to be said, but just in case. The point is that the risks must be managed to preserve the assured value of money. Most non-banks do not need to do this. But, second, some non-banks do write liability contracts which contain promises of future value of one sort or another. Insurance is a very good example of this.</p>
<p>My key point here is that over the last fifteen years post crisis, the distinction between banks and non-banks and the importance of the money system has become better understood and defined. It is not new at all, but it has been important to define it under today&rsquo;s conditions. Failure to do so was a major flaw that led to the financial crisis.</p>
<p>There has to be a &ldquo;however&rdquo; though, and this brings in the second of the three big changes in financial intermediation that we have seen since the financial crisis. The &ldquo;however&rdquo; is that it would be a mistake to think that the greater scale of non-bank finance, and the distinction between money and non-money liabilities has led to a comprehensive separation of these two parts of finance. The two are as inter-connected as ever, but in ways that have changed. And, this is absolutely key to understanding financial stability today and the risks to it.</p>
<p>Let me use a prominent example. There has been a major change in the nature of trading in most major government debt markets, resulting in a much expanded non-bank presence and often much more leverage attached to newer trading strategies. But the banking system remains the ultimate source of liquidity for these activities. Banks&rsquo; activities in prime brokerage have expanded substantially and rapidly. The financing is typically secured and margined to protect against risk. Often, this relies on another of the major post-crisis developments, namely the expansion of central clearing.</p>
<p>These developments are consistent with the post-crisis direction of policymaking, to strengthen infrastructures like clearing houses, put them at the heart of the system, and thereby manage and reduce the risk of serious systemic stress which threatens financial stability. There is a good case that these developments have to date worked. However, rather like the overall growth of non-bank finance, we should not be surprised that a stronger infrastructure has led to the growth, for instance, of more leveraged trading activities. Our job as authorities is to understand these developments and assess and if necessary tackle any vulnerabilities that they may give rise to. That&rsquo;s all work that Klaas has led in the FSB, and we are continuing.</p>
<p>I would describe developments such as the growth of leveraged trading as putting the post-crisis financial system to work. We may or may not like all of them, and they give rise to new risks, but we shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised that the system responds and evolves.</p>
<p>Another example of post-crisis developments in non-bank finance is private assets &ndash; private equity and private credit. These may fall into a somewhat different behavioural category, namely there may be aspects of public markets which encourage going private. Our job is to assess the consequences for financial stability purposes. It is not to presume that such developments are per se bad, but rather to ask questions and assess them with rigour and be transparent with our conclusions. In the lead up to the crisis, there was a different culture, more of an absence and at times disapproval of such scrutiny, and the consequences were regrettable.</p>
<p>A third big change in financial intermediation post-crisis that I would highlight is the growth of crypto assets. I&rsquo;m not convinced that the cause of this was a response to post-crisis regulation. It seems to me to be more an outcome of technological advances. But it falls into the category of new areas that require thorough assessment of possible vulnerabilities and their financial stability implications. I don&rsquo;t regard crypto as a homogenous world, and the distinction between investments and money helps with understanding the distinction. Crypto of the Bitcoin variety falls into the risky investment category, whereas stablecoins used for retail and wholesale payments, rather than just to support crypto trading, fall into the money category, or should do. Understanding the implications of this distinction is important for designing the approach to regulation. But, I will go further than that and say it should enable better stablecoins to emerge than would do in a world in which the distinction was not understood and followed up.</p>
<p>This point takes me to the last important theme I want to cover today, and again one that is closely associated with the leadership that Klaas has undertaken.</p>
<p>Today, we face a growing challenge to the post-crisis system of financial regulation. It comes with a number of descriptions and reasons. One is an old point made by Hyman Minksy, that as time passes memories of a financial crisis fade and this leads to a questioning of the continuing need for the responses. This creates the risk of history showing signs of repeating itself, remembering back for instance to the strength of the deregulation argument before the financial crisis. Those of us, like Klaas, who are veterans of dealing with the financial crisis, don&rsquo;t tend to forget, but I can see evidence in today&rsquo;s world of the truth of Minsky&rsquo;s observation.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think the Minsky theory is the end of the story. Another argument made is what gets described as the need for regulatory simplification. I think a reasonable interpretation of this argument is that it is perhaps natural that the response to an event as big as the financial crisis becomes over-complicated, and the passage of time exposes the need to stand back and take a hard look at whether some parts of the response are too complicated, or excessive. There is truth in this, and we should take up the challenge and respond &ndash; and we are doing so. But, again I don&rsquo;t think this is the full story on the reasons for the growing challenge to financial regulation.</p>
<p>A third argument I detect concerns the distributional effects of the regulatory changes, and comes in a few forms. The first is that the response to the financial crisis has changed the financial system and has thereby gone too far to create winners and losers. A second form of this argument is that the post-crisis regulatory system is inflexible and does not allow innovation. These are important arguments about competitiveness that we need to assess carefully. Brushing them off will not do. Again, where there is truth in the argument, we should respond.</p>
<p>The fourth argument I can see in may ways is the most fundamental namely that the regulatory system is impeding growth in economies. This is a very important challenge, for the simple reason that the potential growth rate of many developed economies has slowed markedly since the financial crisis, and particularly the growth of productivity. And since productivity is a main determinant of the growth of living standards, the evidence of a very flat growth in GDP per capita underlines the importance of this point.</p>
<p>So, we have four challenges to the state of financial regulation, all of which amount in different ways to saying that we have overdone it post-crisis. In my remaining time, I probably can&rsquo;t do each or any of them proper justice, but this debate is now so central to what we are doing that it has to be taken on and given due consideration. To remind him again, I hope Klaas will be part of this effort.</p>
<p>I will start with the Minsky passage of time point. First of all, I think Minsky was right, and current events are illustrating his point. As I mentioned earlier, success in financial stability is when nothing happens, and not much has happened relative to the scale and nature of the shocks we have had &ndash; Covid, Ukraine etc. It is convenient to think, nothing has happened, job done with regulation, I rest my case for the benefits. But meanwhile, the argument is growing that since nothing much has happened, we must be overdoing it on regulation.</p>
<p>The answer to all of this is that it rightly pushes us to ground the case for regulation and keep doing so, because &ldquo;out of sight, out of mind&rdquo; does not lead to good long-run outcomes. Moreover, since the world constantly changes, it is a mistake to freeze the regulatory system because it appears to have worked in the recent period of time. Here I think it is important to set out the specific outcomes we seek in the financial system when we say we are aiming for financial stability. What I have in mind here are outcomes as follows: First, we want a system where confidence in banking is maintained in the face of economic shocks and where resolution regimes enable the continuity of financial services if a bank fails. Second, we want to maintain the singleness of money, including where new types of non-bank that have grown up in the crypto world seek to issue money for real-world payments purposed. Third, we want robust market and payments infrastructure that operates without interruption and recovers quickly from rare disruptions. Fourth, we want financing from banks and non-banks to the real economy that is sustainable through the economic cycle and avoids excess supply of debt followed by debt overhang. These are big building block outcomes that we have to articulate, otherwise the debate on regulation is dangerously ungrounded</p>
<p>Let me turn to the second challenge, the point on simplification. Regulation probably does go in cycles, and we should recognise this and respond. Post-crisis it was straightforward to advance a cost-benefit case for increasing regulation, and this happened. By the way, in my experience governments were very much part of this process, it wasn&rsquo;t just central banks and regulators. But pro-cyclical regulation is not a good or stable state of the world, and we should recognise this. There is little doubt that in some areas we collect too much data. There is also a growing risk that because of this, as the pro-cyclical tide turns, we are inhibited from collecting necessary data in new areas of risk. So, we must, and I think are, responding positively to the simplification challenge. Another case of simplification is the adoption of a simpler capital regime for small deposit takers, in the UK the so-called &ldquo;Strong and Simple&rdquo; regime.</p>
<p>The third challenge is the competitiveness one. As I mentioned, this comes in several forms &ndash; you have skewed competitiveness by regulating, and you have prevented innovation by doing so. These are basically the same argument taking on different forms. Here, too, we must respond, and we have to ground the response in the core building block arguments. The danger here, to be frank, is that arguments that are interest based &ndash; and I don&rsquo;t say this in a critical way, it&rsquo;s a matter of fact &ndash; swamp the fundamental ideas based grounding of financial regulation. We have seen this before &ndash; its another form of the Minsky argument. It is the case that post-crisis regulation did intentionally change the competitive balance of banks and non-banks, for the reasons that we had ended up pre-crisis with an unstable and dangerous banking system which had lost the anchor of the singleness of money. That anchor could only be put back in place with massive state intervention at an unacceptable cost to taxpayers.</p>
<p>Today, I would argue that the financial system is not only more stable, but also generally earning returns which meet basic commercial objectives. It is up to firms then to increase their returns further, nothing is wrong with that. But there is a point in the third challenge. We must enable safe innovation and development of the financial system, otherwise competitiveness is an issue and it will undermine achieving the goal of financial stability. This enablement needs however to happen within a system that is grounded in the core ideas and principles. Yes, I&rsquo;m back to points like the singleness of money again.</p>
<p>The fourth challenge, the growth issue, is crucial. We face a huge challenge on this front. However, I push back at the line of argument that post-crisis financial regulation caused the fall in productivity growth, by restricting business investment in the economy. I think it is a rather different line of argument. Big shifts in productivity growth over history have been shaped by advances in so-called general purpose technology &ndash; things like the steam engine, electricity etc. We had such an advance before the financial crisis, through ICT and the internet. Over time, the contribution of these advances to economic growth does run out &ndash; that&rsquo;s as distinct from their contribution to the level of economic activity. I think this is more what we have seen post-crisis, but the timing is coincidentally awkward for separating out causes.</p>
<p>All of that said, we need a financial system that is ready and able to finance the next general purpose technology advance, which I would guess is AI. This is the important question today. In my view this must be a stable financial system, grounded in the core areas and principles of financial stability, but one that must be set up to support growth.</p>
<p>To finish, all of these four challenges have a point to them. We cannot behave as if the case for financial stability can ignore them. That said, if the baby is thrown out with the bath water so to speak, and financial stability is relegated in terms of its importance, we won&rsquo;t achieve our objectives. There is no trade-off between financial stability and objectives like growth and competitiveness.</p>
<p>But nor is our system perfect in every respect and fit for an ever-changing world. Our system must be constantly assessed and adapted as needed. But that process must be grounded in the core principles and ideas of financial stability. Klaas, you have been a leader in ensuring we do this, and I hope and believe you will go on being so.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I would like to thank Nathana&euml;l Benjamin, Sarah Breeden, Karen Jude and Sam Woods for their comments and help in the preparation of this speech.</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Fiserv Small Business Index remains at 148</i></li>
<li><i style="font-family: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">Y</i><i style="font-family: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">ear-over-year sales grew +2.3%</i></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.fiserv.com/" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Fiserv, Inc.</a>&nbsp;(NYSE: FI), a leading global provider of payments and financial services technology, has published the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fiserv.com/en/fiserv-small-business-index.html" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Fiserv Small Business Index</a>&nbsp;for September 2025, with the seasonally adjusted Index holding steady at 148 for a third consecutive month.</p>
<p>Year-over-year sales (+2.3%) and transactions (+2.3%) grew steadily, and average ticket sizes (+0.1%) increased modestly compared to 2024. Month-over-month sales (+0.1%) and transactions (+0.3%) saw small increases; average ticket sizes fell (-0.2%) slightly compared to August.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pragmatism continued to guide consumer spending in September, with discretionary purchases slowing and the essentials seeing the most growth,&rdquo; said Prasanna Dhore, Chief Data Officer, Fiserv. &ldquo;This continuation of budget-conscious purchasing resulted in slower growth in categories like Arts, Entertainment, Recreation, and Retail, while Professional Services, Healthcare and many other essential industries grew.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Key Takeaways</span></p>
<p><span>Retail grows year-over-year; remains sluggish month to month</span></p>
<p>Small business retail sales grew (+1.6%) year over year, led by Sporting Goods, Hobby, and Miscellaneous Retailers (+5.3%), Furniture and Appliance Retailers (+5.3%) and Clothing, Show and Jewelry Retailers (+5.1%). Yearly growth came despite a slowdown (-0.3%) month over month. Food and Beverage Retailers contributed most significantly to the near-term slowdown, contracting -1.5% month over month. Core Retail (which excludes the volatile categories of Gasoline Stations, Motor Vehicle and Parts Dealers, and Building Materials) faced even stronger headwinds (-0.6%) month-over-month.</p>
<p><span>Consumers continue to be pragmatic with purchases</span></p>
<p>Discretionary spending rose (+1.5%) year-over-year, but Essential sales grew at nearly double the pace (+2.9%). The overall slowdown in momentum across small business sales is evident here as well, with discretionary purchases dropping (-0.1%) month-over-month and essential spending rising modestly (+0.3%).</p>
<p><span>Bars and pubs outperformed full-service and quick-service restaurants in September</span></p>
<p>Restaurant sales grew +1.2% year-over-year and +0.3% month-over-month. The strongest momentum in restaurants was observed at Bars and pubs, which saw an increase in sales (+1.6%) and foot traffic (+1.1%) compared to August. Full-service restaurants experienced much smaller sales growth (+0.3%) month-over-month and a slight increase in foot traffic (+0.2%). Quick-service restaurants saw increased foot traffic (+0.4%) and sales (+0.1%) growth.</p>
<p><span>Services outpaced Goods</span></p>
<p>Year-over-year Services sales showed strong growth (+2.3%) and outpaced the growth of Goods (+1.7%). Compared to August, Services sales grew slightly (+0.2%). Top performing service-based businesses compared to 2024 were Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services (+7.2%), Information (+6.7%) and Healthcare (+3.3%).</p>
<p><span>Ahead of the holiday season, hobby and game stores show positive growth</span></p>
<p>Despite decreased foot traffic (-3.2%) month over month, small business Hobby, Toy, and Game Retailers experienced a healthy sales increase (+2.2%).</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><b>Overview</b></p>
<p>In Q3 2025, LME average daily volume (ADV) was up 3.0% on Q3 2024. Q3 2025 was the LME&rsquo;s sixth highest quarter by ADV in the past 10 years and follows the 10-year high&nbsp;for the market in Q2 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>LME Nickel</b>&nbsp;volume has consolidated its progress, up 30.9% over Q3 2024.&nbsp;<b>LME Lead&nbsp;</b>was up 5.2% on Q3 2024 and&nbsp;<b>LME Tin</b>&nbsp;was up 4.4% over the same period.&nbsp;<b>LME Cobalt</b>&nbsp;has grown significantly for each of the last four quarters and ADV was up from 9 lots in Q3 2024 to 125 lots in Q3 2025 with its highest ever monthly ADV in August.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q3 2025 has also seen the highest level of futures market open interest (MOI) since March 2021.</p>
<p>Matthew Chamberlain, LME CEO, said:</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;While markets have drawn breath following an exceptional second quarter we have continued to see strong volumes at the LME. It has been particularly pleasing to follow the growth of our cobalt contract.</i></p>
<p><i>&ldquo;This quarter has marked the first concrete steps in our work to enhance liquidity on our market with the introduction of TAS contracts. There is more to come in the final three months of the year including the calibration of tick sizes as we prepare for the introduction of block thresholds in Q1 2026. It is an exciting period for the LME and I am grateful to members and clients for their continuing support and readiness to work with us on enhancements that will ultimately deliver even stronger, more liquid markets.&rdquo;</i></p>

<p><span>Cityvarasto is a Finnish self-storage, van rental and moving service company established in 1999.

We are very growth-oriented, and the share issue and listing on First North will greatly promote our goals of growing both organically and through acquisitions. I would like to thank the investors who participated in our IPO.

<title>Vienna Stock Exchange Q3: Equity Turnover Up, ATX Maintains Strong Momentum</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Geopolitical and trade policy turmoil has caused considerable volatility on international stock markets. On the Vienna Stock Exchange, this resulted in a trading volume of EUR 52.95 billion, with the Austrian leading index ATX hovering near its all-time high. At the beginning of July,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wienerborse.at/en/news/vienna-stock-exchange-news/reploid-group-new-in-direct-market-plus/" target="_blank" title="Opens new window">REPLOID Group AG</a>&nbsp;became the second company after&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wienerborse.at/en/news/vienna-stock-exchange-news/steyr-motors-trading-start/" target="_blank" title="Opens new window">Steyr Motors AG</a>&nbsp;to be listed in the SME segment direct market plus in 2025. The growth trend in debt listings has led to another record year: after just three quarters, 21,719 new bonds were listed &ndash; around 62% more than in the entire previous record year.</p>
<p><a class="has-image" href="https://www.wienerborse.at/uploads/u/cms/images/fotos/presse/infografiken/vienna-stock-exchange-q32025.jpg" target="_blank" title="Opens new window"><img alt="Trading on the Vienna Stock Exchange Q32025" height="326" src="https://www.wienerborse.at/uploads/u/cms/_processed_/4/1/csm_vienna-stock-exchange-q32025_fbda563a46.jpg" title="Trading on the Vienna Stock Exchange Q32025" width="520" /></a></p>
<p>"Austrian stocks remained in demand as part of the brisk market activity. With continued growth in the global market and ETF sector, as well as business development in the debt listing space, we are consistently expanding our offering beyond our core business in Austrian equity trading. In doing so, we are creating added value for investors and issuers alike," says Christoph Boschan, CEO of Wiener B&ouml;rse AG.</p>
<h2>Volatile market conditions lead to high equity turnover</h2>
<p>After an exceptionally strong spring in terms of turnover, which was particularly influenced by US tariff policy, the summer months were somewhat quieter. Still, August was the second-strongest month in the past decade &ndash; surpassed only by August of the previous year. September turnover was also on a par with peak years such as 2021 or 2022. Geopolitical news therefore continues to cause noticeable movement on the markets. Turnover from equity investments amounted to EUR 52.95 billion at the end of the third quarter (+3.8% vs Q1-Q3 2024: EUR 51.01 billion).</p>
<h2>ATX including dividends at new all-time high and with new composition</h2>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wienerborse.at/en/index/atx-tr-AT0000A09FJ6/" target="_blank" title="Opens new window">ATX Total Return</a>, like the German DAX, a performance index including dividends, tops international rankings with its year-to-date gains. On 19 August, the national index reached its all-time high of 11,825.97 points. By 30 September, the Austrian benchmark, including dividends, had risen by 32.45% (ATX without dividends: 26.56%), putting it ahead of the DAX (19.95%), MSCI World (16.15%) and Euro Stoxx 50 (12.95%). Since 22 September, the ATX has also been calculated with a new composition: as part of the semi-annual review, STRABAG SE and PORR AG were newly included, replacing Telekom Austria AG and Mayr-Melnhof Karton AG. As of 30 September, the market capitalisation of all domestic companies listed in Vienna amounted to EUR 160 billion.</p>
<p>"Austrian stocks are in high demand this year, and this trend is far from short-term. Since the start of calculation, the ATX Total Return has delivered an annualised average performance of around 7%, earning its place in the global league. Attractive dividend yields, a strong position in the growth region of Central and Eastern Europe and moderate valuations make Austrian equities a key component of globally balanced portfolios," says Boschan.</p>
<h2>ETF offering more than doubled since the beginning of the year</h2>
<p>Turnover in the international segments of global market and exchange traded funds also developed very positively this year. Both the number of international equities tradable in Vienna at domestic fees and the number of index funds have been expanded several times over the course of the year. Most recently, 50 new ETFs were added to trading on the Vienna Stock Exchange, more than doubling the offering since the start of the year from 137 to 336 funds. The global market grew by around 60 securities this year, with the latest addition being the Swedish payment service provider Klarna. Shares in the medical technology company Ottobock are also set to be offered on the Vienna Stock Exchange, alongside the planned IPO on Deutsche B&ouml;rse. The international segment currently comprises around 900 securities from 28 countries.</p>
<h2>Another record year for debt listings</h2>
<p>The Vienna Stock Exchange has continued its strong growth in debt listings. By the end of the third quarter, 21,719 primary listings were admitted to trading, clearly surpassing the previous record year of 2024 (13,443) several months before the end of 2025. This is the result of the Vienna Stock Exchange's growing global reach, as underscored by listings from China's Alibaba Group and the first Mexican issue by Cobre del Mayo. A total of 1,297 debt issuers from 48 countries are currently served.</p>

<title>1 In 8 Canadians Are Hybrid Investors – And Most Plan To Stay That Way</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>To mark Investor Education Month, the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) is publishing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/csa-activities/research/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hybrid DIY Investing: A Research Summary Report</a>. The Report offers a comprehensive examination of hybrid investors in Canada, revealing behaviours, motivations and risk profiles of this investor segment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hybrid investors are those who invest on their own but also have a separate portfolio managed by a financial advisor. Overall, the CSA&rsquo;s research indicates that hybrid investors are younger on average and tend to have a higher risk tolerance than other Canadian investors. However, those with limited engagement with their financial advisor, especially younger investors aged 18 to 34, are more prone to speculative behaviour and are less aware of fraud risks, particularly when relying on self-made or absent financial plans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This study provides a compelling portrait of hybrid investors and underscores the importance of having meaningful discussions with your financial advisor,&rdquo; said Stan Magidson, CSA Chair and Chair and CEO of the Alberta Securities Commission. &ldquo;Regardless of the investing method chosen, it&rsquo;s clear that a comprehensive financial plan that encompasses all of your investment accounts can empower investors to make informed investment decisions aligned to their risk tolerance and goals, while avoiding potentially unsuitable or fraudulent investment opportunities.&rdquo;</p>
<div><strong>Key findings:</strong></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prevalence and demographics:</strong>&nbsp;Approximately one in eight Canadians (12 per cent) are hybrid investors. This group is disproportionately younger, identifies as male, compared to the general investor population, and is more likely to hold a university degree.</li>
<li><strong>Sustained hybrid engagement:&nbsp;</strong>A significant majority (68 per cent) of hybrid investors intend to maintain their dual approach to investing. Among these, 93 per cent express high certainty in their decision, a sentiment echoed in qualitative focus group discussions.</li>
<li><strong>Perceived risk tolerance:&nbsp;</strong>Hybrid investors indicate that they are willing to take on moderate or significant levels of risk with their investments (84 per cent) compared to Canadian investors overall (46 per cent) in a recent 2024 CIRO investor survey.</li>
<li><strong>Speculative investing behaviour:&nbsp;</strong>Those who worked on a financial plan with their advisor tended to engage in less speculative investment behaviour in their DIY account. This included investing in high-risk alternative investments like crypto assets and options, buying and selling investments frequently, and taking on significant risk for the chance of a very large return.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Advisor relationships:&nbsp;</strong>The research found contradictory data with regard to advisor relationships. Survey data suggested that hybrid investors maintain close relationships with their advisors, with many reporting that their advisors are aware of their separate self-directed activities. However, focus group findings indicated a more nuanced reality, with most participants sharing that they had a more transactional and distant relationship with their advisors.</li>
<li><strong>Fraud awareness and prevention:&nbsp;</strong>In focus group discussions, hybrid investors with higher risk tolerance had limited awareness of investment fraud. Those who did articulate a fraud prevention strategy relied on informal or untrustworthy sources and methods, such as online searches and community forums, rather than structured professional advice and institutional safeguards provided by registered advisors.&nbsp;</li>

<title>ISDA derivatiViews: A Path To Greater CFTC-SEC Alignment</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-derivativiews-a-path-to-greater-cftc-sec-alignment-2025102/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-derivativiews-a-path-to-greater-cftc-sec-alignment-2025102/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Earlier this week, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) held a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/meetings-events/sec-cftc-joint-roundtable-sept-29-2025">roundtable on regulatory harmonization</a>&nbsp;&ndash; an initiative we wholeheartedly support. The US regulatory framework has evolved over time to facilitate financial markets that are both vibrant and resilient, but we shouldn&rsquo;t shy away from acknowledging where and how the US regulatory process could be improved.</p>
<p>Both the CFTC and SEC have adapted their respective rulesets over time to reflect critical changes in markets, from the introduction of mandatory central clearing for derivatives to the advent of high-frequency trading. But a cautious approach has slowed market and product evolution. At a time when markets are evolving at a ferocious pace because of technological change, we need to make sure the regulatory process is streamlined and coordinated to avoid gumming up the wheels of finance that are so critical to economic growth. As the roundtable discussion showed, market participants are both capable and willing to work with regulators to support the appropriate evolution of the market by developing trading, risk management and operational solutions required for the future.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to remember that regulators and market participants have a successful history of cooperation on reforms that have delivered safer and more efficient markets &ndash; and ISDA has played an important part in developing legal, operational and risk management solutions to support that on a global scale. This includes delivery of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2016/05/05/isda-launches-resolutionstayjurisdictionalmodularprotocol/">ISDA resolution stay protocols</a>&nbsp;as part of global regulatory bank resolution efforts, implementation of the margining rules for non-cleared derivatives and launch of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/isda-solutions-infohub/isda-simm/">ISDA Standard Initial Margin Model</a>, and development of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/protocol/isda-2021-fallbacks-protocol/">ISDA fallbacks</a>&nbsp;to aid the transition from LIBOR.</p>
<p>There are parts of the current US regulatory framework where similar alignment and coordination are sorely needed. The CFTC and SEC rulebooks can be complex, overlap in certain key areas and are overly reliant on no-action relief. They also contain inconsistencies that mean the regulatory treatment of products and activities with similar risk profiles can differ, depending on whether they fall under the jurisdiction of the CFTC or the SEC.</p>
<p>We would highlight three key areas where greater coordination between the CFTC and SEC is critical and market participants can help to deliver solutions that would increase compliance, cut costs and create a robust collateral infrastructure.</p>
<p>The first is regulatory reporting. It&rsquo;s been more than four years since Archegos Capital Management went bust, leaving its counterparty banks with more than $10 billion in losses. US regulators were largely unaware of the exposures Archegos had been accumulating. While the CFTC introduced its reporting rules in 2012, the SEC regime only came into force a decade later, meaning Archegos did not have an obligation to report its security-based swaps ahead of its collapse.</p>
<p>Both regimes are now in place, which should help avoid gaps in the data going forward. This was helped by cooperation between the two agencies, with the SEC allowing firms to use CFTC reporting processes. But this remains a temporary solution. We urge the SEC to work with the CFTC and the industry to codify this relief into the SEC&rsquo;s permanent ruleset &ndash; a development that would eliminate significant unnecessary complexity and inefficiency for market participants. ISDA plans to add the SEC rules to its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/isda-solutions-infohub/isda-digital-regulatory-reporting/">Digital Regulatory Reporting initiative</a>, which already supports compliance in eight jurisdictions, enabling firms to implement changes to regulatory reporting requirements cost-effectively and accurately.</p>
<p>The agencies should also jointly invest in data curation and analytics capabilities. As a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2023/10/10/hidden-in-plain-sight-derivatives-exposures-regulatory-transparency-and-trade-repositories/">2023 ISDA paper points out</a>, a significant amount of data is available to regulators, but ensuring key information does not remain hidden in plain sight is challenging.</p>
<p>The second issue is Treasury clearing. Ahead of the clearing mandate coming into force from end-2026, clients must be able to realize the benefits of portfolio margining across cleared US Treasury securities and futures. The Fixed Income Clearing Corporation and CME Group are set to propose a client portfolio margining solution, and it&rsquo;s critical the CFTC and SEC act to quickly approve it once they do. This is a no-brainer and essential to make the economics of client clearing work.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t just a CFTC and SEC issue &ndash; US prudential regulators also need to adapt their rules to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2025/09/15/recognition-of-cross-product-netting-is-critical/">recognize the risk-reducing benefits of netting across products</a>, including cleared repos and futures, under the standardized approach to counterparty credit risk.</p>
<p>The third issue is market liquidity and collateral infrastructure. According to the latest&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2025/05/14/isda-margin-survey-year-end-2024/">ISDA margin survey</a>, initial margin and variation margin collected by leading derivatives market participants for their non-cleared derivatives exposures increased by 6.4% to $1.5 trillion at the end of 2024. While margin requirements have helped to provide protection against counterparty credit risk, we must recognize that the financial system has become more prone to liquidity crunches during periods of stress.</p>
<p>At a time when some markets are moving to 24/7 trading, we need 24/7 risk management.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2025/09/30/working-towards-tokenized-collateral/">Tokenization could alleviate some of the liquidity and workflow challenges</a>&nbsp;by expanding the types of usable collateral to a wider range of assets, including money market funds and other tokenized cash and securities. The industry is primed to transform the collateral ecosystem to make it more automated and efficient by leveraging blockchain and tokenized solutions. It&rsquo;s time the CFTC, SEC and market participants work together to upgrade this critical infrastructure underpinning our financial system.</p>
<p>We hope this week&rsquo;s CFTC-SEC roundtable is just the start of greater coordination between the agencies and market participants to swiftly address the old regulations that aren&rsquo;t fit for purpose and address the evolution of products, participants and infrastructures. Working together and tackling these issues will reduce unnecessary regulatory burdens, open a path to greater innovation and improve the competition and efficiency of US financial markets.</p>

<title>Basel Committee Approves Annual G-SIB Assessment, Enhances The Clarity Of Its Grading System For Jurisdictional Assessments And Takes Note Of The Implementation Of Margin Requirements For Non-Centrally Cleared Derivatives</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/basel-committee-approves-annual-g-sib-assessment-enhances-the-clarity-of-its-gr-2025103/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li>Basel Committee approves annual assessment exercise for global systemically important banks.</li>
<li>Enhances clarity of its grading system for jurisdictional assessments.</li>
<li>Discusses implementation status of margin requirements for non-centrally cleared derivatives.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision met virtually on 2 October 2025 to discuss a range of initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>Global systemically important banks</strong></p>
<p>The Committee approved the results of the end-2024 assessment exercise for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). The results will be submitted to the Financial Stability Board before it publishes the 2025 list of G-SIBs.</p>
<p><strong>Implementation</strong></p>
<p>The Committee discussed the grading used for its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/implementation/rcap_jurisdictional.htm"><span class="firstword">jurisdictional</span>&nbsp;assessments</a>, which are a key element of its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/implementation/rcap_role.htm"><span class="firstword">Regulatory</span>&nbsp;Consistency Assessment Programme</a>&nbsp;(RCAP). Jurisdictional assessments review the extent to which domestic regulations in each member jurisdiction are aligned with the minimum regulatory standards agreed by the Committee.</p>
<p>The jurisdictional assessment reports have used four terms to grade the overall level of compliance with the assessed standards (in descending order): compliant, largely compliant, materially non-compliant, and non-compliant. To enhance the clarity of the rank ordering of the jurisdictional assessment grades, the Committee agreed to change the name of the third grade from "materially non-compliant" to "partially non-compliant".</p>
<p>Separately, the Committee approved a finalised technical amendment on the hedging of counterparty credit risk exposures, following a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d584.htm"><span class="firstword">consultation</span>&nbsp;</a>last year. The technical amendment will be published later this month.</p>
<p><strong>Margining</strong></p>
<p>The Committee discussed a report on the implementation of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d499.pdf"><span class="firstword">margin</span>&nbsp;requirements</a>&nbsp;for non-centrally cleared derivatives, developed jointly with the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO). The report finds that implementation of the framework has made the financial system more resilient and that there is no evidence of material issues with the implementation of the framework.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>Background:&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>The Basel Committee is the primary global standard setter for the prudential regulation of banks and provides a forum for cooperation on banking supervisory matters. Its mandate is to strengthen the regulation, supervision and practices of banks worldwide with the purpose of enhancing financial stability. The Committee reports to the Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision and seeks its endorsement for major decisions. The Committee has no formal supranational authority, and its decisions have no legal force. Rather, the Committee relies on its members' commitments to achieve its mandate. The Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision is chaired by Tiff Macklem, Governor of the Bank of Canada. The Basel Committee is chaired by Erik Thed&eacute;en, Governor of Sveriges Riksbank.&nbsp;</em></p>

<title>Euronext Reaffirms Its Support For European Strategic Autonomy By Signing Partnerships With National Military Reserves</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Euronext reaffirms its support for European strategic autonomy by signing partnerships with national military reserves</span></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<h5>On 1 October 2025, Euronext signed a partnership with the French military reserve, the Garde nationale</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>On 19 September 2025, Euronext signed a partnership with the Danish military reserve, InterForce Danmark</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>More partnerships will be signed in the coming months with local military reserves in Europe</h5>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Euronext, the leading European capital market infrastructure, reaffirms its commitment to European resilience and strategic autonomy with the signature of new partnerships with national military reserves in Denmark and France. Additional agreements with local military reserves will be signed in the coming months.</p>
<p>These partnerships extend the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=kqTRr9CVRRlF10OaCxFHPAUpm9DuFXgzE2T4Vm7VHIshyUXgW-krO8E_YZq685XwNMMFklnvPpmzfPi09628Ugv6chdwXNM_iIkEv_MXED42cEeqZcX60pliCVzDKWXKUjNGu3LuFgBzAAsPzjb66rvr84ift9-sBeGaMH_EioNPpavgq3FJFKvUD0up9M83sohAplFpC3xiimBshzZOsec10Vm3UnjPAbwmvWH6oovtpKCeaNnz5HQQXvbHmirkByFxzXM-L_zuTtWRVKqm1QAQh2lxP5aTCP29TdTZvUY=" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="initiatives related to Energy, Security and Geostrategy, the &ldquo;New ESG&rdquo;">initiatives related to Energy, Security and Geostrategy, the &ldquo;New ESG&rdquo;</a>, launched by Euronext on 6 May 2025 to strengthen European strategic autonomy. This set of initiatives led by Euronext enhances the visibility of European companies operating in strategic sectors and provides them with unprecedented tools to meet their financing needs through improved access to capital. These solutions also address the growing demand from asset managers, institutional and retail investors to obtain better exposure to high-growth segments through thematic indices.</p>
<p>As European strategic autonomy and independence rely on the ability of European citizens to take part in their country&rsquo;s own defence ecosystem, Euronext has created a support framework for its employees who are already engaged in a reservist commitment, or who wish to take up this opportunity. As of 6 May 2025, Euronext guarantees the continuation of salary and social benefits for preliminary training periods of up to 15 days for all new reservists, and up to 10 days per year for all Euronext employees engaged in a reservist commitment across all the group&rsquo;s European locations. In countries where a more beneficial local reservist support system exists, the existing framework prevails.</p>
<p>To formalise this engagement, Euronext is signing partnerships with national military reserves.</p>
<p>In Paris, Euronext signed a partnership with the French military reserve, the Garde nationale, on 1 October 2025. General Fran&ccedil;ois-Xavier Poisbeau, General Secretary of the French National Guard (Garde nationale), presented the main aspects of the partnership, while Baptiste Mercier, Head of Operational Performance at Allianz France, and Coralie Lecouffe, Senior Consultant at Capgemini Invent, shared personal experiences from their engagement as operational reservists.</p>
<p>In Copenhagen, Euronext signed a partnership with the Danish military reserve, InterForce Danmark, on 19 September 2025. Local employees had the opportunity to meet with members of the reservist forces, who shared insights about their experience and highlighted how military reservists support Denmark&rsquo;s resilience in the long term.</p>
<p>More partnerships will be signed in the coming months with local military reserve forces from European countries.</p>
<p><span>St&eacute;phane Boujnah, CEO and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext, said:</span>&nbsp;<em>"Through these partnerships, Euronext reinforces its commitment to strengthen European resilience and strategic autonomy, at a time of rising geopolitical tensions. I am deeply proud of this citizen engagement that enables our colleagues to put their skills and abilities to the service of their countries. I want to thank InterForce Danmark and the Garde nationale in France for their support, and the valuable insights they shared. Within the coming weeks and months, Euronext will sign similar partnership agreements with military reserve forces in European countries where we operate. These initiatives demonstrate the power of cross-border collaboration and highlight Euronext&rsquo;s role as a unifying force in Europe&rsquo;s capital markets, fostering both national and continental strength.&rdquo;</em></p>
