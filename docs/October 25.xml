<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p><b>Overview</b></p>
<p>In Q3 2025, LME average daily volume (ADV) was up 3.0% on Q3 2024. Q3 2025 was the LME&rsquo;s sixth highest quarter by ADV in the past 10 years and follows the 10-year high&nbsp;for the market in Q2 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>LME Nickel</b>&nbsp;volume has consolidated its progress, up 30.9% over Q3 2024.&nbsp;<b>LME Lead&nbsp;</b>was up 5.2% on Q3 2024 and&nbsp;<b>LME Tin</b>&nbsp;was up 4.4% over the same period.&nbsp;<b>LME Cobalt</b>&nbsp;has grown significantly for each of the last four quarters and ADV was up from 9 lots in Q3 2024 to 125 lots in Q3 2025 with its highest ever monthly ADV in August.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q3 2025 has also seen the highest level of futures market open interest (MOI) since March 2021.</p>
<p>Matthew Chamberlain, LME CEO, said:</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;While markets have drawn breath following an exceptional second quarter we have continued to see strong volumes at the LME. It has been particularly pleasing to follow the growth of our cobalt contract.</i></p>
<p><i>&ldquo;This quarter has marked the first concrete steps in our work to enhance liquidity on our market with the introduction of TAS contracts. There is more to come in the final three months of the year including the calibration of tick sizes as we prepare for the introduction of block thresholds in Q1 2026. It is an exciting period for the LME and I am grateful to members and clients for their continuing support and readiness to work with us on enhancements that will ultimately deliver even stronger, more liquid markets.&rdquo;</i></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p><span>Nasdaq (Nasdaq: NDAQ) announces that trading in Cityvarasto Oyj shares (ticker: CITYVA) will commence today on Nasdaq First North Growth Market Finland. The company belongs to Consumer Discretionary sector. Cityvarasto is the 30<span><sup>th</sup></span>&nbsp;company to list on Nasdaq&rsquo;s Nordic markets<sup>*</sup>&nbsp;in 2025, and it represents the seventh listing on Nasdaq Helsinki this year.</span></p>
<p><span>Cityvarasto is a Finnish self-storage, van rental and moving service company established in 1999. In addition to the parent company Cityvarasto Oyj, the Cityvarasto group consists of PakuOvelle.com Oy, which specialises in van rental, and the moving service company Suomen Opiskelijamuutot Oy as the most significant subsidiaries. For more&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://cityvarasto.fi/en/about-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>information</span></a></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;Self-storage is an interesting combination of consumer and real estate business. We are supported by strong trends. Urbanisation is progressing, and apartments and storage spaces are getting smaller while the amount of goods is increasing. Demand is also driven by very common and significant life events and changes that are independent of economic cycles. We want to offer space to live. We are very growth-oriented, and the share issue and listing on First North will greatly promote our goals of growing both organically and through acquisitions. I would like to thank the investors who participated in our IPO. I am especially pleased that so many of our personnel became also owners of Cityvarasto and that so many foreign institutional investors were interested in the IPO and share issue. I also believe that many of our new owners will also become our customers&rdquo;, Ville Stenroos, CEO of Cityvarasto comments.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;We are pleased to welcome Cityvarasto to Nasdaq First North Growth Market following a successful IPO," said Henrik Husman, President of Nasdaq Helsinki. "The company has grown rapidly and shown a strong ability to combine self-storage, van rental, and moving services in an innovative way. This reflects the kind of forward-thinking entrepreneurship we are proud to support at Nasdaq. We look forward to following Cityvarasto&rsquo;s journey as a listed company.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>Cityvarasto has appointed Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB Helsinki branch as its Certified Adviser.</span></p>

<title>Vienna Stock Exchange Q3: Equity Turnover Up, ATX Maintains Strong Momentum</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Geopolitical and trade policy turmoil has caused considerable volatility on international stock markets. On the Vienna Stock Exchange, this resulted in a trading volume of EUR 52.95 billion, with the Austrian leading index ATX hovering near its all-time high. At the beginning of July,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wienerborse.at/en/news/vienna-stock-exchange-news/reploid-group-new-in-direct-market-plus/" target="_blank" title="Opens new window">REPLOID Group AG</a>&nbsp;became the second company after&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wienerborse.at/en/news/vienna-stock-exchange-news/steyr-motors-trading-start/" target="_blank" title="Opens new window">Steyr Motors AG</a>&nbsp;to be listed in the SME segment direct market plus in 2025. The growth trend in debt listings has led to another record year: after just three quarters, 21,719 new bonds were listed &ndash; around 62% more than in the entire previous record year.</p>
<p><a class="has-image" href="https://www.wienerborse.at/uploads/u/cms/images/fotos/presse/infografiken/vienna-stock-exchange-q32025.jpg" target="_blank" title="Opens new window"><img alt="Trading on the Vienna Stock Exchange Q32025" height="326" src="https://www.wienerborse.at/uploads/u/cms/_processed_/4/1/csm_vienna-stock-exchange-q32025_fbda563a46.jpg" title="Trading on the Vienna Stock Exchange Q32025" width="520" /></a></p>
<p>"Austrian stocks remained in demand as part of the brisk market activity. With continued growth in the global market and ETF sector, as well as business development in the debt listing space, we are consistently expanding our offering beyond our core business in Austrian equity trading. In doing so, we are creating added value for investors and issuers alike," says Christoph Boschan, CEO of Wiener B&ouml;rse AG.</p>
<h2>Volatile market conditions lead to high equity turnover</h2>
<p>After an exceptionally strong spring in terms of turnover, which was particularly influenced by US tariff policy, the summer months were somewhat quieter. Still, August was the second-strongest month in the past decade &ndash; surpassed only by August of the previous year. September turnover was also on a par with peak years such as 2021 or 2022. Geopolitical news therefore continues to cause noticeable movement on the markets. Turnover from equity investments amounted to EUR 52.95 billion at the end of the third quarter (+3.8% vs Q1-Q3 2024: EUR 51.01 billion).</p>
<h2>ATX including dividends at new all-time high and with new composition</h2>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wienerborse.at/en/index/atx-tr-AT0000A09FJ6/" target="_blank" title="Opens new window">ATX Total Return</a>, like the German DAX, a performance index including dividends, tops international rankings with its year-to-date gains. On 19 August, the national index reached its all-time high of 11,825.97 points. By 30 September, the Austrian benchmark, including dividends, had risen by 32.45% (ATX without dividends: 26.56%), putting it ahead of the DAX (19.95%), MSCI World (16.15%) and Euro Stoxx 50 (12.95%). Since 22 September, the ATX has also been calculated with a new composition: as part of the semi-annual review, STRABAG SE and PORR AG were newly included, replacing Telekom Austria AG and Mayr-Melnhof Karton AG. As of 30 September, the market capitalisation of all domestic companies listed in Vienna amounted to EUR 160 billion.</p>
<p>"Austrian stocks are in high demand this year, and this trend is far from short-term. Since the start of calculation, the ATX Total Return has delivered an annualised average performance of around 7%, earning its place in the global league. Attractive dividend yields, a strong position in the growth region of Central and Eastern Europe and moderate valuations make Austrian equities a key component of globally balanced portfolios," says Boschan.</p>
<h2>ETF offering more than doubled since the beginning of the year</h2>
<p>Turnover in the international segments of global market and exchange traded funds also developed very positively this year. Both the number of international equities tradable in Vienna at domestic fees and the number of index funds have been expanded several times over the course of the year. Most recently, 50 new ETFs were added to trading on the Vienna Stock Exchange, more than doubling the offering since the start of the year from 137 to 336 funds. The global market grew by around 60 securities this year, with the latest addition being the Swedish payment service provider Klarna. Shares in the medical technology company Ottobock are also set to be offered on the Vienna Stock Exchange, alongside the planned IPO on Deutsche B&ouml;rse. The international segment currently comprises around 900 securities from 28 countries.</p>
<h2>Another record year for debt listings</h2>
<p>The Vienna Stock Exchange has continued its strong growth in debt listings. By the end of the third quarter, 21,719 primary listings were admitted to trading, clearly surpassing the previous record year of 2024 (13,443) several months before the end of 2025. This is the result of the Vienna Stock Exchange's growing global reach, as underscored by listings from China's Alibaba Group and the first Mexican issue by Cobre del Mayo. A total of 1,297 debt issuers from 48 countries are currently served.</p>

<title>1 In 8 Canadians Are Hybrid Investors – And Most Plan To Stay That Way</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>To mark Investor Education Month, the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) is publishing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/csa-activities/research/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hybrid DIY Investing: A Research Summary Report</a>. The Report offers a comprehensive examination of hybrid investors in Canada, revealing behaviours, motivations and risk profiles of this investor segment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hybrid investors are those who invest on their own but also have a separate portfolio managed by a financial advisor. Overall, the CSA&rsquo;s research indicates that hybrid investors are younger on average and tend to have a higher risk tolerance than other Canadian investors. However, those with limited engagement with their financial advisor, especially younger investors aged 18 to 34, are more prone to speculative behaviour and are less aware of fraud risks, particularly when relying on self-made or absent financial plans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This study provides a compelling portrait of hybrid investors and underscores the importance of having meaningful discussions with your financial advisor,&rdquo; said Stan Magidson, CSA Chair and Chair and CEO of the Alberta Securities Commission. &ldquo;Regardless of the investing method chosen, it&rsquo;s clear that a comprehensive financial plan that encompasses all of your investment accounts can empower investors to make informed investment decisions aligned to their risk tolerance and goals, while avoiding potentially unsuitable or fraudulent investment opportunities.&rdquo;</p>
<div><strong>Key findings:</strong></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prevalence and demographics:</strong>&nbsp;Approximately one in eight Canadians (12 per cent) are hybrid investors. This group is disproportionately younger, identifies as male, compared to the general investor population, and is more likely to hold a university degree.</li>
<li><strong>Sustained hybrid engagement:&nbsp;</strong>A significant majority (68 per cent) of hybrid investors intend to maintain their dual approach to investing. Among these, 93 per cent express high certainty in their decision, a sentiment echoed in qualitative focus group discussions.</li>
<li><strong>Perceived risk tolerance:&nbsp;</strong>Hybrid investors indicate that they are willing to take on moderate or significant levels of risk with their investments (84 per cent) compared to Canadian investors overall (46 per cent) in a recent 2024 CIRO investor survey.</li>
<li><strong>Speculative investing behaviour:&nbsp;</strong>Those who worked on a financial plan with their advisor tended to engage in less speculative investment behaviour in their DIY account. This included investing in high-risk alternative investments like crypto assets and options, buying and selling investments frequently, and taking on significant risk for the chance of a very large return.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Advisor relationships:&nbsp;</strong>The research found contradictory data with regard to advisor relationships. Survey data suggested that hybrid investors maintain close relationships with their advisors, with many reporting that their advisors are aware of their separate self-directed activities. However, focus group findings indicated a more nuanced reality, with most participants sharing that they had a more transactional and distant relationship with their advisors.</li>
<li><strong>Fraud awareness and prevention:&nbsp;</strong>In focus group discussions, hybrid investors with higher risk tolerance had limited awareness of investment fraud. Those who did articulate a fraud prevention strategy relied on informal or untrustworthy sources and methods, such as online searches and community forums, rather than structured professional advice and institutional safeguards provided by registered advisors.&nbsp;</li>

<title>ISDA derivatiViews: A Path To Greater CFTC-SEC Alignment</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-derivativiews-a-path-to-greater-cftc-sec-alignment-2025102/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-derivativiews-a-path-to-greater-cftc-sec-alignment-2025102/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Earlier this week, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) held a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/meetings-events/sec-cftc-joint-roundtable-sept-29-2025">roundtable on regulatory harmonization</a>&nbsp;&ndash; an initiative we wholeheartedly support. The US regulatory framework has evolved over time to facilitate financial markets that are both vibrant and resilient, but we shouldn&rsquo;t shy away from acknowledging where and how the US regulatory process could be improved.</p>
<p>Both the CFTC and SEC have adapted their respective rulesets over time to reflect critical changes in markets, from the introduction of mandatory central clearing for derivatives to the advent of high-frequency trading. But a cautious approach has slowed market and product evolution. At a time when markets are evolving at a ferocious pace because of technological change, we need to make sure the regulatory process is streamlined and coordinated to avoid gumming up the wheels of finance that are so critical to economic growth. As the roundtable discussion showed, market participants are both capable and willing to work with regulators to support the appropriate evolution of the market by developing trading, risk management and operational solutions required for the future.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to remember that regulators and market participants have a successful history of cooperation on reforms that have delivered safer and more efficient markets &ndash; and ISDA has played an important part in developing legal, operational and risk management solutions to support that on a global scale. This includes delivery of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2016/05/05/isda-launches-resolutionstayjurisdictionalmodularprotocol/">ISDA resolution stay protocols</a>&nbsp;as part of global regulatory bank resolution efforts, implementation of the margining rules for non-cleared derivatives and launch of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/isda-solutions-infohub/isda-simm/">ISDA Standard Initial Margin Model</a>, and development of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/protocol/isda-2021-fallbacks-protocol/">ISDA fallbacks</a>&nbsp;to aid the transition from LIBOR.</p>
<p>There are parts of the current US regulatory framework where similar alignment and coordination are sorely needed. The CFTC and SEC rulebooks can be complex, overlap in certain key areas and are overly reliant on no-action relief. They also contain inconsistencies that mean the regulatory treatment of products and activities with similar risk profiles can differ, depending on whether they fall under the jurisdiction of the CFTC or the SEC.</p>
<p>We would highlight three key areas where greater coordination between the CFTC and SEC is critical and market participants can help to deliver solutions that would increase compliance, cut costs and create a robust collateral infrastructure.</p>
<p>The first is regulatory reporting. It&rsquo;s been more than four years since Archegos Capital Management went bust, leaving its counterparty banks with more than $10 billion in losses. US regulators were largely unaware of the exposures Archegos had been accumulating. While the CFTC introduced its reporting rules in 2012, the SEC regime only came into force a decade later, meaning Archegos did not have an obligation to report its security-based swaps ahead of its collapse.</p>
<p>Both regimes are now in place, which should help avoid gaps in the data going forward. This was helped by cooperation between the two agencies, with the SEC allowing firms to use CFTC reporting processes. But this remains a temporary solution. We urge the SEC to work with the CFTC and the industry to codify this relief into the SEC&rsquo;s permanent ruleset &ndash; a development that would eliminate significant unnecessary complexity and inefficiency for market participants. ISDA plans to add the SEC rules to its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/isda-solutions-infohub/isda-digital-regulatory-reporting/">Digital Regulatory Reporting initiative</a>, which already supports compliance in eight jurisdictions, enabling firms to implement changes to regulatory reporting requirements cost-effectively and accurately.</p>
<p>The agencies should also jointly invest in data curation and analytics capabilities. As a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2023/10/10/hidden-in-plain-sight-derivatives-exposures-regulatory-transparency-and-trade-repositories/">2023 ISDA paper points out</a>, a significant amount of data is available to regulators, but ensuring key information does not remain hidden in plain sight is challenging.</p>
<p>The second issue is Treasury clearing. Ahead of the clearing mandate coming into force from end-2026, clients must be able to realize the benefits of portfolio margining across cleared US Treasury securities and futures. The Fixed Income Clearing Corporation and CME Group are set to propose a client portfolio margining solution, and it&rsquo;s critical the CFTC and SEC act to quickly approve it once they do. This is a no-brainer and essential to make the economics of client clearing work.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t just a CFTC and SEC issue &ndash; US prudential regulators also need to adapt their rules to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2025/09/15/recognition-of-cross-product-netting-is-critical/">recognize the risk-reducing benefits of netting across products</a>, including cleared repos and futures, under the standardized approach to counterparty credit risk.</p>
<p>The third issue is market liquidity and collateral infrastructure. According to the latest&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2025/05/14/isda-margin-survey-year-end-2024/">ISDA margin survey</a>, initial margin and variation margin collected by leading derivatives market participants for their non-cleared derivatives exposures increased by 6.4% to $1.5 trillion at the end of 2024. While margin requirements have helped to provide protection against counterparty credit risk, we must recognize that the financial system has become more prone to liquidity crunches during periods of stress.</p>
<p>At a time when some markets are moving to 24/7 trading, we need 24/7 risk management.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2025/09/30/working-towards-tokenized-collateral/">Tokenization could alleviate some of the liquidity and workflow challenges</a>&nbsp;by expanding the types of usable collateral to a wider range of assets, including money market funds and other tokenized cash and securities. The industry is primed to transform the collateral ecosystem to make it more automated and efficient by leveraging blockchain and tokenized solutions. It&rsquo;s time the CFTC, SEC and market participants work together to upgrade this critical infrastructure underpinning our financial system.</p>
<p>We hope this week&rsquo;s CFTC-SEC roundtable is just the start of greater coordination between the agencies and market participants to swiftly address the old regulations that aren&rsquo;t fit for purpose and address the evolution of products, participants and infrastructures. Working together and tackling these issues will reduce unnecessary regulatory burdens, open a path to greater innovation and improve the competition and efficiency of US financial markets.</p>

<title>Basel Committee Approves Annual G-SIB Assessment, Enhances The Clarity Of Its Grading System For Jurisdictional Assessments And Takes Note Of The Implementation Of Margin Requirements For Non-Centrally Cleared Derivatives</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/basel-committee-approves-annual-g-sib-assessment-enhances-the-clarity-of-its-gr-2025103/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li>Basel Committee approves annual assessment exercise for global systemically important banks.</li>
<li>Enhances clarity of its grading system for jurisdictional assessments.</li>
<li>Discusses implementation status of margin requirements for non-centrally cleared derivatives.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision met virtually on 2 October 2025 to discuss a range of initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>Global systemically important banks</strong></p>
<p>The Committee approved the results of the end-2024 assessment exercise for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). The results will be submitted to the Financial Stability Board before it publishes the 2025 list of G-SIBs.</p>
<p><strong>Implementation</strong></p>
<p>The Committee discussed the grading used for its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/implementation/rcap_jurisdictional.htm"><span class="firstword">jurisdictional</span>&nbsp;assessments</a>, which are a key element of its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/implementation/rcap_role.htm"><span class="firstword">Regulatory</span>&nbsp;Consistency Assessment Programme</a>&nbsp;(RCAP). Jurisdictional assessments review the extent to which domestic regulations in each member jurisdiction are aligned with the minimum regulatory standards agreed by the Committee.</p>
<p>The jurisdictional assessment reports have used four terms to grade the overall level of compliance with the assessed standards (in descending order): compliant, largely compliant, materially non-compliant, and non-compliant. To enhance the clarity of the rank ordering of the jurisdictional assessment grades, the Committee agreed to change the name of the third grade from "materially non-compliant" to "partially non-compliant".</p>
<p>Separately, the Committee approved a finalised technical amendment on the hedging of counterparty credit risk exposures, following a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d584.htm"><span class="firstword">consultation</span>&nbsp;</a>last year. The technical amendment will be published later this month.</p>
<p><strong>Margining</strong></p>
<p>The Committee discussed a report on the implementation of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d499.pdf"><span class="firstword">margin</span>&nbsp;requirements</a>&nbsp;for non-centrally cleared derivatives, developed jointly with the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO). The report finds that implementation of the framework has made the financial system more resilient and that there is no evidence of material issues with the implementation of the framework.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>Background:&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>The Basel Committee is the primary global standard setter for the prudential regulation of banks and provides a forum for cooperation on banking supervisory matters. Its mandate is to strengthen the regulation, supervision and practices of banks worldwide with the purpose of enhancing financial stability. The Committee reports to the Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision and seeks its endorsement for major decisions. The Committee has no formal supranational authority, and its decisions have no legal force. Rather, the Committee relies on its members' commitments to achieve its mandate. The Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision is chaired by Tiff Macklem, Governor of the Bank of Canada. The Basel Committee is chaired by Erik Thed&eacute;en, Governor of Sveriges Riksbank.&nbsp;</em></p>

<title>Euronext Reaffirms Its Support For European Strategic Autonomy By Signing Partnerships With National Military Reserves</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Euronext reaffirms its support for European strategic autonomy by signing partnerships with national military reserves</span></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<h5>On 1 October 2025, Euronext signed a partnership with the French military reserve, the Garde nationale</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>On 19 September 2025, Euronext signed a partnership with the Danish military reserve, InterForce Danmark</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>More partnerships will be signed in the coming months with local military reserves in Europe</h5>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Euronext, the leading European capital market infrastructure, reaffirms its commitment to European resilience and strategic autonomy with the signature of new partnerships with national military reserves in Denmark and France. Additional agreements with local military reserves will be signed in the coming months.</p>
<p>These partnerships extend the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=kqTRr9CVRRlF10OaCxFHPAUpm9DuFXgzE2T4Vm7VHIshyUXgW-krO8E_YZq685XwNMMFklnvPpmzfPi09628Ugv6chdwXNM_iIkEv_MXED42cEeqZcX60pliCVzDKWXKUjNGu3LuFgBzAAsPzjb66rvr84ift9-sBeGaMH_EioNPpavgq3FJFKvUD0up9M83sohAplFpC3xiimBshzZOsec10Vm3UnjPAbwmvWH6oovtpKCeaNnz5HQQXvbHmirkByFxzXM-L_zuTtWRVKqm1QAQh2lxP5aTCP29TdTZvUY=" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="initiatives related to Energy, Security and Geostrategy, the &ldquo;New ESG&rdquo;">initiatives related to Energy, Security and Geostrategy, the &ldquo;New ESG&rdquo;</a>, launched by Euronext on 6 May 2025 to strengthen European strategic autonomy. This set of initiatives led by Euronext enhances the visibility of European companies operating in strategic sectors and provides them with unprecedented tools to meet their financing needs through improved access to capital. These solutions also address the growing demand from asset managers, institutional and retail investors to obtain better exposure to high-growth segments through thematic indices.</p>
<p>As European strategic autonomy and independence rely on the ability of European citizens to take part in their country&rsquo;s own defence ecosystem, Euronext has created a support framework for its employees who are already engaged in a reservist commitment, or who wish to take up this opportunity. As of 6 May 2025, Euronext guarantees the continuation of salary and social benefits for preliminary training periods of up to 15 days for all new reservists, and up to 10 days per year for all Euronext employees engaged in a reservist commitment across all the group&rsquo;s European locations. In countries where a more beneficial local reservist support system exists, the existing framework prevails.</p>
<p>To formalise this engagement, Euronext is signing partnerships with national military reserves.</p>
<p>In Paris, Euronext signed a partnership with the French military reserve, the Garde nationale, on 1 October 2025. General Fran&ccedil;ois-Xavier Poisbeau, General Secretary of the French National Guard (Garde nationale), presented the main aspects of the partnership, while Baptiste Mercier, Head of Operational Performance at Allianz France, and Coralie Lecouffe, Senior Consultant at Capgemini Invent, shared personal experiences from their engagement as operational reservists.</p>
<p>In Copenhagen, Euronext signed a partnership with the Danish military reserve, InterForce Danmark, on 19 September 2025. Local employees had the opportunity to meet with members of the reservist forces, who shared insights about their experience and highlighted how military reservists support Denmark&rsquo;s resilience in the long term.</p>
<p>More partnerships will be signed in the coming months with local military reserve forces from European countries.</p>
<p><span>St&eacute;phane Boujnah, CEO and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext, said:</span>&nbsp;<em>"Through these partnerships, Euronext reinforces its commitment to strengthen European resilience and strategic autonomy, at a time of rising geopolitical tensions. I am deeply proud of this citizen engagement that enables our colleagues to put their skills and abilities to the service of their countries. I want to thank InterForce Danmark and the Garde nationale in France for their support, and the valuable insights they shared. Within the coming weeks and months, Euronext will sign similar partnership agreements with military reserve forces in European countries where we operate. These initiatives demonstrate the power of cross-border collaboration and highlight Euronext&rsquo;s role as a unifying force in Europe&rsquo;s capital markets, fostering both national and continental strength.&rdquo;</em></p>
