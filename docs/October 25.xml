<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Dean Madan. I appreciate the opportunity to speak here at Drexel University and to visit Philadelphia, an area where I have spent much of my personal and professional life.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20251003a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;I will not go on too much about the City of Brotherly Love other than to say I am considering jogging up the steps of the art museum before I catch my train home.</p>
<p>It is an honor to take part in the inaugural Drexel Economic Forum and to meet some of the students, researchers, and business leaders who are here. It is an important time for these groups to hold this event because there is much to discuss about the quickly evolving economy. For my part, as a Federal Reserve policymaker, I am committed to achieving the dual mandate given to us by Congress of promoting maximum employment and stable prices. Delivering on these goals matters to communities, families, and businesses across the country, including right here in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>To inform our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-20251003-slide2.jpg" id="fig2">discussion</a>&nbsp;today, I will share with you my economic outlook and offer my current view of monetary policy before sharing with you some highlights from the Federal Reserve's newly revised monetary policy framework. After my remarks I look forward to answering a few questions.</p>
<p><span>Economic Outlook</span><br />Looking broadly across the U.S. economy, I see that growth has moderated this year, and the risks to both sides of our dual mandate have shifted. Employment growth has slowed because of weaker growth in labor supply and a softening in labor demand. The uptick in the unemployment rate relative to the start of the year suggests that demand has fallen by a bit more than supply and that the downside risks to employment are rising. Meanwhile, higher tariffs are showing through to higher inflation for some goods. I expect that the effects of tariffs on inflation, employment, and economic activity will further show through in coming months.</p>
<p>In the first half of 2025, U.S.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-20251003-slide3.jpg" id="fig3">GDP</a>&nbsp;grew at a 1.6 percent annual rate, which reflects a marked cooling from last year's 2.4 percent growth rate. The slowdown in economic activity in the first half of this year was primarily driven by weaker consumer spending. That said, U.S. retail spending picked up over the summer. Overall, I expect the U.S. economy to maintain the first half's rate of growth through the remainder of the year.</p>
<p>In terms of the labor market, we did not receive the September jobs report this morning because of a lapse in federal government funding. While this is less than ideal, I never focus on a single report; rather, I look across an array of indicators to assess the labor market and the economy.</p>
<p>The available data from both government and private-sector sources point out that labor supply and demand are slowing together, as reflected in the ratio of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-20251003-slide4.jpg" id="fig4">job openings to unemployed</a>&nbsp;Americans seeking work. A few years ago, available jobs well exceeded the unemployment level. That came back into balance over the past year or so. Data released earlier this week showed the unemployment level slightly exceeded openings this summer, but what economists call the V/U ratio remains near 1. Similarly, last week the Labor Department reported that initial jobless claims continue to mostly trend sideways. Net immigration into the U.S., an important contributor to workforce growth, has dropped sharply, and that is a factor restraining a more significant increase in unemployment.</p>
<p>Turning to the other side of our dual mandate, it is notable that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-20251003-slide5.jpg" id="fig5">inflation</a>&nbsp;has slowed considerably from the highs that occurred when the economy reopened after pandemic disruptions. Inflation, however, remains somewhat above our 2 percent target, and the tariffs that have been announced and implemented so far are showing up in some goods prices. Overall, personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices rose 2.7 percent over the 12 months ending in August. Core PCE inflation&mdash;which removes volatile food and energy prices&mdash;was 2.9 percent in August.</p>
<p>Often, it is helpful to study the three major&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-20251003-slide6.jpg" id="fig6">components of core PCE inflation</a>&nbsp;to better understand what is driving overall price measures. Currently, core goods prices, which declined modestly last year, have been rising, reflecting tariff effects, although it is also notable that the increase so far has been smaller than what many forecasters predicted this spring. Meanwhile, core services inflation, outside of housing, has generally trended sideways this year, while housing inflation appears to be on a gradual downward trend.</p>
<p>I view the uncertainty around my baseline outlook as especially high, mainly due to the changes in government policies and the challenges around assessing their net effects on employment and inflation. As the changes in these policies are finalized and we have more time to judge how they are affecting the economy, I expect some of the broader uncertainty around the U.S. economy to diminish.</p>
<p><span>Monetary Policy</span><br />Considering the outlook I described, I see the risks to employment as tilted to the downside and risks to inflation to the upside. It follows that both sides of our mandate are under pressure.</p>
<p>While tariff-related inflation is apparent in the prices of goods, tariff increases typically represent a one-time change in the price level. The scope and persistence of the related rise in inflation will be determined by several factors&mdash;including the final tariff rates, the extent of pass-through to consumer prices, the effects on supply chains, overall economic conditions, and what happens to longer-run inflation expectations. Short-term inflation expectations have come down from the peaks reached in the second quarter, and most measures of longer-term inflation expectations have been largely stable, suggesting that the American people understand our commitment to returning inflation to our 2 percent target. As such, I expect the disinflation process to resume after this year and inflation to return to the 2 percent target in the coming years.</p>
<p>As I noted above, trends across several data series indicate that the labor market is softening, which suggests that, left unsupported, it could experience stress. To balance the risk of persistent above-target inflation and the risk of a deteriorating labor market, I supported a 25 basis point cut in our target range at the last FOMC meeting. This change moved our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-20251003-slide7.jpg" id="fig7">policy rate</a>&nbsp;closer to a more neutral stance while maintaining a balanced approach to promoting our dual-mandate objectives.</p>
<p>With respect to the path of the policy rate going forward, I will continue to evaluate the appropriate stance of monetary policy based on the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.  I will also consider and assess information about government policies and their effects on the economy.</p>
<p><span>The Fed's Revised Framework</span><br />Now that I have discussed my outlook and the latest policy decision, I want to turn to an important document that I use to guide those decisions: the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-20251003-slide8.jpg" id="fig8">Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy</a>. This statement is designed to give the public a clear sense of how we think about monetary policy. As Chair Powell discussed at his Jackson Hole speech, a revised version of that document was issued in August.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20251003a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a></p>
<p>The framework document, often called the consensus statement, was first issued in 2012, under Chair Ben Bernanke's leadership. The Fed's dual mandate, established by Congress, to foster maximum employment and stable prices underpins this framework. Our commitment to delivering on our dual mandate is unwavering. The revisions to our framework will support that mission across a broad range of economic conditions.</p>
<p>The FOMC revised its consensus statement after conducting a public review. That review consisted of three elements: first, Reserve Banks hosted&nbsp;<em>Fed Listens</em>&nbsp;events; second, the Board hosted a research conference; and third, we convened a series of policymaker discussions at FOMC meetings this year, supported by staff analysis. The changes implemented as a result of this review were a logical progression, not a change in course, grounded in our ever-evolving understanding of our economy. I will make note of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-20251003-slide9.jpg" id="fig9">four adjustments</a>&nbsp;to the consensus statement and discuss each in turn.</p>
<p>First, the revised consensus statement removed language emphasizing the effective lower bound (ELB) as a defining feature of the economic landscape. Instead, it states that our monetary policy strategy is designed to promote maximum employment and stable prices across a broad range of economic conditions. This revision, reflecting a move away from the post&ndash;financial crisis era of historically low interest rates, makes our framework more robust. It is useful to recall that at the time of the FOMC's previous framework review, during 2019 and 2020, policymakers were considering an economy that had for many years demonstrated low growth, low inflation, and a very flat Phillips curve&mdash;meaning that inflation was not very responsive to slack in the economy. The overarching concern for central bankers at that time was how to operate when short-term interest rates are near the ELB. Today, of course, we are operating in a very different environment, at least in part brought on by the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Second, the revised framework embraces a flexible inflation-targeting approach at all times and eliminates a "makeup" strategy that would be employed in certain circumstances. The experience of the U.S. economy since the pandemic highlights different challenges to achieving our inflation mandate&mdash;such as supply shocks, sectoral developments, and nonlinear inflation dynamics. The flexible inflation-targeting strategy outlined in our revised framework allows us to take a balanced approach in promoting our goals by considering the extent of departures from them. The revised framework appropriately emphasizes the Committee's commitment to ensuring that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.</p>
<p>Third, the revised consensus statement provides clarity on how the Committee thinks about its legislated goal of maximum employment. The 2020 version of the statement indicated that the Fed would mitigate "shortfalls" from maximum employment. This shortfalls strategy was partly motivated by our recognition that real-time assessments of the natural rate of unemployment&mdash;and hence of "maximum employment"&mdash;are highly uncertain. However, the use of the word "shortfalls" created some communications challenges, as it was not intended to be a commitment that the Committee would never follow preemptive policy actions or ignore tight labor market conditions. As a result, we have removed it from the consensus statement. Instead, the revised document more precisely states that "the Committee recognizes that employment may at times run above real-time assessments of maximum employment without necessarily creating risks to price stability."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/jefferson20251003a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;As Chair Powell pointed out, preemptive action could well be warranted if tightness in the labor market or other factors pose risks to price stability. The revised statement defines maximum employment as "the highest level of employment that can be achieved on a sustained basis in a context of price stability."</p>
<p>Fourth, and closely aligned with the change I just discussed, the FOMC clarified the approach that it would take to monetary policy in times when the employment and inflation sides of our mandate may be at odds. The revised statement says that, in such periods, the Committee will follow "a balanced approach in promoting them, taking into account the extent of departures from its goals and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with its mandate." The revised language more closely aligns with the original 2012 statement. It is also consistent with the Committee's actions during the 2022&ndash;24 period, when the departure from our 2 percent inflation target was the overriding concern.</p>
<p>I have just highlighted a series of changes that we made to the framework statement, but it is also important to note the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/jefferson-20251003-slide10.jpg" id="fig10">continuity</a>&nbsp;with past versions of our statement. The document continues to explain how we interpret the mandate Congress has given us and describes the policy framework that we believe will best promote maximum employment and price stability. We also continue to believe that monetary policy must be forward looking and consider the lags in its effects on the economy. We have never set a numerical goal for employment because the maximum level of employment is not directly measurable and changes over time for reasons unrelated to policy. Likewise, we maintained our commitment to a 2 percent inflation objective because that is a key factor helping keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored, thus supporting both sides of our dual mandate. And we remain committed to conducting a public review roughly every five years.</p>
<p><span>Conclusion</span><br />The FOMC remains fully committed to fulfilling its statutory mandate, and the revisions to the framework will support that mission across a broad range of economic conditions. Thank you for allowing me to share with you details of the revised monetary policy framework and my views on the current economic outlook. I hope both will serve as jumping-off points for your discussions over the rest of the afternoon. Once again, I am honored to take part in this inaugural event and look forward to our conversation.</p>

<p><span>State Senator Liz Krueger,&nbsp;Chair of the New York State Senate Finance Committee</span>:&nbsp;&ldquo;It has been an honor working together with Superintendent Harris throughout her tenure at DFS. She has been a champion for the needs of New Yorkers, whether through safeguarding access to the full spectrum of reproductive care, standing up for older New Yorkers in the face of insurance company malfeasance, or, most recently, protecting New Yorkers' access to that COVID vaccine. I wish her the best of luck in her next role.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>State Senator James Sanders Jr., Chair of the New York State Senate Banks Committee:&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;I want to heartily congratulate New York State Department of Financial Services Superintendent Adrienne Harris for serving honorably and professionally during her tenure as the chief regulator of the State that is a global leader in banking. Superintendent Harris&rsquo; leadership has addressed many emerging issues including cryptocurrency, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, climate change, as well as the long-term issues of banking discrimination, a sound banking system, and many others. I wish Superintendent Harris well on her future endeavors. As Chair of the Senate Banks Committee, I look forward to working with the incoming Acting Superintendent Kaitlin Asrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>State Senator Zellnor Myrie,&nbsp;Chair of the New York State Senate Codes Committee</span>: &ldquo;As Superintendent, Adrienne Harris has fought to ensure financial services work for all New Yorkers. In a moment when consumers are especially vulnerable to fraud and manipulation,&nbsp;Superintendent Harris and DFS have worked to build an equitable, fair and transparent financial system. I'm grateful for her service to our state and look forward to continuing the work of keeping more money in New Yorkers' pockets.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>State Assembly Majority Leader Crystal Peoples-Stokes:</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;I want to thank Superintendent Harris for her steadfast commitment to the people of the State of New York during her tenure leading the Department of Financial Services. Superintendent Harris&rsquo; many notable accomplishments ensured New York remained the trusted financial capital of the world while always looking out for the consumers&rsquo; best interests. She will be missed, and I wish her all the best in her future endeavors.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>State&nbsp;Assemblymember David Weprin, Chair of the New York State Assembly Insurance Committee:</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;I want to thank Superintendent Adrienne Harris for her partnership and her dedication to protecting consumers and strengthening New York&rsquo;s insurance market. Her commitment to protecting policyholders and ensuring fair, transparent oversight has made a real difference for families and business across our state. Her collaborative leadership at DFS has been invaluable, and I wish her the very best in her future endeavors.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>State Assemblymember John T. McDonald</span>&nbsp;<span>III, RPh,&nbsp;Chair of the New York State Assembly Governmental Operations Committee</span>: &ldquo;Superintendent Harris has been a true breath of fresh air during her four years as Superintendent of the Department of Financial Services (DFS).&nbsp; We immediately connected on the issue of governing Pharmaceutical Benefit Managers (PBMs) and we have had a strong start in regulating this area which is important to consumers, providers, and payors.&nbsp; That being said, I do not believe many people understand the full breadth and depth of the range of topics DFS covers and I have been with Adrienne in many different forums over the past four years and am amazed at the depth of her knowledge on even the most minor of issues.&nbsp; This is a reflection of her commitment to the people of New York and the close working relationship with the team and staff she has worked hard to develop over her time as Superintendent. Her presences and expertise will be missed, but I am comforted by the fact that she leaves DFS in a much better place than she found it.&nbsp; I wish her the best in her next chapter.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>State Assemblymember Clyde Vanel,&nbsp;Chair of the New York State Assembly Banks Committee:&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Protecting consumers and safeguarding the stability of our financial system are at the very heart of the Department of Financial Services&rsquo; mission, and under Superintendent Adrienne Harris&rsquo;s leadership, those priorities were elevated to new heights. From day one, she demonstrated a bold vision for what responsible and forward-looking regulation should look like in an age of rapid technological and economic change. During her tenure, she drove significant progress in areas such as cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence, advanced cybersecurity protections, and championed efforts to secure restitution for victims harmed by financial institutions.<span>&nbsp;</span>I am confident that the strong foundation she built will continue to benefit both consumers and the financial services industry for years to come. I wish her nothing but success as she takes the next steps in her remarkable career, and I have no doubt Acting Superintendent Kaitlin Asrow will make a fantastic successor.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Assemblymember Alex Bores</span>: "I am sad to see Superintendent Harris leave her role at DFS, where she has been invaluable to the protection of New York&rsquo;s consumers. Leading from the front, when a constituent of mine was affected by a specific DFS stance, Superintendent Harris gave the issue her personal attention to resolve the matter and changed DFS policy to properly accommodate. I look forward to working with the new superintendent, who will be tasked with filling the shoes of one of the most capable public servants I have had the pleasure of working with."</p>
<p><span>Elisabeth R. Benjamin, Vice President of Health Initiatives at the Community Service Society of New York, leader of the statewide #EndMedicalDebt campaign, and member of the DFS Consumer Protection Advisory Council</span>: &ldquo;Under Superintendent Adrienne Harris&rsquo; tremendous leadership, New York was able to achieve important strides for health care affordability. The Hochul Administration and Superintendent Harris led the way on abolishing co-payments for insulin and expunging medical debt from tens of thousands of credit reports.&nbsp; These policies help tens of thousands of New York healthcare consumers maintain their economic security in these turbulent times.&nbsp; We look forward to continuing to improve health insurance affordability under Acting Superintendent Kaitlin Asrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Mike Pierce, Executive Director of Protect Borrowers and member of the DFS Consumer Protection Advisory Council:</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Superintendent Harris fought for New Yorkers as they've struggled to shoulder rising costs and navigate a shifting and risky financial services market. From housing and healthcare to cars and college, debt shapes how New York families participate in the modern economy. Superintendent Harris understands how debt and predatory financial companies squeeze New Yorkers and leaves behind a legacy as a champion for working families.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Kathryn Wylde, President &amp; CEO, Partnership for New York City:</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Adrienne has transformed the Department of Financial Services from an obscure bureaucracy into a smart, responsive regulator. She is a highly respected, national leader in addressing the complex issues associated with a rapidly changing financial industry.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Brandon Milhorn, President &amp; CEO of the Conference of State Banking Supervisors:</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Superintendent Harris has been a strong advocate for state authority and expertise, particularly in digital assets. Her leadership on the CSBS Board and FSOC strengthened the state system and advanced a more dynamic and resilient financial system.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Rose Marie Glazer, General Counsel of AIG</span>&nbsp;<span>and member of the DFS Insurance Advisory Board:</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;AIG would like to thank Superintendent Harris for her exemplary leadership and stewardship during her tenure, and we are looking forward to working with Acting Superintendent Asrow going forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Karen Ignani, Chair of Emblem Health and&nbsp;member of the DFS&nbsp;Insurance Advisory Board: &ldquo;</span>Superintendent Harris&rsquo; efforts have ensured that New York has set the regulatory bar on critical national issues, such as cybersecurity and the use of artificial intelligence.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Laura Evangelista, President/CEO of LICONY:</span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Throughout her tenure, Superintendent Harris prioritized dialogue and partnership with LICONY and New York&rsquo;s life insurance industry. By maintaining a consistent and thoughtful exchange of ideas and concerns, she promoted a regulatory environment that supports both the industry and the millions of New Yorkers who rely on life insurance for financial security. We are grateful for her partnership and look forward to continuing this constructive relationship with Acting Superintendent Asrow.&rdquo;</p>

Kriegler said. &ldquo;We thank the FCAA for their support as we take on these new registration functions. CIRO looks forward to delivering on this new registration framework and continuing to bring value to our members and the investors they serve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Securities regulatory authorities in Alberta, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Northwest Territories, Nova Scotia, Nunavut, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, and Yukon have already issued delegation orders authorizing CIRO to undertake registration functions for ID and MFDs, effective April 1, 2025.

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/basel-committee-reports-further-progress-on-basel-iii-implementation-2025103/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li>Over the past 12 months, the final Basel III standards came into effect in more than 40% of the Basel Committee's 27 member jurisdictions.</li>
<li>The revised credit risk and operational risk standards as well as the output floor are now in effect in around 80% of member jurisdictions.</li>
<li>The Committee will continue to closely monitor and assess the full and consistent implementation of Basel III standards.</li>
</ul>
<p>Member jurisdictions of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision have made significant progress in implementing the Basel III reforms over the past year, according to the Committee's latest&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/implementation/rcap_reports.htm"><span class="firstword">progress</span>&nbsp;update</a>&nbsp;published today.</p>
<p>The update and monitoring dashboard set out the jurisdictional adoption status of the Basel III standards as of end-September 2025 and show where the standards are already implemented by banks. They cover the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d424.htm"><span class="firstword">final</span>&nbsp;elements of Basel III</a>&nbsp;published by the Committee in December 2017 and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d457.htm"><span class="firstword">finalised</span>&nbsp;minimum capital requirements for market risk</a>&nbsp;of January 2019. The implementation date for these reforms was 1 January 2023,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/press/p200327.htm"><span class="firstword">as</span>&nbsp;announced by the Governors and Heads of Supervision (GHOS) &ndash; the Basel Committee's oversight body &ndash; in March 2020</a>.</p>
<p>Since the previous annual update, the final Basel III standards came into effect in more than 40% of the 27 member jurisdictions. Consequently, the revised credit risk and operational risk standards, as well as the output floor are now in effect in around 80% of member jurisdictions, the CVA standard in nearly 70%, and the revised market risk standards in nearly 40%.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The monitoring dashboard provides the implementation history of Basel standards by member jurisdictions, including the publication and implementation dates of their domestic regulations.</p>
<p>At the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/press/p250512.htm"><span class="firstword">12</span>&nbsp;May 2025 meeting</a>&nbsp;of the GHOS, members unanimously reaffirmed their expectation of implementing all aspects of the Basel III framework in full, consistently and as soon as possible. The series of shocks to financial markets over the past few years have highlighted the importance of having a prudent global regulatory framework in place. The GHOS tasked the Committee with continuing to monitor and assess the full and consistent implementation of Basel III.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>Background</em></p>
<p><em>The Basel Committee is the primary global standard setter for the prudential regulation of banks and provides a forum for cooperation on banking supervisory matters. Its mandate is to strengthen the regulation, supervision and practices of banks worldwide with the purpose of enhancing financial stability. The Committee reports to the Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision and seeks its endorsement for major decisions. The Committee has no formal supranational authority, and its decisions have no legal force. Rather, the Committee relies on its members' commitments to achieve its mandate. The Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision is chaired by Tiff Macklem, Governor of the Bank of Canada. The Basel Committee is chaired by Erik Thed&eacute;en, Governor of Sveriges Riksbank.&nbsp;</em></p>

<title>ESMA 2026 Work Programme – Advancing On More Integrated, Accessible And Competitive Financial Markets In The EU</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor, has today published its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2025-10/ESMA22-50751485-1604_Annual_Work_Programme_2026.pdf">2026 Annual Work Programme</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify">Guided by its multi-annual strategy for 2023&ndash;2028 which sets out three strategic priorities and two thematic drivers, ESMA&rsquo;s 2026 work programme focuses on delivering on core policy and supervisory mandates while contributing to ambitious reforms for more integrated, accessible, and innovative EU capital markets.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>Verena Ross, Chair of ESMA, said:&nbsp;</span></p>
<h6 class="text-align-justify"><em>&ldquo;A core focus in 2026 is ESMA&rsquo;s ambitious, and at the same time pragmatic, approach to simplification and burden reduction. We are pursuing a holistic strategy to streamline rules, enhance risk-based supervision and ensure proportionate reporting requirements across the ESMA remit.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span>In that spirit, we will continue the work linked to three landmark consultations already launched in 2025, on integrated funds reporting, transactional reporting and the investor journey.&nbsp;</em></h6>
<h6 class="text-align-justify"><em>We also stand ready to play a central role in the legislative initiatives set out in the upcoming SIU Strategy, including the removal of barriers in trading and post-trading, facilitating cross-border provision of funds, and strengthening supervision across the EU single market.&rdquo;</em></h6>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>Natasha Cazenave, Executive Director of ESMA, said:&nbsp;</span></p>
<h6 class="text-align-justify"><em>&ldquo;ESMA&rsquo;s ongoing supervisory responsibilities will expand in 2026, through the authorisation and supervision of Consolidated Tape Providers (CTPs), external reviewers under the European Green Bond framework (EUGBR), ESG rating providers, and the extension of third-country benchmark supervision. ESMA and its fellow European Supervisory Authorities will also, for the first time, jointly exercise the oversight of critical third party providers under the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA).</em></h6>
<h6 class="text-align-justify"><em>These new responsibilities will complement our existing mandates and be subject to our risk based, data driven and outcome focused supervision. Through extensive outreach and preparatory work, ESMA supervisory teams are gearing up to take on these new responsibilities."&nbsp;</em></h6>
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span>Supporting the Saving and Investments Union (SIU)</span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify">In 2026, ESMA will continue to build on existing priorities, supporting the forthcoming strategic developments set out by the Commission&rsquo;s Saving and Investments Union (SIU) Strategy. This includes aligning supervisory practices across Member States, enhancing market data capabilities, and actively contributing to upcoming reforms designed to create a more integrated and globally competitive EU financial system.&nbsp;<span>ESMA also aims at seizing opportunities arising from digitalisation, for example by facilitating the simplification and use of clear language in disclosures.</span></p>
<p class="text-align-justify">ESMA&rsquo;s activities will remain closely aligned with the agenda of the European Commission and co-legislators, maintaining the agility needed to address evolving regulatory, economic, and technological landscapes. This responsiveness is crucial as volatility, uncertainty, and rapid change shape the global environment and impact EU financial markets. Given the significance of the forthcoming proposals under the Savings and Investments Union, ESMA stands ready to provide its technical expertise and support to the preparation and implementation of the new legislative files that will be launched.</p>
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span>Other regulatory and supervisory priorities for 2026</span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify">Beyond the priorities coming from the SIU strategy, ESMA will continue supporting implementation of key legislative files agreed under the previous legislature, notably the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR 3) and the European Single Access Point (ESAP).&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>Other ongoing legislative files which, depending on progress, may require ESMA&rsquo;s attention in 2026 are the Retail Investment Strategy (RIS), as well as the review of the PRIIPS, SFDR and Securitisation Regulation.&nbsp;ESMA will ensure that it integrates the principles of Simplification and Burden Reduction across all its activities and will follow up on the 2025 &lsquo;flagship&rsquo; projects seeking simplification and efficiencies in disclosure and reporting frameworks.</span></p>
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span>Driving data innovation and market integration</span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify">ESMA will focus on enhancing data capabilities and promoting innovation across the EU financial sector. Key projects for 2026 include the rollout of the ESMA Data Platform, centralisation studies, and the development of AI-powered supervisory tools. These initiatives will bring common benefits to both ESMA and the National Competent Authorities, improving market efficiency and transparency through the support that data provides for risk-based and data-driven supervision across Europe.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>In the digital finance sector ESMA will continue to focus on the effective implementation of MiCA, as it is key to ensuring investor protection and the orderly functioning of crypto-asset markets. ESMA&rsquo;s supervisory convergence efforts will remain focused notably on the authorisation and supervision of CASPs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>Finally, i</span>n line with the EU&rsquo;s ambition to accelerate the settlement cycle to T+1 by 11 October 2027, ESMA will also coordinate closely with market participants to ensure the smooth transition and preparedness of the financial sector for this event.</p>

<p>It is a pleasure to be here in Amsterdam.</p>
<p><a class="author" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/ecb/orga/decisions/html/cvlagarde.en.html"> </a></p>
<div class="author-image"><a class="author" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/ecb/orga/decisions/html/cvlagarde.en.html"><img src="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/shared/img/boardmembers/cv_lagarde_portrait.jpg" /></a></div>
<p><a class="author" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/ecb/orga/decisions/html/cvlagarde.en.html">
<div class="author-details">
<div class="name">Christine Lagarde</div>
<div class="affiliation-first">The President of the European Central Bank</div>
</div>
</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At today&rsquo;s symposium, we are saying a fond farewell to an outstanding colleague and friend. Klaas, you can look back on a remarkable career in public service at the national, European and global levels.</p>
<p>You were at the helm of De Nederlandsche Bank for over 5,000 days.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.1" id="fn1">1</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;In that time, you were a gifted communicator, conveying complex themes to the Dutch public in clear but never simplistic terms.</p>
<p>As a member of the Governing Council, you participated in over 330 meetings, overseen by three different ECB Presidents. I won&rsquo;t put you on the spot by asking you who your favourite was. You can tell me later &ndash; no pressure.</p>
<p>Being one of the elders on the Governing Council, your voice carried a weight that helped to forge policy consensus at the most critical of moments &ndash; be it during the pandemic or during the sharpest inflation shock in a generation.</p>
<p>And with experience comes wisdom. As Chair of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), you used that wisdom to advance the global agenda on financial stability, shaping international standards and coordination.</p>
<p>Klaas, you are known for reminding colleagues who tend to talk at length to be more &ldquo;impactful&rdquo; in their interventions. Well, now the pressure is on me. I promise to be as &ldquo;impactful&rdquo; as I can.</p>
<p>So today, I would like to focus on the two themes that have defined your career: monetary policy and financial stability.&nbsp;<a class="link-inline" id="_Hlk209781803"></a>And in so doing, I will discuss the powerful role that regulation and supervision can play in reducing the potential trade-offs between them.</p>
<h2>The interaction between monetary policy and financial stability</h2>
<p><a class="link-inline" id="_Hlk210203869"></a>Financial stability and price stability are preconditions for each other.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.2" id="fn2">2</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;Yet history shows that in the pursuit of price stability, monetary policy can face two key trade-offs with implications for financial stability.</p>
<p>The first can occur when monetary policy rapidly tightens. Higher interest rates help to curb inflation, but they can put pressure on banks by eroding asset values and asset quality, even as rising net interest margins offer them some relief.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.3" id="fn3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>We saw this during the 1980s, when the Federal Reserve rapidly tightened monetary policy to bring down high inflation.</p>
<p>Combined with US deregulation in the late 1970s, which encouraged riskier lending and weaker oversight, this monetary tightening was one of the key factors in the emergence of the savings and loan crisis. That led to the failure of roughly 1,300 savings institutions owing to the maturity mismatch on their balance sheets.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.4" id="fn4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>The second trade-off for monetary policy can arise during or following an extended period of monetary accommodation.</p>
<p>When inflation is below target, low rates can help stimulate demand and push inflation back towards target. But in an environment where regulation is relatively weak and especially where rates remain low for an extended period, they can also encourage borrowing, risk-taking and the build-up of financial imbalances.</p>
<p>These dynamics highlight how monetary policy can affect financial stability not only through banks&rsquo; balance sheets but also via market valuations and investor risk appetite.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.5" id="fn5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>Crucially, financial vulnerabilities may keep building even&nbsp;<em>after</em>&nbsp;rates begin to rise. We saw this in the lead-up to the global financial crisis of 2008.</p>
<p>Low rates earlier in the decade fed the US credit and housing boom that later unravelled &ndash; years after the Federal Reserve had begun to gradually tighten. And in the euro area, the sharp rise in private debt in some countries was a key driver of imbalances that built up before the crisis.</p>
<p>The lesson for policymakers was clear. Insufficient regulation and supervision had allowed risks to build unchecked, leaving monetary policy as&nbsp;<em>de facto</em>&nbsp;the only tool available to confront the fallout.</p>
<p>This placed an undue burden on central banks, forcing them to shoulder responsibilities that could have been better managed through stronger safeguards in the first place. That insight powered the construction of a stronger regulatory and supervisory framework after 2008.</p>
<p>The post-2008 regulatory and supervisory framework was a turning point for the interaction between monetary policy and financial stability. It served as a powerful lever in mitigating the trade-offs between them and, accordingly, increased monetary policy&rsquo;s room for manoeuvre.</p>
<h2>Monetary policy in extraordinary times</h2>
<p>This was most visible during two extraordinary periods for monetary policy that followed in the wake of the global financial crisis.</p>
<p>The first period was when inflation was too low.</p>
<p>Central banks across advanced economies turned to a set of new &ndash; and, at the time, unconventional &ndash; tools to meet their price stability mandates, including large-scale asset purchase programmes and the introduction of negative interest rates.</p>
<p>These were significant measures to fight a significant challenge. And at the time, there were vocal concerns that these measures would fuel financial instability.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.6" id="fn6">6</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;Certainly, asset prices and housing valuations&nbsp;<em>did</em>&nbsp;rise notably during this period.</p>
<p>But crucially, given the stronger regulatory and supervisory regime, rising asset prices did&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;translate into excessive leverage<span>&nbsp;</span>in the banking system. In fact, banks in the euro area deleveraged in the decade after the global financial crisis. Similarly, private sector debt as a share of GDP also fell during that time.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.7" id="fn7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>And here in the Netherlands, we saw how macroprudential policy acted as the first line of defence against financial imbalances.</p>
<p>Under your leadership, Klaas, the DNB strengthened the macroprudential framework, introducing higher capital buffers and stricter risk weight requirements to guard against housing market risks. These measures kept in check vulnerabilities that might once have spilled over into broader financial instability.</p>
<p>After years of below-target inflation, the second period came unexpectedly &ndash; when euro area inflation surged to record highs after the pandemic and the energy shock sparked by Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>In the Netherlands, for example, inflation rose rapidly, peaking just above 17% in September 2022 &ndash; almost six times the rate recorded a year earlier.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.8" id="fn8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>Once again, we faced an extraordinary situation &ndash; and the ECB had to step up. Alongside the unwinding of its asset purchases, it raised rates ten times by a cumulative 450 basis points, the fastest tightening in its history.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.9" id="fn9">9</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>And once again, there were concerns about the financial stability implications of such a rapid tightening.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.10" id="fn10">10</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>Tighter financing conditions risked straining borrower debt service and triggering market repricing. That, in turn, could have exposed financial institutions to vulnerabilities from falling asset values, maturity mismatches and weaker asset quality.</p>
<p>While there were some notable bank failures during this period, the global financial system overall remained broadly resilient to rising rates.</p>
<p>In the euro area, for example, banks were supported by stronger capital and ample liquidity buffers. Strong supervision also helped. Even before the inflation shock hit in full, the Single Supervisory Mechanism had factored interest rate risks into its supervisory work programme.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.11" id="fn11">11</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>Moreover, in line with the outcome of its strategy review, the ECB&rsquo;s Governing Council was regularly assessing the links between monetary policy and financial stability as part of its policy deliberations.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.12" id="fn12">12</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>The experience across these two monetary policy eras confirmed the lessons of 2008. Stronger regulation and supervision were able to contain financial exuberance and limit vulnerabilities. They allowed monetary policy to focus on its job of delivering price stability.</p>
<p>In this regard, Klaas, you have a knack for good timing. When you left the Governing Council last July, inflation had fallen substantially from its historic peak and stood at our target of 2% that same month.</p>
<h2>A global financial system in transformation</h2>
<p>Does the progress we have made in strengthening the regulatory and supervisory framework mean that policymakers can now let their guard down? The answer, of course, is no.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s global financial system looks very different from the one that stood on the brink in 2008.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.13" id="fn13">13</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;Two key shifts<span>&nbsp;</span>stand out compared with then.</p>
<p>The first has been the massive structural transformation that has taken place, the most striking change of which has been the growing footprint of non-banks in financial intermediation.</p>
<p>In the euro area, non-banks &ndash; ranging from investment funds and insurance corporations to money market funds and securitisation vehicles &ndash; have grown from about 250% of GDP in 2008 to more than 350% today.</p>
<p>Non-banks are also highly interconnected with the banking sector.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.14" id="fn14">14</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;In the euro area, banks&rsquo; asset exposures to non-banks are sizeable, averaging around one-tenth of significant institutions&rsquo; total assets.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.15" id="fn15">15</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>At the same time, a second key shift is becoming increasingly evident &ndash; namely, signs of regulatory fatigue, which is creating an uneven playing field for financial institutions.</p>
<p>In particular, investment funds, despite their increasing systemic importance, operate under far lighter rules compared with the banking sector. That has in part helped to fuel their growth.</p>
<p>One of the reasons behind this regulatory fatigue is that the post-2008 global regulatory framework has arguably been a victim of its own success.</p>
<p>In policymaking, 17 years is a long time. Not only do painful memories fade, but so too does the recognition that the financial stability the world now enjoys is thanks to the robustness of that global regulatory framework established back then.</p>
<p>This fading sense of urgency, together with concerns that banks&rsquo; competitiveness vis-&agrave;-vis non-banks is threatened by the uneven playing field, has ignited calls to revisit the existing set of financial rules and regulations.</p>
<h2>The importance of levelling up regulation and supervision</h2>
<p>So how should policymakers react to these shifts in the financial system?</p>
<p>In short, it is vital that policymakers adapt regulation and supervision to this challenging environment. They should do so not by&nbsp;<em>lowering</em>&nbsp;standards for banks, but by&nbsp;<em>levelling them up</em>&nbsp;for non-banks that are involved in bank-like activities, or with significant links to the banking sector.</p>
<p>That helps to address banks&rsquo; concerns about the uneven playing field. And better supervision of non-banks would make potential financial stability risks that have lain dormant in darker corners of the economy more visible, allowing policymakers to pre-empt them.</p>
<p>Klaas, as FSB Chair, you have been a powerful voice in warning against the dangers of regulatory rollback.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.16" id="fn16">16</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;And under your leadership, the FSB advanced ambitious policy recommendations on strengthening rules for non-banks.</p>
<p>They covered money market fund resilience<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.17" id="fn17">17</a>]</sup></span>, liquidity mismatches in open-ended funds<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.18" id="fn18">18</a>]</sup></span>, margin preparedness<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.19" id="fn19">19</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;and, most recently, leverage in non-banks.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.20" id="fn20">20</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;This is not to mention the FSB&rsquo;s important work on other areas of financial stability risk.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.21" id="fn21">21</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>As a central banker, I cannot pretend to be an unbiased observer in these discussions. Because if the regulatory and supervisory spotlight were to be broadened to non-banks, monetary policy would benefit too.</p>
<p>If risks were to build outside the banking system, beyond the current reach of regulators and supervisors, the trade-offs that were evident before 2008 may re-emerge, with monetary policy&nbsp;<em>de facto</em>&nbsp;being the only tool to &ldquo;get in all of the cracks&rdquo; and rein in financial exuberance.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.22" id="fn22">22</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>That would be a suboptimal outcome, one that potentially constrains central banks&rsquo; full freedom to defend price stability.</p>
<p>So as referees on the playing field, it is vital that policymakers resist regulatory fatigue and redouble their efforts to extend stronger global rules to non-banks involved in bank-like activities, or with significant links to the banking sector.</p>
<p>At the same time, after a decade of adding regulation, this is a good moment to take stock and assess how regulation can be simplified to avoid duplication and unnecessary burdens on financial institutions.</p>
<p>In this respect, the ECB High-Level Task Force on Simplification is developing proposals for simplifying the European prudential regulatory, supervisory and reporting framework for the European Commission&rsquo;s consideration.</p>
<p>The goal is not to relax rules, nor undo what has been achieved. Instead, the task force is exploring how to reduce undue complexity in selected aspects of the capital structure, reporting and supervision, while also maintaining the resilience of banks and fostering greater integration and harmonisation in EU frameworks.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Let me conclude.</p>
<p>I have spoken this evening about one Dutch elder &ndash; you, Klaas. Hopefully I have done so in a relatively impactful manner. But I would like to finish by citing another Dutch elder.</p>
<p>In his&nbsp;<em>Adagia</em>, the humanist Erasmus gathered the wisdom of past centuries for the benefit of those living in the present. Among the proverbs that still resonate today is, &ldquo;Prevention is better than cure&rdquo;.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.23" id="fn23">23</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>In the Netherlands in particular &ndash; often said to have witnessed the world&rsquo;s first financial bubble, though historians debate its true scale<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp251003~4eea40331a.en.html#footnote.24" id="fn24">24</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;&ndash; that lesson endures: vigilance is wiser than complacency.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>This principle lies at the heart of sound regulation and supervision. As the financial system evolves, regulators and supervisors must retain visibility of potential risks, since preventing instability is always less costly than repairing the damage afterwards. It also helps to limit the potential trade-offs between monetary policy and financial stability.</p>
<p>Policymakers should not wait for another financial crisis to be reminded of how high the stakes are. It is imperative to extend oversight to non-banks involved in bank-like activities, or with significant links to the banking sector &ndash; and policymakers must do so sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>Speech</h2>
<p>It is a great pleasure to be here today to celebrate Klaas&rsquo;s time as President of De Nederlandsche Bank and Chair of the Financial Stability Board. But more than that, to recognise Klaas as a very good friend and colleague.</p>
<p>Klaas&rsquo;s time as Governor covered most of the period since the financial crisis. But his career goes further back, both at the DNB and the Ministry of Finance here in the Netherlands. He has seen it all, and has been at the heart of rebuilding financial stability. It is I think therefore appropriate to concentrate on the theme of financial stability.</p>
<p>I am going to focus on a number of key questions. What has been achieved in the time since the crisis? What appears to be the challenge today to these achievements? And where do we go from here? There have been times in recent years when we might have treated these questions as matters of more academic speculation, that&rsquo;s not so today. They are real questions up for debate and challenge. I know that Klaas will want to be part of answering them. And Klaas, you need no encouragement from us, please do get stuck in, with your trademark elegance and force, the hallmark of Dutch football that you are such a keen supporter of.</p>
<p>What has been achieved in the field of financial stability since the financial crisis? Answer &ndash; a lot. Yes, today&rsquo;s world is a highly uncertain and unpredictable place sadly. We have experienced very large shocks &ndash; a pandemic, the longest war in Europe since 1945, I could go on.</p>
<p>But we have come through, so far at least, without a crisis of financial stability of the sort that has been seen in the past. Likewise, we have not had a major and lasting recession during these recent shocks.</p>
<p>But, this all reminds us that bad things happen in the world, and they can affect financial stability, this is always possible. That said, we start with a financial system that is much more resilient, which is a much better place to be. We have a banking system that after a long-haul post-crisis appears to be sustainably earning its cost of capital in terms of returns. This is reflected in market pricing, with market price-to-book value more consistently above unity.</p>
<p>Another lens through which to look at this point is to examine arrears and loan losses across the recent period of economic shocks. The evidence points to resilience here &ndash; such losses have been low by historical standards. Of course, this benefits banks and their shareholders, but it also helps consumers as customers and economies generally. Customers get better outcomes and particularly when they avoid having their business closed, losing their job, or having their home repossessed. The benefits of financial stability are real and tangible. Yes, but they may not be perceived as such. One of the challenges of financial stability is that it is a state of being in which success comes when things don&rsquo;t happen, and don&rsquo;t go wrong. It is therefore susceptible to the problem of &ldquo;out of sight, out of mind&rdquo;, in other words under-appreciated.</p>
<p>But, I am conscious that this story alone leaves open the charge that we have achieved the so-called stability of the graveyard. Nothing moves, there are no big dramas, because the system is moribund. Not true, is my response. The financial system has evolved and continues to do so. The record of the last 15 years indicates that the financial system has played its part in supporting economies through a series of severe shocks, and has acted to absorb rather than amplify these shocks. I would emphasise here that financial stability is not an end in itself. Rather, the goal is to support economic activity, a point I will come back to later.</p>
<p>When we look at the developments of the last 15 years or so we should also recognise how the financial system has changed, and it certainly has. I am not going to give an extensive review of the changes, but rather pick out a small number of key points and seek to explain their broader significance.</p>
<p>The first major change that we have seen is a rebalancing of the overall scale of global financial intermediation with an increase in the non-bank sector relative to banks. The non-bank sector is not, of course, homogenous, a point I will come back to. I think it is worth drawing out a number of closely related points that underline this shift in balance between banks and non-banks. The first is one that, I think, was clear during the financial crisis, and provides a backdrop to the changes that were to come. It is that the financial crisis was severely exacerbated by the concentration of assets and exposures on the balance sheets of banks which were too volatile and hard to value in a stress, and thus created too much uncertainty around the stability and ultimately solvency of banks.</p>
<p>One of the eternal questions that gets posed during such a stress is whether for banks it is a solvency or liquidity event. The presumption is that the latter is ok in the sense of manageable while preserving going concern, while the former is not. But the problem is that we only know the answer to this question ex-post. Illiquidity is a symptom which tends to point towards doubt around future solvency, but does not answer the question conclusively, either ex-ante or contemporaneously. The question is better put as whether there is sufficient uncertainty around future solvency to cause stress through illiquidity. The answer to this question in many, if not all, problem cases during the crisis was yes. From that answer, it is a logical step to conclude &ndash; as we did &ndash; that the tools of liquidity assistance available to central banks &ndash; let&rsquo;s call them the traditional Bagehot tools &ndash; should be reinforced and supplemented by tools of resolution, and this rightly became an important part of the post-crisis agenda for national authorities and the FSB, an agenda that Klaas has played a major part in leading.</p>
<p>We have made huge progress on the resolution agenda. Alongside that, we have also made huge progress on the Basel agenda for reforming the prudential regulation of banks. At this point, I must make the - obvious I hope but it has to be made anyway &ndash; comment that we must finish off implementation. Linking this back to the re-balancing of the bank and non-bank financial sectors, these developments help to explain why the re-balance has been a sensible and logical development. It has been a foundation reducing the probability of crisis in the banking system.</p>
<p>But, some of the argument for this was apparent at the time of the crisis, and some was less apparent. I think what has become more obvious over the last 15 years is why this change matters for financial stability, and what it tells us about the future. For me at least, this is where the concept of the singleness of money, and trust in money, comes in, and how it underpins the regulation of banks. Put simply, why were some assets problematic for banks in the crisis, and why did it matter?</p>
<p>The distinctive feature of banks is that their liabilities are typically substantially in the form of money deposits. In the regulatory world, it is deposit taking that is unique to banks. Most of the stock of money in our systems is commercial bank deposits.</p>
<p>These deposits underpin the functions of money &ndash; its role as store of value, unit of account and means of exchange or payment. The critical property of money is trust in its nominal value.</p>
<p>Put simply, a Pound or euro in my account has the same value as a Pound or euro in another account, and thus when we make payments we do not have to worry about variable nominal value. This is a key foundation of financial stability, and thus of public trust. In the crisis it was the uncertainty about the future solvency of banks that undermined this trust and thus ended financial stability itself. The underlying issue here was increasing doubts on whether the liabilities of banks did satisfy the properties of the singleness of money. So, a key objective of the post crisis reforms has been to rebuild confidence in the singleness of, and trust in, money.</p>
<p>However, if I stopped the account here, it would fall into the trap of adapting an old-fashioned view of banks that they are only deposit-takers, and not involved in activities which get loosely called investment banking. In what I regard as one of the best books on financial crises, Gary Gorton described the 2008 crisis in the US as a run on repo, prime broker balances, and asset-backed commercial paper.<sup><sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/october/andrew-bailey-keynote-speech-at-klaas-knott-farewell-symposium#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[1]</a></sup></sup></p>
<p>At first sight, this appears critically to muddy the distinction between banks and non-banks. Can we be confident we know where the boundary lies? The lessons here are that the critical feature of banks is the singleness of money and the public&rsquo;s trust in the assured nominal value of their money. Moreover, since banks are ultimately single entities, their reputation and that trust depends on confidence in their balance sheets as a whole (which is not, of course, to ignore that their capital structures must involve loss-bearing in both going and gone concern states). In other words, we must be very focused on the money system in our economies and its stability.</p>
<p>That said, our economies rely on financial risk taking, and that is essential to support investment and growth. To achieve this, it&rsquo;s crucial in large parts of the non-bank system that there is not assured nominal value for the liabilities so that risky investment proceeds. It is critical that we maintain this distinction between banks and non-banks, and it is well understood by the public.</p>
<p>I will, however, add two important qualifications.</p>
<p>First, banks must of course take risks &ndash; that should not need to be said, but just in case. The point is that the risks must be managed to preserve the assured value of money. Most non-banks do not need to do this. But, second, some non-banks do write liability contracts which contain promises of future value of one sort or another. Insurance is a very good example of this.</p>
<p>My key point here is that over the last fifteen years post crisis, the distinction between banks and non-banks and the importance of the money system has become better understood and defined. It is not new at all, but it has been important to define it under today&rsquo;s conditions. Failure to do so was a major flaw that led to the financial crisis.</p>
<p>There has to be a &ldquo;however&rdquo; though, and this brings in the second of the three big changes in financial intermediation that we have seen since the financial crisis. The &ldquo;however&rdquo; is that it would be a mistake to think that the greater scale of non-bank finance, and the distinction between money and non-money liabilities has led to a comprehensive separation of these two parts of finance. The two are as inter-connected as ever, but in ways that have changed. And, this is absolutely key to understanding financial stability today and the risks to it.</p>
<p>Let me use a prominent example. There has been a major change in the nature of trading in most major government debt markets, resulting in a much expanded non-bank presence and often much more leverage attached to newer trading strategies. But the banking system remains the ultimate source of liquidity for these activities. Banks&rsquo; activities in prime brokerage have expanded substantially and rapidly. The financing is typically secured and margined to protect against risk. Often, this relies on another of the major post-crisis developments, namely the expansion of central clearing.</p>
<p>These developments are consistent with the post-crisis direction of policymaking, to strengthen infrastructures like clearing houses, put them at the heart of the system, and thereby manage and reduce the risk of serious systemic stress which threatens financial stability. There is a good case that these developments have to date worked. However, rather like the overall growth of non-bank finance, we should not be surprised that a stronger infrastructure has led to the growth, for instance, of more leveraged trading activities. Our job as authorities is to understand these developments and assess and if necessary tackle any vulnerabilities that they may give rise to. That&rsquo;s all work that Klaas has led in the FSB, and we are continuing.</p>
<p>I would describe developments such as the growth of leveraged trading as putting the post-crisis financial system to work. We may or may not like all of them, and they give rise to new risks, but we shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised that the system responds and evolves.</p>
<p>Another example of post-crisis developments in non-bank finance is private assets &ndash; private equity and private credit. These may fall into a somewhat different behavioural category, namely there may be aspects of public markets which encourage going private. Our job is to assess the consequences for financial stability purposes. It is not to presume that such developments are per se bad, but rather to ask questions and assess them with rigour and be transparent with our conclusions. In the lead up to the crisis, there was a different culture, more of an absence and at times disapproval of such scrutiny, and the consequences were regrettable.</p>
<p>A third big change in financial intermediation post-crisis that I would highlight is the growth of crypto assets. I&rsquo;m not convinced that the cause of this was a response to post-crisis regulation. It seems to me to be more an outcome of technological advances. But it falls into the category of new areas that require thorough assessment of possible vulnerabilities and their financial stability implications. I don&rsquo;t regard crypto as a homogenous world, and the distinction between investments and money helps with understanding the distinction. Crypto of the Bitcoin variety falls into the risky investment category, whereas stablecoins used for retail and wholesale payments, rather than just to support crypto trading, fall into the money category, or should do. Understanding the implications of this distinction is important for designing the approach to regulation. But, I will go further than that and say it should enable better stablecoins to emerge than would do in a world in which the distinction was not understood and followed up.</p>
<p>This point takes me to the last important theme I want to cover today, and again one that is closely associated with the leadership that Klaas has undertaken.</p>
<p>Today, we face a growing challenge to the post-crisis system of financial regulation. It comes with a number of descriptions and reasons. One is an old point made by Hyman Minksy, that as time passes memories of a financial crisis fade and this leads to a questioning of the continuing need for the responses. This creates the risk of history showing signs of repeating itself, remembering back for instance to the strength of the deregulation argument before the financial crisis. Those of us, like Klaas, who are veterans of dealing with the financial crisis, don&rsquo;t tend to forget, but I can see evidence in today&rsquo;s world of the truth of Minsky&rsquo;s observation.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think the Minsky theory is the end of the story. Another argument made is what gets described as the need for regulatory simplification. I think a reasonable interpretation of this argument is that it is perhaps natural that the response to an event as big as the financial crisis becomes over-complicated, and the passage of time exposes the need to stand back and take a hard look at whether some parts of the response are too complicated, or excessive. There is truth in this, and we should take up the challenge and respond &ndash; and we are doing so. But, again I don&rsquo;t think this is the full story on the reasons for the growing challenge to financial regulation.</p>
<p>A third argument I detect concerns the distributional effects of the regulatory changes, and comes in a few forms. The first is that the response to the financial crisis has changed the financial system and has thereby gone too far to create winners and losers. A second form of this argument is that the post-crisis regulatory system is inflexible and does not allow innovation. These are important arguments about competitiveness that we need to assess carefully. Brushing them off will not do. Again, where there is truth in the argument, we should respond.</p>
<p>The fourth argument I can see in may ways is the most fundamental namely that the regulatory system is impeding growth in economies. This is a very important challenge, for the simple reason that the potential growth rate of many developed economies has slowed markedly since the financial crisis, and particularly the growth of productivity. And since productivity is a main determinant of the growth of living standards, the evidence of a very flat growth in GDP per capita underlines the importance of this point.</p>
<p>So, we have four challenges to the state of financial regulation, all of which amount in different ways to saying that we have overdone it post-crisis. In my remaining time, I probably can&rsquo;t do each or any of them proper justice, but this debate is now so central to what we are doing that it has to be taken on and given due consideration. To remind him again, I hope Klaas will be part of this effort.</p>
<p>I will start with the Minsky passage of time point. First of all, I think Minsky was right, and current events are illustrating his point. As I mentioned earlier, success in financial stability is when nothing happens, and not much has happened relative to the scale and nature of the shocks we have had &ndash; Covid, Ukraine etc. It is convenient to think, nothing has happened, job done with regulation, I rest my case for the benefits. But meanwhile, the argument is growing that since nothing much has happened, we must be overdoing it on regulation.</p>
<p>The answer to all of this is that it rightly pushes us to ground the case for regulation and keep doing so, because &ldquo;out of sight, out of mind&rdquo; does not lead to good long-run outcomes. Moreover, since the world constantly changes, it is a mistake to freeze the regulatory system because it appears to have worked in the recent period of time. Here I think it is important to set out the specific outcomes we seek in the financial system when we say we are aiming for financial stability. What I have in mind here are outcomes as follows: First, we want a system where confidence in banking is maintained in the face of economic shocks and where resolution regimes enable the continuity of financial services if a bank fails. Second, we want to maintain the singleness of money, including where new types of non-bank that have grown up in the crypto world seek to issue money for real-world payments purposed. Third, we want robust market and payments infrastructure that operates without interruption and recovers quickly from rare disruptions. Fourth, we want financing from banks and non-banks to the real economy that is sustainable through the economic cycle and avoids excess supply of debt followed by debt overhang. These are big building block outcomes that we have to articulate, otherwise the debate on regulation is dangerously ungrounded</p>
<p>Let me turn to the second challenge, the point on simplification. Regulation probably does go in cycles, and we should recognise this and respond. Post-crisis it was straightforward to advance a cost-benefit case for increasing regulation, and this happened. By the way, in my experience governments were very much part of this process, it wasn&rsquo;t just central banks and regulators. But pro-cyclical regulation is not a good or stable state of the world, and we should recognise this. There is little doubt that in some areas we collect too much data. There is also a growing risk that because of this, as the pro-cyclical tide turns, we are inhibited from collecting necessary data in new areas of risk. So, we must, and I think are, responding positively to the simplification challenge. Another case of simplification is the adoption of a simpler capital regime for small deposit takers, in the UK the so-called &ldquo;Strong and Simple&rdquo; regime.</p>
<p>The third challenge is the competitiveness one. As I mentioned, this comes in several forms &ndash; you have skewed competitiveness by regulating, and you have prevented innovation by doing so. These are basically the same argument taking on different forms. Here, too, we must respond, and we have to ground the response in the core building block arguments. The danger here, to be frank, is that arguments that are interest based &ndash; and I don&rsquo;t say this in a critical way, it&rsquo;s a matter of fact &ndash; swamp the fundamental ideas based grounding of financial regulation. We have seen this before &ndash; its another form of the Minsky argument. It is the case that post-crisis regulation did intentionally change the competitive balance of banks and non-banks, for the reasons that we had ended up pre-crisis with an unstable and dangerous banking system which had lost the anchor of the singleness of money. That anchor could only be put back in place with massive state intervention at an unacceptable cost to taxpayers.</p>
<p>Today, I would argue that the financial system is not only more stable, but also generally earning returns which meet basic commercial objectives. It is up to firms then to increase their returns further, nothing is wrong with that. But there is a point in the third challenge. We must enable safe innovation and development of the financial system, otherwise competitiveness is an issue and it will undermine achieving the goal of financial stability. This enablement needs however to happen within a system that is grounded in the core ideas and principles. Yes, I&rsquo;m back to points like the singleness of money again.</p>
<p>The fourth challenge, the growth issue, is crucial. We face a huge challenge on this front. However, I push back at the line of argument that post-crisis financial regulation caused the fall in productivity growth, by restricting business investment in the economy. I think it is a rather different line of argument. Big shifts in productivity growth over history have been shaped by advances in so-called general purpose technology &ndash; things like the steam engine, electricity etc. We had such an advance before the financial crisis, through ICT and the internet. Over time, the contribution of these advances to economic growth does run out &ndash; that&rsquo;s as distinct from their contribution to the level of economic activity. I think this is more what we have seen post-crisis, but the timing is coincidentally awkward for separating out causes.</p>
<p>All of that said, we need a financial system that is ready and able to finance the next general purpose technology advance, which I would guess is AI. This is the important question today. In my view this must be a stable financial system, grounded in the core areas and principles of financial stability, but one that must be set up to support growth.</p>
<p>To finish, all of these four challenges have a point to them. We cannot behave as if the case for financial stability can ignore them. That said, if the baby is thrown out with the bath water so to speak, and financial stability is relegated in terms of its importance, we won&rsquo;t achieve our objectives. There is no trade-off between financial stability and objectives like growth and competitiveness.</p>
<p>But nor is our system perfect in every respect and fit for an ever-changing world. Our system must be constantly assessed and adapted as needed. But that process must be grounded in the core principles and ideas of financial stability. Klaas, you have been a leader in ensuring we do this, and I hope and believe you will go on being so.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I would like to thank Nathana&euml;l Benjamin, Sarah Breeden, Karen Jude and Sam Woods for their comments and help in the preparation of this speech.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li><i>Fiserv Small Business Index remains at 148</i></li>
<li><i style="font-family: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">Y</i><i style="font-family: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">ear-over-year sales grew +2.3%</i></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.fiserv.com/" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Fiserv, Inc.</a>&nbsp;(NYSE: FI), a leading global provider of payments and financial services technology, has published the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fiserv.com/en/fiserv-small-business-index.html" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">Fiserv Small Business Index</a>&nbsp;for September 2025, with the seasonally adjusted Index holding steady at 148 for a third consecutive month.</p>
<p>Year-over-year sales (+2.3%) and transactions (+2.3%) grew steadily, and average ticket sizes (+0.1%) increased modestly compared to 2024. Month-over-month sales (+0.1%) and transactions (+0.3%) saw small increases; average ticket sizes fell (-0.2%) slightly compared to August.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pragmatism continued to guide consumer spending in September, with discretionary purchases slowing and the essentials seeing the most growth,&rdquo; said Prasanna Dhore, Chief Data Officer, Fiserv. &ldquo;This continuation of budget-conscious purchasing resulted in slower growth in categories like Arts, Entertainment, Recreation, and Retail, while Professional Services, Healthcare and many other essential industries grew.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Key Takeaways</span></p>
<p><span>Retail grows year-over-year; remains sluggish month to month</span></p>
<p>Small business retail sales grew (+1.6%) year over year, led by Sporting Goods, Hobby, and Miscellaneous Retailers (+5.3%), Furniture and Appliance Retailers (+5.3%) and Clothing, Show and Jewelry Retailers (+5.1%). Yearly growth came despite a slowdown (-0.3%) month over month. Food and Beverage Retailers contributed most significantly to the near-term slowdown, contracting -1.5% month over month. Core Retail (which excludes the volatile categories of Gasoline Stations, Motor Vehicle and Parts Dealers, and Building Materials) faced even stronger headwinds (-0.6%) month-over-month.</p>
<p><span>Consumers continue to be pragmatic with purchases</span></p>
<p>Discretionary spending rose (+1.5%) year-over-year, but Essential sales grew at nearly double the pace (+2.9%). The overall slowdown in momentum across small business sales is evident here as well, with discretionary purchases dropping (-0.1%) month-over-month and essential spending rising modestly (+0.3%).</p>
<p><span>Bars and pubs outperformed full-service and quick-service restaurants in September</span></p>
<p>Restaurant sales grew +1.2% year-over-year and +0.3% month-over-month. The strongest momentum in restaurants was observed at Bars and pubs, which saw an increase in sales (+1.6%) and foot traffic (+1.1%) compared to August. Full-service restaurants experienced much smaller sales growth (+0.3%) month-over-month and a slight increase in foot traffic (+0.2%). Quick-service restaurants saw increased foot traffic (+0.4%) and sales (+0.1%) growth.</p>
<p><span>Services outpaced Goods</span></p>
<p>Year-over-year Services sales showed strong growth (+2.3%) and outpaced the growth of Goods (+1.7%). Compared to August, Services sales grew slightly (+0.2%). Top performing service-based businesses compared to 2024 were Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services (+7.2%), Information (+6.7%) and Healthcare (+3.3%).</p>
<p><span>Ahead of the holiday season, hobby and game stores show positive growth</span></p>
<p>Despite decreased foot traffic (-3.2%) month over month, small business Hobby, Toy, and Game Retailers experienced a healthy sales increase (+2.2%).</p>

<p><span>About the Fiserv Small Business Index<span>&reg;</span></span></p>
<p>The Fiserv Small Business Index is published during the first week of every month and differentiated by its direct aggregation of consumer spending activity within the U.S. small business ecosystem. Rather than relying on survey or sentiment data, the Fiserv Small Business Index is derived from point-of-sale transaction data, including card, cash, and check transactions in-store and online across approximately 2 million U.S. small businesses, including hundreds of thousands leveraging the Clover point-of-sale and business management platform.</p>
<p>Benchmarked to 2019, the Fiserv Small Business Index provides a numeric value measuring consumer spending, with an accompanying transaction index measuring customer traffic. Through a simple interface, users can access data by region, state, and/or across business types categorized by the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). Computing a monthly index for 16 sectors and 34 sub-sectors, the Fiserv Small Business Index provides a timely, reliable, and consistent measure of small business performance even in industries where large businesses dominate.</p>

<p>Ron has served over six years on Court, as Senior Independent Director for three years. He has made a significant contribution and bringing a vital knowledge of technology change and payments.

We wish Ron well for the future and thank him for his service on Court.&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><b>Overview</b></p>
<p>In Q3 2025, LME average daily volume (ADV) was up 3.0% on Q3 2024. Q3 2025 was the LME&rsquo;s sixth highest quarter by ADV in the past 10 years and follows the 10-year high&nbsp;for the market in Q2 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>LME Nickel</b>&nbsp;volume has consolidated its progress, up 30.9% over Q3 2024.&nbsp;<b>LME Lead&nbsp;</b>was up 5.2% on Q3 2024 and&nbsp;<b>LME Tin</b>&nbsp;was up 4.4% over the same period.&nbsp;<b>LME Cobalt</b>&nbsp;has grown significantly for each of the last four quarters and ADV was up from 9 lots in Q3 2024 to 125 lots in Q3 2025 with its highest ever monthly ADV in August.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q3 2025 has also seen the highest level of futures market open interest (MOI) since March 2021.</p>
<p>Matthew Chamberlain, LME CEO, said:</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;While markets have drawn breath following an exceptional second quarter we have continued to see strong volumes at the LME. It has been particularly pleasing to follow the growth of our cobalt contract.</i></p>
<p><i>&ldquo;This quarter has marked the first concrete steps in our work to enhance liquidity on our market with the introduction of TAS contracts. There is more to come in the final three months of the year including the calibration of tick sizes as we prepare for the introduction of block thresholds in Q1 2026. It is an exciting period for the LME and I am grateful to members and clients for their continuing support and readiness to work with us on enhancements that will ultimately deliver even stronger, more liquid markets.&rdquo;</i></p>

<p><span>&ldquo;Self-storage is an interesting combination of consumer and real estate business. We are supported by strong trends.

We are very growth-oriented, and the share issue and listing on First North will greatly promote our goals of growing both organically and through acquisitions. I would like to thank the investors who participated in our IPO. I am especially pleased that so many of our personnel became also owners of Cityvarasto and that so many foreign institutional investors were interested in the IPO and share issue.

<title>Vienna Stock Exchange Q3: Equity Turnover Up, ATX Maintains Strong Momentum</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Geopolitical and trade policy turmoil has caused considerable volatility on international stock markets. On the Vienna Stock Exchange, this resulted in a trading volume of EUR 52.95 billion, with the Austrian leading index ATX hovering near its all-time high. At the beginning of July,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wienerborse.at/en/news/vienna-stock-exchange-news/reploid-group-new-in-direct-market-plus/" target="_blank" title="Opens new window">REPLOID Group AG</a>&nbsp;became the second company after&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wienerborse.at/en/news/vienna-stock-exchange-news/steyr-motors-trading-start/" target="_blank" title="Opens new window">Steyr Motors AG</a>&nbsp;to be listed in the SME segment direct market plus in 2025. The growth trend in debt listings has led to another record year: after just three quarters, 21,719 new bonds were listed &ndash; around 62% more than in the entire previous record year.</p>
<p><a class="has-image" href="https://www.wienerborse.at/uploads/u/cms/images/fotos/presse/infografiken/vienna-stock-exchange-q32025.jpg" target="_blank" title="Opens new window"><img alt="Trading on the Vienna Stock Exchange Q32025" height="326" src="https://www.wienerborse.at/uploads/u/cms/_processed_/4/1/csm_vienna-stock-exchange-q32025_fbda563a46.jpg" title="Trading on the Vienna Stock Exchange Q32025" width="520" /></a></p>
<p>"Austrian stocks remained in demand as part of the brisk market activity. With continued growth in the global market and ETF sector, as well as business development in the debt listing space, we are consistently expanding our offering beyond our core business in Austrian equity trading. In doing so, we are creating added value for investors and issuers alike," says Christoph Boschan, CEO of Wiener B&ouml;rse AG.</p>
<h2>Volatile market conditions lead to high equity turnover</h2>
<p>After an exceptionally strong spring in terms of turnover, which was particularly influenced by US tariff policy, the summer months were somewhat quieter. Still, August was the second-strongest month in the past decade &ndash; surpassed only by August of the previous year. September turnover was also on a par with peak years such as 2021 or 2022. Geopolitical news therefore continues to cause noticeable movement on the markets. Turnover from equity investments amounted to EUR 52.95 billion at the end of the third quarter (+3.8% vs Q1-Q3 2024: EUR 51.01 billion).</p>
<h2>ATX including dividends at new all-time high and with new composition</h2>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wienerborse.at/en/index/atx-tr-AT0000A09FJ6/" target="_blank" title="Opens new window">ATX Total Return</a>, like the German DAX, a performance index including dividends, tops international rankings with its year-to-date gains. On 19 August, the national index reached its all-time high of 11,825.97 points. By 30 September, the Austrian benchmark, including dividends, had risen by 32.45% (ATX without dividends: 26.56%), putting it ahead of the DAX (19.95%), MSCI World (16.15%) and Euro Stoxx 50 (12.95%). Since 22 September, the ATX has also been calculated with a new composition: as part of the semi-annual review, STRABAG SE and PORR AG were newly included, replacing Telekom Austria AG and Mayr-Melnhof Karton AG. As of 30 September, the market capitalisation of all domestic companies listed in Vienna amounted to EUR 160 billion.</p>
<p>"Austrian stocks are in high demand this year, and this trend is far from short-term. Since the start of calculation, the ATX Total Return has delivered an annualised average performance of around 7%, earning its place in the global league. Attractive dividend yields, a strong position in the growth region of Central and Eastern Europe and moderate valuations make Austrian equities a key component of globally balanced portfolios," says Boschan.</p>
<h2>ETF offering more than doubled since the beginning of the year</h2>
<p>Turnover in the international segments of global market and exchange traded funds also developed very positively this year. Both the number of international equities tradable in Vienna at domestic fees and the number of index funds have been expanded several times over the course of the year. Most recently, 50 new ETFs were added to trading on the Vienna Stock Exchange, more than doubling the offering since the start of the year from 137 to 336 funds. The global market grew by around 60 securities this year, with the latest addition being the Swedish payment service provider Klarna. Shares in the medical technology company Ottobock are also set to be offered on the Vienna Stock Exchange, alongside the planned IPO on Deutsche B&ouml;rse. The international segment currently comprises around 900 securities from 28 countries.</p>
<h2>Another record year for debt listings</h2>
<p>The Vienna Stock Exchange has continued its strong growth in debt listings. By the end of the third quarter, 21,719 primary listings were admitted to trading, clearly surpassing the previous record year of 2024 (13,443) several months before the end of 2025. This is the result of the Vienna Stock Exchange's growing global reach, as underscored by listings from China's Alibaba Group and the first Mexican issue by Cobre del Mayo. A total of 1,297 debt issuers from 48 countries are currently served.</p>

<p>To mark Investor Education Month, the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) is publishing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/csa-activities/research/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hybrid DIY Investing: A Research Summary Report</a>. The Report offers a comprehensive examination of hybrid investors in Canada, revealing behaviours, motivations and risk profiles of this investor segment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hybrid investors are those who invest on their own but also have a separate portfolio managed by a financial advisor. Overall, the CSA&rsquo;s research indicates that hybrid investors are younger on average and tend to have a higher risk tolerance than other Canadian investors. However, those with limited engagement with their financial advisor, especially younger investors aged 18 to 34, are more prone to speculative behaviour and are less aware of fraud risks, particularly when relying on self-made or absent financial plans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This study provides a compelling portrait of hybrid investors and underscores the importance of having meaningful discussions with your financial advisor,&rdquo; said Stan Magidson, CSA Chair and Chair and CEO of the Alberta Securities Commission. &ldquo;Regardless of the investing method chosen, it&rsquo;s clear that a comprehensive financial plan that encompasses all of your investment accounts can empower investors to make informed investment decisions aligned to their risk tolerance and goals, while avoiding potentially unsuitable or fraudulent investment opportunities.&rdquo;</p>
<div><strong>Key findings:</strong></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prevalence and demographics:</strong>&nbsp;Approximately one in eight Canadians (12 per cent) are hybrid investors. This group is disproportionately younger, identifies as male, compared to the general investor population, and is more likely to hold a university degree.</li>
<li><strong>Sustained hybrid engagement:&nbsp;</strong>A significant majority (68 per cent) of hybrid investors intend to maintain their dual approach to investing. Among these, 93 per cent express high certainty in their decision, a sentiment echoed in qualitative focus group discussions.</li>
<li><strong>Perceived risk tolerance:&nbsp;</strong>Hybrid investors indicate that they are willing to take on moderate or significant levels of risk with their investments (84 per cent) compared to Canadian investors overall (46 per cent) in a recent 2024 CIRO investor survey.</li>
<li><strong>Speculative investing behaviour:&nbsp;</strong>Those who worked on a financial plan with their advisor tended to engage in less speculative investment behaviour in their DIY account. This included investing in high-risk alternative investments like crypto assets and options, buying and selling investments frequently, and taking on significant risk for the chance of a very large return.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Advisor relationships:&nbsp;</strong>The research found contradictory data with regard to advisor relationships. Survey data suggested that hybrid investors maintain close relationships with their advisors, with many reporting that their advisors are aware of their separate self-directed activities. However, focus group findings indicated a more nuanced reality, with most participants sharing that they had a more transactional and distant relationship with their advisors.</li>
<li><strong>Fraud awareness and prevention:&nbsp;</strong>In focus group discussions, hybrid investors with higher risk tolerance had limited awareness of investment fraud. Those who did articulate a fraud prevention strategy relied on informal or untrustworthy sources and methods, such as online searches and community forums, rather than structured professional advice and institutional safeguards provided by registered advisors.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<title>ISDA derivatiViews: A Path To Greater CFTC-SEC Alignment</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-derivativiews-a-path-to-greater-cftc-sec-alignment-2025102/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-derivativiews-a-path-to-greater-cftc-sec-alignment-2025102/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Earlier this week, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) held a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/meetings-events/sec-cftc-joint-roundtable-sept-29-2025">roundtable on regulatory harmonization</a>&nbsp;&ndash; an initiative we wholeheartedly support. The US regulatory framework has evolved over time to facilitate financial markets that are both vibrant and resilient, but we shouldn&rsquo;t shy away from acknowledging where and how the US regulatory process could be improved.</p>
<p>Both the CFTC and SEC have adapted their respective rulesets over time to reflect critical changes in markets, from the introduction of mandatory central clearing for derivatives to the advent of high-frequency trading. But a cautious approach has slowed market and product evolution. At a time when markets are evolving at a ferocious pace because of technological change, we need to make sure the regulatory process is streamlined and coordinated to avoid gumming up the wheels of finance that are so critical to economic growth. As the roundtable discussion showed, market participants are both capable and willing to work with regulators to support the appropriate evolution of the market by developing trading, risk management and operational solutions required for the future.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to remember that regulators and market participants have a successful history of cooperation on reforms that have delivered safer and more efficient markets &ndash; and ISDA has played an important part in developing legal, operational and risk management solutions to support that on a global scale. This includes delivery of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2016/05/05/isda-launches-resolutionstayjurisdictionalmodularprotocol/">ISDA resolution stay protocols</a>&nbsp;as part of global regulatory bank resolution efforts, implementation of the margining rules for non-cleared derivatives and launch of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/isda-solutions-infohub/isda-simm/">ISDA Standard Initial Margin Model</a>, and development of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/protocol/isda-2021-fallbacks-protocol/">ISDA fallbacks</a>&nbsp;to aid the transition from LIBOR.</p>
<p>There are parts of the current US regulatory framework where similar alignment and coordination are sorely needed. The CFTC and SEC rulebooks can be complex, overlap in certain key areas and are overly reliant on no-action relief. They also contain inconsistencies that mean the regulatory treatment of products and activities with similar risk profiles can differ, depending on whether they fall under the jurisdiction of the CFTC or the SEC.</p>
<p>We would highlight three key areas where greater coordination between the CFTC and SEC is critical and market participants can help to deliver solutions that would increase compliance, cut costs and create a robust collateral infrastructure.</p>
<p>The first is regulatory reporting. It&rsquo;s been more than four years since Archegos Capital Management went bust, leaving its counterparty banks with more than $10 billion in losses. US regulators were largely unaware of the exposures Archegos had been accumulating. While the CFTC introduced its reporting rules in 2012, the SEC regime only came into force a decade later, meaning Archegos did not have an obligation to report its security-based swaps ahead of its collapse.</p>
<p>Both regimes are now in place, which should help avoid gaps in the data going forward. This was helped by cooperation between the two agencies, with the SEC allowing firms to use CFTC reporting processes. But this remains a temporary solution. We urge the SEC to work with the CFTC and the industry to codify this relief into the SEC&rsquo;s permanent ruleset &ndash; a development that would eliminate significant unnecessary complexity and inefficiency for market participants. ISDA plans to add the SEC rules to its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/isda-solutions-infohub/isda-digital-regulatory-reporting/">Digital Regulatory Reporting initiative</a>, which already supports compliance in eight jurisdictions, enabling firms to implement changes to regulatory reporting requirements cost-effectively and accurately.</p>
<p>The agencies should also jointly invest in data curation and analytics capabilities. As a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2023/10/10/hidden-in-plain-sight-derivatives-exposures-regulatory-transparency-and-trade-repositories/">2023 ISDA paper points out</a>, a significant amount of data is available to regulators, but ensuring key information does not remain hidden in plain sight is challenging.</p>
<p>The second issue is Treasury clearing. Ahead of the clearing mandate coming into force from end-2026, clients must be able to realize the benefits of portfolio margining across cleared US Treasury securities and futures. The Fixed Income Clearing Corporation and CME Group are set to propose a client portfolio margining solution, and it&rsquo;s critical the CFTC and SEC act to quickly approve it once they do. This is a no-brainer and essential to make the economics of client clearing work.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t just a CFTC and SEC issue &ndash; US prudential regulators also need to adapt their rules to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2025/09/15/recognition-of-cross-product-netting-is-critical/">recognize the risk-reducing benefits of netting across products</a>, including cleared repos and futures, under the standardized approach to counterparty credit risk.</p>
<p>The third issue is market liquidity and collateral infrastructure. According to the latest&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2025/05/14/isda-margin-survey-year-end-2024/">ISDA margin survey</a>, initial margin and variation margin collected by leading derivatives market participants for their non-cleared derivatives exposures increased by 6.4% to $1.5 trillion at the end of 2024. While margin requirements have helped to provide protection against counterparty credit risk, we must recognize that the financial system has become more prone to liquidity crunches during periods of stress.</p>
<p>At a time when some markets are moving to 24/7 trading, we need 24/7 risk management.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2025/09/30/working-towards-tokenized-collateral/">Tokenization could alleviate some of the liquidity and workflow challenges</a>&nbsp;by expanding the types of usable collateral to a wider range of assets, including money market funds and other tokenized cash and securities. The industry is primed to transform the collateral ecosystem to make it more automated and efficient by leveraging blockchain and tokenized solutions. It&rsquo;s time the CFTC, SEC and market participants work together to upgrade this critical infrastructure underpinning our financial system.</p>
<p>We hope this week&rsquo;s CFTC-SEC roundtable is just the start of greater coordination between the agencies and market participants to swiftly address the old regulations that aren&rsquo;t fit for purpose and address the evolution of products, participants and infrastructures. Working together and tackling these issues will reduce unnecessary regulatory burdens, open a path to greater innovation and improve the competition and efficiency of US financial markets.</p>

<ul>
<li>Basel Committee approves annual assessment exercise for global systemically important banks.</li>
<li>Enhances clarity of its grading system for jurisdictional assessments.</li>
<li>Discusses implementation status of margin requirements for non-centrally cleared derivatives.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision met virtually on 2 October 2025 to discuss a range of initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>Global systemically important banks</strong></p>
<p>The Committee approved the results of the end-2024 assessment exercise for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). The results will be submitted to the Financial Stability Board before it publishes the 2025 list of G-SIBs.</p>
<p><strong>Implementation</strong></p>
<p>The Committee discussed the grading used for its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/implementation/rcap_jurisdictional.htm"><span class="firstword">jurisdictional</span>&nbsp;assessments</a>, which are a key element of its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/implementation/rcap_role.htm"><span class="firstword">Regulatory</span>&nbsp;Consistency Assessment Programme</a>&nbsp;(RCAP). Jurisdictional assessments review the extent to which domestic regulations in each member jurisdiction are aligned with the minimum regulatory standards agreed by the Committee.</p>
<p>The jurisdictional assessment reports have used four terms to grade the overall level of compliance with the assessed standards (in descending order): compliant, largely compliant, materially non-compliant, and non-compliant. To enhance the clarity of the rank ordering of the jurisdictional assessment grades, the Committee agreed to change the name of the third grade from "materially non-compliant" to "partially non-compliant".</p>
<p>Separately, the Committee approved a finalised technical amendment on the hedging of counterparty credit risk exposures, following a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d584.htm"><span class="firstword">consultation</span>&nbsp;</a>last year. The technical amendment will be published later this month.</p>
<p><strong>Margining</strong></p>
<p>The Committee discussed a report on the implementation of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d499.pdf"><span class="firstword">margin</span>&nbsp;requirements</a>&nbsp;for non-centrally cleared derivatives, developed jointly with the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO). The report finds that implementation of the framework has made the financial system more resilient and that there is no evidence of material issues with the implementation of the framework.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>Background:&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>The Basel Committee is the primary global standard setter for the prudential regulation of banks and provides a forum for cooperation on banking supervisory matters. Its mandate is to strengthen the regulation, supervision and practices of banks worldwide with the purpose of enhancing financial stability. The Committee reports to the Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision and seeks its endorsement for major decisions. The Committee has no formal supranational authority, and its decisions have no legal force. Rather, the Committee relies on its members' commitments to achieve its mandate. The Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision is chaired by Tiff Macklem, Governor of the Bank of Canada. The Basel Committee is chaired by Erik Thed&eacute;en, Governor of Sveriges Riksbank.&nbsp;</em></p>

<title>Euronext Reaffirms Its Support For European Strategic Autonomy By Signing Partnerships With National Military Reserves</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Euronext reaffirms its support for European strategic autonomy by signing partnerships with national military reserves</span></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<h5>On 1 October 2025, Euronext signed a partnership with the French military reserve, the Garde nationale</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>On 19 September 2025, Euronext signed a partnership with the Danish military reserve, InterForce Danmark</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>More partnerships will be signed in the coming months with local military reserves in Europe</h5>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Euronext, the leading European capital market infrastructure, reaffirms its commitment to European resilience and strategic autonomy with the signature of new partnerships with national military reserves in Denmark and France. Additional agreements with local military reserves will be signed in the coming months.</p>
<p>These partnerships extend the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=kqTRr9CVRRlF10OaCxFHPAUpm9DuFXgzE2T4Vm7VHIshyUXgW-krO8E_YZq685XwNMMFklnvPpmzfPi09628Ugv6chdwXNM_iIkEv_MXED42cEeqZcX60pliCVzDKWXKUjNGu3LuFgBzAAsPzjb66rvr84ift9-sBeGaMH_EioNPpavgq3FJFKvUD0up9M83sohAplFpC3xiimBshzZOsec10Vm3UnjPAbwmvWH6oovtpKCeaNnz5HQQXvbHmirkByFxzXM-L_zuTtWRVKqm1QAQh2lxP5aTCP29TdTZvUY=" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="initiatives related to Energy, Security and Geostrategy, the &ldquo;New ESG&rdquo;">initiatives related to Energy, Security and Geostrategy, the &ldquo;New ESG&rdquo;</a>, launched by Euronext on 6 May 2025 to strengthen European strategic autonomy. This set of initiatives led by Euronext enhances the visibility of European companies operating in strategic sectors and provides them with unprecedented tools to meet their financing needs through improved access to capital. These solutions also address the growing demand from asset managers, institutional and retail investors to obtain better exposure to high-growth segments through thematic indices.</p>
<p>As European strategic autonomy and independence rely on the ability of European citizens to take part in their country&rsquo;s own defence ecosystem, Euronext has created a support framework for its employees who are already engaged in a reservist commitment, or who wish to take up this opportunity. As of 6 May 2025, Euronext guarantees the continuation of salary and social benefits for preliminary training periods of up to 15 days for all new reservists, and up to 10 days per year for all Euronext employees engaged in a reservist commitment across all the group&rsquo;s European locations. In countries where a more beneficial local reservist support system exists, the existing framework prevails.</p>
<p>To formalise this engagement, Euronext is signing partnerships with national military reserves.</p>
<p>In Paris, Euronext signed a partnership with the French military reserve, the Garde nationale, on 1 October 2025. General Fran&ccedil;ois-Xavier Poisbeau, General Secretary of the French National Guard (Garde nationale), presented the main aspects of the partnership, while Baptiste Mercier, Head of Operational Performance at Allianz France, and Coralie Lecouffe, Senior Consultant at Capgemini Invent, shared personal experiences from their engagement as operational reservists.</p>
<p>In Copenhagen, Euronext signed a partnership with the Danish military reserve, InterForce Danmark, on 19 September 2025. Local employees had the opportunity to meet with members of the reservist forces, who shared insights about their experience and highlighted how military reservists support Denmark&rsquo;s resilience in the long term.</p>
<p>More partnerships will be signed in the coming months with local military reserve forces from European countries.</p>
<p><span>St&eacute;phane Boujnah, CEO and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext, said:</span>&nbsp;<em>"Through these partnerships, Euronext reinforces its commitment to strengthen European resilience and strategic autonomy, at a time of rising geopolitical tensions. I am deeply proud of this citizen engagement that enables our colleagues to put their skills and abilities to the service of their countries. I want to thank InterForce Danmark and the Garde nationale in France for their support, and the valuable insights they shared. Within the coming weeks and months, Euronext will sign similar partnership agreements with military reserve forces in European countries where we operate. These initiatives demonstrate the power of cross-border collaboration and highlight Euronext&rsquo;s role as a unifying force in Europe&rsquo;s capital markets, fostering both national and continental strength.&rdquo;</em></p>
