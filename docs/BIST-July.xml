<div> Fed Listens, Event, Monetary policy, Chicago, Economic conditions
Summary:<br />
Fed Listens event in Chicago to discuss economic conditions, childcare, and employment. Panelists and audience provide insights to inform policymaking. <div>
<p>Thank you, Austan, for the warm welcome. It is really a pleasure to join you in Chicago for this year's&nbsp;<em>Fed Listens</em>&nbsp;event.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240710a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;When we started&nbsp;<em>Fed Listens</em>&nbsp;back in 2019, the initiative was part of a broad, comprehensive review of the decisionmaking framework we use to pursue our monetary policy goals of maximum employment and price stability. In the years that followed, we have met with people from across the country and from a wide variety of backgrounds and experiences to learn about how the economy has been recovering from the COVID experience.</p>
<p>Each&nbsp;<em>Fed Listens</em>&nbsp;event created a wonderful opportunity to take a step back, to ask questions of those who are directly impacted by our policies and the prevailing economic conditions, and then really&nbsp;<em>listen&nbsp;</em>to their feedback. I am extremely proud that&nbsp;<em>Fed Listens</em>&nbsp;has grown and developed into an ongoing venue for the Federal Reserve Board and the Reserve Banks to foster an ongoing conversation and discussion with those who are directly experiencing current economic conditions.</p>
<p>As many of you may recall, at last year's&nbsp;<em>Fed Listens&nbsp;</em>event here in Chicago, we discussed youth employment and joining the labor force following the pandemic, which were especially inspiring. So, in that spirit, today is not only a wonderful opportunity to continue this important conversation in the Seventh District, but also an opportunity to dig deeper into issues that affect local families through the childcare industry, working parents, and employers.</p>
<p>Austan and I enjoyed getting to know our panelists better earlier today, and I am looking forward to learning more about their experiences through the upcoming panels and discussions. I am also very pleased to welcome our audience&mdash;both in person and those tuning in online. I view&nbsp;<em>Fed Listens</em>&nbsp;as an excellent example of Board and System convenings that enable us to gain important insights about economic conditions by engaging directly with those experiencing the economy.</p>
<p>As you all know, Fed officials and economists review a vast amount of economic data on a regular basis. Discussions like those we will engage in today provide color and context to supplement the other economic data we monitor. Your perspectives help us gain deeper insights into how we are meeting our dual mandate of maintaining maximum employment and stable prices.</p>
<p>A better understanding of a wide variety of this type of data, from the considerations families face in making spending decisions (including the costs of childcare) to factors weighed by business owners in applying for loans and offering benefits to help attract top talent, all provide better insight into our data collection. These conversations help us to gain perspective on how Americans in different areas of the country are faring. Some of the issues discussed today may be unique to the Seventh District, but certainly many of these themes and dynamics are present throughout the country and across all 12 Federal Reserve Districts. Seeking out local perspectives is one of the great advantages of the Federal Reserve System's regional structure and of the&nbsp;<em>Fed Listens&nbsp;</em>structure in particular.</p>
<p>Earlier, I had the pleasure to meet each of the panelists you'll hear from today. Their varied experiences and backgrounds across sectors lay an important foundation for today's discussion. We hope that our attendees will also join in to share your own observations as you experience these issues in your own lives, businesses, and communities. Your perspective will help to inform our work as policymakers with the responsibility to promote a strong and vibrant economy for all Americans.</p>
<p>So with that, I would like to say, thank you again, Austan, and especially to recognize your entire Chicago Fed team for hosting this&nbsp;<em>Fed Listens</em>&nbsp;event today and for the opportunity to be part of this discussion.</p>
<p>Without further ado, I am delighted to get our conversation started by turning things over to Robin Newberger, who is a policy advisor here at the Chicago Fed.</p>

<div> Securities, Enforcement Division, Crypto, Fraud, Investor harm
Summary:
Gurbir S. Grewal, the director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, delivered a speech at a symposium on regulating finance in the changing administrative state, addressing the application of securities laws to crypto asset securities, investor harm, compliance, and public trust. He discussed the history of the securities laws and the need to differentiate between the substance and form of transactions in applying these laws. Grewal also emphasized the need for robust enforcement to protect investors and enhance public trust. In the epilogue, Grewal provided an update on recent developments in crypto markets, including the increase in investor complaints, the decline in public trust, and the SEC's continued efforts to address noncompliance and protect investors. <div>
<p class="text-align-center">Prologue<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">*</a></p>
<p>What follows is a speech I delivered at the William &amp; Mary Business Law Review&rsquo;s Third Annual Symposium entitled &ldquo;Regulating Finance in a Changing Administrative State&rdquo; on April 1, 2023. Since then, there have been many developments in the world of crypto asset securities, some of which I address in an epilogue to the speech, below.</p>
<p>Table of Contents</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>I. Everything &ldquo;New&rdquo; is Old&mdash;Really Old&mdash;and Well-Established</p>
<p>II. Investors in Crypto Asset Securities Are Being Harmed as We Speak</p>
<p>III. Innovation and Compliance Are Not Incompatible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>IV. Public Trust Requires Robust Enforcement of the Securities Laws.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Epilogue</p>
<p class="text-align-center"><a id="intro"></a>Introduction</p>
<p>Thank you to the&nbsp;<i>William &amp; Mary Business Law Review</i>&nbsp;for hosting this symposium and for inviting me to participate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thrilled to be back at my law school alma mater. This is a special place &ndash; one that not only helped me hone my legal skills, but also one that helped mold me into a &ldquo;citizen lawyer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For me, it was my experience with the late Professor John Levy and participating in the legal aid clinic that he ran that first showed me how we can use our law degrees to not only protect, but also to uplift others. It&rsquo;s an experience that has helped shape my entire public service journey.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m grateful that the law school continues to train excellent citizen lawyers&mdash;a number of whom I&rsquo;ve had the privilege of working with during my time as New Jersey Attorney General and now at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (&ldquo;SEC&rdquo;).</p>
<p>I am equally grateful that in developing the next generation of citizen lawyers the law school is emphasizing inclusion &ndash; a core value that has guided much of my work.</p>
<p class="text-align-center">* * *</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s topic &ndash; &ldquo;Regulating Finance in a Changing Administrative State&rdquo; &ndash; is no doubt a timely one, but also one that could easily serve as my job description. And the panels you&rsquo;ve organized touch on nearly every aspect of our work in the Enforcement Division.</p>
<p>So naturally, I have many thoughts I would like to share with you, but before I do, I must make clear that my remarks today are in my official capacity as the Director of the Division of Enforcement, but do not necessarily reflect the views of the Commission, the Commissioners, or other members of the staff.</p>
<p>Perhaps I should also add to that disclaimer that the views I plan to share this morning may not be the most popular you will hear today. I think that is because the theme underlying this symposium is a concept that I not only disagree with, but is also one that is frequently advanced in some corners&mdash;that technological innovations have so dramatically transformed the financial markets since the 1930s, when Congress first passed the federal securities laws and created the SEC to enforce them,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[1]</a>&nbsp;that those laws are now somehow ill-suited to regulate our financial markets, especially when it comes to crypto assets.</p>
<p>Some of our critics&mdash;perhaps a number of you&mdash;argue, instead, that new, bespoke rules and regulations are needed for this particular industry. They believe that this is best achieved either through notice and comment agency rulemaking or by Congress developing an entirely new regulatory framework for crypto assets.</p>
<p>At the same time, a number of defendants are using newly crafted legal concepts like the &ldquo;major questions doctrine,&rdquo; to challenge certain SEC enforcement actions as being beyond the authorities Congress delegated to the SEC.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[2]</a></p>
<p>You will no doubt discuss all of these issues and more throughout the day, but in many cases you will do so in the abstract. What I would like to do this morning is provide you with some context because the securities laws are anything but abstract to the millions of investors that are harmed when promoters of securities, including crypto asset securities, and others engage in fraudulent activity or otherwise violate our rules and regulations.</p>
<p class="text-align-center"><a id="everything"></a>I. Everything &ldquo;New&rdquo; is Old&mdash;Really Old&mdash;and Well-Established</p>
<p>The history of our securities laws makes clear that Congress always intended the definition of what is a security to be principles-based and flexible to cover the many kinds of schemes where promoters seek others&rsquo; money and promise profits in return.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[3]</a></p>
<p>Following the stock market crash of 1929, in the midst of the Great Depression and during a period of grave economic crisis, there was a general loss of trust in our financial markets. In response, Congress passed the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which created the SEC, to protect investors and the markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[4]</a></p>
<p>A key feature of the Securities Act was to require companies offering &ldquo;securities&rdquo; and raising money from the public to register their offerings with the SEC and to provide investors full, fair, and truthful disclosures of material information about their offerings, their financial health, and their executives.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[5]</a>&nbsp;The Act defined &ldquo;securities&rdquo; broadly to include various kinds of investments, including what it called an &ldquo;investment contract.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[6]</a></p>
<p>No sooner was the Act passed than companies began arguing that whatever they were doing did not constitute the offer and sale of securities and, therefore, they did not need to comply with the law&rsquo;s registration requirements. To support their positions, the companies often focused on the name or form of the product or transaction, not its substance. They argued that because their form of offering was not specifically enumerated by statute, it did not need to be registered.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[7]</a></p>
<p>Sound familiar?</p>
<p>And as happens today, back then the SEC sued to stop ongoing unregistered securities offerings. Time and again, federal courts focused on the economic reality of the transactions at issue and the broad investor protections Congress intended to advance in enacting the federal securities laws.</p>
<p>And time and again, those courts determined that the transactions at issue&mdash;ranging from investment opportunities in oil barrels to fishing boats to silver foxes&mdash;did in fact constitute the offer or sale of securities.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[8]</a><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>And then in 1946, the Supreme Court issued its seminal opinion in&nbsp;<i>SEC v. Howey</i>, setting forth the test for what constitutes an &ldquo;investment contract,&rdquo; and therefore a security, for purposes of the federal securities laws.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[9]</a>&nbsp;The Court explained that Congress intended &ldquo;investment contract&rdquo; to apply broadly to a variety of situations in which individuals invested money in a common enterprise with the expectation that they would earn a profit through the efforts of others.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[10]</a>&nbsp;This approach &ldquo;embodie[d] a flexible rather than a static principle, one that is capable of adaptation to meet the countless and variable schemes devised by those who seek the use of the money of others on the promise of profits.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[11]</a></p>
<p>And&nbsp;<i>Howey&nbsp;</i>has proven to be a remarkably flexible and resilient test that courts have since applied to find a wide variety of offerings to be investment contracts and, thus, securities. The list includes offerings related to whiskey, cosmetics, self-improvement courses, and pay phones,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[12]</a>&nbsp;as well as a surprising number of creatures: earthworms, beavers, chinchillas, and even cattle embryos.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[13]</a></p>
<p>Notably, none of these offerings involved stocks or bonds or the kinds of investments you or I might have in our portfolios. And that&rsquo;s really the point of&nbsp;<i>Howey</i>: whether something is a security depends on the&nbsp;<i>substance</i>&nbsp;of the transaction &ndash; not its name, not its form, and not its underlying technology.</p>
<p>As Justice Thurgood Marshall put it decades later, &ldquo;Congress painted with a broad brush,&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[14]</a>&nbsp;and its &ldquo;purpose in enacting the securities laws was to regulate investments, in whatever form they are made and by whatever name they are called.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[15]</a></p>
<p>Critics who now dismiss&nbsp;<i>Howey&nbsp;</i>as outdated because it involved orange groves nearly 80 years ago and demand a new regulatory regime overlook this history and, I think, completely miss the point: the definition of a security is, and has always been, principles-based to allow for the flexibility that comes with innovative investment products, technology-driven or otherwise.</p>
<p class="text-align-center"><a id="investors"></a>II. Investors in Crypto Asset Securities Are Being Harmed as We Speak</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, the &ldquo;major question&rdquo; for us is: are investors being hurt within our remit? If the answer is yes, then we must act, and we must do so with a sense of urgency. And increasingly, the answer to that question has been yes.</p>
<p>The current turmoil in the crypto markets is taking a real toll on everyday Americans. According to one survey, approximately 16% of U.S. adults have invested, traded, or used crypto, and among that group approximately 46% report their investments have done worse than they expected.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[16]</a>&nbsp;While some of this may be the result of natural market forces, some of it is certainly due to fraud and other unlawful activity.</p>
<p>Let me give you an overview of the type of activity we are encountering because it&rsquo;s quite often left out of conversations like the ones you will have at this conference. To date, the SEC has charged many issuers with failing to register initial coin offerings, as well as their offerings of so-called lend, earn, and staking products, meaning that the offerings lacked required disclosures &ndash; disclosures that ensure that investors can make informed investment decisions.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[17]</a></p>
<p>The SEC has also alleged in a number of our actions that certain unregistered crypto offerings are nothing but straight rips, Ponzi schemes, affinity frauds, or other types of scams.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[18]</a></p>
<p>In the actions the SEC has recently brought in this space, our allegations have described, among other things:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Body">Products labeled as &ldquo;defi&rdquo; offerings that are neither decentralized, nor finance, but rather frauds;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[19]</a></li>
<li class="Body">Stablecoins that are neither stable, nor coins, but rather fraudulent;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[20]</a></li>
<li class="Body">So-called &ldquo;trusted&rdquo; protocols and &ldquo;smart contracts&rdquo; that, despite representations to the contrary, can be, and are, used to manipulate the market for crypto asset securities;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[21]</a></li>
<li class="Body">Platforms, protocols, and exchanges that fail to provide any details about their cybersecurity risks subjected to malicious attacks that result in investor harm;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[22]</a>&nbsp;and</li>
<li class="Body">In the end, investors, large and small, defrauded, and billions in customer assets misused or stolen.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[23]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of these alleged schemes have resulted in lines of investor victims at the doors of bankruptcy courts hoping to recover a fraction of their hard-earned money.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[24]</a></p>
<p>And just this week, the SEC alleged that a noncompliant crypto intermediary simultaneously acted as exchange, broker, and clearing agency without registering with the SEC&mdash;thereby putting investors at risk from conflicts of interest and inadequate oversight.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[25]</a></p>
<p>So, while we can appreciate the innovation around, and the technological advancements of, blockchain and distributed ledger technology, we must also be cognizant of the risks and harms to investors associated with the related products and offerings. As in any other space, we have a duty to analyze whether the activity is subject to the federal securities laws and, if so, whether those laws have been violated.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s precisely what we have done. Over the last decade, based on Enforcement Division investigations and recommendations, the SEC has brought well over 100 crypto-related actions involving unlawful activity across the crypto markets as I have just outlined.</p>
<p>And in every case, where federal courts have had to determine whether there were &ldquo;securities&rdquo; at issue, the courts have applied the&nbsp;<i>Howey</i>&nbsp;test&mdash;looked at the economic realities of the offerings, and, even though the offerings at issue involved supposedly novel technologies, rejected defense arguments that they were not securities.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[26]</a></p>
<p>During this same period, the SEC has spoken clearly and consistently about the applicability of the securities laws in the crypto space, citing decades of Supreme Court precedent explaining the test for determining whether something is an &ldquo;investment contract,&rdquo; and thus a security.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[27]</a></p>
<p>To put it bluntly, there is not a lawyer or market participant in this area that does not know the applicable regulatory framework and tests. As Chair Gensler has stated, &ldquo;Not liking the message isn&rsquo;t the same thing as not receiving it.&rdquo;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29">[28]</a>&nbsp;That is also likely why courts have rejected &ldquo;fair notice&rdquo; and due process arguments in a number of these actions.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30">[29]</a></p>
<p class="text-align-center"><a id="innovation"></a>III. Innovation and Compliance Are Not Incompatible</p>
<p>I would like to turn now to another topic that also sometimes gets lost in the headlines, and that is the importance of compliance in the crypto markets.</p>
<p>First, when issuers of crypto asset securities do not comply with registration requirements, investors and analysts do not get mandatory disclosures about the issuer, their offerings, and their financial condition. Investors cannot make informed investment decisions without that information. Disclosures that are especially important in a market of thousands of different offerings involving technology that most laypeople do not understand.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31">[30]</a></p>
<p>Second, in a compliant securities market, separate functions generally are performed by different legal entities, each of which are subject to separate regulations that protect investors. This creates separation and even a healthy degree of antagonism between the functions: brokers do not want to execute their clients&rsquo; trades on questionable exchanges, and exchanges do not want to work with unreliable clearing agencies. Importantly, national securities exchanges do not take custody of assets that trade on the exchange and thus do not have the ability to lend them out or use them to make risky bets.</p>
<p>In contrast, in the crypto world sometimes these functions collapse under one roof, as we alleged just this week with respect to the Beaxy exchange.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32">[31]</a>&nbsp;This aggregation of functions creates significant conflicts of interest and exponentially increases risk of investor harm as we saw with the collapse of FTX, where we allege that Sam Bankman-Fried and others not only fraudulently raised billions of dollars from investors in FTX, but also misused billions in funds belonging to FTX&rsquo;s trading customers.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33">[32]</a></p>
<p>Finally, in a compliant securities market, the firms fulfilling these various functions, such as exchanges, broker-dealers, and clearinghouses, are subject to supervision, oversight, and examination by the SEC.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34">[33]</a>&nbsp;Among other things, they are required to maintain books and records and make them available to the SEC, and they are required to have internal controls.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35">[34]</a>&nbsp;This all provides additional, essential layers of protection for investors.</p>
<p>The quarrel, therefore, is with noncompliant actors, not the technology or its promises. The technology is actually beside the point. We have to regulate markets and protect investors based on current realities and existing risks. There are no exceptions to the application of the federal securities laws based on the future potential or benefits that an offering may provide.</p>
<p>Moreover, innovation and compliance with the securities laws are not mutually exclusive. As Chair Gensler has repeatedly stated, the SEC staff stand ready to work with crypto entrepreneurs and understand the need to be flexible in applying our disclosure requirements.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36">[35]</a></p>
<p class="text-align-center"><a id="public"></a>IV. Public Trust Requires Robust Enforcement of the Securities Laws</p>
<p>I would like to finish by touching on a topic that&rsquo;s important to this conversation and a bit personal for me: public trust.</p>
<p>In my early speeches as Enforcement Director, I spoke about the declining trust in our financial institutions and markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37">[36]</a>&nbsp;While there is no single cause for this decline, it is in part due to the perception that we&mdash;the regulators&mdash;are failing to hold bad actors accountable, coupled with the belief that there are two sets of rules: one for the big and powerful and another for everyone else.</p>
<p>None of this is abstract either. I&rsquo;ve seen it firsthand as a federal, county, and state prosecutor. I saw it firsthand speaking to victims as my state&rsquo;s attorney general, and I see it now in this role. And the effects of this diminished trust can be especially pronounced among minority and marginalized communities.</p>
<p>For example, studies show that a majority of Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, and LGBTQ Americans feel that traditional financial institutions &ldquo;are not meant for people like me.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38">[37]</a>&nbsp;Due to historical injustices and negative experiences, many members of these communities may also have skepticism, or outright hostility, towards the government.</p>
<p>This lack of trust can lead to further victimization. I&rsquo;ve seen this with certain types of affinity frauds, especially among immigrant communities, where the perpetrator may appeal to the victims&rsquo; closeness to their own community and potentially their suspicion of outsiders.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39">[38]</a></p>
<p>Not infrequently, we encounter suspicion so strong that the victims are reluctant to cooperate with us or believe our allegations even in the face of overwhelming evidence of the fraud.</p>
<p>And through these experiences, I have developed a playbook, one that we are employing at the Enforcement Division, to protect investors and reclaim and enhance public trust. It&rsquo;s built on three principles:&nbsp;<span><i>robust enforcement</i></span>&nbsp;&ndash; moving our investigations with a sense of urgency and addressing emerging risks;&nbsp;<span><i>robust remedies</i></span>&nbsp;&ndash; seeking penalties and remedies at levels adequate to both hold bad actors accountable and deter misconduct; and&nbsp;<span><i>robust compliance &shy;&shy;</i>&shy;&shy;&ndash;&nbsp;</span>working with market participants and gatekeepers to create a culture of compliance and cooperation to prevent misconduct.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40">[39]</a></p>
<p>Another response to this decline in trust has been the &ldquo;predatory inclusion&rdquo; tactics of crypto entities directed at Black, brown, and other marginalized communities.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41">[40]</a>&nbsp;Here, I&rsquo;m talking about the familiar (but so far unsupported) narratives that crypto will be predicated on a permissionless and trustless environment; that it will increase financial inclusion;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42">[41]</a>&nbsp;that it will uplift the unbanked or underbanked; that it will help them build wealth and increase upward mobility; and that if you &ldquo;step right up, everyone&rsquo;s a winner.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43">[42]</a></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also seen predatory tactics on full display in case after case, where the SEC has alleged that &ldquo;influencers&rdquo; are touting unregistered offerings to investors without disclosing that they are being compensated to do so.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44">[43]</a>&nbsp;We allege they do so by lying about their returns from their own, in some cases fictional, crypto investments, and without disclosing they are being paid tens of thousands of dollars for their tweets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45">[44]</a></p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s the direct result of these efforts or for other reasons beyond the scope of this presentation, crypto assets are the only major financial products that Black Americans are more likely to own than white Americans.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46">[45]</a>&nbsp;And there is some evidence that Black and brown investors have now been disproportionately harmed during the downturn of crypto markets over the last two years.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47">[46]</a></p>
<p>But despite such losses in the crypto industry, distrust in the traditional financial system is still driving investors towards crypto. We saw that just a few weeks ago when the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and questions about the stability of the wider banking system pushed increased interest in crypto assets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48">[47]</a></p>
<p>In some ways, we are now at the intersection of the two responses to addressing diminished public trust I just outlined. People who looked to crypto as a refuge from the ills of traditional finance are now experiencing those same ills in the crypto markets. They are being harmed by the very types of behavior that led Congress to create the securities laws in the first place&mdash;the same behaviors that have led to reduced trust in the markets: misstatements or misleading disclosures, conflicts of interest, and insiders abusing their positions for personal advantages at the expense of ordinary investors.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49">[48]</a></p>
<p>I believe that in this moment, we have to leverage the playbook I described. We must act with all the tools at our disposal to protect investors and enhance public trust and confidence in our markets.</p>
<p>This means continuing to get behind the labels, focusing on substance over form, ensuring that actors comply with the securities laws, and holding those that do not accountable, without fear or favor.</p>
<p class="text-align-center"><a id="conclusion"></a>Conclusion</p>
<p>In the end, I believe that it should be against this backdrop of real investor harm, precedent, and the need to enhance public trust and confidence in our markets, that you consider the familiar industry talking points (or tweets in this day and age), that I&rsquo;m certain you&rsquo;ll hear (or reference) throughout the day&mdash;that according to some we are exceeding our authority, regulating by enforcement, stifling innovation, and driving it overseas.</p>
<p>As long as investors in securities are being harmed now, we must act now.</p>
<p>Thank you again to the&nbsp;<i>William &amp; Mary Business Law Review</i>&nbsp;for inviting me to speak to you today. I am privileged to have had this opportunity and I hope that you have a great, contextualized discussion today.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p class="text-align-center"><a id="epilogue"></a>Epilogue</p>
<p>By the time I became Enforcement Director in July 2021, the SEC had already brought dozens of enforcement actions to address widespread noncompliance in the crypto markets. But, noncompliance, and the attendant investor risk, remained pervasive. Meanwhile, four months later, the combined market capitalization of crypto assets reached approximately $3 trillion.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50">[49]</a>&nbsp;This marked a 15-fold increase from just two years earlier.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51">[50]</a>&nbsp;Soon after, however, the crypto market cratered, abetted by a series of high-profile failures and bankruptcies of major firms that caused extensive investor losses.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52">[51]</a>&nbsp;It lost two-thirds of its market capitalization in just nine months, shedding value even quicker than it had gained it.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53">[52]</a><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>In short, my tenure as Director has coincided with extreme volatility and investor risk in the crypto markets. This has been vividly demonstrated by the dramatic increase in the number of complaints about crypto that investors submitted to the SEC&rsquo;s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy (&ldquo;OIEA&rdquo;), from 820 in fiscal year 2019,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54">[53]</a>&nbsp;the first year that OIEA&rsquo;s annual list of Top Ten Categories of Complaints included crypto, to 5,357 in fiscal year 2023.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55">[54]</a></p>
<p>In response to this upheaval and rampant noncompliance, we have redoubled our enforcement efforts, some of which I was privileged to highlight in my speech at William &amp; Mary. Perhaps unsurprisingly, there have been even more developments in the crypto markets since those remarks. Just days later, the Pew Research Center released a survey finding that nearly a third of Americans who had ever invested in, traded, or used crypto, no longer held any.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56">[55]</a>&nbsp;The number of lower-income Americans who had gotten out of crypto was even higher, at 43%,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57">[56]</a>&nbsp;providing another vivid rejoinder to the narrative that crypto will uplift the unbanked, help them build wealth, and increase upward mobility.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58">[57]</a></p>
<p>The same survey found that a whopping three-quarters of Americans who have heard about crypto do not believe that crypto is reliable and safe.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59">[58]</a>&nbsp;Given the continued noncompliance in this space, they have good reasons to be concerned. For example, in June 2023, the SEC charged the operators of the largest crypto asset trading platform in the world with allegedly combining the functions of an exchange, broker, dealer, and clearing agency without complying with the registration provisions of the federal securities laws applicable to any of those functions, depriving investors of crucial investor protections.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60">[59]</a>&nbsp;The SEC&rsquo;s complaint also alleged that the operators commingled certain customer assets and attempted to evade U.S. securities laws by announcing sham controls that they disregarded so that they could keep high-value U.S. customers on their platforms.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61">[60]</a></p>
<p>The next day, the SEC also charged the operator of the largest crypto asset trading platform in the United States with intertwining the traditional services of an exchange, broker, and clearing agency without complying with the registration provisions applicable to any of them.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn62" name="_ftnref62">[61]</a>&nbsp;Taken together, these matters, which were brought just about two months after my remarks, highlight what I believe to be the continued risk to investors in the crypto markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn63" name="_ftnref63">[62]</a></p>
<p>As if that were not enough, the Enforcement Division continues to address fraud and noncompliance in new and old forms in the crypto space. Among others, the SEC filed its first actions charging the illegal unregistered offerings of crypto asset securities in the form of purported non-fungible tokens (NFTs), applying the same well-trod test discussed above to determine that the NFTs were offered and sold as &ldquo;investment contracts,&rdquo; and therefore were securities.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn64" name="_ftnref64">[63]</a>&nbsp;The SEC also brought its first case charging a purportedly decentralized autonomous organization with failing to register its pooled crypto asset vehicles as investment companies, as required under the federal securities laws.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn65" name="_ftnref65">[64]</a>&nbsp;And in another recent action, the SEC brought charges against individuals allegedly responsible for a $1.7 billion crypto asset-related pyramid scheme.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn66" name="_ftnref66">[65]</a></p>
<p>Also notable, since my remarks, several courts have issued rulings in ongoing litigation expressly reaffirming&nbsp;<i>Howey&rsquo;s&nbsp;</i>application to crypto assets and rejecting not only the defendants&rsquo; blanket arguments that the crypto assets at issue were not securities, but also, in the cases where the court addressed it, their attempt to invoke the &ldquo;major questions doctrine.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn67" name="_ftnref67">[66]</a></p>
<p>In addition, in April 2024, the SEC completed its first trial involving crypto asset securities. After a nine-day trial, a jury in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York found the defendants liable for orchestrating what the SEC alleged was a years-long fraud involving crypto asset securities that led to massive investor losses when the scheme unraveled.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn68" name="_ftnref68">[67]</a>&nbsp;Following the verdict, the defendants agreed to pay more than $4.5 billion in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn69" name="_ftnref69">[68]</a></p>
<p>In sum, the crypto markets remain fast-moving, volatile, and, I believe, rife with investor risk. But as the foregoing remarks and this epilogue make clear (and if the past and my remarks at William &amp; Mary are prologue), the Division of Enforcement has moved with urgency, and will continue to do so, to fulfill our investor protection mandate in these markets.</p>

<div> NGX, Impact Board, sustainability instruments, green bond, Nigeria <br />
NGX introduces Impact Board for sustainability instruments, coinciding with Green Bond Advisory Group Meeting, aiming to drive responsible investing. <br /><br />Summary: NGX launches Impact Board for sustainable finance, attracting domestic and international investment, setting new standard for responsible investing in Nigeria. <div>
<p>Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) has unveiled its Impact Board, a dedicated platform for listing sustainability instruments, following approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This initiative was announced during a Closing Gong Ceremony in Lagos on Wednesday, July 10th, honoring Mr. Balarabe Abbas Lawal, Minister of Environment, and commemorating the 8th Green Bond Advisory Group Meeting.</p>
<p>The ceremony, which saw Mr. Lawal, Co-Chair, Green Bond Advisory Group Meeting, engage with investors and stakeholders on the proposed federal government Green Bond issuance, brought together key figures in Nigeria's financial and environmental sectors. Attendees included Dr. Emomotimi Agama, Director-General of the SEC, alongside delegates from the Debt Management Office, Ministry of Environment, issuers, and issuing houses.</p>
<p>This launch marks a pivotal moment in NGX's steadfast commitment to integrating sustainability into the core of Nigeria's capital market. By providing a high-visibility platform for sustainability instruments, NGX aims to usher in a new era of responsible investing, offering forward-thinking issuers access to purpose-driven capital.</p>
<p>Addressing the pressing environmental challenges facing the country, Mr. Lawal emphasized, "With issues like flooding, pollution, and deforestation, we urgently need funds to tackle them. This is why we are approaching the market." His sentiment was echoed by Dr. Agama, who affirmed SEC's support: "We are ready to bolster the sustainable finance market, aiming to deepen it with diverse instruments that contribute to Nigeria's sustainable development."</p>
<p>Alhaji (Dr.) Umaru Kwairanga, Group Chairman, Nigerian Exchange Group (NGX Group) highlighted NGX's capabilities, stating, "We possess the capacity, resources, and technology to raise the funds required by the Federal Ministry of Environment and the Nigerian economy to achieve the goals outlined in the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals."</p>
<p>Mr. Ahonsi Unuigbe, Chairman of NGX, underscored the significance of the Impact Board, noting its potential to encourage issuers like the Federal Government to leverage the market for financing strategic, sustainability-focused projects.</p>
<p>Further emphasizing the Group's commitment, Mr. Temi Popoola, Group Managing Director and CEO of NGX Group, stated, "We are dedicated to driving sustainability with the right frameworks, which is why giving visibility to this class of instruments is crucial for achieving our goals."</p>
<p>Mr. Jude Chiemeka, CEO of NGX, framed the launch as more than just a new platform, describing it as "a paradigm shift in how we approach finance and development." This sentiment was reinforced by Mr. Abimbola Babalola, Head of Trading and Products at NGX, who highlighted the Board's potential to foster capital-raising opportunities and create new tradeable products for investors.</p>
<p>The timing of the Impact Board's launch, coinciding with the 8th Green Bond Advisory Group Meeting, underscores the growing momentum behind sustainable finance initiatives in Nigeria. This synergy between governmental environmental strategies and market-driven solutions promises to accelerate the country's progress towards its sustainability goals.</p>
<p>As Nigeria steps into this new chapter of sustainable finance, the Impact Board stands poised to attract both domestic and international investment, driving growth and supporting the nation's sustainable development agenda. This innovative platform not only represents NGX's vision for the future but also sets a new standard for responsible investing in Africa's largest economy, potentially serving as a model for other emerging markets.</p>

<div> Severe weather, Cape of Good Hope, container traffic, LSEG Shipping Research, strong cyclone
Summary:<br />Severe weather halts container traffic near Cape of Good Hope. LSEG analysis shows no ships passing since July 8th. Predicts a record-breaking Atlantic hurricane season. AAO positive phase may signal the end of strong cyclones. Another cyclone may impact South Africa later this week. Waves off South Africa coincided with a strong cyclone and below-normal temperatures. <div>
<p><span>Severe weather conditions near the Cape of Good Hope has brought container traffic to a halt this week according to analysis by LSEG Shipping Research.</span></p>
<p><span>Since Monday 8<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;July, daily transit data and vessel location data via the LSEG Workspace Interactive Map show no containerships passing the Cape&nbsp;of&nbsp;Good&nbsp;Hope &ndash; adding to congestion and delays exacerbated by the Red Sea crisis. The Interactive Map layer shows marine weather and waves over 10m high.</span></p>
<p><span><b>Fabrice Maille, Global Head of&nbsp;Shipping &amp; Agriculture at LSEG</b>, comments:&nbsp;<i>"We have a complete stop at the Cape&nbsp;of&nbsp;Good&nbsp;Hope for containerships &ndash; east and west. There is no significant change in Red Sea traffic so far, but several containerships have made turnarounds and/or are waiting&nbsp;off the coast of Durban.&rdquo;</i></span></p>
<p><span><b>Isaac Hankes, Senior Weather Analyst, at LSEG</b>&nbsp;noted that the waves off the South Africa coast coincided with a strong cyclone that impacted the region on the last Sunday, and it was associated with temperatures that were well below normal.</span></p>
<p><span>He comments:<i>&nbsp;&ldquo;This was a powerful cyclone (with winds that generated the waves), but we are not seeing anything extraordinary in the data. Something comparable happened in early June, for example. These events are like a cold air outbreak in the South Africa winter, in the Northern Hemisphere context.&rdquo;</i></span></p>
<p><span>He also added:<i>&nbsp;&ldquo;There is another cyclone likely to impact South Africa later this week, so the issue with the waves may continue yet with respect to shipping issues. However, the AAO will soon move into its positive phase, which could signal the end&nbsp;of&nbsp;strong cyclones after the one later this week.&rdquo;</i></span></p>
<p><span>These precedents support LSEG Commodities' recent forecast that showcased a possibly record-breaking Atlantic hurricane season this year, which is following the expected pattern after the effects of Beryl as an exceptionally strong storm for this time of the year.</span></p>

<h3>Huw Pill</h3>
<p>Chief Economist and Executive Director, Monetary Analysis</p>
</div>
</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>Thanks very much to our hosts at Asia House today. It is a great pleasure to be here and have the opportunity to discuss the outlook for UK monetary policy with such a distinguished group.</p>
<h3>Transformation</h3>
<p>The monetary policy function at the Bank of England has recently been the subject of a review by ex-Federal Reserve Chair (and Nobel laureate in economics) Ben Bernanke. The results of this review were published as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/independent-evaluation-office/forecasting-for-monetary-policy-making-and-communication-at-the-bank-of-england-a-review/forecasting-for-monetary-policy-making-and-communication-at-the-bank-of-england-a-review">Forecasting for monetary policy making and communication at the Bank of England</a>.</p>
<p>The recommendations embodied in this review point to a need for reform: both in how the Bank of England&rsquo;s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) operates, and in the support provided to the Committee by Bank of England staff. Such change is entailed by a need to respond to the challenges posed by structural changes to the economy. Among these changes number (inter alia): the global financial crisis; the Covid-19 pandemic; the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and its impact on international energy and food prices; events in the Middle East; climate change; and the technological possibilities and threats of artificial intelligence. (The list could go on.)</p>
<p><strong>Strategy&nbsp;</strong>- Piecemeal change to the existing policy framework is no longer sufficient to address emerging new challenges. A comprehensive approach that internalises the spillovers among data analyses, macroeconomic forecasting, interest rate choices and policy communication is required. &lsquo;<strong>The whole is greater than the sum of the parts</strong>&rsquo;.</p>
<p>We need to be conscious of how all these elements fit together. In our internal discussions at the Bank of England, we have often used the metaphor of a single thread hanging off an expensive sweater. It is tempting to pull on that hanging thread to restore the pristine appearance of the sweater. And sometimes such an approach works. But the danger exists that pulling on the single thread leads to a wider unravelling of the cloth. In the extreme, the whole garment might disintegrate in our hands.</p>
<p>This metaphor cautions against making cosmetically appealing short-term changes to the policymaking framework, for fear that they may have wider and deeper side effects over time that go well beyond what had originally been envisaged. The UK monetary policymaking framework may have run that risk in the past &ndash; and paid the penalty on occasion. Developing a better understanding of how policy measures and choices interact with one another &ndash; of the structural relationships among them, to use the economic jargon &ndash; is the only way of managing this risk.</p>
<p><strong>Change&nbsp;</strong>- Any new monetary policy strategy for the UK also needs to embody a judicious mix of the old and the new.</p>
<p>It would obviously be ill-advised to discard those elements of the existing policy framework that have performed well in recent challenging times. Among these I would list many of the basic institutional features of the UK system: an independent MPC; a price stability mandate for monetary policy established in legislation; operationalisation of that mandate in the form of a quantified target for inflation; and accountability of MPC members to Parliament. Retaining these elements is key: &lsquo;<strong>we don&rsquo;t want to throw the baby out with the bath water</strong>&rsquo;.</p>
<p>As reflected in last month&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/may/ben-broadbent-ccbs-new-evidence-on-the-monetary-transmission-mechanism-workshop">valedictory speech</a>&nbsp;of my sadly now former colleague (indeed former boss) Ben Broadbent &ndash; and also in last Monday evening&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/july/speech-by-jonathan-haskel-at-escoe-kings-college-london">valedictory</a>&nbsp;of my equally sadly soon-to-be-former colleague (but not boss) Jonathan Haskel &ndash; this institutional framework has proved central to the considerable improvement in UK monetary policy performance over recent decades.</p>
<p>These two eminent economists both provide compelling evidence that the contrast between: (1) on the one hand, the prompt return of UK inflation to target following the significant external impulses generated by Covid and the invasion of Ukraine; and (2) on the other hand, the higher and much more persistent profile of UK inflation following the 1970s oil price shocks, owes much to these institutional improvements.</p>
<p>But equally, while retaining these benefits of institutional innovations associated with the adoption of inflation targeting, we also need to recognise the need for changes to the strategy in the face of changes in context and circumstance. And we must be open to learning from the experience and guidance of others.</p>
<p>Together with members of the Bank of England&rsquo;s modelling team, I was privileged to spend time last week with my former colleagues at the European Central Bank in Frankfurt. We drew valuable lessons from their experiences and expertise. A few weeks ago, the Centre for Central Banking Studies at the Bank of England hosted a workshop for central bank chief economists at which Prof. Bernanke very generously offered views on his recent report, triggering a rich discussion of the strategic challenges facing macroeconomic forecasting and monetary policy.</p>
<p>Not only do such events offer an opportunity for mutually beneficial exchanges of views and ventilation of ideas within the central banking community, but also &ndash; in those areas where Prof. Bernanke has identified that the Bank of England has work to do &ndash; they allow us to draw on the experience of others, avoid the pitfalls of implementing incremental changes to the framework, short circuit the costly process of learning-by-doing, and leapfrog directly to more modern methods.</p>
<p><strong>Patience&nbsp;</strong>- All these efforts take time. There is a premium on having the patience to ensure that multiple difficult, interrelated and therefore complex decisions are taken correctly.</p>
<p>I have spoken in the past of the need to &lsquo;<strong>get the basics right</strong>&rsquo; in reforming the MPC&rsquo;s monetary policy strategy. Our external audiences will inevitably focus on the visible aspects of the strategy that are central to policy communication. But these may be among the last to change in response to the recommendations of Prof. Bernanke&rsquo;s review: the form of policy presentation should follow the substance of policy formulation, not lead it.</p>
<p>A good decision is easier to communicate and rationalise than a poor decision. Expending effort on cosmetic issues at the expense of getting the fundamental analyses and decision processes right is to have &lsquo;the tail wagging the dog&rsquo;.</p>
<p>All this implies a natural sequencing of reform efforts: start by getting the enabling and foundational aspects of data collection and management right; then develop the models and frameworks to analyse the data; move on to designing the processes required to ensure policy makers are presented with the analysis in a manner and according to a schedule that maximises the likelihood they will take the best decision; assess how those policy decisions and their rationale should be presented to external stakeholders, including financial market participants, the media and the general public; and finally design a mechanism to collect feedback, so the impact of those decisions and their communication can be assessed.</p>
<p>But in practice all these efforts will proceed &ndash; and indeed are already proceeding &ndash; in parallel. Making them consistent is a significant organisational challenge. And, of course, we are not starting from scratch.</p>
<p>To illustrate, today the Bank of England is publishing its annual&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/about/get-involved/citizens-panels/your-voice-2024-insights-from-the-boe-outreach-programmes?sc_mode=normal" target="_blank">Outreach Report<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external">&nbsp;</span></a>, which describes the role and impact of the Bank&rsquo;s various outreach programmes in facilitating conversations with our various communities: the Citizens Panel, the Youth Forum and the Community Panels.</p>
<p>Over the past couple of years, I have been closely involved in this important work, which entails both collecting information and perspectives from our stakeholders &ndash; notably about the effects of persistently higher energy prices on UK households&rsquo; cost-of-living &ndash; as well as offering opportunities to present the sometimes difficult rationale for monetary policy decisions to hard-to-reach audiences. These efforts embody both data collection and policy communication &ndash; and, as such, they do not easily fit within the sequencing that would be followed if designing the new monetary policy strategy involved starting with a blank piece of paper, completely from scratch.</p>
<h3>Conjuncture</h3>
<p>For all the emphasis I have placed on the renewal of the MPC monetary policy strategy, the MPC must also conduct monetary policy today. This brings me to the current monetary policy conjuncture.</p>
<p>As I am sure you all well know, the MPC voted to leave Bank Rate unchanged at 5&frac14;% at its last meeting in June.</p>
<p>Of course, it is welcome news that the MPC&rsquo;s target variable &ndash; headline UK CPI inflation &ndash; has returned to the 2% target in May. But the MPC&rsquo;s remit makes clear that the inflation target holds at all times. It is not enough to meet the target in a transitory or fleeting way. Rather the MPC must achieve the inflation target on a lasting and sustainable basis.</p>
<p>Given the famous long and variable lags in monetary policy transmission, this requires that the MPC adopt a medium-term orientation and forward-looking approach in its formulation of monetary policy. That naturally points in the direction of placing an inflation forecast close to the centre of its policy discussion, as has indeed been the case for many years.</p>
<p>But when forecasting inflation becomes difficult &ndash; as has proved to be the case at the Bank of England and elsewhere over the past decade &ndash; an approach that places the inflation forecast at the centre of its policy framework comes under stress. That has been recognised in one of the key recommendations made by Prof. Bernanke in his view &ndash; to downplay the role of the MPC&rsquo;s baseline inflation forecast in the discussion and presentation of its policy decisions.</p>
<p>Of course, if one analytical tool is to be downplayed, there must be other tools upon which to place greater reliance. Prof. Bernanke has emphasised the role to be played by scenarios and policy simulations.</p>
<p>As an intermediate and pragmatic step to address the difficulties with forecasting in the face of the profound structural shocks to the UK economy, in recent years the MPC has emphasised that it is focused on the persistent component of overall inflation, since it is this component which &ndash; by nature &ndash; will still be embodied in price developments at the horizon where monetary policy decisions taken today have their greatest impact on inflation. In so doing, the MPC maintains its necessarily medium-term and forward-looking orientation.</p>
<p>More specifically, the MPC has emphasised three key indicators of inflation persistence: labour market tightness; pay growth; and services price inflation. On the basis of recent outturns, at the margin recent developments in these indicators have hinted towards some upside risk to my assessment of inflation persistence.</p>
<p>But these are noisy data series. More generally, the MPC has long recognised that it is difficult to distinguish the signal about underlying persistent inflation dynamics from the inevitable noise in any one release when assessing the news in the month-to-month data flow.</p>
<p>Viewed through this lens, it is hard to dispute the case that inflation persistence in the UK continues to prove &ndash; well &ndash; persistent. That is perhaps to be expected.</p>
<p>The difficulty in extracting signals about changes in the low frequency persistent component of inflation from noisy higher frequency indicators has not disappeared. Nor is it likely to in the coming months.</p>
<p>More data will come before we take our next policy decision at the MPC meeting on 1 August. But we have to be realistic about how much any one or two releases can add to our assessment.</p>
<p>While the MPC must remain open to the possibility that compelling new evidence could emerge which would lead the Committee (or individual members of it) to a revised opinion, it should also remain cautious in seeing any single data as either a necessary or sufficient trigger for that re-assessment.</p>
<p>In parallel with these various kinks in the data flow, time is also passing. And with monetary policy in restrictive territory, the extent to which the MPC is bearing down on underlying inflation also has a time dimension. The total quantum of monetary policy restriction is partly determined by the length of time that Bank Rate is held at a restrictive level. So the MPC&rsquo;s interpretation of the data needs to be placed against an assessment of how restrictive the overall stance of monetary policy is and has been, as well as a view on how that restriction is being transmitted to price developments.</p>
<p>It is easy to get frustrated with this. But it is important that the MPC maintains the right strategic orientation &ndash; and remains true to the framework it has articulated to deal with current challenges. Unless we have reason to shift to a new framework for policy discussions, there is a premium on acting consistently within our established machinery. It takes a framework to beat a framework.</p>
<p>The challenges associated with forecasting notwithstanding, the MPC continues to make substantial progress.</p>
<p>The current restrictive monetary policy stance continues to bear down on the persistent component of UK inflation. The MPC needs to ensure that the degree of cumulative restriction in the monetary policy stance is sufficient to ensure that the persistent dynamic in recent inflation indicators is squeezed out of the system in a way that is consistent with a timely and sustained return of CPI inflation to the 2% target.</p>
<p>At annual rates still not far from 6%, annual services price inflation and wage growth continue to point to an uncomfortable strength in those underlying inflation dynamics.</p>
<p>But the latest data also remains consistent with the view that these inflationary pressures have now been contained, and may be starting to revert towards levels that are more consistent with the achievement of the inflation target.</p>
<p>The challenge for the MPC is to get the balance right: enough monetary policy restriction to achieve the inflation target, but neither too much nor too little for fear of destabilising the economy.&nbsp;<strong>&lsquo;Twas ever thus</strong>.</p>
<p>Until the transformation agenda in response to the Bernanke review bears fruit, what complicates matters is how the outlook for inflation persistence stemming from analysis of the evolution of our three &lsquo;key indicators&rsquo; can be reconciled with the MPC&rsquo;s macroeconomic forecast &ndash; and, in particular, the inflation outlook at the policy-relevant two- to three-year horizon. The MPC&rsquo;s judgements around inflation persistence are crucial to determining the shape and profile of the inflation forecast at that horizon.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding Prof. Bernanke&rsquo;s recommendation to downplay the baseline inflation forecast, in the meantime being clear about the character of these judgements about inflation persistence and how their evolution informs the MPC&rsquo;s inflation forecast remains important.</p>
<p>Behind the MPC&rsquo;s inflation persistence judgement lies a structural view of price and wage setting behaviour in the UK economy. We don&rsquo;t simply need to observe developments in the key indicators, but rather we need to explain &ndash; both to ourselves and to our various external audiences &ndash; why there is greater persistence in current inflation dynamics than our standard model framework would imply, even after we have taken account of the extent of slack in the economy.</p>
<p>Based on that view, I will propose a few potential ways to interpret the inflation persistence judgements embedded in the forecast.</p>
<p>On one view, these judgements could reflect decaying second round effects in price and wage inflation following the big external shocks associated with the pandemic and Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine. Those effects may take longer to decay than any second-round effects embodied in conventional models and frameworks, but they are not fundamentally different &ndash; it is simply a question of the half-life of those second-round effects just being somewhat longer.</p>
<p>In this case, the challenge for the MPC is to decide whether to let this greater persistence play out or to act to bring inflation down more quickly while accepting the cost in terms of activity and employment that this implies. In other words, the MPC faces a traditional &lsquo;trade-off&rsquo; situation.</p>
<p>On another view, the inflation persistence judgments could represent a more permanent change to price, wage and margin setting behaviour, perhaps associated with changes in the pay structure, different competitive dynamics in the markets for labour, product and services, or with high degrees of real income resistance.</p>
<p>For any given level of slack in the economy, the momentum of nominal dynamics in price / wage / cost / margin setting behaviour may simply be stronger.</p>
<p>In that scenario, ultimately the MPC will be left with no choice but to maintain a restrictive monetary policy to weigh against such incipient stronger inflationary dynamics for the 2% inflation target is to be achieved on a lasting basis. That is the Committee&rsquo;s mandate.</p>
<p>Viewed through his lens, the persistence judgements represent a deterioration in the supply side of the UK economy: they capture an under-estimation of the NAIRU (or equivalently an over-estimation of potential output).</p>
<p>It is apparent from this discussion that the character of inflation persistence has implications for the conduct of monetary policy.</p>
<p>When drawing implications from the evolution of the &lsquo;key indicators of inflation persistence&rsquo; for the MPC&rsquo;s monetary policy assessment, it is important to address what those indicators tell us about the nature of inflation persistence. This goes beyond a quantitative mapping from those indicators into an inflation forecast. A more structural interpretation of inflation persistence is required. And further work is needed to provide this.</p>
<p>In particular, separating households&rsquo; inflation perceptions from households&rsquo; and firms&rsquo; short-term inflation expectations &ndash; and then seeking to separate both from inflation itself &ndash; remains a difficult empirical challenge. Distinguishing &lsquo;catch-up dynamics&rsquo;, which might be expected to dissipate over time (even if relatively slowly), from &lsquo;de-anchoring dynamics&rsquo; that might have a more long-lasting character and represent a deterioration on the supply side, remains key.</p>
<p>This all said, in the absence of any big new shocks, the &ldquo;when-rather-than-if&rdquo; characterisation of prospective Bank Rate cuts still seems appropriate.</p>
<p>The views expressed in these remarks are not necessarily those of the Bank of England or the Monetary Policy Committee.</p>
<p>I would particularly like to thank Saba Alam and Iris Hall for their help in the preparation of these remarks.</p>
<p>The text has also benefitted from helpful comments from Andrew Bailey, Jamie Bell, Sarah Breeden, Fabrizio Cadamagnani, Alan Castle, Clare Lombardelli, Jonathan Haskel, Rich Harrison, Adrian Paul, Kate Reinold, Fergal Shortall and Danny Walker for which I am most grateful.</p>
<p>Opinions (and all remaining errors and omissions) are my own.</p>

<h2>Speech</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The reason I wanted to speak today is because I believe Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) are absolutely vital.&nbsp;<strong>We need to work out how to bring out the best in each other, so that we can keep moving society forward</strong>.</p>
<p>I have been the Chief Financial Officer of the Bank of England for the last 5 years. It has been an honour to serve the UK during Covid, Brexit, the cost of living crisis, and against a challenging geopolitical backdrop. During this time, I have had my hands full with the Bank of England&rsquo;s balance sheet, which grew to over &pound;1 trillion during the pandemic.</p>
<h3>Personal journey</h3>
<p><strong>I have spent the last twenty years in financial services&hellip;but that was never the plan!</strong></p>
<p>I was born in London, and my family lived in Highgate at the time. We moved progressively South to Wimbledon and then to Purley, where I grew up.</p>
<p>My parents worked hard and inspired me to work hard. My Dad was awarded a scholarship by the Government of Ghana to study in the UK after coming 3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;in West Africa for his A-Levels. He came to study engineering at the Camborne School of Mines. My Mum, totally separately, came from Ghana to the UK when she was 18, to study midwifery at Liverpool University. She went on to work for the NHS for 40 years, and I saw her juggle long shifts, while raising a family.</p>
<p>From the age of 7, I had my heart set on being a doctor, so that I could help people. I went to Old Palace, a fantastic all girls school, in Croydon, where I had the most incredible headmistress, Miss Hilton. She believed in me, and that went a long way.</p>
<p>I read Chemistry at Oxford University, because I wanted to help create a drug to help people with cancer. My Masters focused on creating molecules with anti-tumorous properties. At Oxford, I was inspired by the late, great Professor Sir Jack Baldwin &ndash; he was one of the most eminent British Chemists of our time. He believed in me, and he chose me to be part of his research group. I then got a junior research fellowship at Princeton University.</p>
<p>After some time working in the labs, behind a fumehood, I experienced some of the highs of research, as I created lots of new compounds, and my work was published in an international journal. But, I started to realise that I wanted to work in a more fast-paced and more socially interactive environment. I wanted to use my creative and experimentation skills to solve problems. And, in the background, I had a part-time job working in fashion at Burberry in London to pay my student debt. We had a lot of well known customers coming through our doors, and the fashion world gave me an alternative to wearing a white lab coat and goggles to work every day!</p>
<p>Fast forward, I trained as a Chartered Accountant at Ernst &amp; Young in London. I became an Investment Banker at UBS, and during the global financial crisis, I travelled around the world doing M&amp;A deals. Then I did different CFO roles at Barclays.</p>
<p>When I was on maternity leave, I was approached about becoming the CFO of the Bank of England. And as they say, the rest is history.</p>
<p>When I joined the Bank, I was the youngest Executive Director. I was 36, which makes me a millennial (just about!), and I was also the first black executive in the Bank&rsquo;s 329 year history.</p>
<p>I have learned to balance work and family, as I have 4 young children ranging from a baby to an 8-year old. So I have been busy juggling work and home&hellip;</p>
<p>As I reflect back over the years, there are some key things that have helped:</p>
<p>Firstly, I have been&nbsp;<strong>flexible</strong>&nbsp;about what I do, and changing direction. This has been a consistent theme. New things come up. New people come up<strong>. I like experiencing different things and gravitate towards people I enjoy spending time with, because work needs to be fun!</strong></p>
<p>Secondly, having my own sense of&nbsp;<strong>inner fulfilment</strong>&nbsp;is important. There&rsquo;s no point in waiting for people to thank you and give you credit for the work you are doing - otherwise, you could be waiting a long time! People are busy, people have other things on their mind, so there&rsquo;s no point dwelling on things you can&rsquo;t change. I get satisfaction from doing purposeful work.</p>
<p>Thirdly, there will be barriers. Of course there will be. That&rsquo;s always been my experience. But there will always be key people, who believe in you, and who will help you figure it out during the toughest times<strong>. Family, friends, mentors, and sponsors. People who you can lean on to give you support and encouragement</strong>. And that&rsquo;s what I have found has made the difference.</p>
<h3>How am I helping to drive Diversity and Inclusion across modern business?</h3>
<p>At the Bank, I&rsquo;m the co-Executive sponsor of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.</p>
<p>I enjoy the social purpose aspect of my role. I do a lot of outreach. I love meeting people from different communities, businesses and charities; people across the public and private sector. I have the opportunity to contribute to different industry discussions at a national level, and to speak at international fora like the G20, and the International Monetary Fund. I try to engage, listen, and share experiences to drive positive change.</p>
<p>At the Bank, we have<strong>&nbsp;focussed on creating an inclusive culture, where everyone can thrive. Our visible and invisible diversity is what will help us achieve better outcomes for our society</strong>.</p>
<p>During the pandemic, we made DEI a strategic priority for the Bank, and I was delighted when the Governor, Andrew Bailey, asked me to be the co-Executive sponsor.</p>
<p>In 2020, after Black Lives Matter, the Bank of England commissioned a Court Review of Ethnic diversity. We found that outcomes were very different for white and ethnic minority colleagues, and also that we needed to do more to achieve gender equality. I have helped the Bank respond to this, and I will make sure we continue to prioritise this, against a trend of global efforts reducing in this space.</p>
<h4>Targets</h4>
<p>We have set formal targets for the recruitment and retention of diverse staff at various levels at the Bank, particularly for women and ethnic minorities.&nbsp;<strong>We are tracking progress because what gets measured gets done.</strong>&nbsp;At the highest level in the organisation, Court, our board has a good mix of gender and ethnic diversity. And we are working towards meeting our targets at&nbsp;<strong>all</strong>&nbsp;levels.</p>
<h4>Diversity alone won&rsquo;t get us where we want to be:</h4>
<p>1.&nbsp;<strong>Inclusion matters.</strong></p>
<p>2.&nbsp;<strong>Equal pay and career progression matters.</strong></p>
<p>3.<strong>&nbsp;Allyship matters</strong>.</p>
<p>And, finally, to close&hellip;.&nbsp;<strong>What I would like to see more than anything, is for diverse people to be fully accepted and valued when they are ordinary, not just when they are exceptional&hellip;.&nbsp;</strong>That&rsquo;s when we&rsquo;ll know we are really moving society forward.</p>
<p>Thank you Suki Sandhu, and the INvolve team for everything you are doing. And thank you all for listening.</p>
<p>I would like to thank my Bank colleagues and chairs of our employee networks, for the vital work they are doing to drive inclusion in the workplace. Also Mohini Gurung and Catherine Milton for proofreading this speech.</p>

<div> Financial Stability Oversight Council, Digital Assets, Regulation, Market, Enforcement
Summary: The CFTC Chairman emphasized the need for legislation to regulate the digital asset market, enacting principles-based oversight, funding, customer protections, AML/KYC requirements, and education/outreach. <br /><br /> <div>
<div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item">
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>Introduction</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Chairwoman Stabenow, Ranking Member Boozman, and members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today as Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC or Agency) to discuss the state of the digital asset commodity market.&nbsp; Before I begin, I would like to recognize and thank my fellow CFTC Commissioners and CFTC staff for their dedication and commitment to serving the American public.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>State of the Digital Asset Commodity Market</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>During my almost seven-years at the CFTC as both a Commissioner and as Chairman, I have observed the digital asset market evolve significantly, expanding and collapsing, at times with periods of high volatility. &nbsp;It has also facilitated countless scandals and fraudulent activity, some very small and typical in criminal form, others massive in scale and profile.&nbsp; I have watched the market as it has piqued the interest of both novice and sophisticated investors, and have seen some of our nation&rsquo;s most established financial institutions build businesses driven by digital assets.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>What has concerned me most throughout the expansion of this digital asset class is that while everyday Americans fall victim to one digital asset scam after another, there remains no completed legislative response. &nbsp;I have repeatedly been asked by members of Congress what I am doing to protect their constituents.&nbsp; I believe the single most important thing I have done, and continue to do, is advocate to this body to fill the regulatory gap.&nbsp; I am not alone in my concerns.&nbsp; In 2022, a Financial Stability Oversight Council report highlighted that there is a gap in regulation of the spot market for digital assets that are not securities.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam48?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp; This gap for non-security tokens continues to constitute a majority of the digital asset market measured by market capitalization.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam48?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the risks that this unregulated market poses to U.S. investors, I have consistently and publicly called for new legislative authority for the CFTC,</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam48?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;including before this Committee.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam48?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Congress must act quickly in order for regulators, like the CFTC, to provide basic customer protections that are core to U.S. financial markets.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Further, based on my observations as Chairman, I do not believe inaction will quash public interest for digital assets; it will only result in greater risk to our financial markets and investors. &nbsp;As the digital asset market continues to integrate into traditional financial institutions, concerns regarding broader market resiliency and perhaps even financial stability will ripen.&nbsp; In short, our current trajectory is not sustainable.&nbsp; Federal legislation is urgently needed to create a pathway for a regulatory framework that will protect American investors and possibly the financial system from future risk.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>Enforcement</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>It has been almost nine years since the CFTC brought its first enforcement action in connection with an illegal Bitcoin operation.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam48?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp; Since that time, the agency has been aggressive in using our powerful, but limited anti-fraud and anti-manipulation authorities.&nbsp; In total, the CFTC has brought over 135 digital commodity cases resulting in billions in penalties and restitution.&nbsp; All along, CFTC enforcement staff has worked closely with our civil and criminal law enforcement partners at the federal and state levels.&nbsp; The escalating rate of digital asset enforcement cases since 2020 mirrors the accelerated and sustained adoption of digital assets by U.S. investors.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Just last week, a District Court in the Northern District of Illinois entered summary judgment in favor of the CFTC in a case involving fraud by an unregistered entity that promised steady returns in digital asset commodities such as Bitcoin and Ether.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam48?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp; In its decision, the court re-affirmed that both Bitcoin and Ether are commodities under the Commodity Exchange Act.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>In fiscal year 2023, actions involving digital asset-related allegations comprised almost half of our enforcement docket.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam48?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp; Of the 47 enforcement actions involving digital assets commodities, 35 alleged misconduct in the spot market.&nbsp; Ultimately, the CFTC, whose primary responsibility is overseeing the multi-trillion-dollar U.S. derivatives markets, is committing nearly half its enforcement resources to a market it does not have the authority or appropriated resources to regulate.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Nearly a decade of digital asset experience has given CFTC staff a deep understanding of the market and underlying technology that supports it.&nbsp; Market regulators like the CFTC were built precisely for situations we find ourselves in today.&nbsp; The flawed notion that regulating an asset class legitimizes it misses the point of our responsibilities.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>International Progress</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Concurrent with my duties as CFTC Chairman, I have the privilege of serving as the Vice-Chairman of the International Organization of Securities Commissions, more commonly known as IOSCO.&nbsp; IOSCO&rsquo;s member agencies regulate more than 95% of the world&rsquo;s securities markets in over 130 jurisdictions.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam48?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp; In this role, I have observed both major and developing economies establish regulatory frameworks for digital assets.&nbsp; From Asia, the Middle East, the European Union, the United Kingdom, and South America, what started as pilot programs and draft legislation just a few years ago, has developed into established global regulatory systems.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The delta between the U.S. and our international counterparts preserves weaknesses that are exploited by bad actors, and prohibits us from much needed coordination efforts.&nbsp; Further, and primarily for the members of this Committee to consider, any potential economic benefits and innovation arising from this technology ultimately will be stymied without regulatory certainty.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>Legislative Priorities to Achieve Success</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>As this Committee continues to consider legislation to fill the regulatory gap, I would like to focus your attention on the components of a framework that would ensure the CFTC has the tools to provide customer and market protections.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>First, the principles-based oversight model has served the CFTC and its regulated markets well, striking an appropriate balance between clear outcomes-based requirements, and measured flexibility to meet those outcomes.&nbsp; Core principles such as compliance with fair and orderly trading, system safeguards, financial resource requirements, and products not being readily susceptible to fraud or manipulation, to name just a few, serve as a solid foundation to build transparent and resilient markets, regardless of asset class.&nbsp; In light of the novel nature of digital assets, the CFTC would then, consistent with a legislative mandate, tailor rules to meet the risk and characteristic profile.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Second, appropriate funding is necessary to meet the mandate of any legislatively enacted regulatory program.&nbsp; A permanent fee-for-service model, exclusively assessed on digital asset registrants, and that is commensurate with the responsibilities outlined in a bill, is critical.&nbsp; As with other fee-for-service models, congressional appropriators and the agency should work in tandem to set budget levels and subsequently set fees to meet those budget levels.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Third, given the retail-oriented nature of the digital asset market, legislative authority for the CFTC to require registrants to provide a comprehensive disclosure regime regarding a commodity token&rsquo;s structure, purpose, market-based characteristics, and general risks is also critical to ensure investors have access to material information.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Fourth, it is essential that legislation provide comprehensive authority for anti-money laundering, know-your-customer, and a customer identification program, built off of existing requirements for market participants.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Fifth, given the important role the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) plays in the oversight of security-based digital tokens, the Committee should consider a disciplined, balanced framework for the determination of tokens as commodities or securities under existing law.&nbsp; The SEC and CFTC have a longstanding partnership that facilitates strong, robust regulation of securities and derivatives markets.&nbsp; I am confident that the two agencies will continue working closely, ensuring a reliable, fair, and efficient system for listing and trading of digital assets on regulated exchanges.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Finally, given the broad adoption of digital assets by a significant portion of the American population,</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam48?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;a comprehensive education and outreach program, building off of the CFTC&rsquo;s Office of Customer Education and Outreach, will enable the investing public to understand both the risks and opportunities of this technology.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>Conclusion</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>I am encouraged by this Committee&rsquo;s continued efforts, dating back to 2022, to fill the gap in regulation, prioritizing customer protections and market stability.&nbsp; In addition to this Committee&rsquo;s work, there have been other important steps taken in Congress to address the need for comprehensive regulation of the digital asset commodity market.&nbsp; The principles and regulatory foundations that have made our capital markets and derivatives markets the deepest, most liquid, and most resilient in the world provide an effective model for the digital asset commodity market.&nbsp; We need to act thoughtfully, but with urgency, to fill this harmful regulatory gap in order to give American investors the protection they deserve.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>I thank the Committee for your focus in this area, and&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>look forward to answering your questions.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<div> Keywords: valuation, climate risk, equity, uncertainties, transition costs <br />
Summary: 
- New research extends valuation techniques to estimate the effect of climate and economic uncertainties on global equity values.
- Study evaluates impact of greenhouse gas emissions trajectories on equity values under various scenarios.
- Key factors influencing equity valuation include emissions abatement, climate tipping points, and central bank actions.
- Study indicates the need for prompt abatement action to keep losses below 10%, with over 40% of global equity value at risk without acceleration.
- Methodological innovations include a fully probabilistic approach, state-dependent discounting, and joint analysis of transition costs and physical risks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p><b><i>New EDHEC-Risk Climate Impact Institution research: </i></b><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b></p>
<ul>
<li><b><i>Extends valuation techniques to estimate the effect on global equity values of climate and economic uncertainties, financial contingencies, transition costs and physical risks. </i></b></li>
<li><b><i>Evaluates the impact on global equity values of different greenhouse gas emissions trajectories under multiple climate and economic scenarios. </i></b></li>
<li><b><i>Identifies aggressiveness of emissions abatement, location of climate tipping points, and ability and willingness</i></b> <b><i>of central banks to lower rates during economic distress as key impact factors of equity valuation.</i></b></li>
<li><b><i>Indicates that prompt and robust abatement action is needed to keep losses below 10%. Conversely, over 40% of global equity value is at risk if decarbonisation efforts do not accelerate, with losses exceeding 50% when climate tipping points are factored in.</i></b></li>
</ul>
<p><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b></p>
<p>In a new study, <a href="https://climateimpact.edhec.edu/sites/ercii/files/pdf/ercii_publication_how_does_climate_risk_affect_equity_valuations.pdf"><i>How Does Climate Risk Affect Global Equity Valuations? A Novel Approach</i></a>, EDHEC-Risk Climate Impact Institute addresses key limitations of current climate-aware valuation approaches to produce novel insights. The paper, conducted within the research chair established by EDHEC Business School and Scientific Beta, reveals that the impact of climate risk on global equity valuation can be significant, especially in scenarios with limited climate action.</p>
<p>Key Findings:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>The uncertainty of climate and economic outcomes and the state dependence of discounting</b> are two key and much neglected contributors to changes in equity valuation. </li>
<li>The magnitude of losses depends on the <b>aggressiveness of emission abatement policy</b>; the <b>presence or otherwise of tipping points</b>; on the extent of Central Banks&rsquo; willingness and ability to <b>lower rates in states of economic distress</b>.</li>
<li>Severe impact on equity valuation can be obtained with very plausible combinations of policies and physical outcomes; and there is considerably more downside than upside risk &ndash; <b>over 40% of global equity value is at risk unless decarbonisation efforts accelerate and losses could exceed 50% with near climate tipping points</b>.</li>
<li><b>Prompt and robust abatement action is needed</b> to keep losses below 10%. </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Methodological Innovations:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Fully Probabilistic Approach</b>: incorporating climate and economic uncertainties into a probabilistic framework for a more realistic and comprehensive evaluation of potential outcomes.</li>
<li><b>State-Dependent Discounting:</b> recognising that physical damages from climate change impair cashflows in a state-dependent manner and allowing discount factors to be determined by economic conditions and damages, which highlights the neglected role of state-dependent discounting.</li>
<li><b>Joint Analysis of Transition Costs and Physical Risks:</b> upgrading a popular integrated climate economics assessment model to estimate the effect of transition costs (associated with regulatory measures to curb greenhouse gas emissions) and physical damages on the value of global equity stock, providing a unified view of climate-related financial risks.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Ducoulombier, Director of EDHEC-Risk Climate Impact Institute</b> states:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The research team led by Professor Rebonato has upgraded mainstream integrated assessment models to incorporate the progress of climate science and make them fit for financial applications. By modelling the considerable uncertainty in the physical and economical dimensions of climate change and linking it to top-down equity valuation, this study debunks the notion that the value of financial assets may be immune to climate changes and provides additional support for bold climate action.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Professor Ricardo Rebonato, Scientific Director of EDHEC-Risk Climate Impact Institute</b>, adds:</p>
<p>&ldquo;These results&ndash;obtained with mild assumptions&ndash;underline the importance of uncertainty and state-dependent discounting for climate-aware equity valuation.&nbsp; Our approach shows that it is possible and fruitful to integrate climate risks into financial analysis and we will be working further to develop theoretically solid and practically implementable tools for climate-aware investment management.&rdquo;</p>

Summary: The FTSE Mondo Visione Exchanges Index tracks market cap, performance, and capital returns of 33 exchanges and trading floors. <div>
<p>Exchanges heavily reliant on cash equities have faced challenging times due to a shortage of listings and low valuations, prompting some firms to reassess their current listings. In contrast, exchanges with a diversified business model have weathered these conditions more successfully.</p>
<p>The FTSE Mondo Visione Exchanges Index concluded June at 71,426.00 points, reflecting a 0.4% decline from its May 2024 value of 71,725.78.</p>
<p>The top 5 exchanges by market capitalisation at the end of June were:</p>

<div> campaign, awareness, investor education, protection, collaboration
<br />
Summary: 
World Investor Week raises awareness for investor education and protection, covering themes like technology, fraud prevention, and sustainable finance. Collaboration among IOSCO members is emphasized. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>The World Investor Week (WIW) is a week-long, global campaign to raise awareness of the importance of investor education and protection, and to highlight the various initiatives of securities regulators in these two critical areas.</p>
<p>WIW has two primary objectives, namely (i) to disseminate key messages that support investor education, investor protection and financial literacy; and (ii) to foster learning opportunities for investors. The campaign also aims to strengthen collaboration among IOSCO members on investor education and protection initiatives.</p>
<p>Launching on 7 October 2024 and spanning the course of the week, organizations representing over 100 jurisdictions will come together to drive awareness around trending issues which impact investors around the world.</p>
<p>Principal themes include</p>
<ul>
<li>Technology &amp; Digital Finance</li>
<li>Crypto Assets</li>
<li>Sustainable Finance</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These will be complemented with discussions and workshops on</p>
<ul>
<li>Fraud and Scam Prevention</li>
<li>Investor Resilience</li>
<li>Basics of Investing</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Jean-Paul Servais, Chair of IOSCO&rsquo;s Board, and Chairman, Financial Services and Markets Authority, Belgium</strong>, said: "Last year&rsquo;s World Investor Week saw the involvement of 118 jurisdictions and reached almost 730 million individuals. We have to keep the ball rolling as with technological advancements and increased use of AI, new challenges arise. We also see how crypto, fractional trading, gamification and copy-trading are trending.</p>
<p>I am confident that WIW2024 will build on the success of previous years to drive greater investor awareness of these issues and look forward to contribute to its success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s themes were agreed by IOSCO&rsquo;s Committee 8 which conducts its work on retail investor education and financial literacy and includes 38 members from both established and emerging markets.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Pasquale Munaf&ograve;, Senior Officer, Commissione Nazionale per le Societ&agrave; e la Borsa, Italy, and Chair of IOSCO&rsquo;s Committee 8</strong>, said: &ldquo;The principal themes we have identified this year result from extensive engagement with all Committee 8 members and unanimously reflect the most urgent issues facing investors today. We also collaborate very closely with other relevant committees to ensure a comprehensive and unified approach to investor protection and education.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By placing the spotlight on these critical areas, we aim to empower and protect investors worldwide, providing them with the knowledge and tools needed to navigate an increasingly complex financial landscape.&rdquo;</p>

<div> Announcement, DTCC, VaR calculator, FICC, U.S. Treasury Clearing <br />
Summary:<br />
DTCC launches VaR calculator for firms to evaluate margin and Clearing Fund obligations for FICC membership amidst expected rise in U.S. Treasury Clearing activity. <div>
<p>The Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the premier post-trade market infrastructure for the global financial services industry, today announced the launch of a new public-facing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dtcc.com/managing-risk/stress-testing-and-liquidity-risk-management/ccfl-public-calculator" target="_blank">Value at Risk (VaR) calculator</a>. The calculator provides market participants with the ability to evaluate potential margin and Clearing Fund obligations associated with becoming a Member of DTCC&rsquo;s Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC) Government Securities Division (GSD).</p>
<p>With U.S. Treasury Clearing activity processed through FICC expected to rise by US$4 trillion daily after the SEC&rsquo;s expanded clearing mandate is implemented in 2025 and 2026, DTCC&rsquo;s VaR calculator will be a crucial tool for firms to accurately determine VaR and potential margin obligations for any simulated portfolio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;VaR is a widely used risk management concept in the financial services industry and is the primary component of GSD&rsquo;s Clearing Fund requirements,&rdquo; said Tim Hulse, Managing Director, Financial Risk &amp; Governance, at DTCC. &ldquo;The calculator considers factors such as historical data, volatility and confidence levels to estimate VaR, increasing market transparency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The new calculator provides market participants with the opportunity to calculate potential Margin obligations on a simulated portfolio, for given positions and market value, using FICC&rsquo;s VaR methodology.</p>
<p>Hulse added, &ldquo;FICC understands the urgency and importance of evaluating firms&rsquo; risk exposure associated with the expansion of U.S. Treasury Clearing. The VaR calculator provides market participants with increased transparency into these obligations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As part of its commitment to the industry, DTCC continues to assess calculators, tools, and enhanced access methods to support the expansion of U.S. Treasury clearing activity.</p>

<p class="paragraph"><span class="normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-US">Bridgewise,  the financial research intelligence platform for global securities, announced today the launch of a new fund analysis solution that will provide market-leading levels of detail into funds and their underlying assets. Powered by AI, Bridgewise will enable for  the first time deep analysis of fund holdings, past performance, and fee structure, providing coverage for the vast majority of funds on the market.

<p class="paragraph"><span class="normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-US">This is precisely the problem AI is well placed to solve.

There is no way for a human to provide a detailed fundamental analysis on each and every asset in popular funds, especially when some funds are composed of thousands of individual stocks. The time  it would take to complete such an analysis would quickly stretch to a full year or more. Our AI technologies not only allow for a previously unobtainable level of depth of fund analysis, but also nearly universal coverage of funds, each one with the same level  of detailed analysis along with buy/sell recommendations for the individual stocks in the fund.&rdquo;</span></span><span class="eop"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<title>Substantive Research’s Latest Survey Shows That Research Budgets Rise Globally For The First Time Since MiFID II</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li> <strong><em><span>H1 2024 research budgets increased both as a proportion of AUM as well as in absolute terms</span></em></strong> </li>
<li> <strong><em><span>As a proportion of assets managed, US budgets rose 15%, with European budgets also rising but by a more modest 4%</span></em></strong> </li>
<li> <strong><em><span>The survey indicates that the cycle of endless price depreciation and budget cuts across the board in investment research has come to an end&nbsp;</span></em></strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Substantive Research, the research and data spend analytics provider for the buy side, today publishes the findings of its latest survey into investment research pricing, budgeting and consumption, looking at how research spending has evolved during the first half of 2024.</span></p>
<p><span>The FCA&rsquo;s&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.fca.org.uk%2Fpublication%2Fconsultation%2Fcp24-7.pdf/1/010201909b6ef946-96cc3681-a4d9-4f26-88c9-76d68edee636-000000/fjPm2srx-Lt4cux1DN-Ke3w7Cyo=382" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>April 2024 Consultation Paper</span></a><span>&nbsp;on &ldquo;Payment Optionality for Investment Research&rdquo; has ignited a debate on whether asset managers in Europe can, or should return their research costs back to their end investors after six years of paying these costs from their own P&amp;Ls post-MiFID II. The proposed optionality from the FCA comes with many caveats and obligations, and the market views its adoption as being highly dependent on whether there will be push-back from end investors, as asset managers explore this option.</span></p>
<p><span>Substantive Research undertook its latest survey of the buy side to understand the impact that proposed payment optionality is having on the consumption of investment research, and how differences in US and European regulations affect pricing and payments.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Survey findings</span></strong></p>
<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fsubstantiveresearch.com%2Finsights-and-press%2Finvestment-research-budgets-slide-again-despite-imminent-rebundling-freedoms%2F/1/010201909b6ef946-96cc3681-a4d9-4f26-88c9-76d68edee636-000000/ksWNqVufGeoSH0HoU07RejuDu6U=382" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>Previous analysis</span></a><span>&nbsp;in 2023 had shown that budgets in the US had increased as a proportion of AUM, and dipped only very slightly in the UK/EU by the same measure. However, in monetary terms, budgets still fell by 6.5% globally as AUM was down across the universe surveyed.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>In the first half of 2024, Substantive Research&rsquo;s analysis has shown that budgets are increasing both as a proportion of AUM as well as in absolute terms:</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li> <span>As a proportion of assets managed, US budgets rose 15%, with European budgets also rising by a more modest 4%. This shows why politicians have been pressuring the UK and EU regulators to help European asset managers return these costs back to their end investor clients. As the cycle moves on, US research budgets bounce back much more quickly - their investment professionals have more money to spend on external research from brokers and independent providers.&nbsp;</span> </li>
<li> <span>Overall, in monetary terms budgets increased by 2.2%. &ldquo;Although a modest rise, this fundamentally changes the dynamics of the research market. Within that figure, some providers are increasing pricing and driving greater consumption of meetings and calls with their sector analysts. We are back to a market of winners and losers, instead of almost all research providers experiencing price deflation year after year,&rdquo;&nbsp;</span><strong><span>said Mike Carrodus, CEO, of Substantive Research</span></strong><span>.</span> </li>
<li> <span>Brokers still dominate research budgets, taking 85% of spend annually, which has decreased by 1% since 2023, with tooling and analytics solutions benefitting accordingly and growing from 4% to 5% of research budget allocations. Substantive predicts that spending on analytics and research tooling will accelerate in the next budgeting cycle for 2025 &ndash; interest is high and these vendors are climbing up the provider list.</span> </li>
<li> <span>Independent Research Providers (IRPs) and Expert Networks remain unchanged at 8% and 2% respectively of annual budgets on average.&nbsp;</span> </li>
<li> <span>Concentration of research budgets to the top 10 brokers rose very slightly from 54.8% to 54.9%, a key metric to monitor in future, to see if the FCA&rsquo;s reforms do indeed spur greater competition as desired.&nbsp;</span> </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Mike Carrodus, CEO of Substantive Research, commented:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;We saw last year that research budgets were stabilising and now we have the confirmation that the trend has turned. However, when compared with six years of price depreciation, this recovery does not take us anywhere near where research spending was pre-MiFID II. What this does do, is set the scene for the FCA&rsquo;s new rules later this summer, with the key question being &lsquo;Will the new FCA freedoms accelerate European research spending up to a US level and trend ahead?&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>He added:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>&ldquo;Much will depend on the reaction from the asset managers&rsquo; end investor clients, and even if research costs do end up chargeable to asset owners once again the new procurement rigour in research valuation and payments from the buy side is going nowhere. If this market is to reflate materially, there will need to be new demand for new asset classes, and new supply required to justify additional payments in future - a change in funding will not arbitrarily drive research pricing back to pre-MiFID II levels.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Universe of organisations covered in the study</span></strong><span>:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>60 asset management firms; 60%/40% Headquartered Europe/North America; Total AUM represented $20tr+; 75%/25% Long-only/Hedge Fund.</span></p>

<p><span><a name="_Hlk169771199"></a><a name="_Hlk169795384"></a><span>These Islamic BTL products are available to new and seasoned landlords who are British residents or UK expats. Instead of using interest, Offa&rsquo;s BTL product involves the Islamic finance principles of co-ownership-with-leasing. Customers acquire the property in partnership with Offa and make monthly payments to increase their share, over time owning it.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Another key feature of Offa&rsquo;s BTL product is that where a customer&rsquo;s rental income is not sufficient for the required affordability criteria for the BTL finance, Offa allows them to make up the difference with their personal monthly income (commonly known in the industry as top-slicing).</span></p>
<p><span>The service is available to anyone purchasing property in England and Wales aged 21 or over where the property&rsquo;s value is between &pound;60,000 and &pound;1 million. First-time landlords can also apply, and Offa&rsquo;s BTL solutions are also available for houses in multiple occupancy (HMOs).</span></p>
<p><span>Offa provides an ethical finance model designed in accordance with Islamic finance principles, which means not charging interest and investment into sectors deemed harmful to society &ndash; such as alcohol, tobacco, and the arms trade.</span></p>
<p><span>In April, Offa announced a &pound;100 million credit line for its bridge finance arm from a fund managed by UAE-based Gulf Islamic Investments Group (GII). The credit line is the largest of its kind outside of the Gulf, creating significant capacity for the Birmingham-headquartered business to expand and diversify its financial propositions in the UK property market.</span></p>
