Bridgewise launches AI-powered fund analysis platform with detailed insights, buy/sell recommendations, and added expert Deborah Fuhr to advisory board. <div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="paragraph"><span class="normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-US">Bridgewise,  the financial research intelligence platform for global securities, announced today the launch of a new fund analysis solution that will provide market-leading levels of detail into funds and their underlying assets. Powered by AI, Bridgewise will enable for  the first time deep analysis of fund holdings, past performance, and fee structure, providing coverage for the vast majority of funds on the market. Critically, Bridgewise&rsquo;s platform provides analysis in any language, helping to close barriers for global funds.</span></span><span class="eop"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph"><span class="normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-US">ETFs, mutual funds, and other similar vehicles have become some of the most popular choices for investors, with assets invested in the global ETFs industry  have increased </span></span><span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://etfgi.com/news/press-releases/2024/06/etfgi-reports-assets-invested-global-etfs-industry-reached-new-record" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span class="normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-US">10.8%  YTD in 2024, going from $11.63T at the end of 2023 to $12.89T</span></span></a></span><span class="normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-US">.<b> </b>However, due to the sheer number of assets held in funds, it hasn&rsquo;t been possible to provide comprehensive analysis, especially considering that less than 20% of global securities are covered by professional analysts.</span></span><span class="eop"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph"><span class="normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-US">This is precisely the problem AI is well placed to solve.

There is no way for a human to provide a detailed fundamental analysis on each and every asset in popular funds, especially when some funds are composed of thousands of individual stocks. The time  it would take to complete such an analysis would quickly stretch to a full year or more. Our AI technologies not only allow for a previously unobtainable level of depth of fund analysis, but also nearly universal coverage of funds, each one with the same level  of detailed analysis along with buy/sell recommendations for the individual stocks in the fund.&rdquo;</span></span><span class="eop"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph"><span class="normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-US">As part of Bridgwise&rsquo;s expansion into the funds market, the company has added Deborah Fuhr to its advisory board.

<p class="paragraph"><span class="normaltextrun"><b><span lang="EN-US">Deborah Fuhr says</span></b></span><span class="normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-US">, &ldquo;ETFs are  increasingly gaining popularity with retail investors and financial advisors around the world providing simple, liquid, transparent, cost efficient, diversified exposure to global markets, regions, countries, themes. At the end of May our research reported  the global ETFs industry has had 60 months or 5 years of consecutive monthly net inflows and the assets invested in the global ETFs industry reached a record of $12.89 trillion.&nbsp; Bridgewise is developing a solution to fill a growing need for detailed information  about mutual funds and ETFs to allow retail investors to make fully informed decisions.&rdquo;</span></span><span class="eop"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="paragraph"><span class="normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-US">For investors, the new fund analysis solution will provide a unique experience including interactive elements, contextual ratings, and other features designed  to help them find investment opportunities.

<p class="paragraph"><span class="normaltextrun"><b><span lang="EN-US">Alternatives Analysis</span></b></span><span class="normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-US"> - Interactive  comparisons of alternative funds make it easy for investors to choose the one that is right for them.</span></span><span class="eop"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<title>Substantive Research’s Latest Survey Shows That Research Budgets Rise Globally For The First Time Since MiFID II</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<ul>
<li> <strong><em><span>H1 2024 research budgets increased both as a proportion of AUM as well as in absolute terms</span></em></strong> </li>
<li> <strong><em><span>As a proportion of assets managed, US budgets rose 15%, with European budgets also rising but by a more modest 4%</span></em></strong> </li>
<li> <strong><em><span>The survey indicates that the cycle of endless price depreciation and budget cuts across the board in investment research has come to an end&nbsp;</span></em></strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Substantive Research, the research and data spend analytics provider for the buy side, today publishes the findings of its latest survey into investment research pricing, budgeting and consumption, looking at how research spending has evolved during the first half of 2024.</span></p>
<p><span>The FCA&rsquo;s&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.fca.org.uk%2Fpublication%2Fconsultation%2Fcp24-7.pdf/1/010201909b6ef946-96cc3681-a4d9-4f26-88c9-76d68edee636-000000/fjPm2srx-Lt4cux1DN-Ke3w7Cyo=382" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>April 2024 Consultation Paper</span></a><span>&nbsp;on &ldquo;Payment Optionality for Investment Research&rdquo; has ignited a debate on whether asset managers in Europe can, or should return their research costs back to their end investors after six years of paying these costs from their own P&amp;Ls post-MiFID II. The proposed optionality from the FCA comes with many caveats and obligations, and the market views its adoption as being highly dependent on whether there will be push-back from end investors, as asset managers explore this option.</span></p>
<p><span>Substantive Research undertook its latest survey of the buy side to understand the impact that proposed payment optionality is having on the consumption of investment research, and how differences in US and European regulations affect pricing and payments.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Survey findings</span></strong></p>
<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fsubstantiveresearch.com%2Finsights-and-press%2Finvestment-research-budgets-slide-again-despite-imminent-rebundling-freedoms%2F/1/010201909b6ef946-96cc3681-a4d9-4f26-88c9-76d68edee636-000000/ksWNqVufGeoSH0HoU07RejuDu6U=382" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>Previous analysis</span></a><span>&nbsp;in 2023 had shown that budgets in the US had increased as a proportion of AUM, and dipped only very slightly in the UK/EU by the same measure. However, in monetary terms, budgets still fell by 6.5% globally as AUM was down across the universe surveyed.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>In the first half of 2024, Substantive Research&rsquo;s analysis has shown that budgets are increasing both as a proportion of AUM as well as in absolute terms:</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li> <span>As a proportion of assets managed, US budgets rose 15%, with European budgets also rising by a more modest 4%. This shows why politicians have been pressuring the UK and EU regulators to help European asset managers return these costs back to their end investor clients. As the cycle moves on, US research budgets bounce back much more quickly - their investment professionals have more money to spend on external research from brokers and independent providers.&nbsp;</span> </li>
<li> <span>Overall, in monetary terms budgets increased by 2.2%. &ldquo;Although a modest rise, this fundamentally changes the dynamics of the research market. Within that figure, some providers are increasing pricing and driving greater consumption of meetings and calls with their sector analysts. We are back to a market of winners and losers, instead of almost all research providers experiencing price deflation year after year,&rdquo;&nbsp;</span><strong><span>said Mike Carrodus, CEO, of Substantive Research</span></strong><span>.</span> </li>
<li> <span>Brokers still dominate research budgets, taking 85% of spend annually, which has decreased by 1% since 2023, with tooling and analytics solutions benefitting accordingly and growing from 4% to 5% of research budget allocations. Substantive predicts that spending on analytics and research tooling will accelerate in the next budgeting cycle for 2025 &ndash; interest is high and these vendors are climbing up the provider list.</span> </li>
<li> <span>Independent Research Providers (IRPs) and Expert Networks remain unchanged at 8% and 2% respectively of annual budgets on average.&nbsp;</span> </li>
<li> <span>Concentration of research budgets to the top 10 brokers rose very slightly from 54.8% to 54.9%, a key metric to monitor in future, to see if the FCA&rsquo;s reforms do indeed spur greater competition as desired.&nbsp;</span> </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Mike Carrodus, CEO of Substantive Research, commented:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;We saw last year that research budgets were stabilising and now we have the confirmation that the trend has turned. However, when compared with six years of price depreciation, this recovery does not take us anywhere near where research spending was pre-MiFID II. What this does do, is set the scene for the FCA&rsquo;s new rules later this summer, with the key question being &lsquo;Will the new FCA freedoms accelerate European research spending up to a US level and trend ahead?&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>He added:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>&ldquo;Much will depend on the reaction from the asset managers&rsquo; end investor clients, and even if research costs do end up chargeable to asset owners once again the new procurement rigour in research valuation and payments from the buy side is going nowhere. If this market is to reflate materially, there will need to be new demand for new asset classes, and new supply required to justify additional payments in future - a change in funding will not arbitrarily drive research pricing back to pre-MiFID II levels.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Offa, the UK&rsquo;s first Sharia-compliant bridge finance fintech, has today launched an innovative new buy-to-let finance (BTL) service &ndash; with fast funding decisions delivered via a modern paperless process &ndash; aiming to disrupt and transform the traditionally old-fashioned and cumbersome world of Islamic finance.</span></p>
<p><span>Powered by the latest software, Offa&rsquo;s BTL service meets the needs of both Muslim and non-Muslim property investors with its flexible property finance solutions and end-to-end digital processes, making it fast and easy to apply and get a quick decision.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Sagheer Malik, Offa&rsquo;s Chief Commercial Officer</span>&nbsp;and MD&nbsp;<span>of Retail Finance, said: &ldquo;Offa is all about a high-quality modern service and speed is crucial in real estate. With the launch of our ultra-quick buy-to-let service, combined with our teams&rsquo; decades of industry experience, we are bringing Islamic finance into the 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;century, leaving behind the onerous paperwork and cumbersome systems that many customers have typically suffered in the past.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;Our streamlined digital application process &ndash; which is unparalleled in the Islamic finance market &ndash; means clients can potentially get a fair decision within minutes, depending on credit rating and risk criteria.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span><a name="_Hlk169771199"></a><a name="_Hlk169795384"></a><span>These Islamic BTL products are available to new and seasoned landlords who are British residents or UK expats. Instead of using interest, Offa&rsquo;s BTL product involves the Islamic finance principles of co-ownership-with-leasing. Customers acquire the property in partnership with Offa and make monthly payments to increase their share, over time owning it.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Another key feature of Offa&rsquo;s BTL product is that where a customer&rsquo;s rental income is not sufficient for the required affordability criteria for the BTL finance, Offa allows them to make up the difference with their personal monthly income (commonly known in the industry as top-slicing).</span></p>
<p><span>The service is available to anyone purchasing property in England and Wales aged 21 or over where the property&rsquo;s value is between &pound;60,000 and &pound;1 million. First-time landlords can also apply, and Offa&rsquo;s BTL solutions are also available for houses in multiple occupancy (HMOs).</span></p>
<p><span>Offa provides an ethical finance model designed in accordance with Islamic finance principles, which means not charging interest and investment into sectors deemed harmful to society &ndash; such as alcohol, tobacco, and the arms trade.</span></p>
<p><span>In April, Offa announced a &pound;100 million credit line for its bridge finance arm from a fund managed by UAE-based Gulf Islamic Investments Group (GII). The credit line is the largest of its kind outside of the Gulf, creating significant capacity for the Birmingham-headquartered business to expand and diversify its financial propositions in the UK property market.</span></p>
