<div> Financial stability risks, global stablecoins, regulatory challenges, EMDEs, macro-financial risks <br />
Summary: Global stablecoins pose financial stability risks in EMDEs due to regulatory challenges, capacity constraints, and cross-border operations. <div>
<p class="post-subheading">EMDEs may be exposed to macro-financial risks arising from the use of foreign currency pegged global stablecoins (GSC), which can increase financial stability risks by destabilising financial flows and straining fiscal resources.</p>
<p><span class="post-content"> </span></p>
<p>The collapse and de-peg of certain stablecoins since the outbreak of the crypto-asset market turmoil in 2022 highlights the potential fragility of stablecoins that are not adequately designed and regulated. Stablecoins also present concerns related to financial integrity, illicit finance, data privacy, cyber-security, consumer and investor protections, market integrity, fiscal stability, and macroeconomic stability. While these risks and challenges are global, some emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) may be exposed to additional risks and challenges associated with global stablecoin (GSC) activities.</p>
<p>There are several factors that can amplify regulatory implementation challenges for EMDEs, including capacity and resource constraints, the prevalence of foreign currency pegged stablecoins, and extensive cross-border operations of foreign currency pegged stablecoins. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This report explores potential factors driving the higher level of activities related to foreign currency-pegged stablecoins in EMDEs, their associated financial stability risks and regulatory challenges, and provides considerations to address them.</p>

<p><span><span>Aurojyoti Bose, Lead Analyst at GlobalData, comments:<strong>&nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;Both JP Morgan and Houlihan Lokey registered improvement in terms of value and volume ranking by the respective metrics in H1 2024 compared to H1 2023.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>JP Morgan&rsquo;s ranking by value took a big jump from 14th position in H1 2023 to the top spot in H1 2023. This can be attributed to the fact that the average size of deals advised by JP Morgan, which was just $180.7 million in H1 2023, stood much higher at $1.1 billion in H1 2024. Meanwhile, Houlihan Lokey was able to improve its ranking by volume from third position in H1 2023 to the top position in H1 2024.&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<div> Baader Bank, Spectrum Markets, partnership, retail brokers, Germany <br />
Summary: Baader Bank partners with Spectrum Markets to facilitate client trades, expand retail investor access, and offer extended trading hours in Germany. <div>
<ul>
<li>Baader will serve as an intermediary and facilitate client&rsquo;s trades on Spectrum&rsquo;s trading venue</li>
<li>Partnership enables Spectrum to access a larger network of retail brokers across Germany</li>
<li>German retail investors will benefit from Spectrum&rsquo;s innovative features, including extended traded hours and an expanded product offering</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spectrum Markets (&ldquo;Spectrum&rdquo;), the pan-European trading venue for securities, announces today that Baader Bank, a leading provider of securities and banking services in Europe, becomes a new trading member.</p>
<p>With over four decades of trading securities, Baader Bank offers seamless access to capital markets to its partners and institutional investors through secure, efficient, and integrated trading platforms. Notably, Baader has significantly expanded its retail broker client base in recent years, which will help bolster Spectrum&rsquo;s presence in Germany.</p>
<p>As part of this strategic collaboration, the Germany-based securities and banking services company will serve as an intermediary, facilitating clients&rsquo; trades on to Spectrum Markets&rsquo; trading venue.</p>
<p>Baader&rsquo;s brokers will gain access to Spectrum&rsquo;s pioneering technology with simplified connectivity for new trading partners joining Spectrum, which speeds up the onboarding process and reduces unnecessary costs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another key driver of the partnership is the growing demand for extended trading hours among Baader clients, which is a trend Spectrum sees gathering momentum across the European retail investment landscape. Trading via Spectrum enables retail investors to trade outside of traditional hours, thanks to the venue&rsquo;s 24/5 trading capabilities, while remaining within a regulated trading environment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The team at Spectrum is delighted to join forces with Baader Bank, as it underscores our commitment to providing European retail investors a superior trading experience compared to other market players. Through Baader, brokers will enjoy access to a broader range of products, during extended hours, on a regulated trading venue. We are seeing a global shift in demand for round-the-clock trading, and this partnership means that Spectrum can tap into Baader&rsquo;s extensive network but also expands our presence in Germany,&rdquo; said Nicky Maan, CEO of Spectrum Markets.</p>

<div> Collaboration, QuantHouse, Quod Financial, AI-driven trading, market data
Summary:
QuantHouse and Quod Financial partner to use high-quality data for AI-driven trading optimization, enabling real-time transaction cost analysis and improved trade executions. <br /><br /> <div>
<p><span><span>Iress today announced that its QuantHouse division has entered into a strategic global partnership with Quod Financial, a leading provider of multi-asset trading technology. Through the collaboration, QuantHouse will supply its low-latency and historical market data to Quod Financial for use within backtesting and to refine its AI-driven trading algorithms, enabling trading firms to carry out real-time, highly accurate transaction cost analysis (TCA) at the point of execution.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span></span><span>QuantHouse&rsquo;s Head of EMEA Sales and Business Development, Rob Kirby, said: &ldquo;In today&rsquo;s trading environment, financial institutions are actively exploring and adopting the latest advances in AI and machine learning (ML) to enhance trading outcomes. The key challenge with deploying these latest innovations into the trading environment is that AI-driven algorithms can only be as accurate as the data on which AI systems are trained.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&ldquo;QuantHouse&rsquo;s high-quality, extensive historical data is now being used to train QuodFinancial&rsquo;s AI/ML models to adapt to, and even anticipate market movements. Traders no longer need to adjust their TCA assumptions or trading strategies manually when unexpected market events happen. They can now analyse the cost associated with each trade, optimise trading strategies and ultimately improve trade executions right at the point where it is needed most: as part of the trade execution.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span></span><span>&ldquo;We are very excited about this collaboration and look forward to working together to empower market participants with the right data for AI-driven trading optimisation.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span></span><span>Quod Financial&rsquo;s Chief Revenue Officer, Medan Gabbay, said: &ldquo;In financial services, the performance of your technology is defined by the quality and speed of the data that powers your systems. This has never been more true or more important than now, as we go through a transition of data automation and AI/ML. QuantHouse has proven to be an exceptional partner in this data journey.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<title>Kiwoom Asset Management Launches Two ETFs Targeting The North American Battery And Semiconductor Supply Chains Operated By South Korean Companies Tracking Two Solactive Indices</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> collaboration, Solactive, Kiwoom Asset Management, South Korean companies, North American supply chain
Summary:<br /><br />Solactive collaborates with Kiwoom Asset Management to provide indices for new ETFs focusing on South Korean companies in the North American semiconductor and battery supply chains. <div>
<p><strong>Solactive is pleased to expand its collaboration with Kiwoom Asset Management by providing the underlying indices to the KIWOOM KOSEF K-Battery North America Supply Chain and the KIWOOM KOSEF K-Semiconductor North America Supply Chain. &nbsp;The Solactive K-Battery North America Supply Chain Index and the Solactive K-Semiconductor North America Supply Chain Index track the performance of South Korean companies that are key players in the supply chain for the North American semiconductor and battery industries.</strong></p>
<p>Both the semiconductor and battery manufacturing industries are benefiting from tailwinds from the U.S. legislative initiatives such as the Inflation Reduction and CHIPS Acts that are aimed at strengthening supply chains in these critical technologies. This is likely to create opportunities for South Korean companies with strong technological expertise and extensive experience in both sectors to expand their market presence in North America.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.solactive.com/indices/?index=DE000SL0L284">Solactive K-Battery North America Supply Chain Index</a>&nbsp;tracks the performance of the 15 eligible South Korea-listed companies with the highest topical exposure to the battery supply chain in North America. The constituents are selected based on their topical score according to ARTIS<span>&Ograve;</span>&nbsp;&ndash; Solactive&rsquo;s proprietary natural language processing tool for determining thematic exposures &ndash; and the relative revenue generated from North American sales. The index basket encompasses companies with considerable exposure in advanced battery lithium-based technologies, lithium-integrated storage solutions, lithium mobility and vehicle integration, as well as sustainable lithium battery lifecycle management.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.solactive.com/indices/?index=DE000SL0L250">Solactive K-Semiconductor North America Supply Chain Index</a>&nbsp;tracks the performance of the top 15 eligible South Korea-listed companies operating in the semiconductor supply chain for North America. The selection is based on a granular sector classification framework and also considers the relative revenue generated from North American sales. Index constituents include companies from the following highly relevant industries: semiconductor manufacturing, semiconductor equipment and services, industrial materials manufacturing, and IC-level intellectual property software libraries.</p>
<p><strong>The KIWOOM KOSEF K-Battery North America Supply Chain and KIWOOM KOSEF K-Semiconductor North America Supply Chain listed on 23 July 2024 on the Korea Stock Exchange (KRX) with the ticker code 488200.KS and 488210.KS.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Timo Pfeiffer, Chief Markets Officer at Solactive, comment</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ed</span>&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;We are excited to collaborate with Kiwoom Asset Management by providing tailor made index solutions designed to ensure optimal coverage of the selected strategic themes with fully rules-based indices as underlyings for these new ETFs. The ETFs offer investors unique exposure to many fast-growing application fields such as electric vehicles, consumer electronics or renewable energies and energy storage.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Seongin Jeong, Head of ETF Business Department at Kiwoom Asset Management, commented:</span>&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;The semiconductor and secondary battery industries are where Korea&rsquo;s leading companies are globally competitive. With the U.S.&rsquo;s attempt to strengthen the industry supply chain, Korean companies closely connected to the North American supply chain are expected to benefit.&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;<em>These two products, created in collaboration with Solactive, offer an approach to investing in the Korean semiconductor and secondary battery industries with a focus on the North American supply chain. We look forward to providing global investors with new investment opportunities in the Korean semiconductor and secondary battery industries.&rdquo;</em></p>

<div> charged, market manipulation, ASIC, pump and dump, shares <br />
Summary: ASIC has charged four people with market manipulation for their involvement in a coordinated scheme to pump up shares before dumping them. <div>
<p>Following an ASIC investigation, four people have been criminally charged for their alleged involvement in a coordinated scheme to pump up shares in Australian stock values before dumping them at inflated prices.</p>
<p>Syed Yusuf, Larissa Quinlan, Emma Summer, and Kurt Stuart were charged in the Downing Centre Local Court with conspiracy to commit market rigging and false trading, to artificially increase the price of Australian shares before dumping them.</p>
<p>They face a maximum penalty of 15 years&rsquo; imprisonment and a fine of over $1million for market manipulation.</p>
<p>ASIC alleges that in an organised operation the defendants formed a private group on the Telegram app where they discussed and selected penny stocks to announce to the public Telegram group named the &lsquo;ASX Pump and Dump Group.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The defendants have also been charged with dealing with the proceeds of crime in relation to the money that they each obtained from selling the shares subject of the pump and dump activity.</p>
<p>ASIC Chair Joe Longo said, &lsquo;Market manipulation is illegal. Pump and dump schemes are a form of financial fraud, eroding investor wealth, threatening the integrity of our markets and potentially the Australian economy more broadly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Upholding the integrity of our Australia&rsquo;s financial markets is a priority for ASIC.</p>
<p>&lsquo;ASIC monitors the cleanliness of our markets, and we take decisive action to disrupt activities that may impact cleanliness. This is why we took the action of entering social media forums and posting directly to issue warnings to members that their actions may be in breach of the law. Coordinated attempts to manipulate the market is a criminal offence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This matter is being prosecuted by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions after a referral from ASIC in December 2022.</p>
<p>The matter was adjourned to 30 July 2024 in the Downing Centre Local Court for a detention application to be made in respect of each of the defendants.</p>
<h2>Background&nbsp;</h2>
<p>ASIC monitors trading on Australian licensed markets through its sophisticated real-time surveillance system and by integrating trade data with data from third parties to monitor pump and dump activity in Australian securities markets. This enables ASIC to see underlying clients, to identify networks of connected parties and to analyse trading patterns.</p>
<p>Over three weeks in September 2021, nine announcements were made to the &lsquo;ASX Pump and Dump Group&rsquo; to boost the selected stocks. The defendants allegedly purchased some or all of the stocks with the intention to &lsquo;pump&rsquo; the share price to an artificial target and then sell them once the price of the stock had substantially increased.</p>
<p>In October 2021, ASIC warned traders in a Telegram share market chat room they may be breaking the law by seeking to organise stock price manipulation (<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2021-releases/21-256mr-asic-warns-of-social-media-led-pump-and-dump-campaigns/" title="21-256MR ASIC warns of social media led &lsquo;pump and dump&rsquo; campaigns">21-256MR</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each of the defendants purchased some, but not all, of the stocks that they had conspired to announce to the members of the &lsquo;ASX Pump and Dump Group&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The defendants are charged with dealing with the proceeds of crime in relation to the money that they each obtained from selling the shares subject of the pump and dump activity pursuant to s 400.4(1) of the Criminal Code, and conspiracy to commit market rigging and false trading, pursuant to s 11.5(1) of the Criminal Code (Cth) and s 1041B(1)(b) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).</p>

<div> Insurance, Regulatory outlook, Legislation, FMA, Conduct of Financial Institutions<br />
Summary: FMA's Head of Insurance provides updates on regulatory outlook, Conduct of Financial Institutions, Credit regulation, and evolving regulatory approach. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>E ngā iwi, e ngā karangatanga, te iti me te rahi, tēna koutou, tēna tatou.</p>
<p>Thank you, David, it&rsquo;s a pleasure to be here to provide an update on our regulatory outlook and priorities.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s been a pretty eventful year as I&rsquo;m sure all of you are well aware. There is no shortage of topics to cover. I am going to try to cover as much as I can, and we can always mop up anything else in the Q and A.</p>
<p>I do want to start by speaking a little bit about myself. This is the first formal speech I&rsquo;ve given since I joined the FMA as Head of Insurance. My background, like many of you in this room, is in the law. I started my career in-house at a very small local government insurer, which is actually how I met David, who did some work for the superannuation side of the business. I was then General Counsel at Te Kahui Inihua o Aotearoa/ The Insurance Council of New Zealand for six years, before I joined the FMA in October last year.</p>
<p>It has been a pleasure, and an exciting challenge, to help establish and set up the FMA&rsquo;s Insurance team, as we prepare to implement CoFI.</p>
<p>When I first accepted the FMA role, there were many jokes about me &ldquo;turning to the dark side&rdquo;. While I was never fully convinced about which was &ldquo;dark&rdquo; and which &ldquo;light&rdquo;, I can confirm that working for the regulator is definitely not a dull experience. I have been heartened to meet so many passionate and clever people in my new role, people that have a genuine focus on supporting a financial system which consumers have trust and confidence in.</p>
<p>I never fail to be impressed by my team in particular, and their depth of knowledge about regulation and supervision, and I&rsquo;m proud to be able to supplement their knowledge and experience with some of the things I have learnt from my time in the insurance industry. One of the learnings I have from that time, is that the regulator and regulated at their most basic level, have remarkably similar goals &ndash; trust and confidence from the consumers that access their products and services. Without that, we cannot have an effective financial sector.</p>
<p>Changes proposed by Government bring conduct regulation across the life-cycle of consumers&rsquo; experience of financial services</p>
<p>There have been a series of changes announced by the Government in recent months. The most significant being the decision to proceed with the Conduct of Financial Institutions regime, and also to transfer regulation of Credit from the Commerce Commission to the FMA.</p>
<p>The inclusion of core banking and insurance as well as credit, combined with our establishment mandate for financial advice and investments means that all the financial products that touch most people&rsquo;s lives will soon be supervised by the FMA.</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting loans to help you through, for that big purchase like your car</li>
<li>Buying your first home</li>
<li>Insuring your home, yourself, your livelihood, your family, your pets</li>
<li>Saving for your own, or for your kids&rsquo; education</li>
<li>Getting quality financial advice to help you make the best decisions for your own circumstances</li>
<li>Investing for your retirement through KiwiSaver, or your future goals through other investments.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of these significant moments in the lives of New Zealanders will be covered by a conduct regulator whose vision is to foster the fairest financial system in the world. It&rsquo;s a big responsibility and a big goal, and we take it very seriously. It&rsquo;s why I was so energised to join the culture at the FMA, that shares my own determination to make a difference.</p>
<p>Conduct of Financial Institutions</p>
<p>When we think about COFI, we don&rsquo;t immediately see a list of new compliance obligations for firms. We see a varied, diverse, and wide range of different businesses across the motu. All of these businesses have relationships with customers, shareholders and communities that make a meaningful difference to people&rsquo;s lives. We understand that each of these businesses have their own strategies, target markets, product offerings and customers. They will also range from multinational enterprises to local, regional businesses. They have different capital footprints and revenue streams, different risk and governance models.</p>
<p>COFI is designed to accommodate all of the above, and the way FMA implements new legislative regimes is accommodating. We do not, and never have, taken a one-size fits all approach.</p>
<p>We are currently engaging closely with a wide variety of firms who will need a CoFI licence. We have proactively engaged with smaller firms in particular, such as non-bank deposit takers and Credit Unions.</p>
<p>Because of this, we know which firms are on track, and which may need more support in the weeks and months ahead. We will be working with those firms who need our help in the lead up to March next year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Working with my frontline colleagues in the Advice function at the FMA, we have learnt and adopted some major lessons from the introduction, transition and bedding in of the new financial advice regime in the last few years.</p>
<p>Just as we have acknowledged the efforts of the advice sector &ndash; in their thousands &ndash; to work with us in implementing FSLAA, we also recognise the efforts and resource that firms are putting into their preparation and applications for COFI. This is not only an investment into their future license to operate, we also strongly believe that demonstrating your ability to meet the standards in COFI and ensure the fair treatment of customers, will also contribute to greater trust and confidence in financial services.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to close this section on CoFI by making some observations based on where we are in the licensing process:</p>
<p>We know there are some firms who have told us that they are likely to seek an exemption to requiring a fair conduct programme. We also know of some firms who have indicated to us that they are likely to seek an exemption from the regime as a whole. I would really encourage those firms to have a Plan B in terms of getting a CoFI licence. The law is very clear about what is expected.</p>
<p>I also want to remind people that the date for firms to have a CoFI licence is fixed for March 2025. If you are a firm who needs a CoFI licence, and do not have this by April 2025, you will not be able to offer financial services to your retail customers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good to see that we have already processed and approved three complete license applications for COFI. These are from smaller firms which demonstrates that our process is designed to meet the needs of all participants. We will ensure that everyone that gets their application to us, in time, will be dealt with individually and in time. But please do not leave this until the last minute.</p>
<p>Credit</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Minister Andrew Bayly announced his intention to transfer the regulation of Consumer Credit to the FMA.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in a room full of financial markets lawyers. I&rsquo;m sure all of you will be more than well aware of the amount of work that is now going on behind the scenes in order to make this happen. We are not getting ahead of ourselves, as there are many details and a legislative process to go through. We are well engaged with policy makers and the Commerce Commission. We don&rsquo;t underestimate the task in hand. We want to acknowledge the significant work the Commerce Commission has achieved in this space over many years, and will accept the role of Kaitiaki, guardianship, they will be handing over to us with respect.</p>
<p>Changes coming highlight the importance of the Council of Financial Regulators, where we work with our partners to maintain a coordinated approach to our interactions with firms. In particular with the RBNZ, our partner in the Twin Peaks model, where we will focus on ensuring industry experiences a streamlined approach from RBNZ in its role as prudential regulator, and from the FMA in our role over conduct and disclosure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve touched on two of the big changes coming over the next year. I&rsquo;d like to also speak a little to how our regulatory approach is developing.</p>
<p>Now I know that you are a crowd that likes to get into the detail. Even then, I&rsquo;d be surprised if you were all to have read our Statement of Intent. I&rsquo;d like to briefly summarise it, because it gives you a good sense of where and what we are aiming for in the years ahead.</p>
<p>We now have four key objectives that underline our strategic direction and approach to implementation, supervision, engagement, and enforcement.</p>
<ul>
<li>Evolving our outcomes approach</li>
<li>Evolving our intelligence led approach</li>
<li>Deterring harmful unregulated activities</li>
<li>Deterring misleading and deceptive practices.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Distilling our focus areas into these four major themes is an important way to focus our resources and activities in the right areas and for the most effective impact for consumers and markets. These are both the foundational pillars and the primary lens through which we deliver our risk-based intelligence led approach.</p>
<p>We have been thinking very carefully about how we can supervise and engage with the entities we regulate in a more consistent way across every sector. We want to ensure supervision is forward-looking, risk-based and efficient, reduces unnecessary regulatory burden (we hear you!) and focuses on the outcomes that we believe are vital to consumers and markets.</p>
<p>An outcomes-focused approach also means that our primary attention is to prevent conduct that is harmful to consumers and markets. This approach is consistent with both international best practice and our legislative requirements, and we are currently looking at how we need to change the ways we work internally to reflect this new approach to supervision.</p>
<p>We intend to publish the next iteration of our outcomes-focused approach in the Spring. We have been carefully considering the feedback from industry and stakeholders and ensuring that we listen to points that have been raised. We will be making it particularly clear that an outcomes-focused approach is about making sure the FMA&rsquo;s own work is forward-looking and risk- based, and is not a new set of requirements for the industry.</p>
<p>One of the other ways our regulatory approach is developing is in the ways we are thinking about the costs and benefits of our regulatory approach. Where it&rsquo;s appropriate, and where we are able, we&rsquo;ll look to remove unnecessary burden, and we always remain alert to how our actions can impact firms.</p>
<p>A good example of this was our consultation earlier this year on a class exemption for green bonds. Industry had told us they wanted a more efficient route to market for these green, social and sustainability bonds. Our consultation was looking for feedback on whether our proposal provides the right balance of allowing issuers to get to market quickly, and cost-effectively, while still ensuring that investors are given information they will find timely, accurate, and valuable in making investment decisions. We're keen to know where we can take an outcomes-focused approach to remove potential barriers, and work with industry to enable innovation and flexibility.</p>
<p>Demonstrating the findings and outputs from our monitoring and supervisory approach is critical to support industry and show them practices we observe working well or areas for improvement. We published insights from our monitoring of the advice sector in the first couple of years of the new regime. This was a timely summary of our monitoring in the advice sector through the transition and in the first year of the new regime. We provided a balanced report with examples of good practice to help other firms demonstrate good conduct, and meet their obligations, and also some areas that need improvement.</p>
<p>In line with our intelligence-led approach we have shared results from an in-depth research study into New Zealanders views and understanding of fairness in financial services.</p>
<p>The research centres on a consumer survey of approximately 3,000 New Zealanders who answered a range of questions about fairness. The research is intended to support evidence-based conversations with industry and stakeholders on what fair treatment means.&nbsp;&nbsp;The research is not guidance for financial service providers.&nbsp;There are some useful scenarios that people were asked to assess for being fair or unfair. The responses were remarkably consistent in showing a generally agreed view of what fairness means to consumers.</p>
<p>Another upcoming change that most of you in the room will be familiar with, is the Contracts of Insurance Bill. I won&rsquo;t make the same old joke about how it&rsquo;s been 20+ years getting to this point with the legislation, but I will say how pleased we are to see this important piece of work advancing. There has been a lot of movement in the law, so we know there are parts of the legislation that could do with clarification and modernisation, and consolidation of the five Acts will make the law more accessible and understandable.</p>
<p>There are parts of the Bill that will mean changes for insurers. The new disclosure provisions and rules relating to unfair contracts terms will require some getting used to, and as regulator for this piece of legislation, the FMA is already thinking about the guidance that could be helpful to support implementation of the Bill.</p>
<p>These changes will help achieve the Bill&rsquo;s purpose of promoting the confident and informed participation of all stakeholders in Aotearoa&rsquo;s insurance market. The Bill, once passed, will also amend the Financial Markets Conduct Act to impose duties on insurers to help consumers understand insurance policies, and provide regulation-making powers relating to the form and presentation of policy wordings and making sure information is publicly available.</p>
<p>I believe these are positive changes for the industry. We all know that insurance is a complex topic and despite simplification of documentation and improvements in the use of plain English, policies are not well understood. We hope these proposed changes will uplift overall consumer understanding, which, going back to my opening comments, helps build that overall trust and confidence that the industry needs in order to thrive.</p>
<p>Concluding paragraphs</p>
<p>I am aware, from my time at ICNZ, and now at the FMA, that for everyone in the financial services industry, the last few years have been a period of significant change.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not just about the COVID pandemic. There has been the new financial advice regime, the conduct and culture reviews, the CoFI regime, Climate Related Disclosures, the upcoming transfer of Credit from the Commerce Commission to the FMA.</p>
<p>There is further change to come &ndash; for example, we are working on the Government&rsquo;s plans for a single conduct licence.</p>
<p>I think it is worth remembering that we all want the same end result. That is for businesses to grow successfully, and support their customers by treating them fairly and putting their interests at the heart of their decision-making. For those professionals that help industry with financial services regulation, we understand and support the work you do. We know that keeping an open dialogue with all our stakeholders will be critical to our success in both the short-term, delivering the up-coming changes, but also the long-term, in order to foster the fairest financial sector in the world.</p>
<p>I welcome any questions you may have.</p>

<div> elections, hedge fund, capital, global, strategy
Summary:<br />Capital in hedge funds reached $4.31 trillion, with increased investment in fixed income, credit, arbitrage, and macro strategies. Managers navigate geopolitical risks. <br /> <div>
<p>Hedge fund capital extended the recent rise, narrowly surpassing the historic 1Q record and advancing further above the historic $4.3 trillion milestone in 2Q24 with managers navigating and positioning for an evolving, fluid, complex election cycle and geopolitical environment. Upcoming elections throughout Europe and upcoming US elections represent a significant risk of policy shifts, economic transition, trade adjustment and structural dislocations in coming months. These risks increased despite an improving economic outlook, acceleration of M&amp;A concurrent with expectations for continued moderation in inflation and interest rate increases by the US Federal Reserve,</p>
<p><span>Total hedge fund assets increased for the seventh consecutive quarter in 2Q 2024, rising to an estimated $4.31 trillion, representing a quarterly increase of approximately $11 billion, as reported today by HFR</span><sup>&reg;</sup><span>, the established global leader in the indexation, analysis and research of the global hedge fund industry, in the latest release of the&nbsp;</span><i style="font-family: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">HFR Global Hedge Fund Industry Report</i><span>. The growth in hedge fund capital was driven by 2Q performance-based gains and was lead by strategy asset inflows into Relative Value Arbitrage and Macro, which were offset by outflows in Equity Hedge and Event-Driven strategies.</span></p>
<p>The HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;advanced +5.0 percent in 1H24, led by directional Equity Hedge and uncorrelated Macro strategies, while the HFRI Asset Weighted Composite Index<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;advanced a similar +5.1 percent in 1H24, indicating a modest outperformance of larger funds over small to mid-sized funds for the period. The HFR Cryptocurrency Index returned +25.5 percent in 1H, with decline in 2Q moderating the gain of +45.3 percent in 1Q24.</p>
<p>As investors positioned for both interest rates reductions and increased geopolitical uncertainty, credit- and interest rate-sensitive fixed income-based Relative Value Arbitrage (RVA) strategies led both strategy asset increases and capital flows, with RVA capital increasing by an estimated $30.3 billion in 2Q, increasing total RV capital to an estimated $1.16 trillion. Multi-Strategy funds again led RVA asset increases in 2Q24, adding an estimated $20.1 billion of capital to end the quarter at $712 billion, including $10.3 billion of new capital inflows. The HFRI Relative Value Index (Asset Weighted) gained +3.9 percent in 1H24 with sub-strategy performance again led by the HFRI RV: Convertible Arbitrage Index, which advanced +5.5 percent.</p>
<p>Uncorrelated Macro strategies extended 1Q inflows with additional capital inflows of $2.6 billion bringing the 1H inflows to $4.4 billion; total Macro capital remained steady at $715 billion. The HFRI Macro Index Asset Weighted Index gained +6.1 percent in 1H24 though the Index was little changed for 2Q, after posting the largest quarterly gain in the last 20+ years in 1Q24. Multi-strategy funds also led Macro sub-strategy asset inflows for 2Q, with these receiving an estimated $5.0 billion of new investor capital, while the Quantitative, trend-following HFRI Macro: Systematic Diversified Index led Macro sub-strategy performance in 1H24, advancing +7.9 percent.</p>
<p>Event-Driven (ED) strategies, which categorically focus on out of favor, deep value equity and credit positions, experienced a small decrease of capital of $7.9 billion in 2Q on mixed, volatile performance across certain ED sub-strategies. The decline reduced total ED capital to $1.20 trillion, a small reduction from the prior quarter record but still representing an estimated increase of $40 billion for 1H24. ED sub-strategy asset decreases were once again concentrated in higher beta Shareholder Activist and Special Situations strategies, with these decreasing by $6.7 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, in 2Q24. The HFRI Event-Driven (Asset Weighted) Index gained +4.2 percent in 1H24 with sub-strategy gains led by the HFRI ED: Credit Arbitrage Index, which gained +5.9 percent.</p>
<p>Capital managed by Equity Hedge (EH) strategies declined in 2Q following the 1Q surge, with capital falling by $11 billion in 2Q after rising an estimated $69.2 billion in 1Q, bringing total EH capital to level of $1.24 trillion. EH sub-strategy asset decreases were led by Fundamental Value funds in 2Q, which fell by an estimated $9.2 billion for the quarter, bringing total EH: Fundamental Value capital to an estimated $697.6 billion. The HFRI Equity Hedge (Total) Index posted a strong gain of +6.1 percent in 1H24 after leading all strategy indices for 2023 with a gain of +11.4 percent. EH sub-strategy gains were led by the HFRI EH: Quantitative Directional Index, which surged +11.7 percent in 1H24.</p>
<p>Investors allocated new capital to smaller and new firms in 2Q, with these seeing inflows of $3.0 billion in 2Q while the industry&rsquo;s largest firms (managing greater than $5 billion) and mid-sized firms managing between $1 and $5 billion experienced estimated net outflows of $5.7 and $6.7 billion, respectively for the quarter. Combining these with 1Q flows, the largest firms experienced inflows of $8.7 billion in 1H24, while mid-sized firms managing between $1 and $5 billion experienced an outflow of $5.0 billion, and firms managing less than $1 billion experienced an estimated inflow of $3.5 billion.<span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Total hedge fund capital extended the recent gains with a more moderate gain in 2H, though still eclipsing the previous quarter record, increasing total global capital further above the $4.3 trillion milestone. Despite the continuation of the increasing trend, the composition of the growth and investor preferences by strategy shifted from the prior quarter with fixed income, credit, arbitrage, multi-strategy and macro funds leading recent asset increases. Even more so than the prior quarter, managers remained focused on unprecedented geopolitical and election risks and opportunities, with these not only including geopolitical/military conflict, but also including ongoing volatile inflation, interest rates and macroeconomic considerations which have dominated the past two years,&rdquo; stated Kenneth J. Heinz, President of HFR. &ldquo;The second quarter results reflect these increasing risks and a more balanced risk sentiment than 1Q, with managers navigating these thematic micro-cycles driven by shifting expectations for election results, policy changes, trade impacts, interest rate/inflation expectations and tension between extended equity valuations and the potential for continued growth. Investors and institutions are likely to increase commitments to managers positioned for these historic uncertain conditions and which have successfully navigated these cycles over the past year, with institutional investors seeking both access to these opportunities while protecting portfolios from volatility and risk.&rdquo;</p>

<div> survey, negotiation, digital automation, ISDA, derivatives<br />
<br />
The ISDA survey shows that negotiation times for derivatives documents haven't decreased since 2006. Delays are caused by resource constraints, regulatory pressures, and operational challenges. Digital automation tools are used, but manual processes are still common. ISDA platforms, such as MyLibrary and ISDA Clause Library, are utilized, but manual intervention continues. Summary: The ISDA survey highlights stagnant negotiation times for derivatives documents since 2006, caused by various challenges. Digital automation tools are used, but manual processes still prevail. <div>
<p>ISDA has published its survey on document negotiation, which shows the average time taken to negotiate key derivatives documents hasn&rsquo;t fallen since 2006, with some negotiations taking longer due to resource constraints, regulatory pressures and operational challenges.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/07/22/isda-document-negotiation-survey/">ISDA Document Negotiation Survey</a>&nbsp;collects and reports data on the composition, negotiation and digital automation of ISDA documentation. The results, which are based on responses from 42 institutions, most of which are banks or broker-dealers, suggest there has been no improvement in negotiation times for ISDA Master Agreements and related credit support documentation since 2006.</p>
<p>The survey highlights delays in the negotiation of initial margin (IM) credit support annexes (CSAs) that have been caused by the requirement to segregate IM with a third-party custodian. Practical challenges in setting up custodial arrangements were cited by 25 respondents as a cause of delays in negotiating IM CSAs, account control agreements and eligible collateral schedules. Other factors causing delays include provisions governing the relationship with custodial documents and eligible collateral.</p>
<p>The survey also asked participants about their use of digital automation tools, in order to identify progress in transitioning contract lifecycle management systems and processes to new technologies and automated data solutions. While 30 respondents &ndash; more than 70% &ndash; reported&nbsp; &nbsp;using some form of digital automation, with data capture being the most frequently cited use case, nearly half of respondents said they still exclusively use manual processes for data capture. Many other firms still use manual intervention in combination with digital automation.</p>
<p>Respondents were also asked about their use of certain ISDA platforms, with 20 firms stating that they use the MyLibrary digital documentation platform during negotiations, and 13 confirming they use the ISDA Clause Library. However, the survey confirmed that manual intervention continues in many documentation processes. The ISDA Create contract negotiation platform can address key issues such as negotiation times, data capture and resource constraints.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ISDA Document Negotiation Survey truly underscores the business case for greater digitization of derivatives documentation. Firms can realize significant efficiencies and savings by embracing digital platforms, which in turn enables them to onboard new business more quickly. By moving negotiations to ISDA Create, they can reduce negotiation times, capture contractual data and free up precious resources,&rdquo; said Katherine Tew Darras, ISDA&rsquo;s General Counsel.</p>

<div> Redesigned, Cboe, Variance Futures, S&amp;P 500, Exchange-listed
Summary: Cboe launches redesigned S&amp;P 500 Variance Futures to simplify trading, offer central clearing, align with SPX options, and address customer feedback. <br /><br /> <div>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Newly redesigned product aims to bring OTC variance swaps trading to the exchange-listed market</li>
<li>Simplifies trading and settlement, while offering benefits of price discovery, central clearing and liquidity</li>
<li>Product addresses customer feedback and improves upon Cboe's previous variance futures offerings</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cboe Global Markets, Inc. (Cboe: CBOE), the world's leading derivatives and securities exchange network, today announced plans to launch a newly redesigned Cboe S&amp;P 500 Variance Futures contract (Ticker: VA), which is expected to begin trading on September 23, 2024, subject to regulatory review.</p>
<p>The Cboe S&amp;P 500 Variance Futures contracts will settle based on a calculation<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;of the annualized realized variance of the S&amp;P 500 Index. The realized variance will be calculated once each day from a series of values of the S&amp;P 500 Index beginning with the closing index value on the first day a VA futures contract is listed for trading and ending with the special opening quotation (SOQ) of the S&amp;P 500 Index on the final settlement date of that contract.</p>
<p>Cboe's new VA futures aim to introduce a simplified approach to variance trading and settlement, providing an exchange-listed alternative to over-the-counter (OTC) variance swaps. Market participants may use these futures in connection with calculating forward implied volatility, managing and hedging against volatility risks, or expressing directional views. Trading within a regulated and transparent on-exchange environment, VA futures are designed to also provide market participants with the additional benefits of price discovery, central clearing and an easily accessible structure.</p>
<p>Cboe introduced its first S&amp;P 500 variance futures product in 2004, followed by several iterations in the following years. The latest product improves upon Cboe's previous offerings and aims to address feedback from a broad spectrum of market participants. As such, the redesigned futures leverage a more straightforward methodology and will quote and trade directly in variance units with a contract size of $1<sup>2</sup>, allowing for easier calculations and position management. Furthermore, the new VA futures correspond to and expire on the same dates as standard S&amp;P 500 Index (SPX) options, which settle on the third Friday of the month. This alignment is expected to offer investors enhanced flexibility in managing variance exposure and implementing more precise hedging and trading strategies.</p>
<p>"Our relaunch of Cboe S&amp;P 500 Variance Futures is another example of Cboe continually refining its offerings to meet customer demand," said Rob Hocking, Head of Product Innovation at Cboe. "Following our previous variance products, we have engaged in close dialogue with our clients to gather insights that have been instrumental in shaping this new iteration. We believe this new version will be more accessible, capital-efficient and user-friendly, providing a way to more easily replicate OTC variance swap exposures without the operational complexities. Additionally, the final phases of the Uncleared Margin Rules have increased the costs of holding OTC derivatives for some market participants. Given the broader regulatory landscape, we believe the current environment is ideal for this relaunch."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The new iteration of the Cboe S&amp;P 500 Variance Futures contract reinforces the S&amp;P 500's ongoing strength as the best single gauge of the U.S. equity market and its highly liquid ecosystem," said Tim Brennan, Head of Capital Markets at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. "By collaborating with Cboe, market participants will have another tool to further understand opportunities for managing variance as well as risks within the world's most liquid equity benchmark."</p>
<p>The new VA futures will be exclusively listed and traded on Cboe Futures Exchange, LLC (CFE), joining other prominent volatility futures, such as Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) futures and the planned launch of Weekly Options on Cboe Volatility Index Futures and Cboe S&amp;P 500 Dispersion Index (DSPX) futures, subject to regulatory review.</p>
<p>Cboe will be hosting a webinar on the key benefits and opportunities provided by the new Cboe S&amp;P 500 Variance Futures on Tuesday, July 23 at 8:30am ET. To register for the webinar, please&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4215950-1&amp;h=2028314482&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fcboe.zoom.us%2Fwebinar%2Fregister%2F5717213146669%2FWN_mbUECDQiSSWGpV2aVBoO_A&amp;a=click+here" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">click here</a>.

<title>Effectiveness Of Supervision Is Overall Good, The EBA Peer Review Report On The Definition Of Default Finds</title>

<div> Peer Review, Supervision, Definition of Default, EBA Guidelines, Credit Risk

Summary:
The EBA Peer Review found good effectiveness in supervising credit risk and the definition of default among six competent authorities. Recommendations for improvement were also identified.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<div>
<div>
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published a Peer Review on its&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/activities/single-rulebook/regulatory-activities/credit-risk/guidelines-application-definition" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><span>Guidelines on the application of the definition of default</span></a><span>.&nbsp; The Review found that the effectiveness of supervision in this area is good, in particular as regards the monitoring of internal ratings-based approach (IRBA) credit institutions. Supervision of the definition of default of credit institutions using the standardised approach (SA) is also good but more varied, reflecting the more dispersed nature of credit institutions and the relative predominance of IRBA credit institutions in terms of size and assets in different jurisdictions. The Report identifies a small number of follow-up measures/recommendations for certain competent authorities as well as best practices that would be of benefit for other competent authorities to adopt.</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>In the aftermath of the global financial crisis a harmonised definition of default was established in the EU as a key component in higher-quality and more uniform assessment of credit risk and calculation of risk-weighted assets, reducing the scope for regulatory arbitrage. The EBA was mandated to issue guidelines harmonising the definition of default of an obligor that is used for the purpose of the internal ratings-based approach for the calculation of capital requirements for credit risk as well as for the standardised approach.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The Report includes findings on the supervision of credit risk of six competent authorities, focusing on application of the definition of default and the EBA Guidelines across three major areas:</p>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li> implementation of the EBA Guidelines&nbsp; in the supervisory framework; </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li> effectiveness of the procedure for the submission of the application; </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li> effectiveness of the assessment for checking compliance with the definition of default.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
</div>
<br />
<div>
<p>While some EU IRBA banks are under the supervision of a national competent authority (in conjunction with the European Central Bank - ECB), the majority are under the direct supervision of the ECB. The ECB has developed a detailed and thorough approach towards definition of default supervision, including documentation for the submission of definition of default applications. Regarding the&nbsp; supervision of the definition of default of credit institutions using the standardised approach, the Review has identified scope for additional consideration by competent authorities, alongside best practices to further strengthen supervision. These include:&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li> considering and documenting the elements used to determine the basis of risk-based supervision of the definition of default and/or the supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP) assessments; </li>
</ul>
</div>
<br />
<div>
<ul>
<li> potential alignment of self-assessment questionnaires on the definition of default submitted to banks; </li>
</ul>
</div>
<br />
<div>
<ul>
<li> consideration of the appropriate frequency and depth of assessments; </li>
</ul>
</div>
<br />
<div>
<ul>
<li> establishing minimum checks on IT systems used by credit institutions to calculate elements of the definition of default; </li>
</ul>
</div>
<br />
<div>
<ul>
<li> alignment of remedial actions in the context of local versus cross-border institutions.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
</div>
<br />
<div>
<h4>Legal basis and background</h4>
</div>
<div>
<p>Article 30 of the EBA Regulation requires the EBA to periodically conduct peer reviews of some or all of the activities of competent authorities within its remit, to further strengthen consistency and effectiveness in supervisory outcomes. Peer reviews identify follow-up measures to achieve this, together with best practices seen in competent authorities. After two years, the EBA is required to assess the adequacy and effectiveness of actions taken by competent authorities in response to the follow-up measures.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The Peer Review has been performed by an ad hoc Peer Review Committee made up of EBA and competent authorities&rsquo; staff in accordance with the EBA&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/peer-review-work-plan" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">peer review work plan for 2023-2024</a>&nbsp;and following the process in Article 30 of the&nbsp;<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02010R1093-20210626" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">EBA Regulation</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document_library/930577/2020-04-28%20Methodology%20for%20the%20conduct%20of%20peer%20reviews.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">EBA peer review methodology</a>.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The exercise covered six competent authorities (ECB/SSM, Greece, Liechtenstein, Poland, Sweden and Slovenia). The competent authorities were selected on the basis of objective criteria: Five competent authorities (GR, PL, LI, SE and SI) were selected based on the average percentage of non-performing loans (NPLs) in institutions&rsquo; banking book within their jurisdiction, i.e. two competent authorities with the average highest percentage of NPLs ratio, two competent authorities with the lowest percentage of NPLs ratio and one competent authority with an NPL ratio which is at the median of the distribution of the various European countries). The ECB/SSM was included in the sample given the breadth of credit institutions under its supervision.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>The EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default&nbsp; provide a detailed clarification of the definition of default and its application, covering key aspects such as the days past due criterion for default identification, indications of unlikeliness to pay, conditions for the return to non-defaulted status, treatment of the definition of default in external data, application of the default definition in a banking group and specific aspects related to retail exposures.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="page-content page-carousel sc-9ca19e062f344f0ab7d950745e0cb1fa">
<p>In April 2024, 27 financial institutions active in the UK foreign exchange market participated in the semi-annual turnover survey for the Foreign Exchange Joint Standing Committee (FXJSC). The survey results are summarised below. Detailed tables for the April 2024 reporting period are available separately.</p>
<p>The main findings of the survey are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The average daily reported UK foreign exchange turnover was $3,351 billion in April 2024, representing a 14% increase when compared to the last survey in October 2023. Turnover in April 2024 was up 11% when compared to April 2023; the dip in October 2023 was consistent with previously observed trend of April surveys showing higher volumes than the October surveys.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Volumes in each instrument were broadly unchanged from the October 2023 Survey. FX swaps were the most traded instrument with 45% of overall volume, followed by FX spot volume at 29%.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Market share of the top three traded currency pairs; EUR/USD, GBP/USD and USD/JPY, remained broadly in line with the October 2023 survey. EUR/USD continued to be the most traded currency pair in London, with an average daily turnover of $795 billion, making up 24% of overall volume in April 2024.</li>
<li>Since October 2008, the overall FX turnover has risen steadily, increasing by 97% from $1,697 billion to $3,351 billion. Over that time, NDF volumes have outstripped the overall growth in FX turnover, increasing ten-fold - which is the largest increase when compared to other instruments over the same period.&nbsp;</li>

<div> ACER, report, Slovakian gas transmission tariffs, Eustream A.S., methodology <br />
Summary: ACER recommends reviewing revenue regime, applying benchmarking adjustment to competitive points, clarifying under-recovery management, reviewing contracted capacity forecast, justifying proposed risk premium. <br /> <div>
<p>Today, ACER releases its report on the Slovakian gas transmission tariffs proposed by Eustream A.S., the Transmission System Operator (TSO) of Slovakia.</p>
<p>The proposed methodology considers the changes in network patterns caused by the 2022 energy crisis. To address these, Eustream proposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adopting a postage stamp reference price methodology (RPM) with a revenue split of 37.5/62.5 between entry and exit points.</li>
<li>Using a benchmarking adjustment to lower tariffs and attract additional flows to the network.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What does ACER recommend?</span></p>
<p>ACER analysed the information provided by Eustream to assess the compliance of the proposed methodology with the requirements of the Network Code on Harmonised Transmission Tariff Structures (<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsPBlIJUVgFAUwMAQMGHVZYBQYdUAwAAhoCV1YHAQsFUw5QAAAdB1AHBVsCBFYdUgkGBR0GCgdVGgwBAFEZVlYABgZQUllYBgVQRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">NC TAR</a>). Based on this analysis, ACER provides the following recommendations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Review the revenue regime applicable to Eustream.</li>
<li>Apply the benchmarking adjustment only to points of the Slovak network that are in competition with other networks across the EU.</li>
<li>Clarify how the systematic under-recovery borne by the TSO is managed.</li>
<li>Assess the split of revenue and capacity between existing contracts (concluded before 6 May 2017 and defined by Article 35 of the NC TAR) and the proposed RPM.</li>
<li>Review the contracted capacity forecast, which serves as an input to the RPM.</li>
<li>Justify the level of the proposed risk premium considering the risks faced by the TSO.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the next steps?</span></p>
<p>On 5 June 2024, URSO, the National Regulatory Authority (NRA) of Slovakia, approved&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsBCAZQVFVRUUxdUFdaHVYMAwIdUw4DVBoEBgYFBFIGDgUAUlQdB1AHBVsCBFYdUgkGBR0GCgdVGgwBAFEZVlYABgZQUllYBgVQRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Eustream&rsquo;s tariffs</a>&nbsp;(covering the period from 1 January 2025 to 31 December 2027) after receiving ACER&rsquo;s preliminary feedback.</p>
<p>ACER invites URSO to consider the recommendations included in this report, either by complementing its motivated decision (published on 5 June 2024) or in the next consultation on the RPM (provided this occurs by 2025).</p>

<div> G20, FSB, debt, NBFI, vulnerabilities <br />
The FSB Chair highlights high debt levels and vulnerabilities in non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI) as key risks to financial stability. Uneven progress in implementing agreed policies. Chair emphasizes the need to finalize and implement these in a timely fashion. Monitoring and analyzing NBFI vulnerabilities ongoing. Addressing leverage-related vulnerabilities in NBFI a key area of current policy focus. The FSB expects to publish a consultation report with proposed policy solutions by the end of 2024.<br /><br />Summary: <br />The FSB Chair highlights high debt levels and vulnerabilities in non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI) as key risks. Uneven progress in implementing agreed policies, with a focus on addressing leverage-related vulnerabilities and the need for timely implementation. <div>
<ul>
<li> <em><strong>In his letter to the G20, FSB Chair highlights high debt levels and vulnerabilities in non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI) as key risks to financial stability.</strong></em> </li>
<li> <em><strong>Chair notes many of the underlying vulnerabilities in NBFI are still in place.</strong></em> </li>
<li> <em><strong>FSB Chair also flags uneven progress in implementation of agreed NBFI policies and notes the need to finalise and implement these in a timely fashion.</strong></em> </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) today published a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/07/fsb-chairs-letter-to-g20-finance-ministers-and-central-bank-governors-july-2024/">letter from its Chair, Klaas Knot, to G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors</a>, ahead of the G20 meeting on 25-26 July.</p>
<p>In his letter, Mr Knot highlights historically high debt levels of both government and private sector borrowers and vulnerabilities in real estate markets and NBFI as areas that deserve continuing attention. These vulnerabilities raise the potential for sharp price corrections in the event of a shock, which could be more likely amid heightened geopolitical uncertainty and rich asset valuations in some markets. He calls for full implementation of the agreed G20 financial regulatory reforms to address these vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>The letter covers the two reports the FSB is delivering to the G20: a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/07/stocktake-on-nature-related-risks-supervisory-and-regulatory-approaches-and-perspectives-on-financial-risk/">stocktake on regulatory and supervisory initiatives related to the identification and assessment of nature-related financial risks</a>, which was published last week; and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/07/enhancing-the-resilience-of-non-bank-financial-intermediation-progress-report-4/">FSB&rsquo;s annual progress report on its work to enhance resilience in NBFI</a>, delivered together with the letter.</p>
<p>The letter notes that many of the underlying vulnerabilities that contributed to stress in the NBFI sector during recent market incidents are still largely in place. The NBFI progress report highlights a number of challenges hampering progress, including data challenges that impede a full assessment of NBFI vulnerabilities and the formulation of effective policy responses.</p>
<p>Addressing leverage-related vulnerabilities in NBFI is a key area of current policy focus, and the FSB expects to publish by the end of 2024 a consultation report with proposed policy solutions. The FSB continues to monitor and analyse NBFI vulnerabilities on an ongoing basis through the development of additional metrics and analytical tools, as well as through targeted deep dives in specific areas, including solvency and liquidity risks in an environment of rising interest rates, and vulnerabilities in private credit.</p>
<p>The report also outlines further work that will help the FSB determine whether collectively the reforms, once implemented by jurisdictions, have sufficiently addressed systemic risk in NBFI.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The FSB published in November 2020 a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2020/11/holistic-review-of-the-march-market-turmoil/">Holistic Review of the March Market Turmoil</a>, which laid out a comprehensive and ambitious work programme for strengthening the resilience of the NBFI sector while preserving its benefits. This work is being carried out within the FSB as well as by its member standard-setting bodies and international organisations, to ensure that relevant experiences and perspectives are brought to bear.</p>
<p>The stocktake on regulatory and supervisory initiatives related to the identification and assessment of nature-related financial risks was conducted by the FSB at the request of Brazilian G20 Presidency. The stocktake draws on a survey of participating FSB members and the work done by international organisations on nature-related risks.</p>
<p>The FSB coordinates at the international level the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies and develops and promotes the implementation of effective regulatory, supervisory, and other financial sector policies in the interest of financial stability. It brings together national authorities responsible for financial stability in 24 countries and jurisdictions, international financial institutions, sector-specific international groupings of regulators and supervisors, and committees of central bank experts. The FSB also conducts outreach with approximately 70 other jurisdictions through its six Regional Consultative Groups.</p>
<p>The FSB is chaired by Klaas Knot, President of De Nederlandsche Bank. The FSB Secretariat is located in Basel, Switzerland and hosted by the Bank for International Settlements.</p>

<title>ICE First Look At Mortgage Performance: June Sees Calendar-Driven Spike In Delinquencies; Foreclosures Remain Historically Low</title>

<div> Delinquency rate, foreclosure inventory, prepayment rate, foreclosure starts, foreclosure sales<br />
Summary:<br />
Delinquency rate increased in June, foreclosure starts declined, prepayment rate decreased, foreclosure sales dropped, Mississippi had the highest delinquent properties. <div>
<div class="bw-subheadline-wrapper">
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li>Coming off a near-record low in May and with June ending on a Sunday, the national delinquency rate jumped +14.5% (+45 basis points) to 3.49%, its second highest level in 18 months</li>
<li>Sunday month-ends often lead to sharp, but typically temporary, spikes in delinquent mortgages, as payments made on the last day of a given month are not processed until the following month</li>
<li>As such, June saw a +19.6% increase in the number of borrowers a single payment past due &ndash; the highest inflow since May 2020 &ndash; while 60-day delinquencies rose 11.8% to a five-month high</li>
<li>Though up 5.1% from May, serious delinquencies (loans 90+ days past due but not in active foreclosure) were still down ‑8.5% year over year and 10.1% below pre-pandemic levels</li>
<li>Foreclosure starts declined 6.2% in June &ndash; pushing active foreclosure inventory to its lowest point since the end of COVID-era moratoriums, now 34% below pre-pandemic levels</li>
<li>5.3K foreclosure sales were completed nationally in June, representing a -14.9% month-over-month decrease to their lowest level since February 2022, still well below pre-pandemic norms</li>
<li>Prepayments eased -7.6% from May, breaking a six-month streak of increasing prepay activity as we near the typical seasonal peak of home sales, and affordability and rate constraints persist</li>
</ul>

<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE:ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, reports the following &ldquo;first look&rdquo; at June 2024 month-end mortgage performance statistics derived from its loan-level database representing the majority of the national mortgage market.</p>

<div> market-based rules, gas supply, demand, EU, ACER<br />
Summary: Balancing prices decreased, leading to reduced net neutrality positions. TSO actions stable but need further investigation for security of supply implications.<br /><br /> <div>
<p>The&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsAAlBXVlZQVExcBAUAHVYABQ4dUwFQBRoAB1VSBgVWDgNVA1AdUF1UBQkDDAUdUghWAx0GDgQCGg0EBFUZVwMEBQYBCFhYB1BWRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Gas Balancing Network Code</a>&nbsp;(BAL NC) establishes market-based rules to ensure that gas supply and demand are balanced efficiently within the EU. Its aim is to promote short-term gas wholesale markets by financially incentivising network users to balance their positions using daily or within-day products, thus enhancing market flexibility and efficiency.</p>
<p>ACER annually monitors the effects of the BAL NC implementation and provides key indicators to help better understand balancing actions across Member States.</p>
<p>Today, ACER publishes&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsABFJUUARXBUwOB1VVHVYLAFIdUwsIXhoGAFcABAVQBVdXBgIdUF1UBQkDDAUdUghWAx0GDgQCGg0EBFUZVwMEBQYBCFhYB1BWRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">the highlights</a>&nbsp;of key indicators (also in an&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsGBQAFBwcBUkxfAwYCHVYNBlQdUF1SXxoMAQBSBwMEVlJUBlUdUF1UBQkDDAUdUghWAx0GDgQCGg0EBFUZVwMEBQYBCFhYB1BWRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">interactive dashboard</a>) on the EU gas balancing system for the gas year 2022-2023.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the key findings of ACER&rsquo;s latest analysis?</span></p>
<p>ACER analysed key indicators from the EU balancing systems in the gas year 2022-2023, comparing with previous years and among Member States.</p>
<p>Key findings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Balancing prices (both for Transmission System Operators' and network users' activity) have decreased substantially compared to the previous gas year (2021-2022), aligning with broader wholesale gas market trends.</li>
<li>These lower prices led to reduced net neutrality positions (net payments charged or credited to network users), marking a positive market development.</li>
<li>TSO balancing actions, as a share of total market volumes, remained stable compared to the pre-crisis period. However, most systems saw an increase in TSO sell actions year-on-year, suggesting the need for further investigations at the national level to assess potential security of supply implications.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the next steps?</span></p>
<p>ACER recommends National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) to regularly assess the performance of their balancing regimes and consider adjusting the design based on changing market conditions.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> education, ethical issues, artificial intelligence, collaboration, financial services<br />
Summary:<br />
- IFoA and CISI collaborate to support actuaries in understanding ethical issues related to AI.
- Almost 300,000 global financial services practitioners offered ethical AI training.
- Machine Learning/AI listed as a priority future skill for the UK financial services sector.
- IFoA President notes the importance of building AI expertise for actuaries.
- CISI CEO emphasizes the importance of ethical frameworks and responsible deployment of AI. <br /> <div>
<p>The Institute and Faculty of Actuaries (IFoA), the UK&rsquo;s only chartered body for educating, developing and regulating actuaries, is working with the Chartered Institute for Securities &amp; Investment (CISI) to support actuaries in their understanding of ethical issues when deploying artificial intelligence (AI).</p>
<p>Through this new collaboration, the IFoA&rsquo;s 32,000+ members will have the opportunity to study for&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.cisi.org/cisiweb2/cisi-website/study-with-us/professional-assessments/Certificate-in-Ethical-Artificial-Intelligence" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">CISI&rsquo;s Certificate in Ethical AI</a>.</p>
<p>The CISI launched its&nbsp;<b>Certificate in Ethical Artificial Intelligence</b>&nbsp;in November last year as part of its campaign to champion ethics and transparency in the use of AI. The Certificate was introduced as part of Lord Mayor Michael Mainelli&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.mainelli.org/?page_id=3730" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ethical AI initiative</a>&nbsp;with key input from the project steering group.</p>
<p><img alt="CISI_22Jul24" src="https://mondovisione.com/_assets/images/CISI_22Jul24.jpg" title="CISI_22Jul24" /></p>
<p>Since launch, the CISI&rsquo;s collaborations with professional and industry bodies indicate that almost 300,000 global financial services practitioners have been offered the opportunity to boost their skills and learning in respect of ethics and transparency in the use of AI.</p>
<p>Machine Learning/AI was listed as a priority future skill for the UK financial services sector by the Financial Services Skills Commission (FSSC) in a recent report, with the CISI noting that every one of the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://financialservicesskills.org/framework/skills/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">FSSC 13 future skills</a>&nbsp;were being addressed by&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.cisi.org/cisiweb2/cisi-website/join-us/membership-benefits/cisi-learning-platform" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">CISI&rsquo;s digital CPD modules</a>.</p>
<p><b>Kalpana Shah, IFoA President said</b>: &ldquo;We are pleased to partner with CISI to deliver this ethical AI training. Many of our members are already engaged with AI, but it is vital for all actuaries to grasp both its potential and implications. We want to support our members in building their AI&nbsp;expertise in a range of areas including enhancing analytics, improving processes, providing oversight, and ensuring ethical use while avoiding biases. This course is a valuable addition as we continue to build our AI-focussed learning offer for members.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Tracy Vegro OBE, CISI Chief Executive Officer said</b>: &ldquo;We are delighted to announce this partnership with the IFoA and to welcome actuarial professionals to the CISI AI learning and development community. As the&nbsp;leading global professional body qualifying, supporting, and championing actuaries, the IFoA member risk management and analytical skillset is evermore crucial in a world of business and geo-political uncertainty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Technology and trust must go hand in hand and ethical frameworks are essential for AI development, supported by industry-wide skills and training.&nbsp;Responsible deployment of these technologies is central to the agenda.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Lord Mayor Mainelli said</b>:&nbsp;"The buildout of the CISI&rsquo;s ethical AI initiative, a core part of the overall Connect to Prosper Mayoral programme this year, across our alphabet of professions - accountants, now actuaries, bankers and so on - is evidence of the key role that this technology is playing in any economic development. In Britain, our new government has characterised high, durable, and inclusive growth that respects the environmental limitations of our planet as a &ldquo;national mission.&rdquo; Bringing ethical issues to the centre of any business, professional or political decision on the deployment of generative AI is a key step towards enduring success on this project."</p>

<div> integration, Global Relay, ChatGPT Enterprise, compliance, OpenAI<br />
Summary:<br />
Global Relay integrates with OpenAI's ChatGPT Enterprise Compliance API to help financial institutions meet industry compliance standards and regulatory guidelines. <div>
<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.globalrelay.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Global Relay</a>, the leading provider of communications compliance solutions for regulated industries, announces its integration between OpenAI&rsquo;s ChatGPT Enterprise&nbsp;Compliance API&nbsp;and Global Relay&rsquo;s financial compliance platform. The new compliance capabilities&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://openai.com/index/new-tools-for-chatgpt-enterprise/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">launched by OpenAI</a>&nbsp;in conjunction with Global Relay&rsquo;s platform will help customers use OpenAI&rsquo;s&nbsp;Enterprise&nbsp;Compliance API to meet industry standards for business communications recordkeeping, data archiving, and surveillance.</p>
<p>OpenAI&rsquo;s&nbsp;ChatGPT Enterprise Compliance&nbsp;application programming interfaces (API) allows ChatGPT Enterprise workspace administrators to manage their data&nbsp;to help&nbsp;ensure privacy and compliance with regulatory standards. Companies in all sectors, including Global Relay&rsquo;s client roster of 20,000 financial institutions worldwide, will be able to use the Global Relay Connector for ChatGPT&nbsp;Enterprise&nbsp;solution to help compliantly capture and archive prompts, conversations, and file attachments between individual users and&nbsp;ChatGPT Enterprise, and securely store all this data in Global Relay Archive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are delighted to begin an impactful launch integration&nbsp;with a company whose technology is transforming virtually every industry and business function before our eyes, including financial compliance,&rdquo;&nbsp;<b>commented Sahar</b>&nbsp;<b>Kayhani, Chief Product Officer at Global Relay.</b>&nbsp;&ldquo;Generative AI, such as ChatGPT, represents a significant advancement in how businesses interact with customers and manage internal communications. This significant shift in business operations also ushers in the need for regulatory compliance solutions that meet the evolving needs of the industry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Global Relay&rsquo;s integration with OpenAI&rsquo;s ChatGPT Enterprise Compliance API will enable enterprise compliance and risk leaders to capture, archive, and access ChatGPT Enterprise data alongside Global Relay&rsquo;s existing monitoring of instant messaging tools, and social media, voice, files, and business collaboration tools &mdash; all within a single platform.</p>
<p>Kayhani added, &ldquo;In light of regulators&rsquo; intensified focus on off-channel communications, many customers were asking us for the capability to capture ChatGPT Enterprise data. Our connector will enable organizations to harness the full potential of generative AI, with peace of mind knowing that the audit trail of communications is readily available to disclose to regulatory agencies, while maintaining the highest standards of data integrity, completeness, and security. As the market for generative AI continues to evolve, the integration of comprehensive archiving and surveillance will be crucial.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In March, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) updated its guidelines to include&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/guidance/faqs/advertising-regulation" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">requirements for overseeing AI chatbot communications</a>, mandating that AI-driven communications must adhere to the same supervision, content, and recordkeeping standards as other business communications. Global Relay&rsquo;s ChatGPT Enterprise integration not only helps organizations comply with FINRA 3310 and SEC 17a-4 where new rulings have been introduced, but also provides complete, accurate, and quality source data resulting in optimized search, surveillance, and accurate AI. This all leads to greater operational efficiency and lower cost for organizations in their communications compliance strategy.</p>

AI-assisted decision-making is becoming a cornerstone for healthcare companies aiming to reduce operational costs and optimize their services.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Prathyusha Paruchuri, Senior Disruptive Tech Analyst at GlobalData, adds: &ldquo;Startups are leveraging generative AI to interpret vast amounts of medical data, reduce paperwork, and optimize AI-driven workflows to further advance in their fields. Companies like DeepCure, Automera, BeeKeeperAI, Alaffia Health, and InpharmD are addressing diverse healthcare challenges, with funding ranging from $6.05 million to $24.6 million in 2024, underscoring their innovative solutions and market potential.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>An analysis of GlobalData&rsquo;s Deals Database reveals that during the first half (H1) of 2024, healthcare sector's VC deals in the generative AI theme stood at a total value of $444.7 million.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Some of the notable VC funding deals during this period include: $150 million fund raised by Kore.ai to continue the advancement of AI platform, $70 million raised by Ambience Healthcare to grow both its operations and business clientele, and $60 million capital secured by Omniscient Neurotechnology (o8t) to increase US market share and advance product development efforts.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Non-VC deals during the review period included a $1.7 billion partnership agreement between Isomorphic Labs and Eli Lilly to advance drug design approaches. Another notable partnership was between VantAI and Bristol Myers Squibb, valued at $674.0 million, to expand therapeutic programs. Additionally, Stemline Therapeutics and Insilico Medicine entered a $512.0 million licensing agreement to develop AI-powered treatments for hormone-sensitive cancers and other oncology indications</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Paruchuri concludes: &ldquo;Even though healthcare companies are facing funding squeeze, investments in generative AI are an exception. The technology has a transformative impact on diagnostics, patient engagement, and remote care. However, concerns about its ability to handle emergencies and its finite knowledge base highlight the need for cautious and regulated adoption.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note: Historic data may change in case some deals get added to previous months because of a delay in the disclosure of information in the public domain.</span></span></p>

<div> Enforcement action, company directors, disqualification, small businesses, ASIC<br />
Summary:<br />
ASIC disqualifies seven directors for misconduct, illegal phoenix activity, failure to pay creditors. Orders related to Creditor-Defeating Dispositions and Director ID application. <div>
<p>ASIC continues to take enforcement action against company directors whose actions unfairly impact small businesses with the disqualification of seven directors in the 1 April to 30 June March 2024 quarter.</p>
<p>Some of the directors who received the maximum allowable disqualification of five years had also engaged in illegal phoenix activity and used company funds to make payments to related parties for no commercial reason. The failure of company directors to pay the ATO, employee entitlements or other creditors puts them at an unfair competitive advantage over other small proprietary companies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These actions are part of ASIC&rsquo;s enforcement priorities which aim to protect small business through action to halt harmful conduct. ASIC continues to target misconduct related to company failures and persons that engage in illegal phoenix activity that result in outstanding debts which can be harmful to other small businesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>ASIC is dedicated to engaging with and providing proactive support for small business owners and will continue to act against individual directors to protect the wider public, employees and other businesses against the future mismanagement of companies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following directors were banned from managing corporations following their roles in the collapse of multiple small proprietary companies leaving many creditors unpaid including other small business creditors, employees, and the Australian Taxation Office (ATO):&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Meral Altinarda</span></p>
<p>Former accommodation and food services industry director Meral Altinarda, of Keysborough, VIC, was disqualified from managing corporations for four years due to her involvement in the failure of four companies. The four companies owed a combined total of $2,199,755 to creditors, including $1,737,247 owing to the ATO. ASIC disqualified Ms Altinarda until 10 April 2028.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Julian Joesph Bignold</span></p>
<p>Former food services industry director Julian Joseph Bignold of Turramurra, NSW, was disqualified from managing corporations for three and a half years due to his involvement in the failure of two companies. The two companies owed a combined total of $12,411,959 to unsecured creditors, including $529,561 owing to the ATO. ASIC disqualified Mr Bignold until 11 October 2027.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Miroslav Jack Samardzij</span></p>
<p>ASIC previously issued a media release regarding the disqualification of former building and construction industry director Miroslav Jack Samardzija, from managing corporations for the maximum period of five years due to his involvement in the failure of three small proprietary companies, which owed a combined total of $2,344,867 to unsecured creditors, including approximately $1,031,522 to the ATO:<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-078mr-asic-disqualifies-qld-construction-director-for-5-years/#!page=1&amp;type=media%20releases&amp;search=Miroslav%20Jack%20Samardzija%20" title="24-078MR ASIC disqualifies QLD construction director for 5 years">24-078MR ASIC disqualifies QLD construction director for 5 years</a>. ASIC disqualified Mr Samardzija until 15 April 2029.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Laurence Pereira</span></p>
<p>ASIC previously issued a media release regarding the disqualification of former electrical, refrigeration, air-conditioning, and mechanical services industries director Laurence Christopher Pereira, from managing corporations for the maximum period of five years due to his involvement in the failure of four small proprietary companies, which owed a combined total of $4,006,382 to unsecured creditors including $1,031,357 for unpaid wages, superannuation, and employee entitlements:&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-105mr-asic-disqualifies-qld-director-for-maximum-five-years/" title="24-105MR ASIC disqualifies QLD director for maximum five years">24-105MR ASIC disqualifies QLD director for maximum five years</a>.&nbsp;ASIC disqualified Mr Pereira until 1 May 2029.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Peter Gribble</span></p>
<p>Property development and financial services industry director Peter Gribble of Turramurra NSW was disqualified from managing corporations for two and half years, until 23 November 2026, due to his involvement in four small proprietary companies which owed a combined total of $9,463,640 to 24 unsecured creditors. Many of the affected creditors were small businesses in the food industry. Peter Gribble was previously disqualified by ASIC in October 2022 from controlling financial services businesses for three years:&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2022-releases/22-274mr-asic-bans-sydney-based-director-for-three-years-over-refusal-or-failure-to-pay-afca-determinations/" title="22-274MR ASIC bans Sydney-based director for three years over refusal or failure to pay AFCA determinations">22-274MR ASIC bans Sydney-based director for three years over refusal or failure to pay AFCA determinations</a>.</p>
<p><span>Andrew Liam Parry</span></p>
<p>ASIC previously issued a media release regarding the disqualification of former solar, media, telecommunications, and bitcoin mining director Andrew Liam Parry, from managing corporations for the maximum period of five years due to his involvement in the failure of four small proprietary companies, which owed a combined total of $11,085,390 to creditors:&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-114mr-asic-disqualifies-nsw-director-for-five-years/#!page=1&amp;type=media%20releases&amp;search=Andrew%20Liam%20Parry" title="24-114MR ASIC disqualifies NSW director for five years">24-114MR ASIC disqualifies NSW director for five years</a>. ASIC disqualified Mr Parry until 24 May 2029.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Christian Oey</span></p>
<p>ASIC previously issued a media release regarding the disqualification of former financial and insurance services industry director, Christian Oey, from managing corporations for the maximum period of five years due to his involvement in the failure of two companies, which owed a combined total of $5,850,309 to creditors:&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-035mr-asic-disqualifies-nsw-director-for-maximum-five-years-after-failure-of-seven-companies/" title="24-035MR ASIC disqualifies NSW director for maximum five years after failure of seven companies">24-035MR ASIC disqualifies NSW director for maximum five years after failure of seven companies</a>. ASIC disqualified Mr Oey until 6 June 2029.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Assetless Administration Fund&nbsp;</h2>
<p>In disqualifying these directors, ASIC relied on supplementary reports lodged by the following and other liquidators after ASIC approved funding from the <a href="https://asic.gov.au/for-finance-professionals/registered-liquidators/your-ongoing-obligations-as-a-registered-liquidator/assetless-administration-fund/" title="Assetless Administration Fund">Assetless Administration Fund</a>:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Nicholas Giasoumi and Adrian John Warry of Dye &amp; Co Solvency &amp; Turnaround were appointed liquidators of Meral Altinarda&rsquo;s companies Golden Entertainment Pty Ltd and Crew Entertainment Pty Ltd</li>
<li>Adam Shepard of Setter Shepard was the appointed liquidator of one of Mr Bignold&rsquo;s companies with Steven Neville Staatz of Vincents Chartered Accountants the liquidator for the second company belonging to Mr Bignold</li>
<li>Jason Porter of SV Partners is the liquidator for one of Mr Gribble&rsquo;s companies, with Stephen Hathway of HELM Advisory the liquidator for another company belonging to Mr Gribble.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Section 206F of the Corporations Act 2001 allows ASIC to disqualify a person from managing corporations for a maximum period of five years if, within a seven-year period, the person was an officer of two or more companies, and those companies were wound up and a liquidator provides a report to ASIC about each of the company&rsquo;s inability to pay its debts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In deciding whether a director should be banned from managing corporations, ASIC relies on information provided by registered liquidators in initial statutory reports and supplementary reports and on convictions resulting from ASIC&rsquo;s request assistance for external administration (RAEA) program. The RAEA enables registered liquidators to request assistance from ASIC in circumstances when directors, officers and individuals related to a company in external administration fail to comply their legal obligation to assist liquidators.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following a director ban, the disqualified director might be affected by:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Reputational damage. The director ban information is available through ASIC&rsquo;s public register and can impact on a director&rsquo;s reputation</li>
<li>An inability to work as a director without permission of ASIC or the court</li>
<li>Difficulty obtaining finance or credit rating issues</li>
<li>Possible criminal sanctions if the disqualification order is not complied with&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Possible related liquidator claims against the disqualified director.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Directors can seek a review of ASIC&rsquo;s decision by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. To date, ASIC has not been advised that any of the above directors are reviewing their banning order.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ASIC maintains a <a href="https://asic.gov.au/online-services/search-asic-s-registers/banned-and-disqualified/" title="Banned and disqualified">banned and disqualified persons register</a> that provides information about people who have been disqualified from:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>involvement in the management of a corporation,&nbsp;</li>
<li>auditing self-managed superannuation funds (SMSFs), or&nbsp;</li>
<li>practising in the financial services or credit industry.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Orders about Creditor-Defeating Dispositions&nbsp;</h2>
<p>A creditor-defeating disposition is a disposal of company property that prevents, hinders, or significantly delays that property from becoming available for the benefit of creditors in the winding up of the company. &nbsp;<br />A liquidator may seek to recover a voidable creditor-defeating disposition and ASIC or a court may undo this disposition if it is considered a 'voidable transaction' under the Corporations Act.&nbsp;<br />In the period 1 April to 30 June March 2024, ASIC issued the following orders:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Glenn James Turner</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On 19 April 2024, after an application by the liquidator of Widebay Fitouts Pty Ltd (In liquidation) ACN 620 385 506, ASIC made an order directing former director Glenn James Turner, to transfer property of the company that was subject of a creditor-defeating disposition, to the liquidator.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Glenn Wright&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On 31 May 2024, after an application by the liquidator of Wright Engineering Pty Ltd (in liquidation) ACN 080 960 274, ASIC made an order directing former director Glenn Wright, to transfer property of the company that was subject of a creditor-defeating disposition, to the liquidator.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Director ID&nbsp;</h2>
<p>All directors are required by law to verify their identity with Australian Business Registry Services before receiving a director ID. Directors must apply for their director ID within the following timeframes:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Directors appointed before 1 November 2021 had until 30 November 2022 to apply</li>
<li>New directors appointed for the first time between 1 November 2021 and 4 April 2022 had 28 days form their appointment to apply</li>
<li>From 5 April 2022, intending new directors must apply before being appointed.<span>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the period 1 April to 30 June March 2024, ASIC prosecuted the following people for failure to have a director ID:&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Alexander Henry</span><span>&nbsp;and Luke David Mason</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ASIC previously issued a media release regarding the conviction on 3 May 2024, of Alexander Henry of Rockingham WA and Luke David Mason of Wilson WA, for failing to comply with director identification requirements:&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-096mr-western-australian-directors-convicted-for-failing-to-have-director-identification-numbers/#!page=1&amp;type=media%20releases&amp;search=director%20id" title="24-096MR Western Australian directors convicted for failing to have director identification numbers">24-096MR Western Australian directors convicted for failing to have director identification numbers</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Company directors should obtain trusted professional advice if they are uncertain about their legal obligations or concerns about the company&rsquo;s ability to continue to trade and pay their debts.

<div> proposal, update, AML/CFT programs, risk-based, FinCEN <br />
Summary:<br /> 
Four federal financial institution regulatory agencies are proposing amendments to update AML/CFT program requirements to align with changes in the AML Act and FinCEN priorities. The proposal mandates risk evaluation, documentation, and oversight by individuals in the United States, while also supporting innovative compliance approaches. <br /> <div>
<p>Four federal financial institution regulatory agencies today requested comment on a proposal to update their requirements for supervised institutions to establish, implement, and maintain effective, risk-based, and reasonably designed anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) programs. The amendments are intended to align with changes concurrently proposed by the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), most of which result from the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (AML Act).</p>
<p>The proposed amendments would require supervised institutions to identify, evaluate, and document the regulated institution's money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illicit finance activity risks, as well as consider, as appropriate, FinCEN's published national AML/CFT priorities. Additionally, and consistent with the AML Act, the proposal would mandate that the duty to establish, maintain, and enforce the AML/CFT program remain the responsibility of, and be performed by, persons in the United States who are accessible to, and subject to the oversight and supervision by, the relevant agency. The proposal also supports institutions' consideration of innovative approaches to meet compliance obligations.</p>
<p>Comments on the proposal are due 60 days after the date of publication in the&nbsp;<em>Federal Register</em>.</p>

<div> federal reserve board, green dot, fine, consumer compliance, anti-money laundering<br />
Summary: The Federal Reserve fined Green Dot $44 million for unfair practices, requiring them to improve consumer compliance and anti-money laundering programs. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>The Federal Reserve Board on Friday took action to address consumer compliance breakdowns by Green Dot, fining the firm $44 million for numerous unfair and deceptive practices and a deficient consumer compliance risk management program.</p>
<p>Green Dot violated consumer law in its marketing, selling, and servicing of prepaid debit card products, and its offering of tax return preparation payment services. For example, Green Dot failed to adequately disclose the tax refund processing fee for tax preparation services offered on a third party's website. The firm also blocked access to accounts of legitimate customers receiving unemployment benefits and lacked reasonable policies and procedures to help those customers cure those blocks. In addition, Green Dot did not maintain effective consumer compliance risk management and anti-money laundering programs.</p>
<p>The Board is requiring the firm to take several steps to improve these programs. Green Dot must hire an independent third-party to strengthen its consumer compliance risk management program and address the root causes of consumer complaints. The firm also must develop an effective anti-money laundering program and hire an independent third-party to conduct a review of certain transaction activities.<span style="font-size: 11px;">.</span></p>

<div> consultation, Handbook, independent valuers, resolution, EBA <br />
Summary:<br />
EBA launches public consultation on draft Handbook for independent valuers for resolution. Focus on best practices and methodologies. Deadline for comments is 19 September 2024. <div>
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<div>
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today launched a public consultation on the draft Handbook on independent valuers for resolution purposes. The draft Handbook aims at enhancing convergence by providing best practices, high-quality methodologies and processes for the selection and appointment of independent valuers for resolution purposes, as well as examples on the application of these methodologies under some scenarios. The consultation runs until 19 September 2024.&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The EBA has developed this Handbook with the view of improving the process of selecting independent valuers and facilitating its implementation by resolution authorities.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The Handbook also identifies some types of safeguards or measures which could be set in place to mitigate the effects of the potential conflict of interest or circumstances hampering the independence of the valuer.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The Handbook is structured in a chronological order, covering actions before, during and after the appointment of the independent valuer. The preparatory arrangements include actions, such as market research, framework contracts and internal procedures. The Handbook includes specific sections dealing with the assessment of the valuer's independence and the application of safeguards. Finally, after the appointment of the independent valuer, the Handbook includes aspects such as the maintenance of policies and procedures to identify and manage conflicts of interest.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Consultation process</h4>
</div>
<div>
<p>Comments to the consultation paper can be sent by clicking on the "send your comments" on the EBA's consultation page. The deadline for the submission of comments is 19 September 2024. The EBA will consider the feedback received to this consultation when finalising the Handbook.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>All contributions received will be published following the end of the consultation, unless requested otherwise.</p>

<title>SEC Launches Interagency Securities Council To Coordinate Enforcement Efforts Across Federal, State, And Local Agencies</title>

<div> SEC, Division of Enforcement, Interagency Securities Council, fraud, collaboration
<br />
The Interagency Securities Council aims to unite federal, state, and local agencies to combat financial fraud through collaboration, information sharing, and innovative approaches.
<br /><br />Summary: The Interagency Securities Council promotes collaboration, information sharing, and innovative approaches to combat financial fraud for federal, state, and local agencies. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement this month launched the Interagency Securities Council (ISC), which invites federal, state, and local regulatory and law enforcement professionals to meet quarterly to discuss the latest in scams, trends, frauds, and mitigation strategies.</p>
<p>The ISC&rsquo;s objective is to strengthen the cohesion between federal, state, and local agencies, enhance opportunities to collaborate on cases to protect investors, provide insight and guidance across the ecosystem to those who may not frequently operate in this space, and create a forum for unified efforts in combatting financial fraud.</p>
<p>The ISC launched with representatives from more than 100 departments and agencies, including federal agencies, state offices of attorneys general and state police, and local police departments and sheriff&rsquo;s offices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Interagency Securities Council will help front line investigators stay abreast of emerging threats and fact patterns to protect their communities from securities fraud, while supporting the efforts of federal, state, and local law enforcement partners across the country,&rdquo; said Gurbir S. Grewal, Chair of the ISC and Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As financial frauds become more complex, investors benefit from the government &ndash; at all levels &ndash; working together and sharing information to protect and inform the public,&rdquo; said Cristina Martin Firvida, the SEC&rsquo;s Investor Advocate.</p>
<p><span>About the Interagency Securities Council</span></p>
<p>The ISC is open to law enforcement and regulatory agencies, and members participate in discussions with experts on emerging threats, hear from investigators conducting and supervising investigations, and explore case study examples of agencies employing innovative approaches to combat financial fraud. The ISC also serves as an opportunity to connect and share information with the larger law enforcement community that less frequently deals with securities law violations, such as police/sheriff departments and tribal- and military-community law enforcement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s efforts on the council will be led by Adam Anicich and Manuel Vazquez.</p>
<p><span>Contact</span></p>
<p>To learn more about this initiative, or to enroll your department or agency, please contact&nbsp;<a href="mailto:ISC@sec.gov">ISC@sec.gov</a>.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-0">1. Enforcement Decision Making Committee (EDMC) &ndash; Report to Court</h2>
<p>(Sir William Blair, Duncan Cromarty and David Friar)</p>
<p>The Chair welcomed William Blair to the meeting and thanked him for his leadership of the EDMC.</p>
<p>William Blair updated Court on the EDMC&rsquo;s activities over the past year. The EDMC had recruited three new Members to the Committee since the last update to Court. He noted that the expansion of the Bank&rsquo;s statutory responsibilities as a result of the Financial Services and Markets Act (2023) was likely to increase the workload of the EMDC, notably to include Financial Markets Infrastructures.</p>
<p>William Blair also informed Court that the EDMC had been working with the PRA on how to expedite settlements. Court discussed the importance of firms understanding this option was available. He added that the Terms of Reference of the EDMC had been updated for the first time since establishment in 2018, to incorporate a pause in EDMC proceedings to allow for settlement arrangements.</p>
<p>In response to questions, it was clarified that the EDMC would have nine Members for a period of time before falling to six. The Chair observed that the membership of the EDMC was balanced and that the new Members brought valuable, broad skills to the Committee.</p>

<p>Sebastian Walsh notified Court that the next release of historic Court Minutes would be published alongside the Minutes of this meeting.</p>
<p><a id="_Hlk167366657"></a>The Chair invited comments on Court&rsquo;s forward agenda. Diana Noble asked that the Communications directorate return to Court following communication of the Bank&rsquo;s pension review proposals, to inform Court regarding staff views.</p>
<p>The Chair also expressed his thanks to Ben Broadbent, who was attending his final meeting of Court, for his service to the Bank and the United Kingdom.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="page-section">
<div class="section-heading">
<h2 id="chapter-2">3. Governor&rsquo;s Update</h2>
<p>The Governor noted the latest fall in inflation, and observed there would be a number of data releases prior to the next MPC decision. He noted that ongoing challenges surrounding the production of labour force data by the ONS continued to pose a major difficulty for the MPC, but that agency intelligence indicated that while pay settlements remained elevated firms were not now passing as much of those costs through to customers.</p>
<p>The Governor reflected on the Bernanke Review and its importance, noting to Court that the immediate priority for the Bank would be making progress in updating FAME and accompanying systems, where work was under way.</p>
<p>The Governor noted that Liz Oakes &ndash; recently appointed as an external member to the FPC &ndash; had appeared before the Treasury Select Committee (TSC). The Chair of the TSC had written to the Governor to express concerns about the appointment process, with particular regard to how recusals were applied should an appointee have a real or perceived conflict of interest. He had replied to the TSC outlining the rigour of the Bank&rsquo;s process.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="page-section">
<div class="section-heading">
<h2 id="chapter-3">4. Audit and Risk Committee (ARCo) Update</h2>
<p>Jonathan Bewes updated Court on the work of ARCo, which had met on 13 May.</p>
<p>ARCo had been updated on progress being made with regards to the Bank&rsquo;s five-year capital review, undertaken in consultation with HMT.</p>
<p>ARCo had also been updated on the RTGS Renewal Programme, and the Bank&rsquo;s Cloud Strategy. ARCo agreed with the assessment that Cloud was a vital part of the Bank&rsquo;s developing technology strategy.</p>
<p>ARCo had been updated on the work of the Change and Planning directorate and had recommended the team focus on increasing assurance and support around high-impact programmes.</p>
<p>ARCo had considered the Bank&rsquo;s Annual Report and Accounts. Jonathan Bewes was content to recommend to Court that the Bank&rsquo;s Annual Reports and Accounts should be prepared on a going concern basis and that they would be fair, balanced and understandable.</p>
<p>ARCo was presented with a draft of the Bank&rsquo;s Climate Change disclosures.</p>
<p>Jonathan Bewes noted that the Bank&rsquo;s Auditors &ndash; the NAO and KPMG &ndash; had made good progress with their audits and had not identified any material points of concern.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="page-section">
<div class="section-heading">

</section><section class="page-section">
<div class="section-heading">
<h2 id="chapter-5">6. Chief Operating Officer Update</h2>
<p>Ben Stimson updated Court on progress in the transformation of Central Services, reflecting on the appointment of a new leadership team. He noted key priorities in the coming months included the pensions review and the Bank&rsquo;s development of its Leeds operation.</p>
<p>In line with the discussion at the previous ARCo, Court discussed the increasing number of new recruits to the Bank over the past two years. Court requested an analysis of the experience of external recruits in the second half of the year.</p>
<p>Turning to investment planning, Ben Stimson noted that demand had exceeded supply, as Jo Hill would outline during the next item. Court members observed the Bank&rsquo;s new Strategic Priorities, in development, must shape decisions.</p>
<p>Ron Kalifa asked that Court be given more information on the framework used to make investment decisions in due course.</p>
<p>Ben Stimson turned to items coming for approval.</p>
<p><strong>Technology Support Services Framework</strong></p>
<p>Court approved the framework, which supported the Bank&rsquo;s ability to procure third party technology services. Ben Stimson set out that should the framework be utilised; individual contracts would be subject to the Bank&rsquo;s usual governance processes.</p>
<p><strong>Microsoft Enterprise Agreement</strong></p>
<p>Court approved the item.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="page-section">
<div class="section-heading">
<h2 id="chapter-6">7. Investment Portfolio Update</h2>
<p>(Jo Hill)</p>
<p>Jo Hill updated Court on work to refine and harmonise the Bank&rsquo;s investment and change portfolio. Jo Hill said that, while demand continued to exceed available funding, good progress had been made to enhance how programmes are overseen. She also updated Court on the development of her directorate.</p>
<p>Dave Ramsden and Sarah Breeden welcomed the positive cultural change that was emerging around the investment challenge faced across the Bank, with better understanding of dependencies across the organisation.</p>
<p>Court members raised the RTGS Programme and Finance Modernisation Projects as examples where major projects &ndash; and decisions taken regarding them &ndash; would have substantial implications for decision-making elsewhere in the Bank&rsquo;s investment portfolio.</p>
<p>The Chair thanked Jo Hill for her work to establish the Change and Planning directorate and recommended that the Bank maintains its focus on scoping programmes effectively, measuring and tracking outputs and associated financial and non-financial benefits.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="page-section">
<div class="section-heading">
<h2 id="chapter-7">8. The Bank&rsquo;s Finances</h2>
<p>(Afua Kyei and Kristy Eden-Green)</p>
<p>Afua Kyei introduced the item, noting that the previous financial year had closed with the Bank in a better position that had been forecast.</p>
<p>In response to questions, it was clarified that the Bank had not forecast costs to implement a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), as a final policy decision had not been taken on this work.</p>
<p>Court discussed how the Bank intended to balance spending between the three principal areas where a need for investment was needed: Data, Technology and Property.</p>
<p>The Chair asked the Secretary to schedule a discussion of the Bank&rsquo;s emerging thinking on the forthcoming 3-year plan including investment prioritisation, proposed run cost development, including proposed approach to efficiency, and high-level options for budget allocations. Court would consider this prior to the final budget guidance being communicated to the Bank towards the end of the year.</p>
<p>Court approved the Bank&rsquo;s final Budget for the Financial Year 2024/25.</p>

<p>Afua Kyei set out that ARCo had considered the draft Bank of England Annual Report and Accounts on 13 May, noting that the Bank had reached agreement on all questions posed by KPMG.</p>
<p>Court agreed to delegate approval of the Bank&rsquo;s Annual Report and Accounts to the Signing Committee.</p>
<p>Court agreed that the Bank&rsquo;s Annual Report and Accounts should be prepared on a going concern basis.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-9">10. A 3-year plan to modernise Data and Analytics in the Bank</h2>
<p>(James Benford)</p>
<p>James Benford introduced the item and set out progress made since the last update to Court.</p>
<p>Anne Glover and Ron Kalifa offered a number of reflections on work undertaken to date. They noted that while good progress had been made, more could be done to encourage idea generation for the use of Data and Analytics at the Bank. Governors noted that experimentation and ideas generation was happening across the Bank at working level but agreed that more could be done to promote and prioritise this.</p>
<p>Anne Glover and Ron Kalifa suggested that more could be done to highlight the costs and benefits of the programme as well as the dynamics of its work in practice.</p>
<p>Court observed that the enterprise approach being deployed was working and was beneficial for the Bank as a whole. This approach addressed a previous gap of collective oversight and leadership of Data and Analytics at the Bank and was seen to be having an effect on wider work to improve the Bank&rsquo;s approach to project management.</p>
<p>Court agreed to delegate approval of the external publication of the Bank&rsquo;s Data and Analytics Strategy to the Governor, the Chair, Ron Kalifa and Anne Glover.</p>
<p>Court requested a further update on the topic at its October meeting, which should be focussed on the topic of experimentation and the future operating model for Data and Analytics across the Bank.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-11">12. IEO Evaluation of the PRA&rsquo;s secondary growth and competitiveness objective (SCGO)</h2>
<p>(Melissa Davey, Dan Georgescu and David Bailey)</p>
<p>Melissa Davey introduced the item and gave an overview of the review and methodology.</p>
<p>Sam Woods welcomed the IEO&rsquo;s review and noted its importance, coming shortly after the introduction of this secondary objective. He also informed Court that he was considering giving a speech following the publication of the IEO report, to serve as part of the Bank&rsquo;s response.</p>
<p>The Governor and Chair agreed it was important that the Bank responds closely and directly to the points made in the IEO review.</p>
<p>Non-executive members of Court said it would be important to demonstrate that the PRA was working differently in some ways, in response to this objective.</p>
<p>The Chair concluded the discussion by noting the importance of the Bank not being the victim of an expectation gap regarding this objective.</p>
<p>Court agreed to delegate approval for the publication of the report to the Chair, the Governor and Deputy Governor for Prudential Regulation.</p>

<title>The EU Market On Structured Deposits Is Limited In Size, Concentrated In Only A Few Member States, And Offers Products With Varying Net Returns, The EBA Report Finds</title>

<div> Report, structured deposits, European Union, MiFIR, EBA
Summary:
The EBA published a Report on structured deposits in the EU under MiFIR, highlighting challenges in obtaining robust data and outlining potential improvement measures. <div>
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published a Report on structured deposits in the European Union (EU), under the Markets for Financial Instruments Regulation (MiFIR) to monitor this particular market segment.&nbsp;</span><a id="_Hlk172100536" name="_Hlk172100536"><span>The Report finds that in more than half of the 27 national markets in the EU, structured deposits do not exist, and that the EU market remains very small at an aggregate level, with only &euro;16.7 billion of structured deposits sold between 1 January and 30 September 2023 &ndash; the reference period of the Report -, and 95% of which was concentrated in only 4 EU Member States.</span></a></p>
<p>These 4 EU Member States were also the few jurisdictions for which increases in the number of products offered and volumes sold were reported, albeit at a very low level. Across the EU, the total value of structured deposits sold in a given Member State ranges from &euro;2 million to &euro;10 billion, showing a disparity&nbsp;<a id="_Hlk172106172" name="_Hlk172106172">in market penetration and investor interest</a>.</p>
<p><a id="_Hlk172101898" name="_Hlk172101898">The Report also measures the cost and past performance of structured deposits, in response to a request from the EU Commission to report this information. The limited performance data available indicates that the annual net returns for structured deposits vary significantly, with some structured deposits offering no return, while others showing positive returns, in one case up to 24%.</a></p>
<p>The Report also confirms&nbsp;an observation the EBA had made previously when it carried out a similar exercise whose&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-publishes-report-cost-and-performance-structured-deposits">findings</a>&nbsp;were published in 2019, which is&nbsp;that robust data on national markets for structured deposits is difficult to obtain due to their specific characteristics. In particular, structured deposits, unlike most financial instruments are non-transferable agreements between the provider and the depositor, which makes them less liquid. In addition, information about these products is less accessible to the public.</p>
<h4>Background and Legal Basis</h4>
<p>Articles 39(2) and 41(1) of MiFIR mandate the EBA to monitor the market for structured deposits and to temporarily prohibit or restrict the marketing, distribution or sale of structured deposits. In addition, the European Commission has requested that the EBA issues recurrent reports on the cost and past performance of structured deposits.</p>
<p><a id="_Hlk172100301" name="_Hlk172100301">With this Report, the EBA fulfils its mandate under MiFIR and the European Commission&rsquo;s request.</a></p>
<p>Similar to the EBA 2019 Report, this Report describes the typical features of structured deposits, the disclosure and reporting requirements, and data sources. It assesses national markets for structured deposits, including their size, cost and past performance and provides an overview of the risks to investors as well as of supervisory activities taken by national competent authorities. The Report also outlines measures the EBA could put in place to improve potential future iterations of this assessment.</p>

<br />
Summary: Euroclear achieved strong results with increased operating income, slowed cost growth, strategic stake in Inversis, managing impacts of Russian sanctions, and executing its strategic milestones. <div>
<div class="content" id="ReleaseContent">
<p>&nbsp;Results for the first half year ended 30 June 2024</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div dir="ltr" id="dvprnejpg32b6left"><img align="middle" alt="Euroclear Logo" id="prnejpg32b6left" src="https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2064818/4819610/Euroclear_logo.jpg" title="Euroclear Logo" /></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Highlights</b></p>
<p>Euroclear achieves strong results driven by solid operating and interest income</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Underlying operating income increased by 5% to reach a record &euro;1.45 billion.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Business income increased by 3% to &euro;865 million<sup>1</sup>, reflecting continued solid performance of&nbsp;Euroclear's core business as settlement and safe keeping activities reached new record levels.</li>
<li>H1 2024 underlying interest income increased by 9% to &euro;586 million in the context of a sustained high interest rates environment and gradual policy rate cuts.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>Pace of cost growth is slowing progressively</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>After a step-up in investment in digital capabilities, workforce and IT infrastructure in 2023, the growth of underlying operating expenses slowed to 5% in H1 2024. Euroclear remains focused on cost mitigation while making the necessary investments in its strategy, including the improvement of operational resilience, the modernisation of CSDs' core platforms and the reinforcement of non-IT resources.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>Growing shareholder returns and strong capital position</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Underlying earnings per share increased by 7% to &euro;191.4, in line with continued increase in net profit.&nbsp;</li>
<li>On 19 July 2024,&nbsp;Euroclear paid the previously announced dividend relating to the 2023 underlying business results of &euro;210 per share, representing an 82% increase compared to the prior year dividend.</li>
<li>Euroclear's group underlying capitalisation remains very strong and comfortably above capital requirements with an underlying Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio above 50%<sup>2</sup>.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>Euroclear acquires strategic stake in Inversis</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Euroclear today announced it has acquired a stake of 49% in Inversis, a Spanish provider of global investment technology solutions and outsourced financial services, with a committed plan to full ownership by end 2027.</li>
<li>The acquisition aligns with Euroclear's long-term growth objectives and strengthens Euroclear's presence in Spain.</li>
<li>The full press release is available in the press section of Euroclear's website.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>Russian sanctioned assets</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>In July 2024, Euroclear will make a first payment of &euro;1.55 billion to the European Fund for Ukraine following the recent implementation of the EU regulation on the windfall contribution. This adds to the &euro;836 million of corporate taxes to be paid to the Belgian State on the profits related to the Russian assets in H1 2024.</li>
<li>The impacts of Russian sanctions are detailed at the end of this press release.</li>

<p><i>"This is my first set of results as CEO of Euroclear and I am proud to announce continued strong results as clients entrusted us with record levels of safekeeping and settlement volumes. Our commitment to client satisfaction, operational excellence and innovation has driven this excellent performance.</i></p>
<p><i>With an ambitious strategy and a committed team, Euroclear aims to extend its position as a European leader with a global footprint. Already in 2024, we have taken steps to further support the financing of the real economy by making capital markets more integrated, liquid, and efficient. Not only have we connected global investors to the world's tenth largest economy, South Korea, but we have also put in place a renewed focus on contributing to Europe's strategic autonomy and Capital Markets Union.&nbsp;Such efforts are of critical importance given the pressing need to finance the green and digital transition around the globe.</i></p>
<p><i>In addition to delivering a robust underlying business performance, Euroclear continues to diligently implement the international sanctions on Russian assets. Euroclear is also complying with its important obligations to put the windfall contribution into effect and will soon make a first payment of &euro;1.55 billion to the European Fund for Ukraine."</i></p>

<p>Assets under custody reached a new record at &euro;39.6 trillion, growing for the seventh quarter in a row, thanks to solid stock exchange performances coupled with robust results in fixed income.</p>
<p>Settlement volumes have also reached new record levels driven by sustained activity throughout 2024.</p>
<p>Funds depot is boosted by the success of ETFs, combined with the higher stock valuations, and reaches an all-time record level of &euro;3.3 trillion.</p>
<p>Collateral Highway outstanding continues to recover following a strong decline in 2023 due to the Liability Driven Investment (LDI) crisis in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p><b>Q2 strategic milestones</b>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Leveraging&nbsp;Euroclear's network to ease capital flows</i>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a financial market infrastructure,&nbsp;Euroclear aims to bring markets together through its open, flexible architecture and connect local issuers with international investors. In the first half, Euroclear Bank has successfully opened the market's first omnibus account for Korean Treasury Bonds (KTB) and Monetary Stabilisation Bonds (MSB), making South Korean local government debt Euroclearable.</p>
<p>Euroclear has also been working with the Liquidity and Sustainability Facility (LSF) to create a repo solution for African Sovereign Eurobonds to sit within our triparty platform. The triparty basket could provide a new avenue for international investment in Africa, creating market efficiencies and increasing liquidity.</p>
<p><i>Data and innovation milestones</i></p>
<p>Euroclear aspires to become a digital and data-enabled financial market infrastructure. By building an open platform providing a variety of services to all market participants, Euroclear continues to evolve its core service offering, while developing new services &ndash; particularly in the data, sustainability and innovation space.</p>
<p>We continued to make progress against this ambition in Q2 as Euroclear and Mosaic Smart Data joined forces to launch a new initiative to transform data into valuable insights. Mosaic Smart Data has launched a new data intelligence service, Smart Markets, powered by Euroclear's fixed income data, including government and corporate bonds. This service will transform Euroclear's data into insights that participants can easily interpret and use to detect market movements, enhance trading models and build informed strategies.</p>
<p>The second quarter of 2024 was marked by another achievement in developing Euroclear's innovation blueprint. Euroclear has collaborated with ARTEX Global Markets, an innovator in the art investment space to make art public via equity shares. With this first issuance of single equity shares, via Euroclear Bank as issuer CSD, Euroclear expands the range of asset classes available under its international model, building on the success of Eurobonds or ETFs.</p>
<p><b>Senior management and shareholder updates</b></p>
<p><i>A new, expanded Executive Committee&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>To accelerate strategy execution, Euroclear redesigned the structure and composition of its top management team). This new Executive Committee composed of eight members will ensure that all the group's constituents are represented in all key strategic decisions and will have a stronger focus on business operations, people and clients &ndash; both Europe and Internationally.</p>
<p>As recently announced, S&eacute;bastien Danloy will join this expanded Executive Committee in mid-September as Euroclear's new Chief Business Officer (appointment&nbsp;subject to regulatory approval) to lead the business initiatives.&nbsp;Joining Euroclear from BNP Paribas Securities Services, S&eacute;bastien brings over 25 years' experience within the banking, asset management and securities services industry.</p>
<p>Euroclear also announced the appointment of Guillaume Eliet as successor to Paul Hurd in the role of Chief Risk Officer. Guillaume will lead the group's Risk function, a core responsibility of a financial market infrastructure, which is embedded in Euroclear's corporate purpose. Guillaume joined Euroclear in 2017 as the Head of Regulatory, Compliance &amp; Public Affairs, before taking the reins as CEO of Euroclear ESES CSDs in 2021. Guillaume will join the Euroclear Board as Executive Director and the Executive Committee.</p>
<p><i>NZ Super Fund increases stake in Euroclear</i></p>
<p>Last year, several high-quality, long-term investors decided to join Euroclear's group of shareholders. Their commitment is a confirmation of the strategic course and long-term potential of the company. After having acquired 4.99% of Euroclear's shares in September 2023, NZ Super Fund, New Zealand's sovereign wealth fund, recently increased its stake to 8.7%. With this investment, NZ Super Fund becomes the fourth largest individual shareholder of Euroclear and has been invited to propose a non-executive director (subject to the National Bank of Belgium's and shareholders' approvals), and will be the sixth non-executive shareholder's representative on Euroclear's Board. This increased investment further evidences the transition of Euroclear's shareholder base from its traditional "user-owned" model to include a greater proportion of long-term institutional investors.</p>
<p><b>Russian sanctions&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Financial impacts of the Russian assets in H1 2024</b></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>The Russian sanctions continue to have a significant impact on&nbsp;Euroclear's earnings. &euro;3.4 billion of the &euro;4 billion interest&nbsp; &nbsp; income generated relate to Russian sanctioned assets.</li>
<li>Applicable to CBR assets dating from 15 February 2024 onwards, the newly introduced EU windfall contribution after tax amounts to &euro;1.7 billion. Euroclear will make a first payment of &euro;1.55 billion<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;to the European Fund for Ukraine.</li>
<li>The remainder of the profits related to sanctioned assets are being put aside as an important buffer against current and future risks.</li>
<li>The sanctions and Russian countermeasures resulted in direct costs of &euro;48 million and a loss of business income of &euro;13 million.</li>

<p><b>Update on Russian sanctions and countermeasures</b></p>
<p>Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 resulted in market-wide application of international sanctions. Euroclear considers the application of international sanctions as a key obligation. Therefore, well established processes are in place which have allowed the group to implement the sanctions while maintaining our normal course of business.</p>
<p>As a result of the sanctions, blocked coupon payments and redemptions owed to sanctioned entities continue to accumulate on Euroclear Bank's balance sheet. At the end of June 2024, Euroclear Bank's balance sheet totalled &euro;207 billion, of which &euro;173 billion relate to sanctioned Russian assets.</p>
<p>In line with Euroclear's risk appetite and policies and as expected by the EU Capital Requirements Regulation, Euroclear's cash balances are re-invested to minimise risk and capital requirements. In the first semester of 2024, interest arising on cash balances from Russian-sanctioned assets was approximately &euro;3.4 billion. Such interest earnings are driven by the prevailing interest rates and the amount of cash balances that Euroclear is required to invest. Subject to Belgian corporate tax, these earnings generated &euro;836 million tax revenue for the Belgian State. As such, future earnings will be influenced by the evolving interest rate environment.</p>
<p>Effective 15 February 2024, the EU Council adopted a Regulation (Council Regulation (EU) 2024/576 of 12 February 2024 amending Regulation (EU) 833/2014) providing for an obligation for Central Securities Depositories (CSDs) holding reserves and assets of the Central Bank of Russia with a total value of more than &euro;1 million to apply specific rules in relation to the cash balances accumulating due to restrictive measures. These CSDs, such as Euroclear Bank, should account for and manage such extraordinary cash balances separately from their other activities, should keep separate the net profit generated and should not dispose of these ensuing net profits (e.g. in the form of dividends to shareholders).</p>
<p>In May 2024, the European Commission has adopted a new regulation about a windfall contribution applicable to CSDs holding Russian Central Bank assets with a total value of more than &euro;1 million<sup>4</sup>. The profits generated by the reinvestment of these sanctioned amounts dating from 15 February 2024 onwards are required to be contributed to the European Fund for Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Euroclear will comply with the EU regulation on the windfall contribution and make a first payment of approx. &euro;1.55 billion to the European Fund for Ukraine in July 2024.</p>
<p>Euroclear continues to act prudently and&nbsp;is further strengthening its capital by retaining&nbsp;the remainder of the Russian sanction related profits&nbsp;as a buffer against current and future risks. Euroclear is focused on minimising potential legal, financial, and operational risks that may arise for itself and its clients, while complying with its obligations.</p>
<p>Various parties in Russia contest the consequences of the application of sanctions, with a significant number of legal proceedings ongoing, almost exclusively in Russian courts. The impact of the lawsuits on Euroclear is uncertain and Euroclear has received a number of unfavourable rulings since Russia does not recognise the international sanctions. Euroclear will continue to defend itself against all legal claims.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: Bank of England, Enforcement Decision Making Committee, new members, expertise, contested enforcement cases

Summary: The Bank of England appoints three new members to its Enforcement Decision Making Committee, expanding its expertise and independence for contested enforcement cases.<br /><br />Summary: The new members include Harry Matovu KC, Dame Clare Moulder DBE, and Pauline Wallace, bringing diverse legal and financial expertise to the committee.<br /><br />Summary: The committee oversees contested enforcement decisions and operates independently of the Bank's investigation teams, with a focus on transparency and due process. <div>
<p>Following an external recruitment process and consultation, the Bank of England (Bank) has appointed three new members to its Enforcement Decision Making Committee (EDMC) taking the total to nine.</p>
<p>The EDMC is the Bank&rsquo;s decision-making body for contested enforcement cases in the statutory regimes the Bank operates in relation to Prudential Regulation, Financial Market Infrastructures, Resolution and Notes issuance.</p>
<p><strong>David Roberts, the Chair of the Court of the Bank of England, said:</strong></p>
<p>&lsquo;I am delighted to welcome the new members of the Bank&lsquo;s Enforcement Decision Making Committee. The Committee &ndash; which is functionally independent from the Bank&rsquo;s investigation teams and other Bank staff &ndash; takes decisions on any contested enforcement actions. The Committee was established in 2018. Since then, with the passing of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2023, the remit of the Committee has extended to cover all the areas in which the Bank has enforcement powers (Prudential Regulation, Financial Market Infrastructures, Resolution and Note issuances). The appointment of the new members, with their impressive range of the expertise and experiences, reflects the expansion of the breadth of the Committee&rsquo;s remit&rsquo;.</p>
<p><strong>Sonya Branch, General Counsel of the Bank of England, said:</strong></p>
<p>&lsquo;The appointment of these three additional distinguished experts to oversee contested enforcement decisions once again reinforces the Bank&rsquo;s commitment to transparency, due process and independent scrutiny across all of the Bank&rsquo;s enforcement activities&rsquo;.</p>
<h3>About the new members</h3>
<h4>Harry Matovu KC</h4>
<p>Harry Matovu KC is a barrister and King&rsquo;s Counsel in practice at the English Commercial Bar. He is a senior member of Brick Court Chambers in London, and his practice includes major domestic and international commercial disputes across a wide range of financial services and commercial sectors. He also sits as an arbitrator in major international commercial disputes.</p>
<p>He is a Governing Bencher of the Inner Temple, one of the four Inns of Court which govern the admission of lawyers to the Bar and provide support for barristers and student barristers, and he has previously held several positions in the governance structures of the Bar, including the Bar Council Professional Conduct and Professional Standards Committees. He has served as a Trustee of various charitable organisations, including 10 years as a Trustee and 5 years as Deputy Chair of Chichester Festival Theatre. He is founder and Chair of the Black Talent Charter, an initiative to improve the representation of Black executives and professionals in business and the professions.</p>
<h4>Dame Clare Moulder DBE</h4>
<p>Dame Clare Moulder DBE is a solicitor who for many years was a partner at the international law firm, Linklaters, advising banks and large companies on a wide range of banking and capital markets transactions and latterly specialising in derivatives and structured products. Dame Clare was appointed a part time judge (recorder) in 2010 and a full-time judge in 2015. In 2017 she became a High Court Judge (KBD) and since retiring in 2022 has continued to sit on a regular basis in the Commercial Court hearing complex commercial disputes often involving financial institutions or firms.</p>
<h4>Pauline Wallace</h4>
<p>Pauline Wallace is a Chartered Accountant. She currently chairs the UK Endorsement Board which is responsible for the adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards in the UK and sits on the Determinations Panel of The Pensions Regulator. From 2013 to 2019, she was a member of the Regulatory Decisions Committee at the Financial Conduct Authority. Prior to 2013, Pauline was a partner in PwC, initially leading the global financial instruments team and subsequently as the UK head of public policy and regulatory affairs for the firm.</p>
<h3>About the EDMC</h3>
<p>The outcome of most disciplinary enforcement cases is agreed between the Bank and the relevant firm or individual. However, if a firm or individual decides to contest a case brought by the Bank, the EDMC Chair will convene an EDMC panel of three or more drawn to consider the evidence, hear any representations and make the decision. A full description of the EDMC and its procedure is set out in the EDMC Procedures, published in January 2024.</p>
<p>EDMC members are appointed for a five-year term, and they may be reappointed for a second term. Members can serve a maximum of two terms. The existing six members include: Sir William Blair (EDMC Chair); Baroness Kishwer Falkner; Anne Heal; Mark Hoban; Philip Marsden (EDMC Deputy Chair) and; Edward Sparrow.</p>

<p>The Oulook&rsquo;s key findings highlight that new LNG terminals have reduced the EU&rsquo;s dependence on Russian gas supply. Combined with high storage levels at the start of summer 2024, this could allow the EU to fill its gas storage without relying on Russian imports. Gas storage remains crucial for security of gas supply, providing essential flexibility to the gas system during winter.</p>

<ul>
<li>ACER acknowledges improvements in ENTSOG&rsquo;s Outlook methodology and appreciates the inclusion of gas supply scenarios addressing major supply risks and uncertainties concerning future Russian gas flows via Ukraine after the end of 2024.</li>
<li>ACER agrees with ENTSOG&rsquo;s recommendations for mitigating the risks of gas supply-demand imbalance in a scenario where Russian pipeline supply ceases and LNG supply to EU is limited. Specifically, ACER supports the need for gas demand reduction and increased LNG imports from different sources to ensure adequate security of supply levels for the winter of 2024/25.</li>
<li>ACER recommends ENTSOG to consider further improvements to its Outlook methodology, including a low LNG supply scenario that excludes Russian LNG supply imports.</li>

<title>ASIC: American Express Ordered To Pay $8 Million Penalty For Failing To Meet Its Design And Distribution Obligations</title>

<div> penalties, American Express Australia Limited, design and distribution obligations, credit cards, David Jones
Summary:
Federal Court orders Amex to pay $8 million for breaching design and distribution obligations, failed to review target market determinations, and failed to inform David Jones. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>The Federal Court has ordered American Express Australia Limited (Amex) to pay $8 million in penalties for breaching the design and distribution obligations (DDO) in relation to two co-branded credit cards which were primarily distributed to customers in David Jones stores.</p>
<p>The Court found Amex breached the design and distribution obligations as a credit card issuer from 25 May 2022 to 5 July 2022, because Amex:</p>
<ul>
<li>ought to have known high cancelled application rates reasonably suggested that the target market determinations (TMDs) for the cards were no longer appropriate; and</li>
<li>failed to stop issuing the credit cards when it had not reviewed the TMDs.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deputy Chair Sarah Court said, &lsquo;This is an important decision, because it highlights the requirement for issuers and distributors of financial products to customers to have in place adequate systems to monitor events and circumstances that suggest a target market determination is no longer appropriate.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Justice Jackman said, 'In addition to an obligation to identify an appropriate target market within a TMD, inherent in this consumer-centric approach is a requirement for financial product issuers and distributors to actively review events and circumstances that may suggest that an existing TMD is no longer appropriate.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Justice Jackman also said, &lsquo;a penalty of this order ensures it has a &ldquo;sting&rdquo; sufficient to deter both repetition by American Express and contravention by other providers of financial products, and one that goes beyond being a mere &ldquo;cost of doing business&rdquo;.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Court also noted that those at Amex &ldquo;responsible for monitoring the TMDs were not aware of their obligations, and those who were aware of the relevant facts and circumstances failed to take action in respect of those matters&rdquo;.</p>
<p>ASIC was unsuccessful in its allegation Amex contravened s994C(5) of the Corporations Act by failing to take all reasonable steps to ensure David Jones was informed it must not continue distributing the credit cards instore.</p>
<p>Amex admitted the contraventions and jointly submitted the penalties sought by ASIC were appropriate.</p>
<p>Amex was also ordered to pay ASIC&rsquo;s cost of the proceedings.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>On 5 December 2022, ASIC commenced civil penalty proceedings in the Federal Court against Amex alleging contraventions of DDO relating to two co-branded credit cards, the David Jones American Express Card and the David Jones American Express Platinum Card, that were distributed through David Jones department stores (see&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2022-releases/22-338mr-asic-takes-civil-penalty-action-against-american-express-australia-in-first-court-case-alleging-breaches-of-design-and-distribution-obligations/" title="22-338MR ASIC takes civil penalty action against American Express Australia in first court case alleging breaches of design and distribution obligations">22-338MR</a>).</p>
<p>The DDO regime requires financial product issuers and distributors to develop and maintain effective product governance arrangements across the life cycle of financial products. DDO also requires product issuers and distributors to actively review events and circumstances that may suggest that an existing TMD is no longer appropriate.</p>

<div> censured, CTRL Investments Limited, Net Tangible Asset, breach, derivatives issuer license
Summary:<br /><br />The Financial Markets Authority censured CTRL Investments Limited for breaching obligations, including failing to meet NTA requirements and provide required reports. CTRL has since restored its NTA levels. <div>
<p>The Financial Markets Authority &ndash; Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko &ndash; has censured CTRL Investments Limited (CTRL) for breaching the obligations of its Derivatives Issuer licence. CTRL failed to meet its minimum Net Tangible Asset (NTA) requirements between 31 March 2023 and 29 March 2024. It also breached other obligations.</p>
<p>CTRL notified the FMA of the NTA breach in October 2023 following FMA enquiries about the late filing of its financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2023. The breach was caused by the failure of an overseas electronic money institution CTRL used to hold a significant amount of the company&rsquo;s assets. The electronic money institution&rsquo;s failure and subsequent impairment of implicated assets eroded the value of assets that comprised the NTA, and this breach triggered requirements that CTRL:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide the FMA with a plan of how the NTA levels would be replenished within 10 working days of discovering the breach</li>
<li>Provide the FMA with daily reporting of its NTA levels until the NTA levels were restored to the required amount</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CTRL was also required to obtain an assurance report within four months of its balance date (31 March 2023) and provide copies of its assurance and NTA reports to the FMA within 20 business days of receiving the reports.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CTRL failed to meet these requirements within the prescribed timeframes.</p>
<p>FMA Director of Response and Specialist Supervision, Peter Taylor, said: &ldquo;The FMA expects licensed market service providers to understand and comply with their legal obligations.&nbsp;Derivatives are inherently risky, and it is important that the FMA has confidence in derivative issuers and their level of regulatory compliance.&nbsp;In situations where issuers hold the majority or all their assets in one entity, we expect the issuer to manage the risk appropriately. Although CTRL had no open positions or retail clients at the time of the breaches, its approach to the various contraventions and the materiality of those conventions warrants a censure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>CTRL has now restored its NTA levels to the required amount. CTRL cooperated fully with the FMA during its enquiries.</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>The market services licensee obligations CTRL breached are:</p>
<ul>
<li>DI Standard Condition 9(1) by failing to meet minimum&nbsp;NTA&nbsp;requirements;</li>
<li>DI Standard Condition 9(5) (b) by failing to provide within the prescribed timeframe a plan of how NTA levels will be replenished to the required amount;</li>
<li>DI Standard Condition 11(2) by failing to provide the FMA with a copy of the Assurance and NTA reports within the prescribed timeframe; and</li>
<li>Regulation 248(1) of the Financial Markets Conduct Regulations 2014 (the&nbsp;FMC Regulations) by failing to obtain the assurance report within the prescribed timeframe.</li>

<div> Keywords: regulatory reform, bank supervision, liquidity, regulatory framework, financial stability <br />
Summary:<br />Banking regulatory framework needs targeted reforms to address identified deficiencies and enhance resilience for future stress. Supervision, liquidity, and regulatory process are crucial. <div>
<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-md-8">
<p>Earlier this year, we passed the one-year anniversary of the failures of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank. The failure of these banks, and the subsequent failure of First Republic Bank, prompted a discussion of the regulatory framework. These failures have also frequently been cited as the basis for a number of matters on the current regulatory reform agenda. Over time, this agenda has expanded to include bank capital regulation, the role of supervision, the potential vulnerabilities to the banking system created by bank-fintech partnerships, and bank liquidity and funding, among other topics.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240718a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a></p>
<p>This conference covers a number of important issues that touch on many aspects of this regulatory reform agenda. Earlier today, panelists discussed the 2023 regional banking stress, the history of financial crises, and deposit insurance reform. Tomorrow we will hear about the discount window and a discussion on the future of contingent liquidity. A further panel will consider what may be next in terms of regulatory reforms.</p>
<p>In considering this last topic, conferences like this serve an important role&mdash;encouraging us to pause and reflect upon these efforts, and providing an opportunity to share thoughts in full public view about what is working and not working within the bank regulatory framework. These discussions also allow us to consider a range of options to both enhance banking system resiliency and to better prepare for future stress in the system. I am especially pleased that we have an opportunity to publicly confront difficult questions, like probing the link between last year's banking stress and elements of the reform agenda purportedly aimed at addressing identified deficiencies.</p>
<p>As we think about reform of the bank regulatory framework, including changes designed to maintain a robust and responsive approach, what are the principles that should guide our thinking? What lessons should we take from past financial crises in terms of the causality and related bank management and supervisory lessons learned? Were those reforms responsive, successful, and durable over time? When we consider the Federal Reserve's operational infrastructure, including Fedwire&reg; and discount window lending, were its tools effective and complementary to other funding sources (including Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) funding) during times of stress, and if not, how could they be improved?</p>
<p>My hope is that in discussing these issues we can develop a better and deeper understanding about sources of bank funding, financial stability, and the future of the banking system. This complex set of issues can be open to interpretation, and as a result, can lead policymakers to different policy prescriptions for how to make the banking system more resilient, and the regulatory response to financial stress more effective.</p>
<p>Conversations like those that we are having today and tomorrow can help us find consensus both in identifying the risks to the financial system and coming to agreement on policy reforms to address them, if needed. As the discussions continue following this conference, it is essential that we include the experience and perspective of state bank commissioners. I look forward to the opportunity to engage with them more fully on these issues. As a former bank commissioner, I greatly value this perspective.</p>
<p>I am hopeful that all of these conversations can help us to understand differing perspectives and enable us to examine the full extent of the underlying issues before we implement reforms that do not address identified problems or do not adequately consider the underlying risks and unintended consequences.</p>
<p>When I think about regulatory reform and the future of the banking system, I begin with the foundational elements that promote accountability in banking regulation: a deep understanding of the banking system; a thorough analysis of the underlying facts; a careful identification of how elements of the banking system interact and perform over time, especially during stress; and a commitment to take ownership of identified problems with targeted reforms that are commensurate with the underlying risks.</p>
<p>These same elements should be the foundational elements of any reform agenda. They should apply not just to changes that I will call "responsive" changes&mdash;those designed to mitigate the risks exposed during the spring 2023 banking stress&mdash;but also to any other contemplated reforms of the bank regulatory framework. If we approach this task with humility and with full accountability of unintended consequences, I expect that we will find opportunities in a number of areas. These involve not only imposing new requirements and expectations on individual banks, but also opportunities to remediate deficiencies and overlapping requirements within the regulatory framework. Both approaches may be equally effective in enhancing the resilience of the banking system and promoting U.S. financial stability.</p>
<p>In my remarks this evening, I will reflect on these elements, as I share my views on the Fed's lender of last resort function, payments infrastructure, supervision, and regulation.</p>
<p><strong>Lender of Last Resort and Payments Infrastructure</strong><br />As part of the reform agenda, we must consider how to operationally enhance and optimize tools like the discount window to meet banking system liquidity needs more effectively. This must include ensuring the payments infrastructure that supports bank funding mechanisms is equipped to operate not just during business-as-usual conditions, but especially during stress events. Last year's banking stress clearly demonstrated the need for reforms and updates, but these issues existed long before the bank failures. Some banks encountered frictions in using the discount window that made it less effective, and these frictions potentially exacerbated the stress that some institutions experienced. Limits on the availability of payments services, including Fedwire, may also have interfered with the ability to effectively manage bank liquidity. These issues require a careful and impartial review to understand the facts, particularly if we base reform efforts on the recent events.</p>
<p><em>Addressing operational readiness</em><br />Maintenance of existing infrastructure is an often overlooked and sometimes thankless job. When the payments infrastructure works "well enough," as it seemed to do in the lead-up to the spring banking stress, it is easy to take for granted that it will work during times of stress. However, this is an area where we must become more vigilant and avoid complacency.</p>
<p>We know that SVB experienced difficulties in accessing discount window loans before its failure. Certainly, there are ways in which the Fed can enhance the technology, the operational readiness, and the services underpinning discount window loans and payment services to ensure that they are available when needed. On this front, I would note that the Federal Reserve recently published a proposal to expand the operating hours of the Fedwire Funds Service and the National Settlement Service (NSS), to operate 22 hours per day, 7 days per week, on a year-round basis.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240718a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;The proposal also requested feedback on whether the discount window should operate during these same expanded hours. The comment period remains open on this proposal, but this seems like it would be a critical improvement, and one that would be responsive to identified shortcomings.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240718a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a></p>
<p>Other changes are also needed to bring payment services and discount window lending into the 21st century, including modernizing the technology banks use to request loans electronically rather than relying upon a person to answer a telephone call, ensuring that collateral can move freely from the bank or FHLB to the Reserve Bank when needed, and identifying and reducing other areas of friction that banks experience in the use of the discount window. Operational improvements&mdash;including technology enhancements and investments&mdash;and improving operational readiness within the Federal Reserve System, should underpin any approach to improvements.</p>
<p><em>Bank liquidity sources</em><br />A critical component of the current reform agenda focuses on the ongoing evolution of bank funding and liquidity sources and mechanisms. Of course, any discussion about the discount window would be incomplete without considering these sources and mechanisms. The discount window is a critical tool, but it does not operate in isolation. It is also intended to be a source of liquidity as a last resort and at a penalty rate, not as a primary funding resource in the normal course of business at a market rate.</p>
<p>While discount window lending can support bank liquidity, it is best thought of as an additional resource in the federal safety net that allows eligible institutions to weather disruptions in liquidity markets and access other resources. Banks have a range of options to manage liquidity needs during business-as-usual operations and during times of stress, including repo markets and FHLB advances. Within this framework, the discount window operates as a backup liquidity authority, a "last resort" for funding needs. In evaluating the bank liquidity framework, it is imperative that we consider and understand the interrelationships among these resources, liquidity requirements and regulations, and bank liquidity planning.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240718a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a></p>
<p>These resources are complementary, so they must be thought about holistically when discussing and seriously considering changes to requirements. Yet, discussions about reforms are often approached in a piecemeal way.</p>
<p>Some policymakers have stated that a potential response to the 2023 banking stress would be to require banks to preposition collateral at the Fed's discount window. The notion is that by forcing banks to preposition collateral in this way, banks will have a ready pool of liquidity to draw from during times of stress. This compulsory requirement to preposition collateral, it is argued, could also mitigate some of the stigma associated with using the discount window, and thereby improve its effectiveness.</p>
<p>So, we must also ask if the perceived stigma of taking loans from the discount window will be mitigated by requirements to preposition collateral. If the stigma of receiving a discount window loan continues to impede the effectiveness of the Fed serving as a lender of last resort, we must consider other ways to address these stigma concerns. There is no reason for a bank to take a loan at a penalty rate or preposition collateral during periods of calm if the discount window operates effectively and communicates with banks on a regular basis. If the issue is that the window does not operate in an effective manner, requirements to use it will not succeed. Investments must be made to address its operational shortcomings.</p>
<p>Some reforms, like encouraging bank readiness to borrow from the discount window if that is part of their contingency funding plans, could be explored more thoroughly. If a bank includes the discount window in these plans and intends to use it during stress, the bank should be prepared to do so. But if we are honest, we recognize that our prior efforts to reduce discount window stigma, as during the COVID period, have not been durable or successful.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons a bank could choose to borrow from the discount window, including market disruptions in liquidity access or a scarcity in the total amount of reserves in the banking system and a specific borrower's growing financial stress. To access primary discount window credit, a borrower must meet financial standards for borrowing. In some ways, these financial requirements to access primary credit suggest that an important "market signal" of discount window borrowing is related to a market liquidity disruption and may be less of a signal about any individual institution's financial condition. But discount window lending is an additional data point for the market and may be read as a sign of financial distress. This possible interpretation alone may be enough to deter usage of the discount window.</p>
<p>As we consider the future of the discount window, we should explore ways to validate the use of discount window lending in our regulatory framework. For example, are there ways to better recognize discount window borrowing capacity in our assessment of a firm's liquidity resources, for example in calculating a firm's compliance with the Liquidity Coverage Ratio?</p>
<p>As the resources available for bank funding continue to evolve, including the Federal Housing Finance Administration's (FHFA) active consideration of reforms to FHLB lending standards, we see direct impacts on access to liquidity. Even though the comment period for these changes just concluded on July 15, these significant shifts are already affecting how FHLB members will need to plan to use FHLB advances for liquidity funding.</p>
<p>Making regulatory changes to liquidity requirements while the FHFA is shifting FHLB funding prioritization for its members leads to several questions that would need to be answered before engaging in prudent policy-making.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240718a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;How would required collateral prepositioning at the discount window affect the availability or amount of FHLB advances that a bank can rely on for funding purposes? More broadly speaking, how will any requirement to preposition collateral at the discount window affect the availability and use of other funding resources or the day-to-day liquidity management practices of banks? A better approach would be to recognize and understand how the FHLBs support bank liquidity and work together with each FHLB through the Reserve Banks in advance of a bank stress to ensure that mechanisms are in place to facilitate the transfer of collateral to the discount window, and that the Reserve Banks have the appropriate seniority over such collateral. A practical and pragmatic approach will work to preserve the stability of the banking system much more effectively than disrupting the bank liquidity operations of the FHLB system that have been in place since the 1930s.</p>
<p>When it comes to the next steps in liquidity reform, I think it is imperative that we tackle known and identified issues that were exposed during the banking stress in the spring of 2023. This must include updating discount window operations and technology and making sure that payment services are available when needed. But for other reforms, a number of important questions remain unanswered, including understanding both where there are frictions and weaknesses in the current bank funding landscape, and what the potential impact (including intended and unintended consequences) of these reforms on the banking industry could be.</p>
<p><strong>Reform of Supervision</strong><br />Banking regulators play a vital role in promoting the safe and sound operation of individual banks and the stability of the U.S. financial system. These statutory responsibilities require banking regulators to ensure that banks are held to high standards: bank regulators enforce regulation to promote safety and soundness, engage in periodic examinations of banks and their holding companies, and require periodic reporting by regulated institutions. When a bank fails to meet these high standards, supervisory action can be taken to force remediation or, in some cases, impose an enforcement action that includes a civil money penalty.</p>
<p>Last year's banking stress highlighted the need for improvements in bank supervision, with several notable failures to identify and appropriately escalate issues during the examination process. Supervision that is not focused on core risks erodes the resiliency in the banking system. Bank failures and losses to the deposit insurance fund certainly demand attention, review, and accountability, but the underlying issues suggest we need to ensure that supervision works appropriately over time.</p>
<p>Many of the reforms targeted in this conference address broader structural concerns&mdash;like imposing sweeping new regulatory reforms, or broad changes to laws like those governing deposit insurance. I applaud the engagement on these issues, but often the most effective regulatory tool is supervision. Effective supervision requires transparency in expectations and an approach that incorporates remediating deficiencies as a part of meeting those expectations.</p>
<p>Many of the risks identified during last year's banking stress did not involve novel or unique risks. Addressing concentration risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk are all key risks that have long been elements deemed critical for effective supervision in bank examinations. These risks are known to create significant vulnerabilities and can be fatal to individual institutions if not managed appropriately over time.</p>
<p>It is clear in the case of SVB that these risks were not managed appropriately. Bank regulators and supervisors also failed to sufficiently identify and prioritize the appropriate risks. Instead, the focus was on broader, qualitative, and process- and policy-oriented risks. Ultimately, both the bank's management and examiners failed to appropriately emphasize these key issues.</p>
<p>An important step in the reform agenda&mdash;and one of the most effective reforms to build resilience against future banking stress&mdash;is to improve the prioritization of safety and soundness in the examination process, ensuring a careful focus on core financial risks. In my mind, successful prioritization involves increased transparency of expectations and a renewed focus on core financial risks. This includes avoiding issues that are only tangential to statutory mandates and critical areas of responsibility. Where necessary, it also includes adopting a more proactive approach for bank management and bank supervisors to deal with identified risks. Our goal must be to avoid straying from these core issues to focus on less foundational and less pressing areas.</p>
<p>There have been some notable examples of regulatory mission creep, including the climate guidance introduced last year by the banking agencies.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240718a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;I have no doubt that this guidance is well-intended, and that climate change is an important public policy issue. But the question should be whether banks should be required to divert limited risk management resources away from critical, near-term risk management, with a parallel shift in focus by bank examiners. Looking at this guidance through the lens of prioritization, one could reasonably conclude that climate change is not currently a financial risk to the banking system and does not justify a shift in prioritization.</p>
<p>While some may view this position as provocative, my goal is to demonstrate a more foundational point&mdash;mis-prioritizing supervisory objectives will have consequences, making banks riskier and the U.S. financial system less resilient over time.</p>
<p><strong>Regulatory Reform</strong><br />When it comes to regulatory reform efforts, we should acknowledge, as a starting point, that the bank regulatory system has undergone significant transformation since the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, in response to the 2008 financial crisis. This has resulted in significantly increased liquidity and bank capital, new stress testing and resolution planning requirements, and several other improvements designed to promote bank resiliency. Not only the quantum, but the quality, of bank capital has also improved. Common equity tier 1 capital is now codified as the highest quality form of regulatory capital and is included within a capital framework that&nbsp;<em>already&nbsp;</em>includes gold-plating over international capital standards.</p>
<p>Measured against this baseline of resiliency, we need to carefully assess the need for regulatory improvements, while maintaining those elements of the bank regulatory framework that have proven durable and successful over time. I have not previously argued nor am I arguing today that the regulatory framework is perfect and beyond reproach. Or that there is no room for improvement or evolution over time. Where we find opportunities for needed improvements&mdash;either to maintain the system's effectiveness or respond to identified weaknesses&mdash;we should make those changes. But these changes should be motivated by a clear-eyed assessment of the facts, if the goal is to achieve changes that are focused, efficient, and durable over the long run.</p>
<p>Before proposing regulatory reform measures to remediate or address issues identified during the spring 2023 banking stress, we should first reflect on the causes that contributed to the failures of SVB and Signature Bank. These bank failures were followed by government intervention in the form of a guarantee on uninsured deposits at these institutions, and the creation of a broad-based emergency lending facility&mdash;the Bank Term Funding Program&mdash;designed to reassure the market about the underlying strength of the U.S. banking system.</p>
<p>Other characteristics of these bank failures&mdash;the rapid pace of depositors withdrawing uninsured deposits&mdash;appeared to deviate from the patterns seen in prior bank failures (in degree, if not in kind). But many of the core problems of these banks stemmed from well-known, core banking risks&mdash;interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and poor risk management. Each of these can be addressed effectively and efficiently through targeted improvements to the supervisory process.</p>
<p><em>Supplementary leverage ratio</em><br />Our current narrow approach to rulemaking&mdash;focusing on a specific reform, without considering the broader framework or context within which these rules exist&mdash;has created a corresponding narrowness when we think about the consequences of regulatory reform. An efficient regulatory system can build resilience both for bank safety and soundness and financial stability. Take for example missed opportunities in capital reform. The current set of capital reform proposals does not address or propose changes to leverage requirements, including the 5 percent leverage ratio that applies to U.S. global systemically important banks, commonly referred to as the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio (or eSLR). Treasury market intermediation can be disrupted by constraints imposed by the eSLR, as occurred during the early days of market stress during the pandemic. It seems prudent to address this known leverage rule constraint before future stresses emerge that would likely disrupt market functioning.</p>
<p>This narrow focus ignores that many requirements are intended to operate in a complementary way, and that these requirements in the aggregate may overlap or conflict, generating unintended consequences. The Federal Reserve has expressly acknowledged the complementary nature of these requirements, for example in noting that some leverage ratio requirements operate as a backstop to risk-based capital requirements.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240718a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;And yet, the discussions of costs and benefits of reform tend to disregard the aggregate impact across rules, even when related reforms are proposed at the same time and the aggregate impacts can be identified and assessed.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240718a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a></p>
<p>When policymakers publicly discuss changes to liquidity and capital, industry participants will modify their behavior in part to meet anticipated regulatory requirements, despite the regulatory uncertainty that accompanies reform efforts. While this response by banks is unfortunate, it is also predictable.</p>
<p><em>Regulatory process</em><br />My remarks this evening have primarily focused on the substance of reforms and the importance of demonstrating a case to support the changes. But it is also necessary to pause and reflect on the importance of following established process and procedure. This is especially important as we think about the choice between making policy reforms through supervision or regulation. Passing regulations under the Administrative Procedure Act requires agencies to follow specific notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures. I think we should approach this process through the most stringent and conservative lens, particularly when it comes to some of the most consequential rulemakings of the last decade. Rulemaking entails publishing rationales for agency action and seeking public input. These procedural requirements serve an important purpose and ultimately promote better agency decisionmaking. One of the most effective tools we have for doing so is the use of public Board meetings to address matters of significant public interest. My hope is that material items on the reform agenda will continue to be handled through public meetings that give greater visibility and insight into the thinking and rationales of different policymakers.</p>
<p><strong>Closing Thoughts</strong><br />I will conclude today's remarks by thanking all of our participants for joining us in Dallas and contributing to these important discussions. The elements that facilitate accountability parallel those elements necessary for effective reform&mdash;a deep understanding of facts, a careful identification of how elements of the banking system perform over time and during stress, and a commitment to take ownership of identified problems with targeted reforms that are commensurate with the underlying risks. As we engage in a review of our regulatory framework for liquidity and more broadly, these elements should serve as a guide to understanding the past and help us chart a path forward.</p>

<div> appraisal, residential real estate, financial institution, guidance, risk management <br />
The federal regulatory agencies issued final guidance on Reconsiderations of Value (ROVs) for residential real estate transactions, advising on policies and procedures for financial institutions to address deficiencies in appraisals and mitigate discrimination risk.<br /><br />Summary: The guidance advises on policies and procedures for financial institutions on reconsiderations of value for residential real estate, including identifying and addressing discrimination risk and incorporating ROV processes into risk management functions. <div>
<p>Five federal regulatory agencies today issued final guidance addressing reconsiderations of value (ROVs) for residential real estate transactions. The guidance advises on policies and procedures that financial institutions may implement to allow consumers to provide financial institutions with information that may not have been considered during an appraisal or if deficiencies are identified in the original appraisal.</p>
<p>ROVs are requests from a financial institution to an appraiser or other preparer of a valuation report to reassess the value of residential real estate. Deficiencies identified in valuations, either through an institution&rsquo;s valuation review processes or through consumer-provided information, may be a basis for financial institutions to question the credibility of the appraisal or valuation report.</p>
<p>The guidance offers examples of ROV policies and procedures that a financial institution may implement to help institutions identify, address, and mitigate discrimination risk; describes the risks of deficient residential real estate valuations; and explains how financial institutions may incorporate ROV processes into risk management functions. The agencies finalized the guidance largely as proposed, with the addition of clarifying edits based on public comments received on the proposed guidance published in July 2023.</p>

Summary:
The B.C. Court of Appeal upheld the Securities Act's provision for contempt orders, citing the importance of securities legislation in protecting the public. The BCSC's power to enforce compliance is essential. <br /><br />Summary: The B.C. Court of Appeal upheld the Securities Act's provision for contempt orders, citing the importance of securities legislation in protecting the public. The BCSC's power to enforce compliance is essential. <div>
<p>The B.C. Court of Appeal has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bccourts.ca/jdb-txt/ca/24/02/2024BCCA0265.htm" target="_blank">dismissed</a>&nbsp;a constitutional challenge of the B.C. Securities Commission (BCSC)&rsquo;s power to seek contempt orders for witnesses who refuse to cooperate with an investigation.</p>
<p>The July 16 appeals court decision stems from Harjit Gahunia and Ranvir Brar&rsquo;s refusal to be interviewed in 2020 and 2021 as witnesses during a BCSC investigation.</p>
<p>Gahunia and Brar filed their constitutional challenge after the BCSC applied in court, under B.C.&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Securities Act,</em>&nbsp;for an order that they were in contempt for refusing to be interviewed. If a court finds that someone is in contempt, it can impose jail time and fines.</p>
<p>The B.C. Supreme Court&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bcsc.bc.ca/about/media-room/news-releases/2023/59-court-affirms-constitutionality-of-bcsc-power-to-seek-contempt-charges">dismissed</a>&nbsp;their challenge in 2023, finding that the Act&rsquo;s provision for a contempt application is not unconstitutional, nor overly broad or vague, and that the only disclosure required in a contempt proceeding is for evidence of a person&rsquo;s alleged refusal to cooperate.</p>
<p>Noting the Supreme Court of Canada (SCC)&rsquo;s recognition of the importance of securities legislation in protecting the public, the Court of Appeal found that the B.C. Supreme Court &ldquo;made no error&rdquo; in dismissing Gahunia and Brar&rsquo;s application, writing that &ldquo;a similar provision of the&nbsp;<em>Securities Act</em>&nbsp;withstood constitutional scrutiny and the chambers judge was correct when she decided that she was bound by the [SCC] precedent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The decision went on to recognize that &ldquo;the Commission&rsquo;s power to enforce&nbsp;compliance with its investigations is essential to the effectiveness of its investigatory powers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The BCSC is now able to issue an administrative penalty of up to $1 million, as well as other sanctions, for failing to comply with a summons because of Act amendments that came into force in 2023.</p>

<div> Treasury International Capital, TIC data, May 2024, securities, foreign acquisitions
Summary:
TIC data for May 2024 shows a net TIC inflow of $15.8 billion, with net sales of long-term U.S. securities by foreign residents at $16.7 billion. Foreign official inflows were $8.6 billion, and U.S. residents increased their holdings of long-term foreign securities by $37.8 billion. Foreign holdings of U.S. Treasury bills decreased by $9.8 billion, while banks' own net dollar-denominated liabilities to foreign residents increased by $65.7 billion. <div>
<p>The U.S. Department of the Treasury today released Treasury International Capital (TIC) data for May 2024.&nbsp; The next release, which will report on data for June 2024, is scheduled for August 15, 2024.</p>
<p>The sum total in May of all net foreign acquisitions of long-term securities, short-term U.S. securities, and banking flows was a net TIC inflow of $15.8 billion. &nbsp;Of this, net foreign private inflows were $7.3 billion, and net foreign official inflows were $8.6 billion.</p>
<p>Foreign residents decreased their holdings of long-term U.S. securities in May; their net sales were $16.7 billion.&nbsp; Net sales by private foreign investors were $17.7 billion, while net purchases by foreign official institutions were $1.0 billion.</p>
<p>U.S. residents increased their holdings of long-term foreign securities, with net purchases of $37.8 billion.</p>
<p>After including adjustments, such as estimated foreign portfolio acquisitions of U.S. stocks through stock swaps, overall net foreign sales of long-term securities are estimated to have been $54.6 billion in May.</p>
<p>Foreign residents decreased their holdings of U.S. Treasury bills by $9.8 billion.&nbsp; Foreign resident holdings of all dollar-denominated short-term U.S. securities and other custody liabilities increased by $4.7 billion.</p>
<p>Banks&rsquo; own net dollar-denominated liabilities to foreign residents&nbsp;increased&nbsp;by $65.7 billion.</p>
<p>Complete data are available on the Treasury website at:</p>

<h3>ABOUT TIC DATA</h3>
<p>The monthly data on holdings of long-term securities, as well as the monthly table on Major Foreign Holders of Treasury Securities, reflect foreign holdings of U.S. securities collected primarily on the basis of custodial data.&nbsp; These data help provide a window into foreign ownership of U.S. securities, but they cannot attribute holdings of U.S. securities with complete accuracy.&nbsp; For example, if a U.S. Treasury security purchased by a foreign resident is held in a custodial account in a third country, the true ownership of the security will not be reflected in the data.&nbsp; The custodial data will also not properly attribute U.S. Treasury securities managed by foreign private portfolio managers who invest on behalf of residents of other countries.&nbsp; In addition, foreign countries may hold dollars and other U.S. assets that are not captured in the TIC data.&nbsp; For these reasons, it is difficult to draw precise conclusions from TIC data about changes in the foreign holdings of U.S. financial assets by individual countries.</p>

<div> paper, best practices, electronic trading, risk management, market disruptions
Summary:
FIA released a paper on best practices for electronic trading risk management, including pre-trade risk management, volatility control, and post-trade analysis. These practices are effective for existing and evolving technologies. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>FIA, a leader for over 14 years in the development of best practices for mitigating the risks of electronic trading, has released its latest paper -&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fia.org/sites/default/files/2024-07/FIA_WP_AUTOMATED%20TRADING%20RISK%20CONTROLS_FINAL_0.pdf">Best Practices for Automated Trading Risk Controls and System Safeguards</a>.</p>
<p>This paper consolidates our previous work and covers best practices in pre-trade risk management, exchange volatility control mechanisms, post-trade analysis and exchange-based conformance testing, among other areas. These practices are designed to help ensure that markets operate safely, regardless of the technology used.&nbsp;The tools developed through the collaboration of market participants and exchanges to manage the risks related to automated trading have proven highly effective in limiting market disruptions and protecting markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"As we reviewed our previous work in connection with the production of this paper, we were pleased to find that, as trading technologies have evolved over time, the risk mitigation tools used by market participants and exchanges continue to keep our markets operating effectively. Although the paper builds on more than a decade of work in this area, the practices it outlines&nbsp;are well suited to both existing technologies and evolving ones, such as Artificial Intelligence," said Walt Lukken, President and CEO of FIA.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The OCC uses enforcement actions against an institution-affiliated party (IAP) to deter, encourage correction of, or prevent violations, unsafe or unsound practices, or breaches of fiduciary duty. Enforcement actions against IAPs reinforce the accountability of individuals for their conduct regarding the affairs of a bank. The term &ldquo;institution-affiliated party,&rdquo; or IAP, is defined in 12 USC 1813(u) and includes bank directors, officers, employees, and controlling shareholders. Orders of Prohibition prohibit an individual from any participation in the affairs of a bank or other institution as defined in 12 USC 1818(e)(7). Actions taken against IAPs are:</p>

<div> supervisory system, financial reporting, BaFin, independence, enforcement<br />
Summary: Germany's financial reporting supervision improved with BaFin's enhanced independence, selection process, investigative powers, and compliance with enforcement guidelines. <br /><br /> <div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify">The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor, published today its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-07/ESMA42-2004696504-7690_Follow-up_Report_to_Wirecard_Peer_Review.pdf">Follow-up Report</a>&nbsp;to the Wirecard Fast Track Peer Review assessing the progress made with respect to the recommendations formulated in 2020.</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify">This report follows up on the implementation of the recommendations made in the previous&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/library/esma42-111-5349_fast_track_peer_review_report_-_wirecard.pdf">Wirecard Fast Track Peer Review Report</a>.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">Among the key findings, ESMA highlights the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Germany&rsquo;s supervisory system in financial reporting was substantially revised and strengthened, discontinuing the 2-tier system and entrusting all supervision to the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin);</li>
<li>BaFin&rsquo;s independence from issuers and government improved with the set-up of a framework&nbsp;for managing conflicts of interests applicable to all staff and principles of cooperation formalised between BaFin and the Government;</li>
<li>the selection model and examination procedure are improved,&nbsp;</li>
<li>the investigative powers, cooperation and exchange of information are expanded;</li>
<li>BaFin now fully complies with the Guidelines on Enforcement of Financial Information (GLEFI).</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>ESMA had previously carried out a Peer Review under the ESMA Regulation and Peer Review Methodology, in the form of a Fast Track procedure and focusing on only one jurisdiction and one issuer.</p>

<div> Tokenization, equity, liquidity, accessibility, efficiency
<br /><br />Summary:
MOCHAX and Tokeny collaborate to tokenize equity, offering increased liquidity, lower transaction costs, and automated transactions for investors, revolutionizing onchain finance. <div>
<div class="wpb_text_column ">
<div class="wpb_wrapper">
<p><a href="https://mochax.xyz/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>MOCHAX</span></a><span>, a leading digital asset management firm, is launching a Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization project in collaboration with&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tokeny</a>, the pioneering onchain finance operating system for tokenized securities. This initiative tokenizes the equity of the firm, bringing new levels of liquidity, accessibility, and efficiency to the equity market.</span></p>
<p><span>According to Pitchbook, private equity has historically outperformed public markets in return comparisons over periods ranging from 5 to 20 years. However, the traditional equity market is inaccessible and illiquid as firms generally require a large minimum investment, high transaction costs, and a long lock-up period.</span></p>

</div>
<div class="w-separator size_small"></div>
<div class="wpb_text_column ">
<div class="wpb_wrapper">
<p><span>RWA tokenization, the process of representing an asset on the blockchain, provides a solution to solve these challenges. MOCHAX leverages Tokeny&rsquo;s white-label T-REX Platform to tokenize its equity, offering an e-commerce-like digital experience for investors. This approach simplifies the investment process and replaces traditional manual methods. By enabling 24/7 peer-to-peer automated transactions among qualified investors, MOCHAX is reshaping the equity market, making previously impossible features accessible to equity investors and increasing liquidity.</span></p>
<p><span>An&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ey.com/en_us/insights/financial-services/tokenization-in-asset-management" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">EY survey</a>&nbsp;shows that high-net-worth investors and institutional investors rank tokenized equity as the top choice among tokenized alternative assets, due to its increased liquidity, lower transaction costs, improved performance, and enhanced transparency. Since 2021, the team at MOCHAX has been at the forefront of blockchain and digital asset investments, achieving a 44X return on invested capital. To meet this demand, MOCHAX is positioning itself as the go-to platform for tokenized equity with the launch of its security token offering.</span></p>

<div> Geely, Fournais Holding, Mandatum Group, Saxo Bank, strategic review <br />
Summary: Saxo Bank is undergoing a strategic review led by its current shareholders and Goldman Sachs International to guide its future growth. <div>
<p>The owners of Saxo Bank A/S ("Saxo&rdquo;), a leading online platform for traders and investors, namely, Geely Financials Denmark A/S (&ldquo;Geely&rdquo;), a subsidiary of Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co. Ltd, Fournais Holding A/S (&ldquo;Fournais Holding&rdquo;), and Mandatum Group ("Mandatum&rdquo;) (collectively, the &ldquo;Shareholders") have decided to initiate a review of strategic opportunities. The objective is to provide Saxo with the best possible foundation to continue its growth journey, serve clients and partners, and further develop its employees and company culture.</p>
<p>Founded by CEO Kim Fournais in 1992, Saxo launched one of the first online trading platforms in Europe in 1998, providing professional-grade tools and easy access to global financial markets.

<h2>Speech</h2>
<p>Good morning, all. I am delighted to be here today to discuss a very important topic:&nbsp;<strong>collateral management</strong>.</p>
<p>But first allow me to take a step back to set out the broader context. Since the global financial crisis, we have seen a large shift in direct risk-taking from banks to non-banks, driving material growth in market-based finance<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/july/nathanael-benjamin-speech-followed-by-panel-preparing-for-liquidity-stresses#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[1]</a></sup>. Today, half of the funding for UK businesses comes directly from financial markets and non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs), rather than traditional bank loans<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/july/nathanael-benjamin-speech-followed-by-panel-preparing-for-liquidity-stresses#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[2]</a></sup>. This shift has increased banks&rsquo; exposures to the non-bank sector as they intermediate, and provide leverage, for this funding. And counterparties across the financial ecosystem have become increasingly interconnected.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where we come to&nbsp;<strong>collateral</strong>. To limit counterparty risk, credit relationships in the financial system have become more collateralised &ndash; whereby those who owe money pledge assets as security with those to whom they owe the money. That has made the system safer. Now counterparty risk certainly hasn&rsquo;t gone away &ndash; far from it &ndash; and I&rsquo;ve spoken about that on a number of occasions before<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/july/nathanael-benjamin-speech-followed-by-panel-preparing-for-liquidity-stresses#footnote-4" id="footnote-ref-4"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[3]</a></sup>. But measures such as central clearing or improvements in some bilateral margining practices have helped. And the resulting increase in collateralisation has brought significant benefits.</p>
<p>But it has also introduced new challenges.</p>
<p>One challenge is the increased liquidity demands that can result from sharp rises in margin requirements in times of stress. Counterparties have sometimes had to find cash or high-quality collateral at short notice to meet margin calls. This can result in fire-sales of assets when margin calls were sudden or unexpected. In that sense counterparty risk for banks has to some extent transformed into liquidity risk for their clients.</p>
<p>Another challenge is the potential interaction between initial margin requirements and leverage. Bilateral initial margin requirements in some derivatives markets, and haircuts in some repo markets, are sometimes insufficient in good times. This means some counterparties are allowed to take positions that are insufficiently self-funded to protect the other side against the underlying risks. And that may facilitate excessive leverage. When market volatility increases during a stress, initial margin often increases and if holders of over-leveraged positions cannot source enough collateral to meet those margin calls, they will be forced to de-leverage by selling assets. This can lead to a pro-cyclical reduction in leverage in stress, triggering a fire-sale.</p>
<p>These issues relate directly to the typical systemic vulnerabilities in market-based finance identified by the Bank of England&rsquo;s Financial Policy Committee (FPC)<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/july/nathanael-benjamin-speech-followed-by-panel-preparing-for-liquidity-stresses#footnote-5" id="footnote-ref-5"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[4]</a></sup>. These include liquidity mismatches, excessive leverage, and lack of operational readiness, at the level of individual financial institutions. And jumps to illiquidity at the system-wide level, which is exacerbated by concentrated or correlated positions, and interconnectedness. During stress, these vulnerabilities can disrupt financial stability by impacting systemic markets, systemic institutions, and the provision of vital services such as funding to the real economy.</p>
<p>The good news? A lot of work is happening &ndash; internationally and domestically &ndash; to ensure the financial system evolves in a safe and sustainable way. This includes efforts to address low haircuts, particularly in sovereign debt repo markets. And to ensure market participants are prepared for inevitable margin calls and the liquidity need they will generate. Getting this right is particularly important for many vulnerabilities in the financial system.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go into all this now.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>This month 17 years ago, two Bear Stearns&rsquo; hedge funds investing in securities backed by US subprime mortgages filed for bankruptcy. These were the first dominos to fall in a cascade leading to the near implosion of the global financial system and the most severe global economic downturn since the Great Depression. How did a relatively small part of the global securities market have such devastating consequences?</p>
<p>One factor was the high leverage associated with these securities, especially for higher-rated securities. Initially perceived safe, these securities offered only modest spreads, and getting some leverage was the only way to make the expected returns palatable. That leverage was typically achieved through sale-and-repurchase agreements, or &ldquo;repos,&rdquo; which are essentially collateralised loans. A key feature of a repo is the haircut applied by the cash lender to the securities taken as collateral. The smaller the haircut, the more the cash borrower can leverage its equity.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/july/nathanael-benjamin-speech-followed-by-panel-preparing-for-liquidity-stresses#footnote-6" id="footnote-ref-6"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>As the perceived risk of subprime-related securities increased during the crisis, haircuts escalated, triggering a spiral of funding difficulties and asset sales. Average haircuts across nine types of securities at the core of the crisis rose from less than 1% in mid-2007 to almost 50% a year later.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/july/nathanael-benjamin-speech-followed-by-panel-preparing-for-liquidity-stresses#footnote-7" id="footnote-ref-7"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[6]</a></sup>&nbsp;This reduced the debt financing available to investors, often forcing them to sell some of their securities to obtain liquidity. That put additional pressures on prices, generating mark-to-market losses, and eroding investors&rsquo; equity. So it became even harder to fund security holdings, and further sales and losses followed. This severe &lsquo;deleveraging&rsquo; was partly due to haircuts that were too low before the crisis, allowing high levels of leverage to build up. And when reversed, that triggered a destabilising spiral of fire sales, losses, and rising haircuts.</p>
<p>Exposures to securities linked to subprime mortgages were often complicated by credit default swaps (CDS)<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/july/nathanael-benjamin-speech-followed-by-panel-preparing-for-liquidity-stresses#footnote-8" id="footnote-ref-8"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[7]</a></sup>. The CDS network was large, complex, and opaque. In addition, counterparty exposures to the providers of those CDSs, and from other over the counter (OTC) derivatives, were often uncollateralised. That meant losses or defaults could easily spread between counterparties. So lenders became very cautious. Eventually, wholesale lending markets froze, including interbank markets at the heart of the financial system.</p>
<p>We know how the story ended. Several dominos toppled and with the financial system imploding, authorities around the world supported financial institutions on an unprecedented scale.</p>
<p>Never again!</p>
<p>Market participants and global authorities took several steps to enhance the resilience of individual firms and that of the financial system. In particular<strong>, the system became increasingly collateralised</strong>. In wholesale funding markets, transactions shifted away from unsecured loans and more towards secured repos. In the OTC derivatives market, regulatory measures targeted the nodes of the network, the edges linking those nodes, and the overall shape of the network.</p>
<p>Key nodes were the large systemically important banks, which linked to many other institutions, and supported the real economy. The Basel III capital and liquidity standards were developed. And banks were also discouraged, or even prevented in some jurisdictions, from taking directional positions in securities and derivatives markets that expose them to market risk. More of these speculative positions are now taken by NBFIs.</p>
<p>The edges, making one node vulnerable to another, were uncollateralised derivatives exposures. These have since been collateralised through margin requirements. For new trades in bilateral, OTC, markets, this includes mandatory variation margin, and for the largest participants or portfolios, mandatory initial margin. ISDA&rsquo;s Standard Initial Margin Model (SIMM) has been widely adopted to calculate initial margins for bilateral OTC derivative portfolios, including most types of OTC derivatives across multiple asset classes: interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, equity, and commodities. As the period of greatest historical stress is always included in this model, initial margin requirements are generally quite stable. However, it may not react sufficiently quickly when periods of greater stress occur.</p>
<p>For a subset of trades including most interest rate swaps and credit default swaps, mandatory central clearing has been introduced and central counterparty clearing houses (CCPs) secure their counterparty exposures against collateral. On derivatives transactions, CCPs collect variation margin and initial margin. CCPs typically require variation margin to be settled in cash. For initial margin, they may also accept high-quality and liquid securities, such as government bonds.</p>
<p>Through this central clearing, the overall shape of the network has been simplified from &ldquo;spaghetti&rdquo; to a smaller, less complex, and more transparent one. On top of margining requirements, central clearing supports financial stability thanks to multi-lateral netting, which reduces aggregate counterparty exposures. And, for counterparties facing CCPs, their credit risk is reduced because CCPs are designed to be more robust, with no market risk.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/july/nathanael-benjamin-speech-followed-by-panel-preparing-for-liquidity-stresses#footnote-9" id="footnote-ref-9"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Repo markets have both centrally cleared and (non-cleared) bilateral segments. In the bilateral segment, haircuts are set by lenders using their own schedules or internal models, as there is no standard industry model. Some government bond repos are cleared, but the majority remain in the bilateral segment. For instance, around one-third of gilt repos are centrally cleared.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/july/nathanael-benjamin-speech-followed-by-panel-preparing-for-liquidity-stresses#footnote-10" id="footnote-ref-10"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>Repo markets are routinely used by firms to manage their day-to-day liquidity. So they are core to the functioning of the financial system. And the Bank of England too offers regular repo facilities to banks as part of delivering on our monetary policy and financial stability objectives. And we expect a significant increase in our regular repo operations as we look ahead to the future, as Andrew Bailey outlined in a recent speech.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/july/nathanael-benjamin-speech-followed-by-panel-preparing-for-liquidity-stresses#footnote-11" id="footnote-ref-11"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>So overall, developments in collateralisation have been positive for financial stability, but there are challenges:</p>
<ol>
<li>Variation margin supports financial stability by preventing the build-up of current exposures. Regular collection of variation margin, bringing current exposures back to zero as the market value of the underlying positions evolves, limits counterparty risk and supports confidence in the system. But when market prices move sharply in a stress, variation margin requirements reflect those moves, and therefore counterparties who are out of the money may face large margin calls. At the same time as changes in the financial cycle bring other stresses. These calls for additional variation margin can lead to liquidity strains and amplify a stress, depending on the size of the call, the timing and the readiness of the one who receives it. This has been particularly notable for NBFIs as many of them held directional or mismatched positions, naturally generating larger margin calls during market volatility. Whereas banks, partly reflecting previous reforms, had relatively flat positions, larger liquidity buffers, and access to central bank liquidity facilities.</li>
<li>Initial margin and haircuts ensure counterparties are collateralised against potential future losses. This further reduces counterparty risk by providing a buffer against such losses in case the counterparty gets in trouble and positions need to be unwound or novated to someone else during what is called the &ldquo;margin period of risk&rdquo;. But its calibration is very important. If initial margin is set too low in good times it can contribute to excessive leverage in the system, and result in sharp increases in margin requirements in bad times. Whereas if it is too high, financial markets could become too expensive, restricting firms&rsquo; ability to hedge their business risks. In particular,&nbsp;<a id="_Hlk172121252"></a>we have seen initial margins in some bilateral derivative markets set too low in good times. Same with bilateral repo haircuts, which are often zero. Securities financing transaction data<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/july/nathanael-benjamin-speech-followed-by-panel-preparing-for-liquidity-stresses#footnote-12" id="footnote-ref-12"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[11]</a></sup>&nbsp;show that gilt repo haircuts are generally near-zero, meanwhile haircuts on repo transactions backed by US Treasury securities are typically at or below 0.5%.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/july/nathanael-benjamin-speech-followed-by-panel-preparing-for-liquidity-stresses#footnote-13" id="footnote-ref-13"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[12]</a></sup>&nbsp;This is sometimes explained by the trades being part of a broader portfolio of transactions. But that&rsquo;s not always the case. Government bond repo markets represent a core systemic market underpinning financial stability given they are crucial for short-term financing and liquidity management, and support a range of important financial services. So the terms on which leverage is provided are of utmost importance.</li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally, the interconnected two-tier structure of cleared markets can sometimes allow a stress to spread quickly through the system. Clearing members, often dealer-banks, face CCPs directly and clear trades with the CCP on behalf of their clients. CCPs collect variation and initial margin from the clearing members against these trades. The clearing members typically pass on similar demands to the clients whom they face bilaterally. However, they sometimes request higher initial margin, applying an &lsquo;add-on&rsquo; or &lsquo;multiplier,&rsquo; reflecting concerns about credit quality or concentration of the clients&rsquo; positions. And those multipliers have at times been applied at a late stage, after the onset of stress. So liquidity demands can be amplified during a stress, as they spread outwards from CCPs. More generally margining practices can vary across the two tiers. And in good times we have seen terms on the bilateral side sometimes determined by commercial pressure to attract business, rather than sound risk management.</p>
<p>So now I will turn to examples of some recent stresses to illustrate some of these challenges.</p>
<h3>Recent episodes of turbulence</h3>
<h4>Jumps to illiquidity</h4>
<p>At the outbreak of Covid-19, large and sudden asset price moves caused an intense &lsquo;dash for cash&rsquo;, leading to large and sudden variation margin calls and an increase in initial margin requirements. This contributed to liquidity strains on market participants. Due to the large price moves, variation margin calls demanded by CCPs globally surged from a daily average of $25 billion to a single-day peak of $140 billion.

With an imbalance between liquidity demand and supply, authorities intervened. For instance, the Federal Reserve created a facility providing short-term funding to support private sector purchases of money market funds assets, avoiding the need to fire-sell them.</p>
<h4>Hidden and excessive leverage, alongside concentrated positions</h4>
<p>A year later, Archegos Capital Management &ndash; who had established concentrated positions and &ldquo;hidden leverage&rdquo; &ndash; defaulted on margin calls from several prime brokers. Archegos held large positions in a handful of entertainment stocks and internet retailers through leveraged shareholdings and total return swaps (TRS) spreading the latter across several prime brokers, none of which fully understood the full size of Archegos&rsquo; positions.</p>
<p>But the share prices of two companies it invested in fell sharply, generating large losses and margin calls. Struggling to meet these calls &ndash; being unprepared from a liquidity perspective &ndash; Archegos started selling its share holdings. The resulting large trade volumes in markets with limited liquidity caused prices to move further down, generating more margin calls and losses. Eventually, it could not meet its margin calls. Its prime brokers seized and sold remaining shares posted as collateral and liquidated shares held as hedges against TRS positions with Archegos, pushing prices further down. In the end, Archegos failed, having incurred losses of about $20 billion, with prime brokers sharing losses of about $10 billion.</p>
<h4>Jumps to illiquidity, again</h4>
<p>Less than a year later, Russia invaded Ukraine, leading to unprecedented increases in certain energy prices. The Title Transfer Facility (TTF) price of natural gas, the main European benchmark, surged to levels ten times higher than the previous decade&rsquo;s average. Margin calls on TTF futures contracts increased correspondingly. Average daily variation margin calls increased more than 16-fold in the first half of 2022 compared with the relatively calm period of 2019-2020.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/july/nathanael-benjamin-speech-followed-by-panel-preparing-for-liquidity-stresses#footnote-21" id="footnote-ref-21"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[20]</a></sup>&nbsp;Initial margin requirements increased sharply at the two major European exchanges, constraining leverage from more than five times in September 2021, to less than two times in March 2022. Some CCP clearing members demanded clients post not only the initial margin of the CCP, but an extra amount determined by a margin &ldquo;multiplier&rdquo; or &ldquo;add-on,&rdquo; reflecting concerns about credit quality and concentrated positions.</p>
<p>Commodity traders, who had taken short positions in futures contracts to hedge positions in physical gas not yet sold to energy suppliers, faced intense liquidity strains due to margin calls, due within a day. They eventually had to cut hedges to meet these margin calls.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/july/nathanael-benjamin-speech-followed-by-panel-preparing-for-liquidity-stresses#footnote-22" id="footnote-ref-22"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[21]</a></sup>&nbsp;Reflecting that, open interest in TTF contracts on the major European exchanges fell by around 20%. With their ability to hedge compromised, commodity traders could not bear the financial risk associated with their current activity levels and were inclined to scale back. The UK authorities introduced a loan guarantee scheme to facilitate commercial bank loans to certain approved energy firms that were unable to meet extraordinary margin calls due to large moves in energy prices.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/july/nathanael-benjamin-speech-followed-by-panel-preparing-for-liquidity-stresses#footnote-23" id="footnote-ref-23"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[22]</a></sup>&nbsp;Alongside wider measures from outside the UK,<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/july/nathanael-benjamin-speech-followed-by-panel-preparing-for-liquidity-stresses#footnote-24" id="footnote-ref-24"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[23]</a></sup>&nbsp;confidence in lending to energy firms was supported, and the scheme was not drawn upon.</p>
<h4>Insufficient margins or haircuts</h4>
<p>Half-a-year later, in September 2022, the UK&rsquo;s Liability Driven Investment (LDI) funds came under significant stress from margin and collateral calls following a spike in gilt yields.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/july/nathanael-benjamin-speech-followed-by-panel-preparing-for-liquidity-stresses#footnote-25" id="footnote-ref-25"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[24]</a></sup>&nbsp;LDI funds held gilts, funded through the repo market. They also had receive-fixed positions in interest rate swaps, many of which were cleared with CCPs. Both positions were vulnerable to losses and variation margin and collateral calls when interest rates rose. Moreover, LDI funds had particularly high leverage, facilitated through repo financing, provided by banks, often at very low haircuts. Average gilt repo haircuts for LDI funds were only around 25 basis points in the first three quarters of 2022.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/july/nathanael-benjamin-speech-followed-by-panel-preparing-for-liquidity-stresses#footnote-26" id="footnote-ref-26"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[25]</a></sup></p>
<p>As gilt yields increased sharply, LDI funds had to meet variation margin calls on their swaps and top up the collateral backing their repo loans. In the four days to 28 September, 30-year gilt yields rose more than twice as much as the largest 4-day move since 2000 &ndash; an already very large move, witnessed during the &lsquo;dash for cash&rsquo;.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/july/nathanael-benjamin-speech-followed-by-panel-preparing-for-liquidity-stresses#footnote-27" id="footnote-ref-27"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[26]</a></sup>&nbsp;With limited cash on their balance sheets, LDI funds had to sell assets to meet the resulting collateral calls. In addition, the funds&rsquo; net asset values declined, leaving them with less equity capital to fund initial margins and haircuts for their outstanding positions. Hence, they liquidated some of their positions, moving prices further against themselves. Overall, the fire sale caused by LDI funds reduced gilt prices by around 7 percentage points, which compared to a total fall of about twice that amount.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/july/nathanael-benjamin-speech-followed-by-panel-preparing-for-liquidity-stresses#footnote-28" id="footnote-ref-28"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[27]</a></sup></p>
<p>Pension funds, whose solvency improved as LDI funds&rsquo; solvency fell, had the financial capacity to recapitalise their LDI funds interests. However, selling assets and transferring liquidity to the LDI funds took time, which contributed to LDI funds being forced to sell assets. There was a lack of operational preparedness. To restore financial stability, the Bank of England launched a temporary and targeted asset purchase programme.</p>
<h4>Reflections</h4>
<p>Looking back, these episodes of market turbulence highlight the two key challenges I noted in my introduction. First, margin calls were sharp and sometimes larger than anticipated. The liquidity demands created by these margin calls caused pressure on some participants to source collateral at short notice, affecting systemic financial markets that are core to the economy. Second, in some markets, participants were able to build up excessive leverage. Had margins and haircuts been higher in good times, market participants may have maintained a more robust buffer against contagion risks in the market, acting as a first line of defence against the risk they chose to take on.</p>
<p>Looking forward, the Bank of England&rsquo;s System-Wide Exploratory Scenario (SWES) is testing how shocks propagate throughout the financial system and potentially affect core markets. Margin calls and the procyclicality of repo financing are important features of the exercise.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/july/nathanael-benjamin-speech-followed-by-panel-preparing-for-liquidity-stresses#footnote-29" id="footnote-ref-29"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[28]</a></sup>&nbsp;In the scenario, substantial liquidity needs are generated. 80% stemming from variation margin calls and a further 10% from rising initial margin requirements. They fall mostly on NBFIs, who often have to top up collateral on their repo transactions, rather than on banks. The Bank&rsquo;s 2023 CCP Supervisory Stress Test also highlights the relative vulnerability of NBFIs to margin calls.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/july/nathanael-benjamin-speech-followed-by-panel-preparing-for-liquidity-stresses#footnote-30" id="footnote-ref-30"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[29]</a></sup></p>
<h3>Policy measures</h3>
<p>The good news is that a lot of work is underway to enhance margin and haircut practices and improve liquidity preparedness, while also addressing the build-up of excessive NBFI leverage.</p>
<h4>Insufficient preparedness to meet collateral calls during high volatility</h4>
<p>After the dash for cash, an international group on margin, coordinated via BCBS, CPMI, and IOSCO, undertook a comprehensive review of margining<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/july/nathanael-benjamin-speech-followed-by-panel-preparing-for-liquidity-stresses#footnote-31" id="footnote-ref-31"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[30]</a></sup>&nbsp;to assess the extent to which initial and variation margin requirements in centrally and non-centrally cleared derivatives markets contributed to liquidity pressures, particularly of NBFIs during the dash for cash. The review suggested a number of areas for further international policy consideration, generally to better prepare market participants for margin calls. It suggested further work to increase transparency of initial margin in centrally cleared markets,<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/july/nathanael-benjamin-speech-followed-by-panel-preparing-for-liquidity-stresses#footnote-32" id="footnote-ref-32"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[31]</a></sup>&nbsp;and to streamline variation margin processes in centrally and non-centrally cleared markets. It also suggested further work to enhance the liquidity preparedness of market participants.</p>
<p>Accordingly, a set of international groups took this work forward and recently published a range of consultation papers containing policy recommendations. Those include, amongst other things, a recommendation that CCPs develop better margin simulators, and disclose a standardised measure of margin responsiveness. And that market participants be better prepared for margin calls to reduce procyclical behaviour during times of market-wide stress.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/july/nathanael-benjamin-speech-followed-by-panel-preparing-for-liquidity-stresses#footnote-33" id="footnote-ref-33"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[32]</a></sup>&nbsp;These recommendations can support the development of common standards across non-bank market participants. They are all about robust liquidity risk management, stress testing, collateral management, and operational readiness for when that margin call arrives in times of stress. And we strongly support this international work.</p>
<p><a id="_Hlk172121449"></a>And in non-centrally cleared derivative markets, firms should consider creating flexibility in the type of assets deliverable as collateral for variation margin. This can mitigate the risk of correlated forced asset sales during periods of high volatility. A range of eligible asset types can be negotiated through bilateral agreements with counterparties, or &ldquo;dirty Collateral Support Annexes.&rdquo; This approach allows NBFIs to use securities they already hold to meet margin calls &ndash; particularly relevant for NBFIs such as insurers and pension funds, who typically hold large amounts of liquid securities but not large cash buffers. Equally important is addressing legal and operational issues causing frictions and delays in completing variation margin payments, particularly under stress. Standardising intra-day variation processes across markets and automating margin processes will also help with operational readiness. The move to T+1 settlement of securities recently proposed in the UK can further free up liquidity tied up in the system when collateral is sold.</p>
<p>Alongside this, banks, who are the main providers of leverage, should take appropriate steps to understand their counterparties&rsquo; liquidity profile and to consider how that might change in a stress &ndash; that should form a key part of credit due diligence.</p>
<h4>Insufficient haircuts or margins</h4>
<p>In addition to thinking about the liquidity impacts caused by sudden changes in margin requirements, we also need to be mindful of the absolute level of margins in good times as well as in bad times, ensuring initial margin or haircuts provide adequate coverage.</p>
<p>The Bank of England&rsquo;s Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) called out risks from banks&rsquo; margining practices, which often fall short of supervisory expectations. Regulators have emphasised the need for banks&rsquo; margin and haircut practices to better reflect exposure profiles, liquidity, wrong-way risk and concentration of client portfolios and related markets, and how that contributes to tail risk losses from counterparty default.</p>
<p>The PRA expressed concerns that banks often offered initial margin terms in some OTC derivatives markets, or haircuts in repo markets, based on commercial incentives (e.g., competitive pressure to grow business) rather than risk considerations. For example, the PRA&rsquo;s fixed income financing review<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/july/nathanael-benjamin-speech-followed-by-panel-preparing-for-liquidity-stresses#footnote-34" id="footnote-ref-34"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[33]</a></sup>&nbsp;therefore noted that governance practices should be strengthened, and that second-line risk management in banks should own the haircut setting process.</p>
<p>In non-centrally cleared derivatives markets, the PRA also reviewed<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/july/nathanael-benjamin-speech-followed-by-panel-preparing-for-liquidity-stresses#footnote-35" id="footnote-ref-35"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[34]</a></sup>&nbsp;the implementation of models used to set initial margin levels,<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/july/nathanael-benjamin-speech-followed-by-panel-preparing-for-liquidity-stresses#footnote-36" id="footnote-ref-36"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[35]</a></sup>&nbsp;of which the ISDA SIMM is a key component. The review identified governance shortcomings that could lead to systematic under-margining for certain portfolios. In response, the PRA asked banks to align margining practices to the supervisory expectations set out in UK legislation covering margin regulations in OTC markets. And as part of the wider international margin work, a set of proposals have been consulted on, which would see initial margin requirements in non-centrally cleared derivatives markets respond more quickly to stress.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/july/nathanael-benjamin-speech-followed-by-panel-preparing-for-liquidity-stresses#footnote-37" id="footnote-ref-37"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[36]</a></sup>&nbsp;This includes increasing the calibration frequency of the ISDA SIMM to ensure appropriate risk coverage, as well as predictable and efficient updates to the model. Supervisors will monitor the effectiveness of these changes in reducing margin shortfalls without introducing undue procyclicality or liquidity strains in the system. That said, firms remain responsible for the SIMMs implementation, including conducting comprehensive and frequent backtesting and addressing bilateral collateral shortfalls as appropriate.</p>
<p>In the US, the SEC&rsquo;s clearing rule &ndash; effective in 2026 &ndash; mandates central clearing for most US Treasury bond repo transactions. By requiring widespread use of central clearing, it will improve transparency and mitigate financial stability risks through centralised default management processes.</p>
<h4>Correlated and concentrated positions</h4>
<p>Concentration add-ons or adjustments to margin need to consider market-wide factors. Firms need to have controls in place to be able to identify and monitor concentrated exposures that could become illiquid in stress, including one-way or crowded strategies, and adjust ex-ante &ndash; in good times &ndash; for example, their associated margin period of risk to reflect the longer liquidation period and correlation risks.</p>
<h4>Addressing the risks from NBFI leverage and &ldquo;hidden leverage&rdquo;</h4>
<p>Ensuring bilateral margins and haircuts are appropriately set in good times to capture risks of correlated and concentrated positions, including tail risks from stressed liquidations, can constrain the build-up of excessive leverage. This, in turn, can limit or dampen sudden increases in liquidity demands during stress, which typically amplify shocks.</p>
<p>The Financial Stability Board&rsquo;s wider work currently underway on NBFI leverage, which the Bank of England actively supports, is also crucial. This work aims to enhance authorities&rsquo; ability to identify and monitor financial stability risks from NBFI leverage and build appropriate resilience where systemic impacts could arise. It touches on issues seen in past crises: excessive leverage facilitated by the presence of low margins or haircuts (LDI), large concentrations by single entities in specific markets (Archegos) and correlation between positions of various participants (commodities markets stress, and LDI). While recent international reforms since the March 2020 &ldquo;dash for cash&rdquo; have addressed some NBFI risks, such as in liquidity mismatch of money market funds,<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/july/nathanael-benjamin-speech-followed-by-panel-preparing-for-liquidity-stresses#footnote-38" id="footnote-ref-38"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[37]</a></sup>&nbsp;excessive NBFI leverage still poses financial stability risks. Especially when funding positions are concentrated in particular segments of core markets (such as government bond markets). And especially when these positions are used in common strategies across multiple NBFIs or are highly concentrated among a small number of NBFIs.</p>
<p><a id="_Hlk172120964"></a>At the same time, enhancing transparency around &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; leverage through improved disclosures by NBFIs to their counterparties and regulators can help identify concentrations and correlations in key markets, allowing risks to be addressed. The PRA&rsquo;s post-Archegos &lsquo;Dear CEO&rsquo; letter and Fixed Income Financing &lsquo;Dear CRO&rsquo; letter set expectations that the quality of counterparty disclosures should directly link through to the setting of risk appetite. The BCBS is consulting on proposals to improve banks&rsquo; counterparty risk management, including firms adjusting their risk appetite for counterparties that refuse to provide adequate risk disclosures.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/july/nathanael-benjamin-speech-followed-by-panel-preparing-for-liquidity-stresses#footnote-39" id="footnote-ref-39"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[38]</a></sup>&nbsp;The SWES that we are running is also a powerful tool to understand how transparency can affect macro-prudential risks related to margin dynamics.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>So let me sum up. Greater collateralisation has been positive for financial stability, offsetting counterparty risk, making systemic firms more resilient and supporting market activity in stress. Initial margin and haircuts can also constrain the level of leverage in the system, ensuring counterparties contribute adequate cover against their exposures, acting as the first line of defence, and not building up excessive leverage.</p>
<p>But getting margin and haircut levels and practices right is crucial for financial stability.</p>
<p>As variation and initial margins go up in stress, firms need to be prepared for the liquidity need that will arise. Enhancing market participants&rsquo; liquidity preparedness to meet their collateral requests would go a long way towards reducing procyclical behaviours in response to large margin calls and preventing the liquidity crises that have amplified past financial shocks. This requires a high degree of transparency, effective stress testing, and improvements to operational processes.</p>
<p>And initial margin in some bilateral derivatives markets and haircuts in repo markets need to be sufficiently high in normal times. Excessively high margins can unnecessarily tie up resources that could be used more productively elsewhere. But setting initial margin or haircuts too low can undermine financial stability as counterparty risk is not adequately captured, and it means they have to rise more sharply in stress. To mitigate this risk, UK CCPs are required to implement anti-procyclicality measures in their initial margin models.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/july/nathanael-benjamin-speech-followed-by-panel-preparing-for-liquidity-stresses#footnote-40" id="footnote-ref-40"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[39]</a></sup>&nbsp;Financial institutions must also continue to improve their own risk management frameworks so that they adequately consider the exposures of their clients and counterparties.</p>
<p>On the public sector side, the Bank of England is also developing a new contingent repo lending facility, enabling us to provide liquidity directly to NBFIs at times of severe liquidity stress in core UK markets, as a backstop<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/july/nathanael-benjamin-speech-followed-by-panel-preparing-for-liquidity-stresses#footnote-41" id="footnote-ref-41"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[40]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>But the steps I have mentioned today are key to ensure market participants manage and take responsibility for the risks to which they choose to expose themselves. So that the level of risk in the system is properly priced. And so that market participants play their part in ensuring exposures are adequately covered, and that they act as an effective first line of defence. And so that central banks can be the last resort, not the first resort. The international policy work currently underway is key to address these issues, and harmonised guidance and standards will also prevent risks of regulatory arbitrage or a race to the bottom.</p>
<p>Getting these things sorted is essential and will go a considerable way towards addressing some of the main current vulnerabilities in the system of market-based finance.</p>

<p>For example, one counterparty in a repo might sell a security to the other counterparty today for &pound;100 and buy it back from them in a year&rsquo;s time for &pound;102. That is like paying 2% interest on a &pound;100 loan collateralised by the securities transferred to the cash lender for the term of the agreement. If the cash lender applied a haircut of 5%, it would buy the securities &ndash; still worth &pound;100 &ndash; for &pound;95, selling them back for &pound;96.90, which is 2% more than &pound;95. Thus, an investor could buy &pound;100 of securities and immediately repo them for &pound;95 of funding, leaving only &pound;5 to be funded by its own equity. The smaller the haircut, the less own equity required.</p>

<div> Prices, Supply, Demand, Storage, Challenges
Summary:
- Volatile gas prices in Europe
- Stable pipeline and LNG supply
- Decreased gas demand
- Gas storage levels on track
- Challenges from global developments<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>Today, ACER releases its second&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsFUA4CAgQHV0wJBFYHHVYLVFQdUAlSABoHXQoFUQMEDgcJAgYdAl0AUwkGDVMdWggCBR0GXwkEGldXVQIZA1AHVQUFAQNRAVVQRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">quarterly review of key developments in European gas wholesale markets</a>&nbsp;as part of its 2024 Market Monitoring Report (MMR). The first publication was issued in&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsBUgVTB1cCAkxbUANRHVYLBQ4dUwkFVBoGUAZSAlAHUgcBBVcdAl0AUwkGDVMdWggCBR0GXwkEGldXVQIZA1AHVQUFAQNRAVVQRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">March 2024</a>.</p>
<p>This report highlights the main trends in Europe&rsquo;s gas markets in the first half of 2024 and identifies upcoming challenges for Europe arising from global developments (flows via Ukraine, global LNG markets etc.).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What gas market trends did ACER monitoring find?</span></p>
<p>The report finds volatile prices and supply changes in European gas markets in the first half of 2024:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gas prices:&nbsp;</strong>at the end of Q1, European gas wholesale prices fell to levels not seen since before the energy crisis but increased in Q2 as markets re-focused on supply risks, including a tighter global Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) market.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Price integration</strong>&nbsp;has not yet returned to pre-crisis levels, in part due to increased transportation costs. No critical network congestion in Europe&rsquo;s gas market in the first half of 2024.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pipeline and LNG supply:&nbsp;</strong>gas pipeline supply to the EU was stable. LNG remained&nbsp;key for EU supply.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gas demand fell:&nbsp;</strong>in the first half of 2024, gas-fired power generation in the EU decreased by 16% compared to the same period last year.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gas storage:</strong>&nbsp;In Q2 2024, the EU injected 41 TWh less gas into storage compared to Q2 2023. Despite the slower rate, storages are on course to reach the mandated filling level of 90% by 1 November. The storage level reached in Q2 2024 is one of the highest in the past five summers.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What challenges lie ahead?</span></p>
<ul>
<li>The transportation agreement for Russian gas through Ukraine expires by the end of 2024, and its renewal is unlikely. Landlocked Central European countries will need alternative supply routes, making cross-border trade essential for affordable gas.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Hurricane season in the Atlantic (from June to October) could affect LNG production and transportation in the Gulf of Mexico, reducing global LNG supply and tightening European gas balances.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Any delays in concluding the scheduled maintenance of Norwegian upstream gas assets in September could trigger price volatility.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If gas withdrawals significantly exceed those of the past two winters, EU buyers may need to increase their competitiveness in the LNG markets to replenish stocks in 2025, potentially impacting wholesale prices. Weather conditions will play a key role in exposing or mitigating these risks.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Several LNG production projects are nearing completion, with first cargoes expected in 2025, which could help stabilise gas prices. Significant additional LNG volumes are anticipated from 2026 onwards, as several large projects are scheduled to come online.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ACER will continue to closely monitor trends in the European gas markets that could lead to short-term volatility for European energy markets. The next update on the European gas wholesale markets will be published in October 2024.</p>

Thames Water removed from infra300 index due to regulatory uncertainty, replaced by UK Power Networks, reflecting stability and growth.<br /><br />Summary: <br />Thames Water removed from index, replaced by UK Power Networks, reflecting stability and growth, regulatory uncertainty cited for removal. <div>
<p>In a notable shift within the infrastructure investment landscape, Thames Water will be removed from the infra300&reg; market index, effective July 1, 2024. Thames Water had been included in the USD290bn index, which tracks the performance of 300 infrastructure assets in 20 countries, since its inception date 24 years ago. This decision follows the recent draft price determination and the imposition of a special administration regime on Thames Water, both of which have generated considerable uncertainty regarding the company's ability to attract equity investors to sustain its status as a viable private infrastructure investment. By June 30, 2024, the company's market capital, as reported in infraMetrics&reg;, had plummeted by 51.8% compared to the previous quarter.</p>
<p>Scientific Infra &amp; Private Assets (SIPA), which calculates and administers the infra300 index and is an ESMA-registered market benchmark for private infrastructure investments, has been closely monitoring the evolving regulatory environment affecting Thames Water. Recent developments have raised concerns about the company's ability to operate as a private infrastructure business under current and anticipated regulatory conditions. These factors have led to a comprehensive review and the subsequent removal of Thames Water from the infra300 index which is used by a range of investors representing close to USD500bn of infrastructure assets under management.</p>
<p>UK Power Networks, a renowned electricity distribution network operator, will replace Thames Water in the infra300 index. UK Power Networks has demonstrated strong operational performance, regulatory compliance, and resilience, making it a highly suitable addition to the index. This inclusion aligns with the infra300's objective of providing investors with exposure to a representative set of infrastructure assets.</p>
<p>Frederic Blanc-Brude, CEO of SIPA, commented on the change: "The infra300 index provides a measure of the financial risks taken by investors in infrastructure. The decision to remove Thames Water was not taken lightly. However, given the increasing regulatory uncertainties and challenges facing the company, the SIPA index committee wanted to ensure that the infra300 continues to represent the private infrastructure investment universe. UK Power Networks is a suitable replacement in the UK and corresponds to the same segment (IC80, Network Utilities) in the TICCS classification of infrastructure companies."</p>
<p>UK Power Networks delivers electricity across London, the South East, and the East of England. With more than GBP 2 billion in turnover, GBP 15 billion in total assets, and a profit of GBP 600 million in 2023, the company exemplifies stability and growth.</p>
<p>Replacing Thames Water with UK Power Networks will not alter the representation of the flagship infra300 Index, which is equal-weighted. On a value-weighted basis, the weight of network utilities (IC80) in the infra300 is expected to increase by approximately 2.3%. SIPA will continue to monitor the regulatory landscape and make adjustments as necessary to maintain its commitment to representing the investible universe of unlisted infrastructure companies.</p>

<div> Report, financial authorities, biodiversity loss, nature-related risks, regulatory initiatives
<br />
Financial authorities are evaluating biodiversity and nature-related risks, facing data and modeling challenges, and implementing diverse regulatory and supervisory initiatives.
<br /><br />Summary: Financial authorities are assessing nature-related financial risks, facing data and modeling challenges, and implementing diverse regulatory and supervisory initiatives. <div>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Report finds that financial authorities are at different stages of evaluating the relevance of financial risks from biodiversity loss and other nature-related risks.</strong> </li>
<li> <strong>Report notes the major data and modelling challenges faced by analytical work to connect underlying nature risks with financial exposures and to translate estimates of financial exposures into measures of financial risk.</strong> </li>
<li> <strong>Regulatory and supervisory work is at an early stage globally, with diverse approaches across jurisdictions, typically including the promotion of firm-level disclosures. A number of capacity-building initiatives are underway.</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) today published a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/07/stocktake-on-nature-related-risks-supervisory-and-regulatory-approaches-and-perspectives-on-financial-risk/">stocktake of member financial authorities&rsquo; initiatives related to the identification and assessment of nature-related financial risks</a>. The stocktake, which will be delivered to the 25-26 July meeting of G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors in Rio de Janeiro, describes not only supervisory and regulatory initiatives, but central banks&rsquo; and supervisors&rsquo; analytical work on whether and how nature degradation, including loss of biodiversity, is a financial risk.</p>
<p>The report highlights a number of observations:</p>
<p>Financial authorities are at different stages of evaluating the relevance of biodiversity loss and other nature-related risks as a financial risk, with approaches varying, in part due to differing mandates. Some authorities have already concluded there is a material financial risk, while others remain at the stage of monitoring international work on the issue. A few authorities have decided not to work on this topic, due to data gaps and the need to give sufficient priority to climate risks (where analytical thinking and data are further progressed).</p>
<p>Financial authorities which are analysing the issue categorise nature-related risks into the same two types of risks typically used in climate-related financial risk analysis: physical and transition risks. However, analytical work faces major data and modelling challenges. Authorities&rsquo; work to date indicates that financial institutions face large exposures to physical risk via their investments and financing activities, but that analytical work needs to be further developed to better translate estimates of financial exposures into measures of risk. Authorities recognise the strong connections between climate risk and nature, and that more needs to be done to develop a more holistic approach that considers interdependencies between climate- and nature-related financial risks.</p>
<p>Regulatory and supervisory work is also at an early stage globally, and approaches differ considerably across jurisdictions and institutions. That said, a number of authorities from both emerging markets and advanced economies already have regulatory and supervisory initiatives underway. The report highlights examples of approaches taken by international organisations and authorities. There is a general recognition that more expertise is needed in the supervisory community, in central banks, and in the private sector to understand and, where needed, address nature-related risks. A number of capacity building initiatives are underway from around the world.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The stocktake draws on a survey of participating FSB members and the work done by international organisations, including the conceptual framework developed by the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) and work done by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and funded by the European Union, on nature-related risks.</p>
<p>The FSB coordinates at the international level the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies and develops and promotes the implementation of effective regulatory, supervisory, and other financial sector policies in the interest of financial stability. It brings together national authorities responsible for financial stability in 24 countries and jurisdictions, international financial institutions, sector-specific international groupings of regulators and supervisors, and committees of central bank experts. The FSB also conducts outreach with approximately 70 other jurisdictions through its six Regional Consultative Groups.</p>
<p>The FSB is chaired by Klaas Knot, President of De Nederlandsche Bank. The FSB Secretariat is located in Basel, Switzerland and hosted by the Bank for International Settlements.</p>

<br />
Eurex launches futures and options on FTSE Ethereum Index, offering trusted access to Ether in regulated market, expanding crypto derivatives. 
<br /><br />Summary: 
Eurex expands crypto derivatives with FTSE Ethereum Index Futures and Options, offering trusted access to Ether in regulated market. <div>
<ul class="rte--list">
<li>Launch of futures and options on FTSE Ethereum Index in USD and EUR&nbsp;</li>
<li>Trusted access to second largest cryptocurrency Ether in a regulated market&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="detailText">
<div class="paragraph">
<div>
<p>Eurex expands its crypto derivatives portfolio with the launch of FTSE Ethereum Index Futures and Options as of 12 August 2024. Following the launch of FTSE Bitcoin Index Futures and Options in 2023, this is another major milestone in Eurex&rsquo;s ambition to offer secure access to cryptocurrencies in a regulated market environment.<br /><br />Ethereum is the second largest cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of approximately USD 400 billion. There is significant trading and hedging demand from institutional and professional customers, as reflected in record trading volumes in derivatives and other investment products.<br /><br />The new options and futures are listed in EUR and USD, with the respective FTSE Ethereum Index as the underlying. The contract size is equivalent to 10 Ether (approximately USD 35,000). Both contracts are cash settled and expire on the last Friday of the month. In addition to monthly and quarterly maturities, weekly expiring contracts for options will also be available.<br /><br />The FTSE Ethereum Index was developed by FTSE Russell together with Digital Asset Research (DAR). It captures data from vetted assets and exchanges to meet EU Benchmarks. The final settlement rate of the new Eurex contracts is determined as the volume time-weighted average of the FTSE DAR Digital Asset Price over a 15 minute period prior to the fixing time. Liquidity will be supported by orderbook and over-the-counter liquidity providers.<br /><br />Eurex had already launched futures on the FTSE Bitcoin Index in April 2023. Over 100,000 contracts, equivalent to over USD 3.5 billion notional, have been traded since the launch. Crypto product offering was expanded with options on Bitcoin Index Futures in October 2023, to allow investors to hedge their Bitcoin exposure and express a more sophisticated market view with various trading strategies (e.g., straddles, put/call spreads, etc.).<br /><br />Randolf Roth, Member of the Eurex Executive Board: &ldquo;We look forward to expanding our offering in crypto derivatives together with FTSE Russell and Digital Asset Research for our clients. As one of the world&rsquo;s leading CCPs, Eurex offers trading on a regulated exchange and is therefore the right partner to enter the crypto space for institutional clients.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /><br />Kristen Mierzwa, Head of Digital Assets at FTSE Russell, an LSEG business: &ldquo;We are delighted to support the expansions of Eurex&rsquo;s digital assets ecosystem with the offering of futures and options on the FTSE Ethereum Index. In association with the experts at Digital Asset Research we have established an industry standard for assessing underlying digital asset and exchange inclusion. We have applied this vetting methodology to offer indices reflective of the real investable market.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Calls On Firms To Improve Treatment Of Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs)</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> legislation, financial firms, PEPs, FCA, review
Summary:
The FCA has urged financial firms to treat politically exposed persons fairly, tightening PEP definitions, improving communication, and training staff.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The FCA has told financial firms &ndash; including banks, payment firms and lenders &ndash; to do more to ensure parliamentarians, senior public servants and their families are not treated unfairly. &nbsp;</p>
<p><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>Under legislation adopted by Parliament, financial firms are required to do extra checks on so-called politically exposed persons (PEPs). This follows global standards set by the international Financial Action Task Force and implemented by more than 200 jurisdictions.</p>
<p>There have been concerns about how firms in the UK are meeting these requirements and so the FCA has reviewed how firms are treating PEPs.</p>
<p>The FCA found that most firms in its review did not subject PEPs to excessive or disproportionate checks and none would deny them an account based on their status. However all firms could improve. The regulator has told firms that they should:</p>
<ul>
<li>ensure their definition of a PEP, family member or close associate is tightened to the minimum required by law and not go beyond that</li>
<li>review the status of PEPs and their associates promptly once they leave public office</li>
<li>communicate to PEPs effectively and in line with the Consumer Duty, explaining the reasons for their actions where possible</li>
<li>effectively consider the actual level of risk posed by the customer, and ensure that information requests are proportionate to those risks</li>
<li>improve the training offered to staff who deal with PEPs</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>Some firms have already started to make improvements following the change in January 2024, which made the legal starting point that UK PEPs and their associates present a lower level of risk than foreign PEPs.</p>
<p>In a small number of cases, the FCA is instigating an independent and more detailed review of firms&rsquo; practices.</p>
<p>Sarah Pritchard, the FCA&rsquo;s executive director of markets and international, commented:&nbsp;'Public service naturally comes with greater scrutiny. But it must be proportionate and shouldn&rsquo;t disadvantage people running for office or taking senior public roles, or their families. That requires a balancing act. Most firms try to get it right but there is more they can do. We&rsquo;re following up with those firms that were getting the balance wrong to ensure they make changes.</p>
<p>'We have heard directly from some parliamentarians about the problems they and their families have faced. We have been clear where we expect firms to make improvements, including in how they communicate with their customers.'</p>
<p>The FCA proposing changes to our guidance to:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>reflect the new legal starting point that UK PEPs should be treated as lower risk &nbsp;</li>
<li>make clear that non-executive board members of civil service departments should not be treated as PEPs solely for that reason</li>
<li>give greater flexibility in who can approve or sign off PEP relationships within firms</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>The guidance is open for consultation until 18 October 2024 and we welcome any further input.</p>
<p>The FCA is clear, that where improvements have been identified, firms should implement those changes now and not wait for the final updated guidance to be published.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FCA will continue to monitor how firms approach PEPs through its ongoing supervisory engagement and will act if needed.</p>
<p>If PEPs are unhappy with their experience, they can complain to the firm and then the Financial Ombudsman Service. Some firms also have dedicated points of contact for PEPs.&nbsp;</p>

<div> KYAX, ANNA, DTIF, ISO 24165 Digital Token Identifier, regulatory reporting <br />
<br />Summary: 
KYAX, ANNA, and DTIF collaborate to implement ISO standards for digital assets, revolutionizing regulatory reporting with a focus on MiCA compliance. <div>
<p><span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="http://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/http:%2F%2Fwww.kyax.com/1/01020190c4e21d34-42abd650-9fa6-48c0-8302-a3b73d2d55c3-000000/ANVpwPCGn1Rf9foHPDNKsV_Bs3o=383" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>KYAX</span></a><span>, a Digital Asset Financial Reporting tool, the Association of National Numbering Agencies (ANNA), a global member association seeking to foster standardization within the financial industry, and the Digital Token Identifier Foundation (DTIF) whose mandate is to increase transparency in the digital asset space by creating a core reference data set, are pleased to announce they have joined forces to expedite the implementation of the ISO 24165 Digital Token Identifier (DTI) and ISO 6166 International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) standards in the digital asset space.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>This collaboration marks a significant milestone in enhancing transparency and efficiency in regulatory reporting. It is particularly significant for entities falling under the purview of National Regulatory Authorities implementing the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) rules including MiCA and EMIR Refit, as well as other regimes that may be amended to support the adequate reporting of crypto-assets.</span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>The synergy between KYAX, ANNA and the DTIF is poised to revolutionize regulatory reporting practices within the digital asset space.</span></strong><span><br /></span><span><br /></span><span>By combining the golden source of unique identification of digital tokens with a leading digital asset reporting tool, regulated crypto-asset issuers and service providers will be able to stay compliant with minimal effort.</span></span></p>
<p><span>ESMA embedded DTIs as the crypto-asset identifier under MiCA reporting requirements. By integrating KYAX's AI enabled, post-trade regulatory reporting tool with the unique identifiers provided by ANNA &amp; DTIF, the integration aims to simplify the process of adhering to digital asset reporting requirements.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>By promoting the adoption of DTI and incorporating it seamlessly into KYAX's regulatory reporting tool, both entities are committed to implementing MiCA approved reporting frameworks, using DTIF standards that will enable mandatory regulatory compliance for digital asset companies.</span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Matthew de la Fuente, CEO of KYAX,</span></strong><span>&nbsp;said &rdquo;This collaboration sets a new standard for regulatory reporting excellence in the digital asset space, and we look forward to ensuring support for MiCA compliance for every party and counterparty with the click of a button&rdquo;.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Commenting on the collaboration Stephan Dreyer, Managing Director at ANNA, says&nbsp;</span></strong></span><span><span>&ldquo;Since inception, the ANNA and DTIF partnership that aligns new ISINs with DTIs has driven cross industry awareness and adoption of market standards that support market transparency, efficiency and growth. We are delighted to be working with KYAX to facilitate greater integration within the wider digital asset ecosystem&rsquo;</span><span><br /></span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Denis Dounaev, DTIF Product Owner, adds&nbsp;</span></strong></span><span>&ldquo;This integration marks a significant milestone in our mission to increase transparency and standardization within the digital asset space. By aligning our efforts with ANNA and KYAX, we are ensuring that digital assets are seamlessly integrated into mandatory reporting. This will foster greater trust and adoption among regulators and the traditional financial system&rdquo;.&nbsp;</span></p>

<title>TAIFEX Unveils Micro TAIEX Futures To Elevate Market Flexibility As Taiwan Market Hits New Highs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Taiwan Futures Exchange (TAIFEX) is set to launch Micro TAIEX Futures (TMF) on July 29,&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 11px;">2024. This strategic addition to TAIFEX&rsquo;s product lineup aims to offer traders greater flexibility and accessibility in capital management, addressing the rising index levels and evolving demands of the Taiwan market.</span></p>
<p>Since the beginning of 2023, the TAIEX Index has surged by over 9,000 points, recently surpassing the 24,000-point milestone for the first time. This impressive growth has significantly increased the contract size of Mini-TAIEX Futures (MTX), now exceeding NTD 1.2 million per contract, up from approximately NTD 270,000 when first introduced in April 2001. In response to the heightened trading thresholds associated with MTX and TAIEX Futures (TX), the introduction of TMF offers a more accessible and versatile trading instrument.&nbsp;</p>
<p>TMF features a multiplier of NTD 10 per index point, resulting in a contract size of NTD 240,000 at an index level of 24,000 points. This new contract size is one-fifth that of MTX and one-twentieth that of TX, providing investors with a highly adaptable and precise trading tool. The reduced contract size facilitates finer position adjustments and more efficient execution of hedging or trading strategies, allowing investors to respond swiftly to market changes and enabling better capital allocation across a broader spectrum of assets.</p>
<p>Complementing the existing TX and MTX, TMF seamlessly integrates into TAIFEX&rsquo;s current portfolios. Traders can also exploit arbitrage opportunities between these contracts or with other products such as the Mini Electronics Sector Futures (ZEF), Taiwan Semiconductor 30 Futures (SOF), and single stock futures on TSMC, MediaTek and Hon Hai Precision.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The launch of TMF marks another significant milestone for TAIFEX, underscoring its commitment to continually introducing new products that enhance trading flexibility and diversification, expand market participation, and meet the evolving needs of investors.

Funding support of up to 30% will be provided to enable experimentation and development of quantum technology-related pilots that explore the use of Post-quantum Cryptography (PQC)&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2024/mas-commits-up-to-s$100-million-to-support-quantum-and-artificial-intelligence-capabilities#2">[2]</a></span>&nbsp;and Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2024/mas-commits-up-to-s$100-million-to-support-quantum-and-artificial-intelligence-capabilities#3">[3]</a></span>&nbsp;to safeguard firms&rsquo; critical data.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>4<span> </span>MAS will also work with Institutes of Higher Learning and the Institute of Banking and Finance on talent development initiatives to support the development of quantum capabilities in the financial services sector.<br /><br />5<span> </span>More details on the FSTI 3.0 Quantum track can be found&nbsp;<a class="mas-link" href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/schemes-and-initiatives/fsti-quantum-track"><span class="mas-link__text">here</span></a>.<br /><br /><span>Strengthening the adoption of AI in the financial industry</span><br /><br />6<span> </span>While financial institutions have been progressively adopting AI, recent technological advancements have made such tools more widely accessible and increased the pace of adoption. With the advent of Generative AI, financial institutions have embarked on initiatives to map the technology&rsquo;s opportunities and risks, and have begun piloting it across a range of use cases. Nevertheless, the level of AI-readiness and adoption varies across financial institutions in Singapore.&nbsp;<br /><br />7<span> </span>MAS will therefore enhance the existing AI and data grant scheme under FSTI 3.0. This will:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Bolster financial institutions' development and deployment of AI technologies in Singapore</span>&nbsp;&ndash; Singapore has the potential to become a centre of excellence for anchoring AI capabilities, such as in the development of applications, as well as testing and deployment of AI solutions for the financial sector. MAS will support financial institutions in establishing AI innovation centres in Singapore for a range of functions including: AI model building and training, deployment of AI models for high-impact use cases, governance and risk management, as well as testing and monitoring.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span>Develop AI platforms to address industry wide use cases</span>&nbsp;&ndash; There are strong prospects for the financial industry to apply AI to solve industry-wide problems beyond what each financial institution can do individually. This involves the development of frameworks and platforms for policies and protocols that enable secure and privacy-protected data exchange where financial institutions can collaborate on industry-wide use cases. For example, MAS has identified scam and fraud detection as a use case for the first pilot project, and will work with banks, technology solution providers and public agencies on this. The funding will support projects that accelerate the development of industry-wide AI solutions and high-impact use cases.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>8<span> </span>More details on the enhanced support for AI will be announced in the coming months.</p>

<div> Consumer survey, fairness, financial services, research, FMA<br />
Summary: Majority of New Zealanders agree on fairness in financial services, based on FMA-commissioned survey with 33 scenarios, informing industry and stakeholders.<br /> <div>
<p>The majority of New Zealanders generally agree on what constitutes fairness in financial services, research commissioned by the Financial Markets Authority (FMA) &ndash; Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko &ndash; has found.</p>
<p>The research centres on a consumer survey of approximately 3000 New Zealanders who answered a range of questions about fairness. Respondents were invited to assess 33 hypothetical scenarios that New Zealanders could have experienced with financial providers. Respondents evaluated how fair each scenario was on a scale. Of the 33 scenarios, 29 were written that described people experiencing potentially unfair treatment by a financial service provider. These were called &lsquo;unfair risk scenarios&rsquo;. Four more scenarios without an unfair risk were included, called &lsquo;neutral scenarios&rsquo;, to provide a comparison.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of the unfair risk scenarios, 26 of the 29 were more likely to be seen as unfair by New Zealanders, whereas the four neutral scenarios were likely to be evaluated as fair. While results were not absolute, these two key findings suggest there is a consistent understanding of what is fair or unfair in financial services.</p>
<p>In one scenario, 86% of respondents believed it was unfair that a bank took over a year to repay a client who had been overcharged fees. At the other end of the scale, 63% believed it was fair that one client&rsquo;s investment fund had lower fees than his mother&rsquo;s because his fund manager spent less time researching markets and making changes to his investment. The findings are helpful in distinguishing between a consumer outcome with financial services that may be disappointing, but is not necessarily unfair.</p>
<p>The research was designed to offer a methodology to test whether there is a consistent view of how people qualify fairness. The FMA&rsquo;s purpose is built on promoting fair, efficient, and transparent financial markets. Further, from March 2025, financial institutions (including banks, insurers, and non-bank deposit takers) will be required to ensure they treat consumers fairly under the Financial Markets (Conduct of Institutions) Amendment Act 2022 (CoFI). The research is intended to support evidence-based conversations with industry and stakeholders on what fair treatment means. The research is not guidance for financial service providers.</p>
<h3>Key findings</h3>
<ul>
<li>81% of respondents believe it&rsquo;s important everyone has the same opportunities in life</li>
<li>72% expect fair treatment from their financial service provider</li>
<li>69% believe they receive fair treatment from their KiwiSaver provider</li>
<li>63% believe they receive fair treatment from their bank</li>
<li>57% believe they receive fair treatment from their insurance provider.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FMA Chief Economist, Stuart Johnson, said: &ldquo;With fairness in financial services at the heart of our purpose and mandate, we wanted to test the hypothesis on whether there is a reasonable consensus on what constitutes fairness in practice. Fairness generally, is a broad concept which some perceive as too personal&nbsp;to apply to everyday financial activities. This research has shown that when presented with specific customer focused scenarios, people have a remarkably consistent understanding of what constitutes fairness in financial services.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Markets need to be fair for providers, investors and consumers alike. Licensed firms may find the research helpful in thinking about treating customers and investors fairly. For institutions covered by CoFI, this should be useful while considering the development of their fair conduct programmes. We hope this research is a helpful conversation starter and we encourage providers to read the findings and provide us with feedback.&rdquo;</p>

<div> Resilient, Monetary policy, Economy, Financial services, Technology
Summary:<br /><br />Key points: Resilient global growth, moderating inflation, tight monetary policy; Singapore GDP growth, inflation control; Financial sector developments; Enhancing digital financial services, fair dealing, sustainability, AI, quantum technology; MAS financial results. <div>
<p>1.&nbsp;<span> </span>Good morning and thank you for joining us today for the release of the MAS Annual Report for Financial Year 2023/24.<br /><br />2.&nbsp;<span> </span>I will be touching on key areas across central banking, developmental and regulatory.</p>
<p><span>Economic Developments and Monetary Policy</span></p>
<p>3.&nbsp;<span> </span>Let me begin with some remarks about recent economic developments and monetary policy.&nbsp;<span>Global growth has been resilient over the past year in the face of multi-decade high interest rates, and is expected to remain broadly steady over the rest of the year.</span></p>
<p>a. The US economy is expected to turn in fairly robust growth, even as employment and wage growth soften.</p>
<p>b. In China, we expect growth to reach around the 5% target with some policy support.</p>
<p>c. Meanwhile, the external-oriented economies in emerging Asia will continue to benefit from the cyclical recovery in the global tech and trade cycles.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;<span> </span><span>Global inflation has declined significantly from its peak, but the last leg of disinflation towards target will be slower.</span></p>
<p>a. In the advanced economies, price pressures are now largely coming from services, where demand is strong and labour markets still tight.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;<span> </span><span>Beyond this year, we remain vigilant to the risks to the global growth outlook.</span></p>
<p>a. For instance, high interest rates for longer could cause increasing strains on private sector spending, while uncertainties over the ongoing Middle East conflict and the risk of rising global protectionist policies could negatively impact confidence and investment and push up production costs.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;<span> </span><span>Against a backdrop of relatively supportive global growth and disinflation, Singapore&rsquo;s growth momentum should strengthen this year.</span></p>
<p>a. Growth across the major sectors of the economy is expected to gradually return to pre-pandemic norms. For the full year, GDP growth will come in closer to its potential rate of 2 to 3%.</p>
<p>b. The output gap is expected to close by the end of the year.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;<span> </span><span>We have made considerable progress in the fight against inflation. Inflation has come down quite some way from the peak of 5.4% in Q1 of 2023.</span></p>
<p>a. MAS Core Inflation averaged 3.1% year-on-year over April-May, down from 3.3% year-on-year in Q1 2024.</p>
<p>b. Over the past year, price increases have moderated across a range of goods and services, including food, retail goods and discretionary services, such as restaurant meals.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;<span> </span><span>Let&rsquo;s take a look back at how we got to this point.</span></p>
<p>a. MAS began withdrawing policy accommodation in October 2021, well before most other central banks, as the economy recovered and inflation was picking up while supply chains had not fully recovered from COVID-related disruptions.</p>
<p>b. In early 2022, the Russia-Ukraine war compounded inflationary pressures, as supply-side shocks to global energy and food commodity markets interacted with resilient global demand.</p>
<p>c. Over 2022, MAS tightened monetary policy four times, which included making an unprecedented sequence of three upward re-centrings of the S$NEER policy band.</p>
<p>i. The S$NEER appreciated by close to 7% over 2022, helping to lean against surging imported inflation.</p>
<p>ii. Core inflation peaked at 5.4% in Q1 2023, and headline inflation at 7.3% in Q3 2022. If MAS had not tightened monetary policy, core inflation would have reached 7% and headline 8%.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp;<span> </span><span>MAS kept monetary policy on a restrictive stance over 2023 to secure the disinflation path, in the face of underlying price pressures in the domestic economy.</span></p>
<p>a. In 2023, even as global inflation declined as supply-side bottlenecks receded and demand moderated, domestic cost pressures were still elevated amid a tight labour market, strong wage growth and continued passing through of previous step-up in costs by businesses to consumers.</p>
<p>b. The continued appreciation of the S$NEER restrained aggregate demand in the Singapore economy and dampened domestic price pressures.</p>
<p>c. Core inflation is expected to stay on its disinflation path and will ease more significantly in Q4 this year. It is forecast to reach around 2% in 2025, barring further shocks.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp;<span> </span><span>MAS will convey our assessment of the near-term outlook for growth and inflation in the July Monetary Policy Statement.</span></p>
<p>a. From January this year, MAS shifted to a quarterly schedule for issuing monetary policy statements. This enables MAS to provide its assessment of the economic outlook in a timelier fashion.</p>
<p>b. I would like to stress that MAS continues to maintain a medium-term orientation to its policy formulation.</p>
<p>c. The July MPS will be issued by the end of this month. MAS will provide our latest assessment of the evolution of growth, inflation, and how these map to the appropriate monetary policy stance.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp;<span> </span><span>Over the medium term, we are alert to risks to global inflation.</span></p>
<p>a. Structural shifts impacting supply chains, such as geopolitical tensions and rising protectionism, lower labour force growth, as well as climate change and the worldwide transition to net zero emissions, are likely to result in a more supply-constrained global economy.</p>
<p>b. These shifts and supply rigidities could impart upside pressure on inflation compared to norms in the decade before COVID.</p>
<p>c. Artificial Intelligence (AI) could potentially be disinflationary if it relieves supply constraints and increases productivity, but its impact is still uncertain at this point.</p>
<p>d. If the structural shifts to supply prevail, global monetary policy is unlikely to go back to the highly accommodative stance pre-COVID.</p>
<p>e. MAS will continue to closely study these global developments, and their implications for Singapore&rsquo;s inflation and economic growth, with monetary policy responding accordingly to ensure medium-term price stability.</p>
<p><span>Developments in Singapore&rsquo;s Financial Sector</span></p>
<p><span>Financial Services growth outlook</span></p>
<p>12.&nbsp;<span> </span>I now turn to the developments in Singapore&rsquo;s Financial Services sector.<br /><br />13.&nbsp;<span> </span>The sector remained resilient in 2023 and has made good progress across the board:</p>
<p>a. Asset management and funds</p>
<p>i. The Singapore asset management industry has continued to grow in breadth and depth over the years. Assets under management (AUM) reached S$5.41 trillion as at 31 Dec 2023, a 10% growth from the previous year, in line with the 10% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) over the past 5 years.</p>
<p>ii. In particular,&nbsp;<span>private markets have grown significantly</span>. From 2018 to 2023, Singapore&rsquo;s PE and VC AUM grew at a CAGR of 24.6% to more than S$650 billion. Over half of these assets were directed towards supporting the growth of businesses in the APAC region.</p>
<p>iii. We expect private credit to continue to grow, with large global private credit managers expanding their Asia teams in Singapore, and new private credit managers establishing a presence here to tap investment opportunities in the region.</p>
<p>b. Debt market</p>
<p>i.&nbsp;<span>Despite interest rates peaking at multi-decade highs, Singapore&rsquo;s corporate debt market has rebounded strongly</span>, driven by increased financing needs from corporates to fund business expansion. The outstanding size of the market registered a 10.5% increase to S$566 billion, with new issuance growing 21% in 2023 to S$230 billion.</p>
<p>ii.&nbsp;<span>Singapore is also ASEAN's largest sustainable debt market.</span>&nbsp;Sustainable debt issuances grew year-on-year by 7% in 2023, to about S$38 billion. Over S$130 billion of sustainable bonds and loans were issued between 2018 to 2023.</p>
<p>c. Wealth management</p>
<p>i. The wealth management industry has also grown in line with the asset management industry. Singapore is a trusted wealth management centre with high standards of regulation and continues to be attractive to global wealth.&nbsp;<span>High standards of regulation have and will continue to be key to the success of the wealth management sector.</span></p>
<p>ii.&nbsp;<span>The money laundering case of the past year has not changed our growth trajectory, nor our position on regulatory standards.</span></p>
<p>iii. The case underscores the need for continued vigilance by banks and other intermediaries because Singapore, as an international financial centre, is an attractive location to both legitimate wealth and money launderers.</p>
<p>iv. The vigilance of financial institutions here led to Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs) being filed appropriately, and these STRs enabled law enforcement agencies to uncover the web of connections in the money laundering case.</p>
<p>v. Clearly too,&nbsp;<span>there were financial institutions with material nexus to this case.</span>&nbsp;Our supervisory engagements with these financial institutions are mostly completed. We are currently reviewing our findings, to determine the appropriate supervisory actions.</p>
<p>vi. What we have observed broadly is that while we have a high standard of AML/CFT requirements, implementation and practices of individual financial institutions vary. Hence, what is needed is to set a clearer waterline of practices across the industry, rather than a tightening of standards and requirements. We plan to engage industry to clarify our supervisory expectations and help industry implement our AML requirements more evenly across the sector. We also support and welcome ongoing work by industry to develop best practices.</p>
<p>vii. Singapore continues to welcome legitimate wealth and will ensure that our processes and regime are supportive, whilst upholding high regulatory standards. In this regard, we are actively working to reduce the wait time for our tax incentive schemes. We have also introduced schemes to support the further development of Singapore&rsquo;s wealth management sector. For example, the Philanthropy Tax Incentive Scheme for family offices which opened for applications this year, to encourage and channel wealth to philanthropy, social impact and sustainability causes.</p>
<p>d. Insurance</p>
<p>i. Moving on to the insurance sector, our insurance sector continued to grow in 2023 with net premiums and total assets for the overall insurance sector increasing by 6.4% and 6.8% respectively.</p>
<p>ii.&nbsp;<span>Strong life, health and wealth protection demand in Singapore and the region continue to drive robust growth in the local insurance sector. We expect this growth to continue</span>, with leading insurers, reinsurers and brokers deepening their underwriting and advisory capabilities through investments in data analytics, technology and specialist talent in traditional lines, and expanding their product range in specialist areas such as cyber and climate insurance, and in insurance linked securities.</p>
<p>e. Banking</p>
<p>i.&nbsp;<span>Lastly, the banking sector growth has remained robust and resilient. Total assets grew at a 5.5% CAGR over 2018-2023.</span>&nbsp;In the past few years, we saw major banks expand regional capabilities and resources in key areas, including capital markets, wealth management, sustainability, as well as technology and innovation. This has created good jobs and provided upskilling opportunities.</p>
<p>14.&nbsp;<span> </span>Looking ahead, we want to continue to build new capabilities in our financial sector, and improve outcomes for consumers. I will elaborate on 3 priorities:</p>
<p>a. First, safe and resilient digital financial services.</p>
<p>b. Second, fair dealing in financial services.</p>
<p>c. Third, building new capabilities in sustainability, AI and quantum technology.</p>
<p><span>Safe and Resilient Digital Financial Services</span></p>
<p>15.&nbsp;<span> </span>Financial services have achieved a high level of digitalisation in recent years.</p>
<p>a. This transformation has brought about greater convenience to customers.</p>
<p>b. It is now possible to leave home with little or no cash, and there is no need to wait in line at a bank branch for many banking services.</p>
<p>i. The vast majority of us now transact on mobile apps or internet banking.</p>
<p>ii. Almost all Singaporean adults have registered for PayNow - which saw total transaction value rise to S$94 billion in 2023;</p>
<p>iii. On the business front, almost all merchants have registered for SGQR payment, and there are over 300,000 SGQR payments acceptance points for consumers to make payments.</p>
<p>16.&nbsp;<span> </span>The ubiquity of digital financial services means that the information technology systems powering these services are getting more complex and interconnected at a time when the need for resilience is even more critical. Frequent and prolonged disruptions not only cause inconvenience to the public &ndash; they can over time erode trust in digital financial services, or in financial institutions that deliver these services. We must work to avoid this.</p>
<p>17.&nbsp;<span> </span>The standard that MAS has set for the banks is that disruptions to their critical systems should not exceed 4 hours within any 12-month period. We recognise that no IT system is infallible, and disruptions can occur for a variety of reasons. Nonetheless,&nbsp;<span>banks must be able to minimize these system disruptions, and when they occur, recover quickly.</span></p>
<p>18.&nbsp;<span> </span>Banks must now put their focus beyond individual systems, and consider the resilience of its delivery of financial services. A financial institution may rely on multiple IT systems to deliver a payment service. Having a good understanding of how its IT systems interact to deliver a service would thus strengthen a financial institution&rsquo;s ability to recover from service disruptions. Implementing alternate or backup solutions will similarly facilitate continuity in the provision of essential financial services. These expectations have been articulated in our Guidelines on Business Continuity Management.</p>
<p>19.&nbsp;<span> </span>MAS will be taking two key steps to further sharpen FIs&rsquo; focus on resilience of service delivery.<br /><br />20.&nbsp;<span> </span>First, we will consult on enhancing the requirements set out in&nbsp;<span>MAS&rsquo; Notice on Technology Risk Management. In particular, we intend for FIs to</span>&nbsp;-</p>
<p>a. Take a service-centric recovery time objective and not just a system-centric recovery time objective;</p>
<p>b. Identify and address single points of failure in critical business services; and</p>
<p>c. Fully test their recovery plans through an annual exercise to ensure that they are able to operate from their Disaster Recovery (DR) site for a prescribed minimum time period .</p>
<p>21.&nbsp;<span> </span><span>Second, we will consult on instituting a technology assurance program for FIs that are core to our financial system.</span>&nbsp;Earlier this year in March, we have required the Board of Directors of these key FIs to provide MAS a written attestation on the adequacy of their IT Disaster Recovery plan and the effectiveness of the IT Disaster Recovery testing performed in the last 12 months for all their critical systems. We intend to further build out the program to cover technology risk areas beyond disaster recovery to include other areas in the MAS technology and cyber risk management notices and guidelines.<br /><br />22.&nbsp;<span> </span>Let me now touch on scams.<br /><br />23.&nbsp;<span> </span>MAS has been working closely with the financial industry, the Police, and other government agencies in the fight against scams. Over the past few years, the banks have implemented a suite of measures to make it much harder for scammers to succeed. Recent moves include -</p>
<p>a. Banks progressively removing the use of One-Time Passwords for bank account login for digital token users. Instead, they will use the digital tokens, which are more secure.</p>
<p>b. Banks&rsquo; mobile apps now have malware screening capability and will not launch if they detect malware on the phone.</p>
<p>c. Money Lock features were introduced that allow customers to set aside funds that cannot be digitally accessed. As at 30 June, more than 107,000 Money Lock accounts have been set up, with close to S$8.9 billion of savings set aside.</p>
<p>d. Public awareness and education campaigns on scams were also conducted by the Association of Banks in Singapore, individual banks and MAS, to complement national campaigns.</p>
<p>e. Major retail banks are participating and co-located in the Anti Scam Centre to assist the Police with quick tracing and freezing of scam proceeds.</p>
<p>24.&nbsp;<span> </span>After the implementation of anti-malware measures on banking apps, the incidence of scams involving remote takeover by malware was brought down sharply. Phishing scam cases and amount lost were both lower in 2023 than in 2022, and the median amount lost was below S$1000.<br /><br />25.&nbsp;<span> </span><span>Nonetheless, continued vigilance is needed.</span>&nbsp;New scam typologies can and will emerge and phishing cases can go up again. Scams involving authorised transactions have also been particularly difficult to fight, as the victim who has been deceived by the scammer has authorised the payment. These scams account for the majority of cases and losses. Public education and timely sharing of scam alerts will help. MAS and banks will add more frictions and checks to payments, but these may not be effective if scam victims still decide to authorise the payment.<br /><br />26.&nbsp;<span> </span><span>As we consider further measures for banks to implement, this does involve bank customers collectively giving up some convenience for more security.</span>&nbsp;Scam transactions affect under 1% of retail accounts in 2023. All bank customers will face more checks and steps, and need to adjust to changes, if we are to tighten banking measures further. Additional friction may not be welcomed by all. Let me give 2 examples.</p>
<p>a. If we are to minimize reliance on phishable passwords that can be stolen or given away by the victim, then we have to stop using SMS one-time passwords in conjunction with other phishable passwords for authentication, and rely more on banking mobile app digital tokens. We know some bank customers have not fully embraced the use of digital tokens, which are more secure, and continue to use SMS OTPs. In time to come, we may have to consider solutions more secure than digital tokens.<br /><br />b. Banks are also enhancing their account surveillance capabilities to detect suspicious transfers that may be connected to a scam. These are based on rules and machine learning algorithms. They will not be precise and will generate many leads (or false positives) that are not actually scams. So for each actual scam, many more customers who are not being scammed may receive notifications and checks.</p>
<p>27.&nbsp;<span> </span><span>As the banks introduce new measures and frictions, they will give advance notice to customers. They would have done these after close consultations with MAS and the Police.</span>&nbsp;We will emphasise adequate communication by the banks to seek the understanding of bank customers that these are done with their safety and security in mind.<br /><br />28.&nbsp;<span> </span>We will continue to work on measures to help strengthen the resilience of, and consumer&rsquo;s confidence in, digital payment and banking services.<br /><br /><span>Fair Dealing in Financial Services</span><br /><br />29.&nbsp;<span> </span>In May, MAS issued an updated set of Fair Dealing Guidelines that was expanded to scope in all financial institutions and cover all their products and services. With the updated Guidelines, customers can expect &ndash;</p>
<p>a. Products suited to the needs of the target customer segment;</p>
<p>b. Advice with suitable product recommendation, accurate representation of information and extra consideration for those who are more vulnerable;</p>
<p>c. Clear explanations of a product and its terms and conditions; and</p>
<p>d. Independent responsive handling of complaints and feedback.</p>
<p>30.&nbsp;<span> </span><span>Our objective is to raise standards of fair dealing across the industry and improve the experience of customers dealing with FIs so that trust is maintained in the sector.</span>&nbsp;MAS places clear responsibility on the Board and Senior Management of FIs to implement strategies in their organisations for achieving these outcomes and monitor the results. MAS will review FIs&rsquo; progress during our supervisory engagements.<br /><br /><span>Building new capabilities in Sustainability, AI and Quantum technology</span><br /><br /><em>Sustainability</em></p>
<p>31.&nbsp;<span> </span>New capabilities are needed to position our financial sector for the opportunities ahead. A key area is in sustainable finance. We expect sustainability to present new opportunities and transform jobs in the years ahead.</p>
<p>a. Singapore&rsquo;s financial sector has an important role to play to support and accelerate our region&rsquo;s transition to net zero.<br /><br />b. The recently launched Sustainable Finance Jobs Transformation Map study found that many finance professionals will need to understand new sustainability-related regulations and standards, and perform sustainability-related data gathering and analysis work to better take on new sustainable finance-related businesses. MAS and the Institute of Banking and Finance (IBF) will continue to roll out programmes to support professionals in the finance sector to upskill to take on these new sustainable finance opportunities.</p>
<p><em>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</em></p>
<p>32.&nbsp;<span> </span>Let me now turn to how we intend to harness fast developing technologies in AI and Quantum computing.<br /><br />33.&nbsp;<span> </span>Financial institutions are no strangers to AI and have deployed machine learning for many years. With GenAI, FIs globally have started piloting the technology across a range of use cases, albeit cautiously in middle office or backend functions. In Singapore, we observe a wide spectrum of FIs with varying degrees of AI readiness and in different stages of AI adoption. The pace of adoption is expected to pick up with better understanding of its opportunities and risks.<br /><br />34.&nbsp;<span> </span>We see the potential for Singapore to anchor key capabilities to develop and deploy AI solutions in financial services.&nbsp;<span>To achieve this, MAS aims to focus on three key areas &ndash; Talent; Trust; and Technology Centres of Excellence.</span><br /><br /><em><span>Talent</span></em><br /><br />35.&nbsp;<span> </span>First, we need to build a financial sector talent pool with strong AI competencies.<br /><br />36.&nbsp;<span> </span><span>The roles and activities undertaken by many finance professionals will change with the adoption of GenAI</span>, enabling them to spend less time on collecting and processing information, and instead take on higher value work such as analysing insights from AI generated outputs.&nbsp;<span>New job roles will also be created, for example, in &ndash; data management, prompt engineering and AI governance &ndash; as FIs scale up their adoption of GenAI.</span><br /><br />37.&nbsp;<span> </span>MAS and IBF have commissioned a detailed study of how GenAI will change jobs in the sector, and identify the new skillsets needed to perform these changing or new job roles. This enables us to take active steps to equip the financial sector workforce with the right skillsets to capture the opportunities the GenAI brings.<br /><br />38.&nbsp;<span> </span>We expect to publish the findings and recommendations early next year.<br /><br /><span><em>Trust</em></span><br /><br />39.&nbsp;<span> </span>Second, there must be trust and confidence in financial services powered by AI.&nbsp;<span>A strong foundation of governance is essential so that AI is used responsibly and meets high standards.</span><br /><br />40.&nbsp;<span> </span>In 2018, MAS released the FEAT (fairness, ethics, accountability, transparency) principles, which were co-created with the financial industry. The Veritas industry consortium, led by MAS, subsequently developed an assessment methodology and toolkit to help FIs assess whether their use of AI solutions is aligned with the FEAT principles.<br /><br />41.&nbsp;<span> </span>Building on these foundations, MAS worked with an industry consortium through Project Mindforge to identify the risks and opportunities of GenAI, and published a white paper in May. MAS is also putting together a set of good practices for addressing AI model, technology and cyber risks, and considering supervisory guidance next year. An industry-led AI Governance Handbook to aid the development of good AI governance practices is also targeted to be finalised then.</p>
<p><span><em>Technology Centres of Excellence</em></span><br /><br />42.&nbsp;<span> </span>Third, we will anchor the AI centres of excellence of financial institutions in Singapore. There are more than 40 FinTech innovation labs of FIs and technology firms in Singapore. We will build on our experience in anchoring innovation centres here, and support FIs in building AI centres of excellence here as well. The activities could include AI model building and training, deployment of AI models to use cases, and governance, risk management, testing and monitoring. We will make available funding support for these activities and capabilities to be built in Singapore.<br /><br />43.&nbsp;<span> </span>We believe there are strong prospects for the financial industry to work together to apply AI to solve problems beyond what each FI can do individually.&nbsp;<span>We have initiated a new programme called &ldquo;AI Collider&rdquo; to bring the industry together to experiment on and scale industry-wide AI solutions.</span>&nbsp;This involves the development of policies and protocols and a platform for secure and privacy-protecting data exchange where FIs can contribute their respective data and AI models. Industry-wide use cases can be built, trained and deployed on this platform. In the first pilot project, we have identified scam and fraud detection as a use case. By pooling data across banks, suspicious movement of money across bank accounts of multiple banks can be detected, and prompt action taken to investigate and stop these scams. We will share more details in due course.<br /><br /><span><em>Quantum technology</em></span></p>
<p>44.&nbsp;<span> </span>Quantum computing is another transformative technology. According to McKinsey, quantum computing use cases in financial services could create over US$600 billion in value by 2035.<br /><br />45.&nbsp;<span> </span>There are potential use cases in areas like risk management, trading, portfolio optimisation, and cybersecurity. We have engaged financial institutions and received early expressions of interest to work with Singapore.<br /><br />46.&nbsp;<span> </span><span>MAS has been collaborating with the National Quantum Office following the announcement of the National Quantum Strategy</span>&nbsp;by Deputy Prime Minister and MAS Board member Mr Heng Swee Keat in May. MAS will support financial institutions to build capabilities in quantum computing and security in Singapore. This will contribute to the development, testing and deployment of quantum algorithms to industry use cases, and quantum resilient cybersecurity solutions.<br /><br />47.&nbsp;<span> </span><span>We are prepared to provide up to S$100 million in funding support from the Financial Sector Technology and Innovation Scheme (FSTI 3.0) to financial institutions for both AI and Quantum projects and capabilities.</span><br /><br />48.&nbsp;<span> </span>Quantum computing also has profound implications for cybersecurity as it could eventually render current encryption techniques vulnerable to attack. We have to start building capabilities in the financial industry to be quantum resilient. In February this year, MAS published an advisory to all FIs on addressing the cyber risks associated with Quantum computing. The advisory highlights the measures that FIs should consider as part of their quantum transition efforts.<br /><br />49.&nbsp;<span> </span><span>MAS is now working with the industry on a proof-of-concept sandbox on quantum key distribution (QKD)</span>&nbsp;to enable secure and quantum-safe communication between MAS and participating FIs. The sandbox is expected to be implemented by the end of this year, and will help build QKD capabilities for broader application in the industry to strengthen quantum resilience.<br /><br /><span>MAS Financial Results for FY2023/24</span></p>
<p>50.&nbsp;<span> </span>I now turn to MAS&rsquo; financial results.<br /><br />51.&nbsp;<span> </span><span>For FY2023/24, MAS recorded a net profit of S$3.8 billion.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>This comprises:</p>
<p>a. investment gains of S$12.7 billion, mainly from interest income, dividends and realised capital gains, and</p>
<p>b. a small positive currency translation effect of S$1.7 billion,</p>
<p>c. partially offset by S$10.6 billion in net cost from MAS&rsquo; money market operations to manage banking system liquidity, and other expenses.</p>
<p>52.&nbsp;<span> </span>The small positive currency translation effect of S$1.7 billion arose as the Euro, Pound Sterling and US Dollar strengthened against the Singapore Dollar, when we report MAS&rsquo; Official Foreign Reserves, held in foreign currencies, in Singapore Dollars.<br /><br /><span>Conclusion</span></p>
<p>53.&nbsp;<span> </span>With that, I conclude my remarks.</p>

<title>SEC Awards More Than $37 Million To A Whistleblower</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-awards-more-than-37-million-to-a-whistleblower/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> whistleblower program, SEC, award, enforcement action, investor protection fund <br />
Summary:<br />SEC awards $37 million to whistleblower for providing valuable information leading to successful enforcement action, protecting confidentiality and providing monetary rewards from investor protection fund. <div>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced an award of more than $37 million to a whistleblower who provided information not previously known to the SEC and which significantly contributed to a successful enforcement action. The whistleblower also met with Enforcement staff and identified potential witnesses and documents, which conserved staff time and resources.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s award illustrates the importance of the SEC&rsquo;s whistleblower program, as the whistleblower&rsquo;s information helped the agency return millions of dollars to harmed investors,&rdquo; said Creola Kelly, Chief of the SEC&rsquo;s Office of the Whistleblower.</p>
<p>Payments to whistleblowers are made out of an investor protection fund, established by Congress, which is financed entirely through monetary sanctions paid to the SEC by securities law violators. Whistleblowers may be eligible for an award when they voluntarily provide the SEC with original, timely, and credible information that leads to a successful enforcement action. Whistleblower awards can range from 10 to 30 percent of the money collected when the monetary sanctions exceed $1 million.</p>
<p>As set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC protects the confidentiality of whistleblowers and does not disclose any information that could reveal a whistleblower&rsquo;s identity.</p>

<title>US Federal Agencies Issue Final Rule To Help Ensure Credibility And Integrity Of Automated Valuation Models</title>

<div> final rule, Dodd-Frank Act, automated valuation models, quality control standards, mortgage originators

Summary:
- Final rule implements Dodd-Frank Act
- Quality control standards for AVMs
- Protects against data manipulation
- Requires random sample testing
- Compliance with nondiscrimination laws

Summary:<br /><br />The final rule implements quality control standards for automated valuation models (AVMs) used by mortgage originators to ensure credibility, integrity, and compliance with nondiscrimination laws. <div>
<p>Six federal regulatory agencies today issued a final rule, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, designed to help ensure the credibility and integrity of models used in valuations for certain mortgages secured by a consumer's principal dwelling. In particular, the rule will implement quality control standards for automated valuation models (AVMs) used by mortgage originators and secondary market issuers in valuing those homes. The final rule is substantially similar to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/06/21/2023-12187/quality-control-standards-for-automated-valuation-models">proposal</a>&nbsp;issued in June 2023.</p>
<p>Under the final rule, the agencies will require institutions that engage in certain transactions secured by a consumer's principal dwelling to adopt policies, practices, procedures, and control systems designed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>ensure a high level of confidence in estimates;</li>
<li>protect against data manipulation;</li>
<li>seek to avoid conflicts of interest;</li>
<li>require random sample testing and reviews; and</li>
<li>comply with nondiscrimination laws.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Driven in part by advances in database and modeling technology and the availability of larger property datasets, AVMs are being used with increasing frequency as part of the real estate valuation process. While advances in AVM technology and data availability have the potential to reduce costs and turnaround times of the property valuation process, it is important that institutions using AVMs take appropriate steps to ensure the credibility and integrity of the valuations produced. It is also important that the AVMs institutions use adhere to quality control standards designed to comply with applicable nondiscrimination laws.</p>
<p>The final rule will become effective on the first day of the calendar quarter following 12 months after publication in the&nbsp;<em>Federal Register</em>.</p>

<title>ISDA derivatiViews: Seeking Future Leaders To Explore Collateral And Liquidity</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-derivativiews-seeking-future-leaders-to-explore-collateral-and-liquidity/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-derivativiews-seeking-future-leaders-to-explore-collateral-and-liquidity/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> opportunity, collateral management, derivatives, risk, industry<br />
Summary:<br />
The article discusses the ISDA Future Leaders Program and its focus on collateral management in derivatives, looking for fresh ideas to address industry challenges. <div>
<p>The transition to central clearing and margining for non-cleared derivatives has gone a long way to mitigating counterparty credit risk, by requiring&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/04/16/isda-margin-survey-year-end-2023/">a huge volume of collateral to be exchanged between parties</a>. But managing the timely and efficient flow of this collateral through the system on a daily basis is an ongoing challenge.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2023/02/20/automation-and-data-standards-in-collateral/">As recent stress events have shown</a>, delays and inefficiencies in sourcing and posting collateral can quickly lead to an escalation of liquidity risk. ISDA has been working hard to standardize data and bring greater automation to collateral management, and we&rsquo;re now looking to the industry&rsquo;s rising stars to contribute fresh ideas to address this challenge.</p>
<p>Now entering its fourth year, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/isda-future-leaders-in-derivatives/">ISDA Future Leaders in Derivatives (IFLD)</a>&nbsp;program is an exceptional opportunity for derivatives market professionals to engage with peers and stakeholders on an important industry issue and contribute their own perspectives on the way forward. Our most recent cohort published a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/04/17/genai-in-the-derivatives-market-a-future-perspective/">terrific paper on generative artificial intelligence</a>&nbsp;earlier this year, setting out a series of possible use cases in the derivatives market and addressing regulatory issues and other challenges.</p>
<p>We recently&nbsp;<a href="https://assets.isda.org/media/7df8d47a/43e4e764-pdf/">called for nominations</a>&nbsp;for our next group of future leaders, who will join the program later this year. They will get straight to work exploring the policy and operational aspects of collateral management, and what market participants and infrastructure providers need to do to make sure collateral gets to where it needs to be, when it needs to be there. This topic calls for a wide range of perspectives and professional expertise, spanning operations, risk management, technology, policy and legal, so we&rsquo;ll be looking to convene a group that can bring that diversity of thought. Participants will be supported by ISDA&rsquo;s staff and given access to subject matter experts, but the whitepaper will be their own work &ndash; an opportunity to make a unique contribution to a critical industry issue.</p>
<p>The IFLD paper will complement&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/a/NAlgE/CDM-for-Collateral-Initiatives-factsheet-2024.pdf">ISDA&rsquo;s own collateral initiatives</a>, which have been gathering momentum this year. Leveraging our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/collateral-management-sop/">suggested operational practices</a>&nbsp;for collateral management and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finos.org/common-domain-model">Common Domain Model (CDM)</a>, a free-to-use data standard for financial products, trades and lifecycle events, we&rsquo;ve developed resources that support automated workflows and data standardization to reduce operational, liquidity and counterparty risks. We recently announced that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/06/10/vermeg-integrates-common-domain-model-into-colline-collateral-management-system/">VERMEG, a technology provider for the banking and insurance sector, has integrated the CDM into its COLLINE collateral management system</a>&nbsp;to support the consumption of digitized regulatory initial margin credit support annexes. Several other firms are testing the application of the CDM to collateral representation, margin and settlement processes, margin call issuance and response messages, and cash collateral interest processing.</p>
<p>As ISDA continues to work with market participants to realize the benefits of our collateral initiatives, it&rsquo;s a great time for the IFLD to take stock of what has been achieved and the challenges ahead, helping us to map out the future. If this sounds like an opportunity for you or one of your colleagues, please do consider applying. I&rsquo;m looking forward to meeting our next group of future leaders when they get started later this year.</p>
<p><span>The deadline for applications for the IFLD is July 26 and the program will begin on October 9. For more information about the application process, download the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://assets.isda.org/media/7df8d47a/43e4e764-pdf/"><span>call for nominations</span></a><span>&nbsp;or contact&nbsp;</span><a href="mailto:IFLD@isda.org"><span>IFLD@isda.org</span></a><span>.</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li>Basel Committee has published its final disclosure framework for banks' cryptoasset exposures.</li>
<li>The Committee has also published targeted amendments to its cryptoasset standard to tighten the criteria for certain stablecoins to receive a preferential regulatory treatment.</li>
<li>Both standards are to be implemented by 1 January 2026.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision today published its final&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d580.htm"><span class="firstword">disclosure</span>&nbsp;framework</a>&nbsp;for banks' cryptoasset exposures and targeted amendments to its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d579.htm"><span class="firstword">cryptoasset</span>&nbsp;standard</a>&nbsp;published in December 2022. Both standards have an implementation date of 1 January 2026.</p>
<p>The final disclosure framework includes a set of standardised tables and templates covering banks' cryptoasset exposures. These require banks to disclose qualitative information on their cryptoasset-related activities and quantitative information on the capital and liquidity requirements for their cryptoasset exposures. The use of common disclosure requirements aims to enhance information availability and support market discipline.</p>
<p>The targeted amendments to the cryptoasset prudential standard aim to further promote a consistent understanding of the standard, particularly regarding the criteria for stablecoins to receive a preferential "Group 1b" regulatory treatment. Various other technical amendments clarify other aspects of the standard.</p>
<p>The Committee will continue to monitor developments in cryptoasset markets and the need to mitigate new risks</p>

<title>US Treasury And The Financial Services Sector Coordinating Council Publish New Resources On Effective Practices For Secure Cloud Adoption</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/us-treasury-and-the-financial-services-sector-coordinating-council-publish-new-r/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/us-treasury-and-the-financial-services-sector-coordinating-council-publish-new-r/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Financial Services Sector Coordinating Council (FSSCC) published a suite of resources to share with financial services institutions on effective practices for their secure cloud adoption journey. These deliverables are the result of a year-long public-private partnership of the Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee (FBIIC) and the FSSCC.</p>
<p>To provide leadership support for this joint effort the U.S. Department of the Treasury established the&nbsp;<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1503">Cloud Executive Steering Group</a>&nbsp;(CESG) in May 2023 at the direction of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), to help close the gaps identified in Treasury's landmark report on the&nbsp;<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Treasury-Cloud-Report.pdf">Financial Services Sector&rsquo;s Adoption of Cloud Services</a>. The documents published today are intended to arm financial institutions of all sizes with effective practices for secure cloud adoption and operations, and to establish a continuing effort and partnership to begin to address the gaps identified in Treasury&rsquo;s report, which include:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Establishing a common lexicon that may be used by financial institutions and regulators in discussions regarding cloud.</li>
<li>Enhancing information sharing and coordination for examination of cloud service providers.</li>
<li>Assessing existing authorities for cloud service provider (CSP) oversight.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Establishing best practices for third-party risk associated with cloud service providers, outsourcing, and due diligence processes to increase transparency.</li>
<li>Providing a roadmap for institutions considering comprehensive or hybrid cloud adoption strategies including an update to the Financial Sector&rsquo;s Cloud Profile.</li>
<li>Improving transparency and monitoring of cloud services for better &ldquo;security by design.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The completion of these two efforts is the culmination of nearly two years of collaboration to further protect our financial system,&rdquo; said Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, Wally Adeyemo. &ldquo;The CESG is now a proven model and a new way for the financial services sector to effectively address our most significant cybersecurity challenges.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our financial system is essential infrastructure for the entire economy, and it is deeply reliant on a handful of powerful Big Tech cloud service providers,&rdquo; said Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Rohit Chopra. &ldquo;Our work will help protect the financial industry from outages and disruption by leveling the playing field between financial firms of all sizes and big cloud service providers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Banks and other financial services firms know they must adapt to new technologies, but many have been uncertain as to how to do so safely and soundly,&rdquo; said Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael J. Hsu.&nbsp;&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s publications mark a significant step forward by providing a roadmap and helpful resources for banks of all sizes. These documents also clarify cloud service providers&rsquo; responsibilities for ensuring a secure and resilient financial system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These documents are an important step forward in the CESG's effort to make the cloud safer and more resilient within and beyond the financial services industry,&rdquo; said Bill Demchak, Chairman and CEO, PNC Financial Services Group. &ldquo;The strong partnership between public- and private-sector leaders allows us to take a more holistic, collaborative approach to defending against evolving threats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The CESG model represents an unprecedented level of public-private partnership between Treasury, FBIIC, FSSCC, and cloud service providers (CSPs). Clear explanations for the&nbsp;<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/about/offices/domestic-finance/financial-institutions/cloud-executive-steering-group">utility and application of the documents can be found here</a>, on the U.S. Treasury website.&nbsp; The website also includes links to the FSSCC-led outputs so that financial institutions can consult them at any part of their cloud services adoption journey and risk management process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FSSCC led the following workstreams:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The&nbsp;<span>Cloud Profile 2.0,&nbsp;</span>authored collectively by the FSSCC Cloud Profile Workstream and the Cyber Risk Institute (CRI), is intended to serve as a cloud security implementation plan for financial institutions of all sizes and functions.&nbsp; The Cloud Profile 2.0 is an extension of the Cybersecurity Profile created by CRI, which is a tool based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework.&nbsp; It provides a framework for both financial institutions and CSPs and will serve as a common tool developed to assist financial institutions in ensuring secure cloud implementation, while allowing the document to evolve as standards change over time.</li>
<li>The&nbsp;<span>Financial Sector Cloud Outsourcing Issues and Considerations&nbsp;</span>document seeks to address challenges raised in the Treasury Cloud Report related to transparency, resource gaps, exposure to operational incidents originating at CSPs, and contract negotiation dynamics.&nbsp; The document, authored collectively by the FSSCC Cloud Outsourcing Issues and Considerations Workstream and the American Bankers Association (ABA) with support from the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA), identifies a non-exhaustive list of key considerations for developing contractual provisions between financial institutions and CSPs to address risks, regulatory and supervisory compliance expectations when using cloud services. These key considerations should be used as a voluntary reference tool by financial institutions during the contract negotiation phase of onboarding a CSP to appropriately address cybersecurity, resilience, and third party-due diligence expectations, and to enable compliance with growing financial services regulatory requirements and supervisory expectations.</li>
<li>The&nbsp;<span>Transparency and Monitoring for Better &ldquo;Secure-by-Design&rdquo;&nbsp;</span>document, authored collectively by the FSSCC Transparency and Monitoring Secure-by-Design Workstream and the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center (FS-ISAC), is comprised of two outputs for financial institutions with workloads running in CSP environments. The first is a service inter-dependency and resilience model that is a combination of service transparency, architecture best practices, and more detailed information about how a CSP manages the resiliency of its own services.&nbsp; The second proposes packaged cloud configurations that provide baseline security outcomes expected in financial services infrastructure and simplifies financial institutions&rsquo; deployment of CSP workloads ("security by default/design" and "one-click" security) that make is easy for financial institutions to quickly turn on secure infrastructure with minimal engineering.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FBIIC led the following workstreams:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The&nbsp;<span>Cloud Lexicon</span>&nbsp;is a foundational document that captures the most prominent terms used by cloud service providers and financial services sector consumers for a single repository and refence points.&nbsp; The development of the Cloud Lexicon was led by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and will enable CSPs and financial services sector institutions of all sizes to speak in standardized terms when negotiating contract terms, establishing security schema, and adhering to regulatory standards.&nbsp; The document is based on a review of publications from several standard setting bodies and industry associations, and included interviews and feedback from financial institutions, regulators, and CSPs.</li>
<li>The&nbsp;<span>Coordinated Information Sharing and Examinations Initiative</span>, led by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), is a collaborative effort that addresses coordination of examinations and information sharing related to CSPs, under the respective agency&rsquo;s legal authorities. The documented process will support enhanced coordination between agencies to monitor and address risks to both the financial sector and consumers that can arise from financial institutions&rsquo; engagement with CSPs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This collective set of deliverables is intended to highlight opportunities to leverage CESG deliverables into the broader regulatory, oversight, and examination schema, and strengthen the shared responsibility model for cloud services provision in the financial services sector.</p>
<p>Under joint FBIIC and FSSCC leadership, the U.S. Treasury and FSSCC plan to publish additional items related to cloud cyber incident response coordination and cloud concentration risk as they are completed throughout the year.</p>

<p>*The Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee, or FBIIC, is a committee consisting of 18 member organizations from across the regulatory community at both the federal and state level. The Department of the Treasury&rsquo;s Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions chairs the committee. [&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fbiic.gov/">https://www.fbiic.gov/</a>&nbsp;]</p>
<p>**The Financial Services Sector Coordinating Council, or FSSCC, is an industry-led, non-profit organization that coordinates critical infrastructure and homeland security activities within the financial services industry.

<title>IMF Deputy Managing Director Antoinette Sayeh To Retire From The Fund</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/imf-deputy-managing-director-antoinette-sayeh-to-retire-from-the-fund/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/imf-deputy-managing-director-antoinette-sayeh-to-retire-from-the-fund/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Kristalina Georgieva, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), announced today that Deputy Managing Director Antoinette Sayeh intends to conclude her service on September 12, 2024.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Antoinette has been a pillar of the Fund&rsquo;s leadership team for many years. Her incredible experience, deep integrity, and wise judgment have been invaluable to us, and her unwavering commitment to our institution has been truly exemplary,&rdquo; Ms. Georgieva said. &ldquo;Antoinette represents the best of a life devoted to public service: genuine care for the well-being of the people we serve and her ability to place them front and center of our work. This care and concern also extended to the staff of the Fund, for whom she has been a mentor, advisor, and coach to many,&rdquo; Ms. Georgieva added.</p>
<p>Ms. Sayeh, a Liberian national, has been a critical member of the IMF&rsquo;s senior management team since March 2020. During her tenure, she oversaw vital areas of the IMF&rsquo;s operations, policies, and corporate priorities, drawing on her deep knowledge of the institution. She is most known for her tireless advocacy for low-income and fragile and conflict-affected members of the IMF.</p>
<p>Ms. Sayeh also served as Director of the African Department from 2008 to 2016, becoming the first woman to lead an IMF regional department. In that role, she brought a deep understanding of the challenges facing the region and led a major transformation of the institution&rsquo;s relationship with its member countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Notably, she contributed to key reforms of IMF policies on concessional financing, debt, and capacity development. She was a strong advocate for changes that enabled the IMF to provide emergency financing and debt relief to the three African countries hit by the Ebola crisis in 2014.</p>
<p>Before taking up the post of IMF Deputy Managing Director, Ms. Sayeh was a Distinguished Visiting Fellow at the Center for Global Development from 2016 to 2020 and served as the external Co-Chair for the 19th Replenishment of the World Bank Group&rsquo;s International Development Association. As Minister of Finance in post-conflict Liberia from January 2006 through June 2008, Ms.&nbsp;Sayeh led the country through the clearance of its long-standing multilateral debt arrears and the HIPC Decision Point. Before joining Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf&rsquo;s Cabinet, she worked for the World Bank Group for 17 years, holding various senior positions. Prior to that, she worked in Liberia&rsquo;s Ministries of Finance and Planning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Antoinette demonstrates that rare combination of institutional leadership, deep analytical capacity, unparalleled ethical standards, and sound judgment,&rdquo; Ms. Georgieva said. &ldquo;She will be greatly missed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The process is underway to identify a candidate to succeed Ms. Sayeh as IMF Deputy Managing Director, and further announcements will follow in due course.</p>

<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) welcomes the entry into force of the new European Banking Package, which implements the final Basel III framework into EU regulation. To ensure a smooth operational implementation of the Banking Package, the EBA encourages institutions and competent authorities to engage in an active dialogue.</span></p>
<p>In particular, institutions should:</p>
<ul>
<li>communicate to their competent authorities the targeted model landscape, in particular following the migration of exposures to the foundation approach (F-IRB) and standard approach. A key aspect is to ensure that rating systems perform adequately on their scope of application;</li>
<li>assess and categorise changes coming from the implementation of the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR3) that impact the performance of a rating system according to the EU Commission&rsquo;s Delegated Regulation on materiality of changes to the IRB approach. On the other hand, changes coming from the implementation of CRR3 that do not impact the performance of a rating system should not be considered under the scope of the Commission&rsquo;s Delegated Regulation on model change to the IRB approach;</li>
<li>share with their competent authority an implementation plan on the foreseen modelling updates that are linked to future EBA supervisory products. In this context, modelling updates in relation to credit conversion factor (CCF) parameters (e.g. 12 months fixed horizon reference date) may not need to be prioritised until the date of application of the&nbsp;EBA Guidelines on IRB-CCF.</li>

<div> arrest warrants, LIA, Ali Mahmoud Hassan, Interpol, investigation
Summary:<br />The investigating magistrate in Brussels has lifted the arrest warrants against LIA CEO Ali Mahmoud Hassan, stating they were politically motivated. Interpol also lifted the Red Notice. The warrants were related to a debt claim by GSDT against the Libyan State, which the LIA denies. The LIA maintains the warrants were politically motivated and is pleased with the legal ruling.<br /> <div>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The&nbsp;<a class="companylink" title="Libyan Investment Authority">Libyan Investment Authority</a>&nbsp;("LIA") confirms that an investigating magistrate in Brussels recently decided to lift the national, European and international arrest warrants issued on 21 December 2021 against Mr Ali Mahmoud Hassan, C.E.O. of the LIA, stating that they had become "pointless" insofar as the latter had been heard in December 2022.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, in an unprecedented decision, the Red Notice linked to the international warrant was lifted by the Commission of Control of Files (CCF) of Interpol in 2023 as the warrant seemed "politically motivated".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These decisions relate to the investigation opened on 10 September 2015 as a result of the civil party complaint lodged by Global Sustainable Development Trust ("GSDT"), which is trying to obtain payment for a debt it claims against the Libyan State and to which the LIA is unrelated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The LIA has maintained throughout that the arrest warrants were politically motivated and is pleased that justice has now been served with this latest legal ruling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The LIA and its C.E.O. are represented by Mr Kalilou Fadiga (Harding's Mitchell Sollicitors), Mr Christophe Marchand and Mr St&eacute;phane Jans (JusCogens law firm) and Mr Anthony Rizzo (Akalex).</p>

<div> Regulatory technology, Kaizen, introduces AI-powered voice transcription for surveillance. Safe, secure adoption of AI technology, offering choice of voice transcription models for clients.<br /><br />Summary: Kaizen introduces AI voice transcription for surveillance, ensuring safe adoption and offering choice of models for clients. <div>
<p><span>Leading regulatory technology firm, Kaizen, is&nbsp;</span><span>introducing a new artificial intelligence (AI) powered voice transcription functionality on its&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="http://tracking.kaizenreporting.com/tracking/click?d=i32_hvdxlIxeWU1sGlf6oBQiOflQS6OdxUj9nYauojKRIuc2MKehbZHrvHyWhXSMEB60t62IKhN9WXl_6V8Je3HT8uS15x_R1SVO8VrSYrdmmi_-TUhPJq-bBM_eyrKBoXQ1yNiZTX0NH0yKixPPLtpQO0Q7Xkyf-3mDwfGycuE11xgFJtTx5Y_y7Zcp_KtloBvAgKtirvOL9IuFqCQFTw41" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>communications surveillance platform</span></a><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>By using the latest technology Kaizen can bring the same fast search and flexible rule-based monitoring that clients already experience on email and chat messages, to audio communications.</span></p>
<p><span>Kaizen&rsquo;s Chief Product Officer Rory McLaren, said, &ldquo;Anecdotal evidence suggests that the type of behaviour organisations need to monitor takes place on the phone more than in written communications where people are more aware they're being monitored. This new functionality makes it easier for firms to be confident they're monitoring all forms of communication.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Adopting AI in a safe and secure way</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Kaizen has been researching and analysing recent developments in and different models of AI to understand how this technology can revolutionise surveillance and compliance workflows.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Rory adds, &ldquo;We will only use AI where it can add value in a high quality, reliable, cost-effective, safe and secure way. Recent advances in voice transcription have improved the technology dramatically to the point that it is now a viable and valuable addition to surveillance workflows.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Choice of voice transcription models&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Kaizen expects technology in this area to continue to improve, but in such a fast-moving space it is difficult to predict which approaches will be winners in future. Kaizen&rsquo;s approach is therefore to offer its clients a choice of voice transcription models to use at any given time.</span></p>

Summary: 
Vincent van Kervel and Bart Zhou Yueshen win the De la Vega Prize 2024 for their paper on anticompetitive price referencing in off-exchange trading, impacting market liquidity. <br /><br /> <div>
<p><span><span>FESE is proud to announce the &ldquo;De la Vega Prize 2024&rdquo; winners, Vincent van Kervel&nbsp;and&nbsp;Bart Zhou Yueshen,&nbsp;for their relevant paper,&nbsp;</span></span><strong><span><span><span>&ldquo;Anticompetitive Price Referencing&rdquo;.</span></span></span></strong><span><span><br /><br /></span></span><strong><span><span><span>Van Kervel and Zhou Yueshen&rsquo;s&nbsp;</span></span></span></strong><span><span>research explores how price referencing can unintentionally promote anticompetitive behaviour in financial markets, shedding light on an area of critical importance for market participants and regulators.<br /><br />The paper explores how off-exchange trades executed by referencing on-exchange prices can soften competition among market makers on exchanges and make liquidity more expensive for investors. Price referencing equalises on- and off-exchange prices, ensuring best execution but making investors indifferent to the trading venue. Consequently, market makers obtain a license to fragment orders off exchange, raising their profits while exacerbating market-wide illiquidity.<br /><br />Their findings on the negative consequences of price referencing apply to various forms of off-exchange trading: wholesalers&rsquo; in-house execution of retail orders (from payment for order flow arrangements), broker-dealer internalisation, single-dealer platforms, etc. The policy analysis suggests that competition in off-exchange liquidity supply possibly alleviates such negative consequences.</span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span>▶&nbsp;</span></span><span>About Josseph De la Vega</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Josseph De la Vega was born around 1650 into a family of Sephardi Jews. After several dramatic works and novels, in 1688 De la Vega published&nbsp;</span></span><em><span><span>Confusi&oacute;n de Confusiones,</span></span></em><span><span>&nbsp;a book of dialogues concerned with the operations of the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. De la Vega gives three motives for writing the dialogues: simple pleasure; to increase understanding among those who were not in the financial business of what he regarded as &ldquo;the most honest and most useful [business] of all that existed at the time&rdquo;; and, on the other hand, to caution about the &ldquo;tricks&rdquo; engaged in by contemporary financial businesspeople.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>FESE&nbsp;</span></span></span></strong><span><span>believes there still to be much value and relevance today in many of De la Vega's observations about the behaviour of investors in markets. This is why&nbsp;</span></span><strong><span><span><span>since 2000, FESE has chosen to award an eponymous Prize to young scholars delivering outstanding research in the same field.</span></span></span></strong><span><span>&nbsp;The winners from previous editions can be found&nbsp;</span></span><a href="https://www.fese.eu/app/uploads/2024/07/FESE-De-la-Vega-Prize-Winning-Papers.pdf" target="_blank"><span><span>here</span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span></p>

<div> Training, Spain, Latin America, collaboration, agreement
Summary:
- Instituto BME collaborates with Bolivian Catholic University “San Pablo”
- International Week for students in Madrid
- Joint research and tutoring activities
- Possible master's degree collaboration
- BME's commitment to quality education and training
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<ul>
<li><span>Agreement reinforces BME's commitment to quality training in Spain and Latin America</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instituto BME, BME's training centre, has signed a collaboration agreement with the Catholic Bolivian University &ldquo;San Pablo&rdquo; to strengthen the collaboration between the two institutions. The agreement will enable various initiatives to be carried out for students and professionals from both institutions.</p>
<p>One of the highlights of the agreement is the International Week, which will take place in the second half of 2024. Students from the Bolivian Catholic University will travel to Madrid for five days, where they will receive training at the BME Institute, visit market members and business schools.</p>
<p>In addition, both institutions are planning joint research activities such as, for example, the tutoring of Bolivian Catholic University students' research work by Instituto BME professionals. The possibility of creating postgraduate programmes, such as a master's degree, with the collaboration of professors from both educational centres will also be explored with a view to launching it in 2025.</p>
<p>"This agreement is a sign of BME's commitment to quality education and training, not only in Spain but also beyond our borders. We are sure that this alliance with the Catholic Bolivian University &ldquo;San Pablo&rdquo; will bring great benefits and opportunities, and we look forward to working together," explains Enrique Castellanos, Director of the BME Institute.</p>

<div> upgrade, expand, clearing services, foreign currency, international standards
Summary:<br />TASE is upgrading and expanding foreign currency clearing services, allowing transactions in foreign currencies and aligning with international standards. It benefits stakeholders. <div>
<p>TASE Upgrades and Expands Foreign Currency Clearing Services, Aligning the Israeli Capital Market with International Standards. Access to Clearing Services in a Variety of Leading Currencies will Enable Local and International Investors to Settle Transactions in Foreign Currencies alongside the Local Currency and Allow Companies to Raise Capital settled in Foreign Currency as Well.</p>
<p>TASE plans to upgrade and expand clearing services in foreign currency as part of its strategy of evolving the capital market in alignment with international standards.</p>
<p>Expanding clearing services and adding settlement foreign currencies, such as US Dollar and Euro, will allow the public companies to raise money from the public in foreign currency, enable the TASE members to settle OTC transactions in foreign currency, and give Israeli and international investors access to a wide range of corporate actions (e.g. redemption and interest and payment for tender offers) in foreign currency.</p>
<p>These changes will benefit all stakeholders in the local capital market: mutual fund managers will be able to issue mutual funds, including money market funds, that are denominated in foreign currency as a way of offering the public exposure to a variety of additional investment vehicles. International investors will be able to buy shares and bonds via OTC transactions directly in their own local currency, without the conversion need to shekels. The Government and the public companies that conducts their main business in foreign currency will be able to issue shares and bonds and settle the issuance consideration directly in foreign currency. Furthermore, investors will be able to receive bond's interest and redemption payments directly in foreign currency, eliminating substantial conversion costs for both the investors and the public companies.</p>
<p>Expanding clearing infrastructure to support settlement in additional foreign currencies is another step forward in the implementation of TASE&rsquo;s strategy to evolve the Israeli capital market. This will align it with international standards and opening up the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange to global markets and international investors. The aim is to offer the general public, public companies and investors a broader and more diverse range of activities on the Israeli capital market.</p>

<p>Dr Tom James, CEO and CIO of TradeFlow said: "Going LIVE represents a pivotal step from theory to reality. TradeFlow is proud to pioneer the tokenisation of our commodities-backed Funds to open up a new source of liquidity, allowing us to support more trade growth for the SMEs around the world we work with. Digitalisation is at the core of Tradeflow's success as a specialist fund manager over the past 8 years in international trade asset finance, and so it was only natural to embrace the digital asset tokenisation technology and be able to offer investors even more ways to access our TradeFlow Funds and this asset class."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tobias Wohlfarth, Head of Origination at Obligate, commented: "We are pleased to support TradeFlow with the introduction of their first tracker certificate to efficiently tokenize their funds. This strengthens our partnership, boosting liquidity and offering investors new opportunities for accessing TradeFlow's funds. We look forward to continuing our collaboration and exploring further ways to provide versatile and innovative investment solutions."</p>
<p>Further expansion of the collaboration with TradeFlow and Obligate is in the works, with the potential launch of ESG-themed products linked to TradeFlow's new Critical Minerals fund.</p>

<div> Enforcement Report, investor protection, market integrity, harmonized Sanction Guidelines, centralized intake process
Summary:
- CIRO's Enforcement Report highlights commitment to investor protection and market integrity
- Continued integration and evolution through harmonized guidelines and centralized intake process
- Selected case highlights demonstrate commitment to protecting investors and promoting market integrity
- Collaboration with stakeholders and authorities to close gaps in the system
- Merger of IIROC and MFDA to form CIRO results in unified Enforcement teams
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>The Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) released its 2023-2024 Enforcement Report. The report underscores CIRO&rsquo;s continued commitment to investor protection, improving industry standards, and strengthening market integrity through fair, timely and effective enforcement actions.</p>
<p><strong>In 2023-2024, the Enforcement team continued integration and evolution by:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Adopting harmonized Sanction Guidelines and Enforcement Staff Policy Statements, effective February 1, 2024, promoting the fairness and transparency of the enforcement process.</li>
<li>Establishing a new centralized intake process for all public complaints and inquiries, simplifying access for investors.</li>
<li>Unifying decision-making across investment dealer and mutual fund rule cases to ensure consistency throughout the enforcement process.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are also commencing work on harmonizing key enforcement systems and technologies of the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) and the Mutual Fund Dealers Association of Canada (MFDA).</p>
<p>&ldquo;This year&rsquo;s report reflects our unwavering commitment to protecting investors and enhancing market integrity amidst the challenges of regulatory evolution,&rdquo; said Elsa Renzella, Senior Vice-President, Enforcement and Registration. &ldquo;We have made substantial progress in streamlining and modernizing regulatory systems, unifying enforcement decision-making, and improving industry standards. This ensures we focus our finite resources on cases that have the greatest deterrent impact and the strongest regulatory message.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Selected Case Highlights:</h2>
<p>The cases highlighted in this year&rsquo;s report represent CIRO&rsquo;s commitment to protecting investors from unfair, improper, or fraudulent practices by Dealer Members, to foster fair and efficient capital markets, and to promote market integrity, ultimately working to enhance public confidence in Canada&rsquo;s capital markets.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fortrade Canada</strong>&nbsp;was fined $2 million CAD for making prohibited recommendations for contracts for difference to unsophisticated retail clients. As an order execution-only dealer, Fortrade violated regulations by providing recommendations. The firm also failed to maintain a proper supervisory system and retain necessary records. In November 2022, Fortrade agreed to settle the proposed proceeding, agreeing to pay $703,479 USD to clients who complained and establishing a $6 million USD fund for clients with net losses. Fortrade has implemented remedial measures to prevent future issues. The hearing panel highlighted the importance that returning funds to affected clients played in the decision to accept the settlement.</li>
<li><strong>BMO Nesbitt Burns</strong>&nbsp;was fined $1.5 million and ordered to disgorge $146,876 for failing to implement a proper supervisory system regarding the high-risk trading strategy of its registered representative, Yujie Liu. Liu's strategy involved clients investing and borrowing to invest in preferred shares by short selling Government of Canada bonds. BMO failed to detect suitability issues in a timely manner and ensure Liu and supervisors adhered to policies regarding client account suitability. The hearing panel emphasized that the significant fine serves as a strong deterrent to BMO, Liu, and the industry. BMO has since implemented measures to prevent future failures.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our commitment to fair, effective, and timely enforcement has deepened, fostering greater trust in investment dealers and the industry across Canada,&rdquo; said Renzella. &ldquo;We thank our valued stakeholders, including industry and investor organizations, the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA), and their provincial and territorial governments, as well as other regulatory authorities with whom we collaborate to close gaps in the system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 2023, the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) and the Mutual Fund Dealers Association of Canada (MFDA) merged to form the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO), resulting in the unification of their dedicated Enforcement teams.</p>

<title>ISDA: Hedge Accounting Under US GAAP</title>

<div> Accounting Standards Codification 815, hedge accounting, risk management tools, financial reporting, ASC 815 limitations<br />
Summary:<br />Companies struggle with ASC 815 limitations on hedge accounting for risk management, proposing expansion and revision of hedge eligibility criteria. <div>
<p>Under US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, companies across all sectors rely on the hedge accounting principles enshrined in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 815 to manage risk. However, they are often limited to using risk management tools outside of hedge accounting, due to certain prohibitions and technical complexities.</p>
<p>This whitepaper explores the issues faced by financial and non-financial institutions in applying hedge accounting for interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and other risks. It highlights both the prescriptive nature of ASC 815 and the inconsistent interpretations among auditors, which together create operational burdens and can limit hedging strategies. The paper proposes potential solutions to these challenges, including the expansion of hedge eligibility and the revision of hedge accounting criteria, to allow better use of existing risk management tools.</p>
<p>All companies must navigate complex risks including interest rate changes, currency fluctuations and market volatility. If companies cannot apply hedge accounting to mitigate risk, this may result in financial reporting and earnings volatility that users of financial statements cannot easily discern. Effective risk management is crucial for financial stability, but existing guidance in ASC 815 prohibits the application of hedge accounting to certain hedging strategies.</p>
<p>The paper advocates for a holistic review of the hedge accounting framework to address these limitations, improve alignment with risk management activities and enhance the usefulness of financial statements.</p>

<title>The Challenges Facing Economic Measurement And Creative Solutions, Federal Reserve Governor Adriana D. Kugler, At The 21st Annual Economic Measurement Seminar, National Association For Business Economics Foundation, Washington, D.C.</title>

<div> Keywords: NABE, Economic Measurement, Data Dependence, Federal Open Market Committee, Private-sector Data

Summary: Economic measurement and data dependence are vital for policymakers, and the use of private-sector data complements official statistics, allowing for a more comprehensive view of the economy.<br /><br />Summary: Private-sector data, such as job vacancies and housing market statistics, offer timeliness, frequency, and granularity, complementing official statistics.<br /><br />Summary: Statistical agencies are innovating to address measurement challenges, using private-sector data and creating special accounts to track evolving economic developments.<br /><br />Summary: Declining response rates in official surveys are still a challenge, but the integration of private-sector and official data can help address this issue.<br /><br />Summary: The author's data-dependent approach informs monetary policy decisions based on a wide range of indicators, and an outlook for favorable economic trends suggests the possibility of easing monetary policy. <div>
<p>Thank you for your generous introduction, Ellen. I am delighted to be here with the National Association for Business Economics (NABE), and, in particular, I am pleased to be speaking at a conference covering an issue that is close to my heart and on which I have spent many years working: economic measurement.</p>
<p>When Federal Reserve officials tell audiences that their judgments are data dependent, some skeptics perhaps presume that monetary policy is already on a path set in stone. But most in this room likely know what I mean when I talk about data dependence. I am a member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which, of course, pursues a dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240716a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;When I say I am data dependent, that means I am considering the totality of the data&mdash;the full range of economic indicators that provide a sense of where the labor market, economic activity, financial conditions, and inflation have been and where they might be going. Policymakers must have high-quality and accurate data to understand the economy and set the correct policy.</p>
<p>The truth is that it is not just the Fed that needs data. Consumers, businesses, investors, and others have access to more information than ever before when making decisions. It is incumbent on economists, private- and public-sector data collectors, and others to ensure that available data are carefully collected, accurately measured, and clearly presented, and that data collection and measurement efforts are further enhanced and continue to improve.</p>
<p>To be sure, data collection and economic measurement can be challenging, and different types of data face pros and cons, which is why I take an expansive approach to using data, as I will explain a bit later. But I will begin by highlighting a few challenges to economic measurement. I will then provide some examples of how those challenges might be addressed. I will also provide examples of how nontraditional data generated by the private sector can help provide additional angles from which to view aspects of the economy that may not be clear in data produced by government statistical agencies. Finally, I will offer some examples of how, in recent years, our statistical agencies have adapted and innovated, sometimes by incorporating private-sector data to address specific measurement challenges I have in mind. To be clear, my interest in nontraditional data is not a critique of the statistical agencies. To the contrary, official data are critically important to policymakers, researchers, and the public. Rather, I view public and private data as being complementary and helping to provide a more complete picture of the economy.</p>
<p><strong>Importance of Data</strong><br />Economic measurement, the task some of you contribute to every day, is at the core of real-time policy analysis and forecasting. We at the Board of Governors rely on a broad array of data produced by both government and the private sector. And we carefully scrutinize every important economic release and are very familiar with the methodological details of those reports. Suffice it to say, we care a lot about economic measurement at the Fed.</p>
<p>And the Fed itself produces many important data series, including two principal federal economic indicators: the Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization report and the Consumer Credit statistical releases.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240716a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;In addition, our website features numerous other data products that look at bank assets, liabilities, and structure; monetary aggregates; international finance; business finance; and household finance&mdash;including data on the level, share, and composition of wealth for households at different points in the wealth and income distribution, as well as for different demographic groups.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240716a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;The Board also conducts separate surveys of consumers and household economic decision making and surveys of loan officers and credit officers, well known as the SLOOS and the SCOOS. Beyond the Federal Reserve Board, each of the Federal Reserve Banks engages in measurement and data production of various kinds, including closely watched surveys of firms and households. For example, the New York Fed conducts a survey of consumer expectations, which was just released last week, the Atlanta Fed tracks wage data, the Richmond Fed surveys firms on price-setting behavior, among other things, and several Reserve Banks publish alternative measures of inflation and reports on factory and business activity in their regions.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges with Measurement</strong><br />Of course, as one reviews various sources of data, one can see that there are some common measurement challenges. I will mention a few. These are not new, nor is my list exhaustive. My intent here is to focus on challenges that highlight the tradeoffs in using public and private data and to show how these sources of data complement each other.</p>
<p>The first challenge I will identify is that traditional measurement approaches sometimes struggle to track rapidly changing economic developments. This was the case early in the pandemic and is often true at turning points in the business cycle. Of course, it is at those very moments when policymakers, and the public, are most critically interested in how the economy is faring. The reasons for this lag are well known. Statistical agencies can only survey households and businesses every so often, and it takes time to compile and publish high-quality statistics. However, financial markets and business decisions move quickly. Reports produced on a monthly or quarterly basis, often with a multi-week lag, may not be available with sufficient frequency to inform real-time decisions. Also, some indicators, by design, take on new market information slowly. A recent and relevant example is housing services inflation, as measured as part of the consumer price index (CPI) and the personal consumption expenditures price index. Both rely heavily on slowly changing leasing agreements that only adjust to market conditions over many months. Business entries and exits, sometimes called births and deaths, are similar in that they take time to appear in surveys that underlie important statistical products. I will touch on that a bit more later.</p>
<p>A second challenge is that many statistical reports were created decades ago and may not be focused on newer or growing sectors of the economy. For example, there are monthly reports on factory orders, shipments, inventories, and output among the principal economic indicators. Because developments in the goods sector can matter importantly for economic fluctuations, that level of detail is indeed helpful to have. But we would benefit from the same depth of information on domestically produced services, too. While service-sector output constitutes a larger share of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP), the category has only one single dedicated quarterly report, even though much of the post-pandemic recovery requires us to understand how services consumption and employment have evolved. For example, did you know that quarterly hog and pig counts are a principal economic indicator? Yet, there is not a regular government report specifically dedicated to the gig economy. I am certainly glad we collect data for important agricultural commodities, but I think we should probably be examining the large and diverse gig economy as much as we do the pig economy. I believe the statistical agencies grapple with these issues, and it takes time to lay the groundwork and develop new data series, but this challenge is a real one. If reports are built for the past, that may mean they struggle to capture big developments today and in the future, such as the changing nature of where and how people work or the rising use of artificial intelligence (AI) technology.</p>
<p>Finally, there is an impediment that everyone here is acutely aware of: These challenges are made even more difficult because official surveys have seen declining survey response rates. That results in lower precision of statistical estimates and can lead to the need for further, costly surveys to collect the necessary amount of information, as one may need to conduct several rounds of data collection before having sufficiently large samples that can provide reliable estimates. Declining response rates may also be selective and pose a challenge to representing the broader population. Innovative methods for data collection and behavioral interventions to encourage survey responses can be used to address concerns and are being tried in some cases by statistical agencies.</p>
<p><strong>A Data Explosion</strong><br />While these challenges in traditional data that I have described may take some time to be addressed, I am encouraged by the explosion in data produced by the private sector over the past decade or so that can greatly enhance our understanding of the economy. Such data give an opportunity to measure economic developments with greater timeliness, at a higher frequency, and with more granularity. That said, those data often face their own challenges, including issues with representativeness, the lack of methodological consistency, and a short time-series history. Nevertheless, such nontraditional data can be helpful, especially when used jointly with official statistics to which these new sources can be benchmarked.</p>
<p>A prominent example of valuable private-sector data is employment statistics from payroll providers. Such weekly data allowed economists at the Federal Reserve Board to understand, essentially in real time, employment losses when the pandemic first took hold in the United States in March 2020. In comparison, it took until early May to get similar information from the Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS) employment report.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240716a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;Indeed, in trying to understand the rapidly changing economy during the pandemic, Fed economists closely followed a variety of privately produced higher-frequency data. These included reports on restaurant reservations, hotel occupancy, and airport passengers. Economists even used anonymized phone-tracking data to estimate business shutdown rates and trends in retail spending.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240716a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a></p>
<p>Credit and debit card transaction data are another example of a helpful, private-sector tool that economists use to understand consumer behavior in various sectors or regions in close to real time. These figures provided what proved to be a pretty reliable picture of economic developments during the pandemic, well before traditional statistics&mdash;such as quarterly GDP and monthly retail sales&mdash;became available.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240716a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;The need for timely, high-frequency information is not limited to pandemics and turns in the national business cycle. For example, Federal Reserve Board economists have used credit and debit card transaction data to estimate the effects of local natural disasters almost in real time when official statistics are often not available.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240716a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a></p>
<p>When we look at economic turning points, it is also important to consider reports on expectations and anticipated outcomes from nongovernment sources. Those include surveys of expectations of future inflation, anticipated hiring or layoffs, and consumer and business sentiment on the economy or the path of the economy. I pay close attention to these surveys because they are forward looking and help inform where behaviors by businesses and households may be trending.</p>
<p>Tracking supply chains is another area where private-sector sources have proved extremely valuable, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. One important source of such data is the Institute for Supply Management's surveys of purchasing managers. While those series are well established and closely followed, Fed economists found them particularly helpful in recent years to observe supplier delivery times, order backlogs, items in short supply, and measures of inventory satisfaction. Other private-sector data give economists insight into supply chains as well, including measures of air, sea and overland freight costs; the number of waiting container ships; and the volume of railroad traffic. These data series offered additional details on the level of constraint in supply chains following the pandemic shock, alongside reports from official statistical agencies.</p>
<p>I will offer two additional examples of how I use nontraditional data at the Fed&mdash;one from each side of our dual mandate. To better understand the labor market, I have been watching job vacancy, quit, and layoff data closely for many years. The official government source for this information is the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS). While extremely important, JOLTS data are released with a lag of more than a month. And this survey has seen a particularly large decline in response rates.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240716a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a>&nbsp;This instance turned out to be another example of where private data could enhance my understanding. Job search sites' data on postings are updated more frequently than the federal report and generally confirm that JOLTS measurement appears to be accurate. Similarly, JOLTS data on layoffs are lagged. That is why I also look at other figures, including unemployment insurance claims; Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification, or WARN, notices; employment reductions from the Institute for Supply Management; anticipated layoffs from outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas; and mentions of layoffs in earnings reports and the Beige Book.</p>
<p>With inflation, an important component to track recently has been housing services costs, which is typically the single largest expense for U.S. households. Housing services are a big reason why the overall inflation rate remains above our 2 percent target. The official measures of housing services inflation are intended to capture overall growth of housing costs&mdash;that is, costs incurred by owners and renters&mdash;drawing from a survey of rental lease terms. But rental leases tend to change only gradually, so the official measures can significantly lag current market conditions. That is why policymakers can also rely on current market rent data, showing what landlords charge new tenants, information that is available from multiple private-sector sources. Those data can provide some early signal of where official housing inflation series are likely headed.</p>
<p>Here I have mentioned just a handful of private-sector data examples. But each of these helps address measurement challenges I mentioned earlier. From these data, we can gain timeliness and higher frequency, with a better read on underlying economic dynamics like market pricing. And with often low survey response rates in official data, these private-sector sources may provide another perspective on underlying economic developments.</p>
<p><strong>Official Innovations</strong><br />While I see great value in considering data produced outside of statistical agencies, the private sector is not the only place where innovation in economic measurement is occurring. Statistical agencies have long made use of private-sector data, so there is nothing "nontraditional" about using private-sector data to shed more light on economic measurement; in fact, it is a long tradition. I can think of several examples.</p>
<p>The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) taps many private-sector sources in its compilation of GDP statistics, covering topics ranging from oil and gas drilling to insurance premiums.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240716a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;At the Board, the Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization report features a long list of private data sources for the output of products ranging from semiconductors to lumber.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240716a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a>&nbsp;And our Consumer Credit statistics rely in part on data from a large credit bureau and an association of credit unions.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240716a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a>&nbsp;I could go on, but the broader point is that our country's statistical agencies do not ignore valuable sources of economic measurement that the private sector has to offer&mdash;far from it. They make significant use of private information in combination with official surveys and administrative data. And they are actively advancing that practice further.</p>
<p>Economic developments in recent years have been met by a flurry of innovation and adaptation from statistical agencies, relying not only on private-sector sources but also on novel uses or production of government data. One notable product that I have mentioned in past speeches is the Census Bureau's Business Formation Statistics (BFS). First published in 2018, the BFS series was developed in collaboration with the Board's staff and relies on new business applications for Employer Identification Numbers, or EINs.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240716a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a>&nbsp;During the early months of the pandemic, weekly data from the BFS provided a timely indicator of the initial decline in economic activity, and then later the figures likewise documented the rebound.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240716a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a></p>
<p>Another measurement invention was created during the early months of the pandemic: the Census Bureau's high-frequency "Pulse" surveys&mdash;one each for households and businesses. Those surveys leveraged existing Census Bureau resources to provide quick-turnaround information about the rapidly evolving health and economic situations.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240716a.htm#fn14" title="footnote 14"><span>14</span></a><a name="f14"></a></p>
<p>The Household Pulse Survey was rapidly developed shortly after the pandemic struck the U.S., with participation from a broad set of government agencies.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240716a.htm#fn15" title="footnote 15"><span>15</span></a><a name="f15"></a>&nbsp;The survey provides a range of economic information about Americans, including the pandemic-induced jump in remote work. The survey has adapted over time as the health and economic situations have evolved, incorporating questions about vaccination, access to infant formula during a product shortage, inflation, and other issues. The Small Business Pulse Survey provided timely information about employment, revenue, financial conditions, and expectations for future growth, survival, and needs in the highly uncertain pandemic environment. Later iterations of the survey shed light on supply chains, as the United States grappled with input shortages and disrupted freight networks. The Small Business Pulse Survey was discontinued, but it planted the seeds for the current Business Trends and Outlook Survey, which provides a similar wealth of information about business conditions and is already the gold standard for understanding trends such as business-level implementation of AI technologies.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240716a.htm#fn16" title="footnote 16"><span>16</span></a><a name="f16"></a></p>
<p>The national accountants at the BEA have also shown a flair for innovation. For example, the bureau has introduced many "satellite accounts" and other special series over the years&mdash;some still in experimental form&mdash;with national account&ndash;style information about special topics, including health care, income distribution, global value chains, small business, the digital economy, and the space economy, among others.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240716a.htm#fn17" title="footnote 17"><span>17</span></a><a name="f17"></a>&nbsp;Thinking of special-topic national accounts is a way the statistical agencies can keep up with an ever-evolving economy. In fact, the treatment of research and development investment in current GDP methodology originated as a satellite account.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240716a.htm#fn18" title="footnote 18"><span>18</span></a><a name="f18"></a></p>
<p>Another example comes from the BLS and, specifically, how the agency tracks market rents as part of its inflation data series, an issue I mentioned earlier. While the official statistics on housing services inflation do not break out new tenant market rents from the rest of the index, BLS staff recently began exploiting the housing survey data that underlie the CPI to construct a New Tenant Rent Index (NTRI).<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240716a.htm#fn19" title="footnote 19"><span>19</span></a><a name="f19"></a>&nbsp;The NTRI looks at quarterly changes in the terms offered in new leases. Data users are still learning how to best combine the signal from the NTRI with other measures of market rents, but this research effort shows the agility of the statistical agencies in responding to current needs of understanding inflation dynamics.</p>
<p>These are but a few of the many innovations that have arisen from statistical agencies. Regarding the measurement challenges I mentioned earlier, the examples I just listed have helped observers better track the economy during periods of rapid change or when there are shifts in the structure of the economy, such as increased remote work or the rise of AI, changes to immigration patterns, and supply bottlenecks. A harder nut to crack is declining response rates, but it may be that more integration of private-sector data with official data provides an avenue for addressing this problem as well.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20240716a.htm#fn20" title="footnote 20"><span>20</span></a><a name="f20"></a></p>
<p><strong>Seeing Where the Economy Stands</strong><br />I hope my discussion today highlights the tremendous innovation in economic measurement in recent years, supplied by both inventive private-sector data generation and nimble statistical agencies. It is incumbent on economists, researchers, and officials from statistical agencies around the world&mdash;many of you who are here today&mdash;to be open to new and diverse ways to measure the economy so that this healthy pace of innovation can continue.</p>
<p>I want to again stress two things. First, the United States has world-class statistical agencies that have both a long history of rigorously constructing government data sources and adapting and combining information from private-sector with official sources. And, second, private-sector data will continue to be useful for providing granularity, timeliness, and frequency advantages that can complement official statistics, so long as data users are appropriately cautious. Despite the many challenges, the future of economic measurement is bright. The statistical agencies have already proven their ability to innovate and adapt, even under tight resource constraints. And the wealth of private-sector data sources will only expand in the future. When I form my economic outlook and policy assessments, my approach is to watch a wide range of indicators, both official and unofficial, with a focus on the strengths and weaknesses of each.</p>
<p>All the data I carefully examine in my current role allow me to better understand where the economy stands. My colleagues on the FOMC and I make determinations on the policy actions that will be most appropriate for achieving our dual mandate, and so I would like to briefly share my views on how I see the economy evolving and how I see appropriate monetary policy.</p>
<p>Despite a few bumps at the beginning of the year, inflation has continued to trend down in all price categories. But inflation remains above our target. I do believe that supply and demand are gradually coming into better balance. Supply-side bottlenecks continue to heal, and demand has moderated amid high interest rates and as households' excess savings have depleted. The labor market likewise has seen substantial rebalancing and nominal wage growth moderating as a result&mdash;even while keeping up with inflation. Job vacancies and the quits rate have come down from their historically high levels from a couple years ago, and the vacancy-to-unemployment ratio is now back at its pre-pandemic level. On the labor supply side, the increased entry of prime-age workers and immigration have both helped to expand the labor force and compensate for excess retirements we saw during the pandemic. This continued rebalancing suggests that inflation will continue to move down toward our 2 percent target. As I have discussed in recent remarks, if economic conditions continue to evolve in this favorable manner with more rapid disinflation, as evidenced in the inflation data of the past three months, and employment softening but remaining resilient as seen in the past few jobs reports, I anticipate that it will be appropriate to begin easing monetary policy later this year. But my approach to this policy decision will continue to be data dependent and to rely on multiple and diverse sources of data to form my view of how the economy is evolving, especially as upside risks to inflation and downside risks to employment have become much more balanced. If the labor market cools too much and unemployment continues to increase and is driven by layoffs, I would see it as appropriate to cut rates sooner rather than later. Alternatively, if incoming data do not provide confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent, it may be appropriate to hold rates steady for a little longer.</p>
<p>As I conclude, I want to thank those of you in this room who do the hard work each day to create and analyze the economic data that allow not only policymakers like me, but also consumers and businesses, to gain a better understanding of ongoing developments in the U.S. economy. And let me thank NABE again for having me. It was a pleasure to speak with you today.</p>

Summary: The SEC and African regulators collaborate to develop capital markets and regulations to support economic growth in Southern Africa. <div>
<p>Good morning and welcome to the regional training conference for securities regulators in Southern Africa.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-southern-african-071624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;Thank you for your attendance, which reflects your commitment to developing regional capital markets to support economic growth on this continent.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-southern-african-071624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>I would like to thank the Capital Markets Commission of Angola (&ldquo;CMC&rdquo;), and its leader, President [Vanessa] Sim&otilde;es, Dr. [Sebasti&atilde;o] Manuel, Advisor to the CMC&rsquo;s Executive Board, and Professor [Jo&atilde;o Manuel] Fernandes, Chairman of the ISPTEC, for their partnership in planning and hosting this event. My colleagues and I from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (&ldquo;SEC&rdquo;) are pleased to participate and hope that our efforts will contribute to making this event a success.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-southern-african-071624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Thirty years ago, the United States established diplomatic relations with Angola.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-southern-african-071624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;During that time, we have made great strides in strengthening the ties between our two nations as well as the broader Southern Africa region. In 2002, President George W. Bush hosted President [Festus Gontebanye] Mogae of Botswana, President [Joaquim Albetto] Chissano of Mozambique, and President [Jose Eduardo] dos Santos of Angola at the White House in Washington, DC.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-southern-african-071624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;At that meeting, the four Presidents discussed opportunities to bring greater peace and stability to the Southern Africa region.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-southern-african-071624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p>Two decades later, President Joseph Biden invited delegations from 49 African countries and the African Union to the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, where an entire day was devoted to increasing two-way trade and investment.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-southern-african-071624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;As the President remarked: &ldquo;Africa&rsquo;s success and prosperity is essential to ensuring a better future for all of us, not just Africa.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-southern-african-071624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p>Last November, President [Jo&atilde;o Manuel Gon&ccedil;alves] Louren&ccedil;o of Angola met with President Biden at the White House to address opportunities to deepen the relationship between our nations over the coming years.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-southern-african-071624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;One of those opportunities is capital and investment.</p>
<p>This conference will focus on appropriate oversight of the capital markets. To start this conference, I will provide some perspectives on the importance of robust capital markets to a thriving economy.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Importance of Robust Capital Markets</span></p>
<p>After its founding in 2014, the Angolan Securities Exchange &ndash; known as BODIVA &ndash; listed its first initial public offering in 2022.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-southern-african-071624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;To mark the occasion, Walter Pacheco, BODIVA&rsquo;s Chief Executive Officer, stated: &ldquo;We come together today to witness the start of a new era for the financial system and the capital markets.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-southern-african-071624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></p>
<p>The development of capital markets can create opportunities for prosperity for a nation&rsquo;s citizens. At a basic level, for an economy to flourish, businesses must have access to capital to fund their ventures. One way to access capital is to obtain a loan from a bank. However, bank loans are funded from customer deposits, so banks typically are subject to prudential regulation, which seeks to ensure the safety and soundness of the banking sector. The mere rumor that a bank might be unable to satisfy its obligation to depositors can challenge the stability of a nation&rsquo;s entire banking system.</p>
<p>Another way for businesses to obtain funding is through the capital markets. In contrast to money maintained at a bank, an investment of money in the capital markets has no guarantee of returns. Investment risk is a central feature of the capital markets. Investors can assess the financial prospects of various opportunities and choose where to invest. Through this market-based mechanism, capital is allocated to ventures with the greatest potential for success. While not all investors have the time or sophistication to make informed investment decisions, they can delegate those decisions to financial professionals, such as investment advisers and asset managers.</p>
<p>The benefits of capital markets are twofold. First, businesses needing capital can receive the funding necessary to operate and grow. Second, investors can share in the returns if the business succeeds. This stands in contrast to bank deposits, which typically offer customers nominal rates of return in the form of interest.</p>
<p>Of course, investing entails risk. There is no assurance that a business will succeed, and failure will result in the loss of investor capital. Despite this risk, the benefits of exposure to capital markets are well-established. In the United States, the S&amp;P 500 Index tracks the largest companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges. Since 1926, the S&amp;P 500 Index has gained an average of 10.2% annually.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-southern-african-071624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;Although, the U.S. markets have experienced periods of volatility, historically an individual with long-term exposure to the stock market would have experienced gains.</p>
<p>Diversification is also important from an investment perspective. Exposure to multiple companies mitigates the risk posed by the failure of any single company. Robust capital markets create opportunities for new businesses to enter the market, which provides investors with a greater universe of investment opportunities. This procyclical dynamic enhances a nation&rsquo;s economy and the prosperity of its citizens.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Role of Regulators in Fostering Capital Markets</span></p>
<p>In the United States, households own significant amounts of publicly traded stock, often in retirement accounts. As of 2022, 58% of U.S. families own shares of public companies &ndash; either directly or indirectly.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-southern-african-071624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>&nbsp;One key driver of public participation in the capital markets is a regulatory framework that instils confidence in the financial system.</p>
<p>The experience of the United States is that capital markets thrive when they are allowed operate freely within broad guardrails. In the United States, securities regulation focuses on: (1) requiring that companies seeking to raise money from the public provide full and fair disclosure and (2) prohibiting persons from engaging in fraud in the markets. The United States also has laws that govern the conduct of investment advisers that manage assets on behalf of investors as well as other market participants like brokers, dealers, exchanges, transfer agents, and credit rating agencies.</p>
<p>The U.S. framework is not merit-based and the SEC does not evaluate whether an investment is good or bad. Instead, companies are required to provide truthful disclosures in order to raise capital. Under this framework, investors are not protected against making their own bad investments decisions. Instead, the transparency afforded by disclosure allows investors to reach their own conclusions.</p>
<p>The SEC works to detect and address possible violations of the securities laws, such as by engaging in market surveillance activities, monitoring filings and media reports, and assessing tips and complaints submitted by investors and other market participants.</p>
<p>Activities that could trigger an SEC investigation include: (1) misrepresentation or omission of important information about securities; (2) manipulating the market prices of securities; (3) stealing customers' funds or securities; (4) insider trading, which generally means violating a trust relationship by trading on material, non-public information about a security; and (5) selling unregistered securities.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s efforts to bring enforcement actions against individuals or entities that engage in this type of conduct helps to maintain the public&rsquo;s confidence in investing in U.S. public companies. At the same time, U.S. securities regulations do not punish companies merely because they go out of business or perform poorly &ndash; if those results are accurately disclosed. Indeed, in a competitive environment, it is expected that some businesses will fail over time.</p>
<p>The African Union&rsquo;s Agenda 2063 &ndash; which was adopted in 2015 &ndash; expresses a goal of strengthening continental capital markets and financial institutions.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-southern-african-071624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>&nbsp;Evidence suggests that the continent is on the right track. One report states that the number of stock exchanges on the African continent increased from five in 1989 to twenty-eight in 2021.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-southern-african-071624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>&nbsp;That same report reveals that the market capitalization of African stock markets increased from $113 billion in 1992 to $1.1 trillion in 2018.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-southern-african-071624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a></p>
<p>The report also indicates that African capital markets have significant room for additional growth, noting that these markets can &ldquo;increase their investor base by tapping into the huge financial resources sitting in deposit accounts of African pension funds and sovereign wealth funds.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-southern-african-071624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a>&nbsp;According to the report, &ldquo;if these funds were channelled into the continent&rsquo;s local capital markets, they would improve the liquidity of many African exchanges and bond markets.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-southern-african-071624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a></p>
<p>Adopting and implementing regulatory frameworks that strike the appropriate balance between free market economics and investor protection can contribute to the in-flow of assets into the capital markets of African nations. These measures can also attract foreign capital.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pitfalls of Regulation</span></p>
<p>While effective regulation can cause capital markets to flourish, regulators must avoid attempts to venture beyond the limited scope of ensuring transparency and preventing fraud. The strength of the U.S. public company regulatory regime has been that disclosures are generally mandated only if they are material to investors from a financial perspective.</p>
<p>The power of the public company disclosure regime has tempted certain constituencies to use the disclosure rules to effect social or political change. For example, the SEC recently adopted a climate disclosure rule, which appears designed to exert societal pressure on public companies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>This region of Africa has directly felt the consequences of another U.S. securities disclosure rule that is trying to effect social or political change. In 2010, the U.S. Congress passed a law called the &ldquo;Dodd-Frank Act&rdquo; which mandated certain disclosures about conflict minerals originating from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). This law sought to use securities disclosure to reduce conflict and violence in the region. In 2022, the U.S. Government Accountability Office, in studying the law, concluded that peace and security have &ldquo;not improved&rdquo; in the region.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-southern-african-071624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a>&nbsp;Nonetheless, the region continues to suffer from many public companies simply avoiding any acquisition of tin, tungsten, tantalum, and gold from the DRC or countries adjacent to the DRC.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-southern-african-071624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a></p>
<p>While reducing greenhouse gas emissions, or conflict and violence in the DRC, might be worthy goals, those types of policy decisions are appropriately handled by political leaders rather than financial regulators. Straying from the guiding principle of financial materiality risks degrading the integrity of the capital markets and ought to be avoided.</p>
<p>Additionally, financial regulators must not be tempted by retroactively imposing rules through enforcement. Market participants should know the rules in advance. Circumventing the rulemaking process with novel or creative interpretations of the law for the purpose of bringing an enforcement action can disincentivize market participants from engaging in otherwise productive activity. Regulators can also be tempted to squeeze new activities into existing rules, even when they do not fit. This approach can stifle innovation and deprive companies and investors of the benefits of new products, services, and emerging technologies.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conclusion</span></p>
<p>The importance of the U.S.-Africa relationship has been made clear over the course of multiple U.S. presidential administrations. This relationship has many components, but as a financial regulator, I am particularly excited to be here in Angola to support you &ndash; our partners in Southern Africa &ndash; in optimizing your respective regulatory frameworks. The United States owes much of its wealth and prosperity to the development of its own capital markets, and I am hopeful that the information shared at this conference will contribute to the growth of the capital markets in Southern Africa.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<div> consultation, internal model authorisation, EBA, CRR III, Implementing Technical Standards
Summary:<br /><br />The EBA has published a consultation paper to amend the Implementing Regulation on internal model authorization, reflecting changes in the EU legal framework. This includes the reduced scope of application for internal models and updates to the general functioning of supervisory colleges. The consultation is open until October 16, 2024. The amending ITS establish the process for competent authorities to work together during the joint decision on institutions’ application to use internal models for prudential purposes, including the involvement of third-country supervisory authorities and the procedure for assessing the completeness of applications. The draft amending ITS reflect the revised scope for internal models set out in the CRR III, where the possibility to apply these approaches is no longer in place for operational risk. Additionally, the draft amending ITS reflect the updated references to the EBA's guidelines. <div>
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published a consultation paper amending the Implementing Regulation on the joint decision process for internal model authorisation under the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR). The revised Implementing Technical Standards (ITS) incorporate changes to the EU legal framework, including the reduced scope of application for internal models under CRR III and the updated framework on the general functioning of supervisory colleges. This draft amending ITS are part of the first phase of the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-publishes-roadmap-implementation-eu-banking-package">EBA roadmap for implementing the EU Banking Package</a><span>. This consultation runs until 16 October 2024.</span></p>
<p>The existing ITS establish the process to help competent authorities work together while performing their assessments and preparing their contributions to the joint decision on institutions&rsquo; application to use internal models for prudential purpose, including: a) possible involvement of third-country supervisory authorities, b) specification on the procedure for assessing the completeness of application, c) planning of the joint decision process and, more generally, the cooperation between home-host authorities.</p>
<p>The novelty of the draft amending ITS is mainly related to the overall revised scope for internal model set out in the CRR III, where the possibility to apply these approaches is no longer in place for operational risk. Therefore, the references to the Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA) have been removed from the scope of the revised ITS. Additionally, the draft amending ITS reflect the updated references to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/activities/single-rulebook/regulatory-activities/colleges-supervisors/technical-standards#:~:text=The%20Regulatory%20Technical%20Standards%20(RTS,1%20regulation%20and%20able%20to">ITS and Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) on the functioning of supervisory colleges</a>.</p>

<title>The EBA Publishes The Report On The Application Of Derogations To The Deferral And Pay Out In Instruments Under CRD</title>

<div> EBA, report, variable remuneration, derogations, small and non-complex institutions
Summary:<br /> EBA published a report on the impact of derogations on variable remuneration requirements for small institutions and staff. <div>
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published a report on the application of derogations to the requirements to pay out a part of the variable remuneration for identified staff under deferral arrangements and in instruments that are available to small and non-complex institutions and for identified staff receiving only a relatively small amount of variable remuneration. This report forms part of the EBA&rsquo;s contribution to the review to be performed by the European Commission.</span></p>
<p>The report aims to assess the implementation and application of derogations within the EU and their impact on the costs, risk alignment of variable remuneration to the risk profile of the institution as well as on the ability to recruit and retain staff.</p>
<p>Notably, prior to the explicit introduction of CRDV derogations, the national implementations of the CRD permitted small and non-complex institutions and staff receiving relatively low variable remuneration, to waive specific requirements based on proportionality grounds. Consequently, assessing the impact of CRDV changes remains challenging as it is limited to marginal changes to the regime that today applies with more harmonised thresholds.</p>

<div> Proposals, Cross-border payments, FSB, Data flows, Recommendations
<br />
The FSB proposes recommendations to address data flow frictions, establish cross-sectoral collaboration forum, and strengthen consistency in regulating payment service providers.
<br /><br />
Summary: 
The FSB proposes recommendations to address data flow frictions, establish cross-sectoral collaboration forum, and strengthen consistency in regulating payment service providers. <div>
<ul>
<li> <em><strong>FSB proposes recommendations to address frictions in data flows related to cross-border payments and to promote a level playing field between bank and non-bank providers of payment services.</strong></em> </li>
<li> <em><strong>Proposals include the establishment of a forum for cross-sectoral collaboration on data issues related to cross-border payments to ensure that the recommendations are taken forward in a coordinated manner.</strong></em> </li>
<li> <em><strong>Public consultations form part of the FSB&rsquo;s efforts to prioritise work and strengthen private-sector participation under the G20 cross-border payments roadmap.</strong></em> </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) published today, for public consultation, its proposed recommendations to promote&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/07/recommendations-to-promote-alignment-and-interoperability-across-data-frameworks-related-to-cross-border-payments-consultation-report/">greater alignment in data frameworks related to cross-border payments</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2024/07/recommendations-for-regulating-and-supervising-bank-and-non-bank-payment-service-providers-offering-cross-border-payment-services-consultation-report/">consistency in the regulation and supervision of bank and non-bank payment service providers</a>. These reports take forward priority actions under the G20 Roadmap to address legal, supervisory and regulatory frictions in cross-border payments to help achieve the quantitative targets in 2027.</p>
<h4><strong>Policy recommendations to promote greater alignment and interoperability in data frameworks related to cross-border payments</strong></h4>
<p>The transfer of data across borders is essential to the functioning of the cross-border payments system. The FSB&rsquo;s recommendations aim to address identified frictions from data frameworks (i.e. the range of laws, rules and regulatory requirements for collecting, storing and managing data) that pose significant challenges to improving the cost, speed, transparency and accessibility of cross-border payments, while maintaining their safety and security and upholding the objective of protecting the privacy of individuals. These frictions include the misalignment of data in payments that interferes with the smooth processing of cross-border payments, restrictions on data sharing that impede the ability to safely process cross-border payments, and increased costs due to data storage and handling requirements. To take forward these recommendations in a coordinated manner and to identify emerging issues that should be addressed, the FSB proposes the establishment of a forum comprised of public-sector stakeholders covering payments, anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT), sanctions, and data privacy and protection.</p>
<h4><strong>Policy recommendations to strengthen consistency in regulating and supervising banks and non-banks providing cross-border payment services</strong></h4>
<p>Advances in technology in the cross-border payments landscape have led to an increasing number and variety of payment services providers (PSPs) and the services they offer. In response to these changes, legal, regulatory and supervisory frameworks that govern PSPs have had to rapidly adapt and evolve. Due to the absence of comprehensive international standards applicable to non-bank PSPs&rsquo; provision of cross-border payment services, jurisdictions have taken varying approaches to regulating and supervising bank and non-bank PSPs. The proposed recommendations aim to ensure quality and consistency in the legal, regulatory and supervisory regimes for PSPs and to promote greater alignment between those applicable to banks and non-banks in their cross-border payment activities. This approach reduces the likelihood of regulatory arbitrage by establishing a level playing field for both banks and non-bank PSPs, despite differences in business models and risk profiles. Greater consistency in the treatment of payment services across PSPs supports an environment that reduces costs, increases delivery speed, and improves financial access and transparency.</p>
<p>The FSB is inviting comments on these consultation reports and the questions set out. Responses should be submitted through the respective&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/survey/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">online forms</a>&nbsp;<strong>by 9 September 2024</strong>. For questions, please contact the FSB (<a href="mailto:fsb@fsb.org">fsb@fsb.org</a>). Responses will be published on the FSB&rsquo;s website unless respondents expressly request otherwise on the online form.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The G20 has made enhancing cross-border payments a priority to achieve faster, cheaper, more transparent and more inclusive cross-border payments, while maintaining their safety and security. In 2020, the FSB, in coordination with the Bank for International Settlements&rsquo; Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) and other international organisations and standard-setting bodies, developed a Roadmap to address these challenges. In October 2022, G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors endorsed a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2022/10/g20-roadmap-for-enhancing-cross-border-payments-priorities-for-the-next-phase-of-work/">plan for prioritising work</a>&nbsp;under the Roadmap and for enhancing engagement with the private sector and jurisdictions beyond the G20. In February 2023, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2023/02/g20-roadmap-for-enhancing-cross-border-payments-priority-actions-for-achieving-the-g20-targets/">FSB outlined three priority themes to move the Roadmap forward</a>&nbsp;and achieve the quantitative targets by 2027. The themes cover: payment system interoperability and extension; legal, regulatory and supervisory frameworks; and cross-border exchange and message standards.</p>
<p>The FSB coordinates at the international level the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies and develops and promotes the implementation of effective regulatory, supervisory, and other financial sector policies in the interest of financial stability. It brings together national authorities responsible for financial stability in 24 countries and jurisdictions, international financial institutions, sector-specific international groupings of regulators and supervisors, and committees of central bank experts. The FSB also conducts outreach with approximately 70 other jurisdictions through its six Regional Consultative Groups.</p>
<p>The FSB is chaired by Klaas Knot, President of De Nederlandsche Bank. The FSB Secretariat is located in Basel, Switzerland and hosted by the Bank for International Settlements.</p>

<div> power markets, natural gas, environmental markets, global expansion, product portfolio
Summary:
EEX Group achieved significant growth in power, natural gas, and environmental markets globally in the first half of 2024.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p>EEX Group has achieved significant volume growth in the first half of 2024 across major asset classes. The group&rsquo;s global power market volume increased by almost 50%. While natural gas volumes in the US almost doubled in size, European natural gas trading remained stable on the high level seen in the past two years. Environmental markets both in Europe as well as in North America reported a high double-digit growth in the first half of the year. Furthermore, EEX Group has extended its product portfolio in line with market needs.</p>
<p>Peter Reitz, CEO of EEX, comments: &ldquo;<em>2024 started with strong growth across most of EEX Group markets. Our power markets have seen significant expansion in terms of volumes in the first half of the year, underpinned by the growing rate of renewables integration impacting spot markets, as well as the increasing importance of long-term price risk hedging. In addition to that, we see a rising share of high-frequency traders joining our markets. In the context of energy transition and decarbonisation, it is promising to see that our environmental markets in Europe and North America have reported significant increases in terms of trading volumes. We are looking forward to further supporting the energy transition with market-based instruments.&rdquo;</em></p>
<h4><span>Strong growth across all major power markets</span></h4>
<p>In the first half of 2024, the EEX Group global power volume increased by 47% to 6,047.0 TWh with high double-digit growth rates across almost all power products. While volumes on the European power spot market increased by 24% to 430.7 TWh, European power derivatives markets increased by 78% to 3,951.2 TWh, with French and Spanish Power Futures even doubling their volume. Trading volumes in Japanese Power Futures more than tripled to 28.9 TWh. US power derivatives increased by 6% to 1,636.3 TWh.</p>
<p>In March, EEX launched Nordic Zonal Futures as an additional offering for the Nordic power market. As a result, volumes in these markets more than doubled to 13.3 TWh in the first half of the year. Furthermore, in June, the Brazilian power market started its operations at N5X, a joint venture of EEX Group and the local exchange B3.</p>
<h4><span>US gas markets almost doubled</span></h4>
<p>Natural gas futures for the US grew by 98% to 111.0 TWh in the first half of the year. At the same time, European gas derivatives markets exceeded the high level of the previous year by 7% to 2,074.3 TWh while European gas spot markets decreased by 11% to 1,433.3 TWh. In total, EEX Group&rsquo;s natural gas volumes remained at a similar level of 3,618.6 TWh as last year (H1/2023: 3,622.9 TWh).</p>
<p>In April, EEX launched TTF Futures denominated in USD in addition to its existing EUR-denominated contracts. In total, volumes in this market have increased by 21% in the first half of the year to 1,310.4 TWh. Furthermore, strong growth was achieved on the NBP spot market with an increase of 19% to 91.5 TWh as well as in Italian PSV Futures with an increase of 45% to 32.1 TWh.</p>
<h4><span>Significant increase in global environmental markets</span></h4>
<p>European environmental markets were up 44%, representing a total of 576.6 million tonnes of CO<span>2</span>&nbsp;in the first half of 2024, mainly driven by a strong increase of 131% in emissions futures representing 257.8 million tonnes of CO<span>2</span>. EEX noticed a significant growth in order book activity as a result of its Market Maker scheme which was introduced in 2023. In North America, trading in environmental products grew by 65% to 271,884 contracts.</p>
<h4><span>Double-digit growth in agricultural markets</span></h4>
<p>Trading in EEX agricultural products rose by 13% to 29,399 contracts. The increase was driven by a 31% growth in dairy futures to a total of 28,744 contracts (equals 143,720 tonnes).</p>
<p>Peter Reitz concludes:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;EEX Group is committed to further building markets across the globe. In this context, we put a strong focus on products that serve the energy transition like the recently announced GO Futures that will be available as of September. At the same time, we continue to extend the &nbsp;product offering in our existing markets with new contracts and to broaden our geographical reach to increase trading opportunities and capital efficiency for our trading participants&rdquo;.</em></p>

<p><span>The Final Report summarises the feedback from industry and the IRGs on topics including proposed enhancements for automation of existing processes and tooling with regards to Data Leakage Prevention, Data Classification and Data Labelling and moving forward with a combined Governance, Risk &amp; Compliance and Third-party Risk Management tool. The Final Report also provides insight on the next actions for creation of an equitable set of terms and fee model for intermediaries for all User Types and changes regarding the provision of the UPI as part of the OTC ISIN Service. Additionally, the next steps are outlined on the TOTV Service as a part of cost recovery, and the continuation of the Global Agile Architecture programme of work.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Emma Kalliomaki, Managing Director of ANNA and the DSB, said: &ldquo;We would like to extend our gratitude to the industry for their participation in this year&rsquo;s consultation.

<div> Returns, CalPERS, investments, asset classes, funding status
<br />
CalPERS reported a preliminary net return of 9.3% on its $502.9 billion investments, exceeding the 6.8% discount rate. Public equity led, with 17.5% return. Private market asset valuations need to be finalized. CalPERS will review the portfolio's performance in the next few months to determine the final fiscal year returns for 2023-24. CalPERS Funding Risk Mitigation Policy requires the Board of Administration to review whether to lower the rate for future years if investment returns exceed the established 6.8% discount rate.
<br /><br />Summary: 
CalPERS reported a 9.3% net return on its $502.9 billion investments, exceeding the 6.8% discount rate. Public equity led with a 17.5% return. Private market asset valuations need to be finalized. They will review fiscal year returns. The CalPERS Funding Risk Mitigation Policy requires the Board of Administration to review whether to lower the rate for future years if investment returns exceed the established 6.8% discount rate. <div>
<p>CalPERS today reported a preliminary net return of 9.3% on its investments for the 12-month period ending June 30, 2024. Assets as of that date were valued at $502.9 billion.</p>
<p>The investment return outpaced the discount rate of 6.8%, comparable to an assumed rate of return and a policy marker established by the CalPERS Board of Administration. It was also a notable improvement from the two most recent fiscal years, where investment returns were influenced by a variety of economic and geopolitical challenges.</p>
<p>When using the preliminary net return of 9.3% to assess long-term obligations, the overall estimated funded status of the Public Employees&rsquo; Retirement Fund (PERF) stands at 75%.</p>
<p>"Our investing strategy was well positioned to take advantage of improving economic conditions over the past 12 months," said CalPERS Chief Executive Officer Marcie Frost. "Meeting or exceeding our long-term investing goals is crucial for providing the retirement benefits that our 2 million members and their families are counting on."</p>
<p>Public equity investments, comprising 41.9% of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.calpers.ca.gov/docs/perf-monthly-update.pdf" target="_blank">PERF</a>, led the way among asset classes with an estimated 17.5% return.</p>
<p>The private debt asset class, established in 2022, also performed strongly. Its estimated return was 17%.</p>
<p>Fixed income and private equity reported returns of 3.7% and 10.9%, respectively. Real assets reported a negative return for FY 2023-24.</p>
<p>"Our team remains focused on executing on our long-term investment strategy, building a diversified portfolio to navigate markets and mitigate volatility over our multi-generational investment horizon," said Interim Chief Investment Officer Dan Bienvenue.</p>

<p>Updated long-term return rates reflect the addition of recent lower investment returns in the calculation. Preliminary total fund annualized returns for the five-year period ending June 30, 2024, stood at 6.6%; the 10-year period at 6.2%; and the 20-year period at 6.7%.</p>
<p>The 30-year return rate rose slightly to 7.7%.</p>
<p>Preliminary net returns are an early snapshot of the CalPERS portfolio. CalPERS investment and finance staff and outside experts will review the portfolio's performance in the next few months to determine the final fiscal year returns for 2023-24.</p>
<p>The ending value of the PERF for FY 2023-24 will be based on additional factors beyond investment returns, including employer and employee contributions, monthly payments to retirees, and various investment fees.</p>
<p>Once finalized, fiscal year performance returns are used to set contribution levels for the State of California and school districts in the 2025-26 fiscal year and for contracting counties, cities, and special districts in the 2026-27 fiscal year.</p>
<p>Under the current provisions of the CalPERS Asset Liability Management process, investment returns that exceed the established 6.8% discount rate require the Board of Administration to review whether to lower the rate for future years. This process is included in the CalPERS Funding Risk Mitigation Policy.</p>

<title>ISDA derivatiViews: Managing Terminations</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-derivativiews-managing-terminations/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> initiatives, ISDA, close-out framework, notices hub, derivatives contract<br />
Summary: ISDA is addressing challenges in terminating derivatives contracts through the Close-out Framework and Notices Hub, simplifying the process and ensuring efficiency. <div>
<p>Terminating a derivatives contract has never been the simplest of tasks, especially during volatile markets, but the process has become even more complicated in recent years due to various post-crisis regulatory reforms. We&rsquo;re working on ways to make this procedure easier to navigate, with the development of two initiatives &ndash; the ISDA Close-out Framework and the ISDA Notices Hub &ndash; that will help firms prepare for the worst and ensure a key part of the termination process is more efficient.</p>
<p>The complexity became clear in March 2023, following problems at Signature Bank and SVB in the US, among the few bank failures to occur since the financial crisis. The post-crisis introduction of mandatory margining and collateral segregation requirements for non-cleared derivatives, plus the implementation of bank resolution regimes and the potential for temporary stays on termination, created some practical challenges that, in many cases, banks were addressing in a live situation for the first time.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://close-out.isda.org/#/">ISDA Close-out Framework</a>, which we&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/06/27/isda-publishes-framework-to-prepare-for-close-out-of-derivatives-contracts/">launched last month</a>, is designed to illustrate the various steps and decisions firms need to take and is intended as a preparatory tool for future stress events. We hope it will help highlight the areas where coordination is necessary between legal, operational and risk management functions, and flag the types of questions that will likely emerge.</p>
<p>As a follow-up, we intend to run a series of &lsquo;tabletop&rsquo; exercises later this year, in which senior executives from different parts of a firm will come together to work through a termination scenario, using the Close-out Framework as a reference tool. As regulators increasingly focus on internal bank processes for managing the default of a counterparty, we hope this will be a useful resource. Look out for details on the ISDA website or contact&nbsp;<a href="mailto:legal@isda.org">legal@isda.org</a>&nbsp;for more information.</p>
<p>But even before the introduction of margin requirements and the various bank resolution regimes, there were some potentially tricky aspects of the close-out process &ndash; specifically, the physical delivery and receipt of critical termination-related notices. Under the ISDA Master Agreement, these notices must be delivered using certain prescribed methods, based on contact details set out in the agreement &ndash; problematic if a firm has moved without updating its address,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/02/29/time-is-money-improving-the-close-out-process/">as happened with Lehman Brothers International (Europe) in 2008</a>.</p>
<p>A further issue emerged during the pandemic, when offices were located in areas subject to lockdown requirements, meaning notices couldn&rsquo;t easily be delivered or received. Similarly, there were challenges following Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine, when market participants were unable to physically deliver notices in a perilous environment.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/isda-notices-hub/">ISDA Notices Hub</a>&nbsp;responds to this by allowing the instantaneous delivery and receipt of notices via a secure online platform, eliminating risk exposures and potential losses that can result from delays in terminating derivatives contracts. It will also regularly prompt users to update their physical address details, a single entry that will populate agreements with all their counterparties on the system.</p>
<p>Following a major&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/04/25/isda-launches-outreach-initiative-on-proposed-notices-hub/">industry outreach initiative earlier this year</a>, I&rsquo;m delighted to say that we&rsquo;ve&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/07/01/isda-proceeds-with-development-of-an-industry-notices-hub/">received strong support for this initiative</a>&nbsp;from buy- and sell-side firms globally. We will now work with S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence and Linklaters to build the platform, draft the necessary documentation and obtain legal opinions in priority jurisdictions to confirm the validity of delivering notices via the ISDA Notices Hub.</p>
<p>No one wants to see a counterparty fail. But when they do, it&rsquo;s imperative that firms can minimize their exposures by terminating outstanding derivatives contracts as quickly as possible. Our two initiatives, the ISDA Close-out Framework and the ISDA Notices Hub, will make this process much safer, quicker and more efficient.</p>

<div> Guidelines, EBA, consultation, MiCAR, reporting <br />
Summary: EBA launches consultation on draft Guidelines for reporting requirements under MiCAR to ensure supervisory convergence and a level playing field in the Single Market. <div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<ul>
<li><em>The draft Guidelines aim to ensure a common supervisory approach on the data requests with consistent and pre-defined templates across Member States.</em></li>
<li><em>The draft Guidelines will enhance supervisory convergence and ensure a level playing field in the Single Market.</em></li>
</ul>
<br />
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today launched a consultation on draft Guidelines on reporting requirements to assist competent authorities and the EBA in performing their duties under the Markets in Crypto-assets Regulation (MiCAR). These Guidelines should ensure that Competent Authorities have sufficient comparable information to supervise compliance of issuers with MiCAR requirements and provide the EBA with the information necessary to conduct the significance assessment under MiCAR. The consultation runs until 15 October 2024.</span></p>
<p>Issuers of asset-referenced tokens (ARTs) and certain e-money tokens (EMTs) are required to report specific information defined under Article 22 MiCAR. These data provisions by the issuers are not enough to allow competent authorities and the EBA to discharge their supervisory tasks and the significance assessment tasks under MiCAR.</p>
<p>The EBA has identified these data gaps and is consulting on draft Guidelines specifying common templates and instructions for issuers to provide the EBA and competent authorities with the necessary information to cover these gaps. In addition, these Guidelines include common templates and instructions that issuers should use to collect the data they need from the relevant Crypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs).</p>
<h4>Consultation process</h4>
<p>Comments on the consultation paper can be sent by clicking on the "send your comments" button on the EBA's consultation page. The deadline for the submission of comments is 11 October 2024.</p>
<p>The EBA will hold a virtual public hearing on this consultation paper on 20 September 2024 from 10:30 to 12:00 CET. The EBA invites interested stakeholders to register using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/public-hearing-draft-cp-draft-guidelines-templates-assist-competent-authorities-performing-their">this link</a>&nbsp;by 18 September 2024 at 16:00 CET. The dial-in details will be communicated to those who have registered for the meeting.</p>
<p>All contributions received will be published following the end of the consultation, unless requested otherwise.</p>
<h4>Legal basis and background</h4>
<p>MiCAR regulates the offering to the public and admission to trading of ARTs, EMTs and other type of crypto-assets, as well as the provision of crypto-asset services in the EU. MiCAR sets out a wide range of regulatory requirements, including authorisations, conduct and prudential requirements for issuers of ARTs and EMTs, and mandates the issuers of certain tokens to report certain data points to the CAs under Article 22 MiCAR.</p>
<p>These draft Guidelines specify the content and uniform formats for the submission of information used by competent authorities when exercising their supervisory powers under Article 94(1)(a) and Titles III and IV of the Regulation (EU) 2023/1114 and by the EBA when exercising its supervisory powers under Article 122 of that Regulation.</p>
<p>These draft Guidelines are developed pursuant to Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010. In accordance with Article 16(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, competent authorities and financial institutions must make every effort to comply with the Guidelines.</p>
<p>They are addressed to competent authorities as defined in Article 3(1) point (35) of Regulation (EU) 2023/1114 and to issuers of ARTs and issuers of EMTs.</p>

<div> Report, Stacking Orders, Capital Buffers, Management Buffers, EU Framework
Summary:<br /> EBA published a report on stacking orders, capital buffers, and management buffers in the EU framework. It highlights differences and institutions' practices.<br /> <div>
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published a Report on the stacking orders of capital, leverage and MREL/TLAC requirements and related capital buffers, as well as on reflections about management buffers practices in the European Union (EU). The Report describes the role of regulatory stacks, both going and gone concern, with a focus on micro-prudential elements. It also summarises the differences between the EU, the UK and US frameworks. The Report highlights institutions&rsquo; practices on management buffers. Further work of the EBA will include efforts to continue to clarify, where necessary, the interaction between the different stacks.</span></p>
<p>The work conducted on stacking orders aims at better understanding the interaction between the regulatory stacks and in relation to which stacks management buffers are usually set by institutions. The Report describes all regulatory stacks that are relevant for understanding an institution&rsquo;s capital headroom above the requirements. It also presents a high-level overview of the EU framework of currently applicable regulation, together with a description of some other non-EU frameworks.</p>
<p>The analysis of institutions&rsquo; practices on management buffers highlights that many institutions do not have a very clear definition of management buffers, but nearly all of them set a target on the basis of at least one stack. Institutions tend to compare the management buffer to the highest reference point in the relevant regulatory stack on which they have defined a management buffer.</p>
<p>Most institutions set a management buffer target based on the risk-based CET1 ratio. For this ratio, as of December 2022, the management buffer target was on average 2.4 percentage points above the Pillar 2 Guidance (P2G). Many institutions also set targets based on the risk-based Tier 1 and Total capital ratios, the leverage ratio, and the risk-based MREL ratio.</p>
<p>A broad set of factors influence the determination of management buffers. Internal considerations include the ability to manage unexpected risks and to develop strategic and business opportunities. External considerations include expectations from supervisors and regulators or from other stakeholders. In terms of perceived usability of management buffers, most institutions considered management buffers to be more usable than the capital held to meet the Combined Buffer Requirement (CBR).</p>
<h4>Next steps</h4>
<p>The work will inform other EBA regulatory products, such as the one stemming from the mandate on the interplay between the output floor and Pillar 2 (Art 104a(7) CRD6), and prepare the ground for the update of the supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP) Guidelines following the EU Banking Package (CRR3 and CRD6) implementation.</p>
<h4>Legal basis and background</h4>
<p>Under the current EU framework, an institution may be subject to up to ten different stacks resulting from requirements or expectations in terms of own funds and eligible liabilities:&nbsp; three own funds ratios, the leverage ratio and the ratios for Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC), Minimum Requirement for Own Funds and Eligible Liabilities (MREL) and subordinated MREL stacks, considering that each TLAC and MREL stack has a risk-based and leverage-based version.</p>
<p>In its response to the European Commission&rsquo;s Call for Advice on the review of the macroprudential framework, the EBA explained that a more comprehensive evaluation should be performed before considering further substantial changes to the framework.</p>

<div> Parliament, Investment, Growth, Financial Health, Retail Investors
Summary:
PIMFA's agenda supports government priorities for wealth creation and economic growth. Focus on retail investors, regulatory clarity, and UK as an investment destination. 
<br /><br /> <div>
<p><span>PIMFA, the trade association for wealth management, investment services and the personal investment and financial advice industry, has set out its&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.pimfa.co.uk%2Fshared-public%2Fcreating-a-uk-culture-of-thriving-financial-health-our-agenda-for-government%2F/2/01020190b7280dd5-a11bfae1-fa41-4381-8938-d06b1d0fd89e-000000/GvugHYV1U0l5-mJOqH6VWbj6S8k=382" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">agenda for government</a><span>&nbsp;over the course of this Parliament.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>PIMFA&rsquo;s agenda: &lsquo;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.pimfa.co.uk%2Fshared-public%2Fcreating-a-uk-culture-of-thriving-financial-health-our-agenda-for-government%2F/3/01020190b7280dd5-a11bfae1-fa41-4381-8938-d06b1d0fd89e-000000/1NSWzJmjVqUr2BDE6_JOjHXXoNk=382" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Creating a UK Culture of Thriving Financial Health</a><span>&rsquo; builds on and supports the policy priorities set out by this Labour government as it seeks to create wealth within the UK and ultimately deliver economic growth.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>Whilst PIMFA agrees that there is significant scope to drive investment and growth in partnership with the financial services sector, we believe that more focus should be given to the important role that retail investors will play in delivering this outcome. PIMFA believes that this can be done primarily by equipping retail investors with the tools and incentives necessary to save and invest for their financial futures.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>In doing this, PIMFA believes that we will create a culture of thriving financial health and promote long-term investments that benefit not only individuals but also the broader UK economy. This approach will, in turn, drive growth in productive assets and create a robust foundation for sustained economic prosperity.</span><br /><br /><span>To achieve this culture of thriving financial health, PIMFA believes the government and regulators should focus on three overarching aims:&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>- &nbsp; &nbsp;Giving consumers the tools and incentives to save and invest for their financial futures&nbsp;</span><br /><span>- &nbsp; &nbsp;Maintaining and growing the UK as a destination of choice for investors and investment</span><br /><span>- &nbsp; &nbsp;Providing regulatory and legislative clarity for firms to invest and grow</span><br /><span>&nbsp;</span><br /><strong>Liz Field, Chief Executive, PIMFA said:</strong><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;The start of a new Parliament earmarks a natural reset point for industries to consider how they align with government policy programs and identify where they can work with government to transform policy ambitions into positive tangible outcomes.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>&ldquo;As this government will look to utilise the financial services sector to drive growth, investment and wealth, I believe that there is significant scope at this crucial early stage for the government to look across the full spectrum of the financial services sector. This means looking to properly utilise the retail investment market, in addition to its traditional focus on capital provided by larger institutions.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span>&ldquo;The wealth management and financial planning industry provides access for UK individuals to take a real stake in the economy through their investments as well as safeguard their own financial health. This principle of ownership should be a key consideration for the government as it returns to its missions of wealth creation and growth. In setting out our agenda for government today, we aim to show how elements of these government missions can be delivered through harnessing a combination of change, and in some cases, stability.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span>&ldquo;We look forward to working closely with the new government and wish them every success in delivering upon their priorities for this sector across the term of this Parliament.&rdquo;</span></p>

<div> Blackout, ENTSO-E, Expert Panel, ACER, Investigation<br />
<br />
ENTSO-E and ACER are investigating a blackout in south-eastern Europe on 21 June 2024. An Expert Panel was convened to analyze the incident. <br /><br />Summary: ENTSO-E and ACER are investigating a blackout in south-eastern Europe on 21 June 2024. An Expert Panel was convened to analyze the incident. <div>
<p>Following a blackout in the south-eastern part of Continental Europe on 21 June, ENTSO-E has set up an Expert Panel and has invited ACER and relevant regulators in the region to join it. Today, ENTSO-E, ACER and the regulators in the region convened in the first meeting of this Expert Panel.</p>
<p>The investigation of the Expert Panel will be based on the data collected and analysed by ENTSO-E experts. The investigation of the Expert Panel will be finalised with a final report to be published on ENTSO-E website.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On 21 June 2024 at 12:24 CET, due to a major incident in the Continental Europe power system region, a large part of the transmission systems of Albania, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as Croatia suffered a voltage collapse followed by a total blackout in this area. The rest of the Continental Europe power system was not significantly affected by the incident. Furthermore, thanks to the coordinated efforts of the affected TSOs the voltage on the 400 kV grid was restored within a few hours.</p>
<p>ACER and ENTSO-E will continue to provide timely information about the incident.</p>

<title>UK Payments Systems Regulator And UK Financial Conduct Authority Launch Joint Call For Information On Big Tech And Digital Wallets</title>

<div> Regulator, Digital wallets, Benefits, Risks, Consumers<br />
Summary: Regulators seek views on benefits and risks of digital wallets for consumers and businesses, including impact on competition and potential issues. <div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>The Payments Systems Regulator (PSR) and Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)&nbsp;are seeking views on the benefits and risks digital wallets bring to people and businesses.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>The use of digital wallets has grown rapidly over the last few years, and it&rsquo;s likely that more than half of UK adults now use one. With Apple Pay, Google Pay and PayPal being three of the most widely used digital wallets in the UK today, digital wallets have become an increasingly important touchpoint between big tech firms and UK consumers.</p>
<p>The regulators are therefore keen to better understand the impact on consumers and businesses that digital wallets&rsquo; increasing popularity creates, including:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>the range of benefits that digital wallets bring for service users</li>
<li>whether there are any features that mean payments don&rsquo;t work as well as they could for consumers and/or businesses</li>
<li>their role in unlocking the potential of account-to-account payments and how they could impact competition between payment systems; and&nbsp;</li>
<li>whether digital wallets could raise any significant competition, consumer protection or market integrity issues, either now or in the future.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p><span>David Geale, the PSR&rsquo;s Managing Director said</span>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>'Digital wallets are steadily becoming a go-to payment type and while this presents exciting opportunities, there might be risks too.</p>
<p>'Collaboration between regulators and working with industry is crucial to ensure we&rsquo;re on the front foot to support innovation and competition, making sure everyone benefits from access, protection and choice in payments.</p>
<p>'We look forward to hearing views and evidence from a wide range of stakeholders throughout this process.'</p>
<p><span>Nikhil Rathi, the FCA&rsquo;s Chief Executive, said</span>:</p>
<p>'The UK is seeing a seismic shift in how people pay, as digital wallets become a part of everyday life for many people.</p>
<p>'We want to make sure we can maximise the opportunities and benefits for consumers and businesses while protecting against any risks this technology may present.'</p>
<p>The regulators will analyse all responses received and provide an update by&nbsp;<span>Q1 2025</span>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ol>
<li>This&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/calls-input/call-information-big-tech-and-digital-wallets" title="Call for Information: Big tech and digital wallets">publication</a>&nbsp;builds on the&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.psr.org.uk/publications/policy-statements/contactless-mobile-payments-our-report/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PSR&rsquo;s previous work<span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;on contactless mobile payments and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/feedback-statements/fs24-1-potential-competition-impacts-data-asymmetry-big-tech-firms-and-firms-financial-services" title="FS24/1 &ndash; Potential competition impacts from the data asymmetry between Big Tech firms and firms in financial services">FCA&rsquo;s work</a>&nbsp;on big tech activity in financial services.</li>
<li>The PSR is particularly interested in understanding how digital wallets impact consumers&rsquo; choice of payment options at checkout. It hopes to gain better understanding of the implications of digital wallets&rsquo; growing role in payments, and the implications for competition between payment systems including the PSR&rsquo;s strategic objective of unlocking the potential of account-to-account payments.</li>
<li>The FCA&rsquo;s regulatory remit gives it a particular interest in issues such as how digital wallets may impact competition in the supply of financial services and the operational resilience and systemic safety of the UK financial services sector.</li>
<li>There has been a significant amount of interest on this issue internationally, including by the European Commission and the US Department of Justice.</li>
<li>In the UK, the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers (DMCC) Bill was passed by Parliament on 23 May. The Bill introduces significant reforms to the UK&rsquo;s consumer, digital markets, and competition regimes. The CMA&rsquo;s Digital Markets Unit (DMU) will be granted powers to enforce a new regulatory regime for firms in digital markets that have 'strategic market status'. The issues we examine in this report may be relevant to the work of the CMA. We will continue to liaise closely with the CMA on this topic.&nbsp;</li>
<li>This call for information is open until 5pm on Friday 13 September. The regulators are interested in hearing from stakeholders across the payments and wider financial services landscape, including digital wallet and technology providers as well as their service users and other parties with an interest in digital wallets. The regulators will consider all feedback received and provide an update by Q1 2025.</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the premier post-trade market infrastructure for the global financial services industry, today issued a white paper, &ldquo;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://dtcc.com/ustclearing/treasury-clearing-mandate" target="_blank">The U.S. Treasury Clearing Mandate: An Industry Pulse Check</a></span>,&rdquo; to further enhance the industry&rsquo;s knowledge of the U.S. Securities &amp; Exchange Commission&rsquo;s (SEC) expanded clearing rules. The paper, which reports on findings from a recent industry survey conducted by DTCC&rsquo;s Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC) subsidiary, provides updated estimates on the volume of transactions required to be submitted for central clearing, the planned usage of FICC&rsquo;s various access models, and how margin and liquidity risk management resources may be impacted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;FICC stands at the center of a momentous transformation of market structure,&rdquo; said Brian Steele, DTCC Managing Director, President, Clearing &amp; Securities Services. &ldquo;FICC continues to regularly survey the industry in order to provide new estimates on the impact of the rule. This most recent survey demonstrates that the industry&rsquo;s level of understanding and preparedness for expanded clearing has significantly improved since we conducted our survey in 2023, as evidenced by further refinements to volume, liquidity and margin impacts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Specifically, new findings confirm:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Volumes:</span>&nbsp;Treasury clearing activity is expected to increase by more than $4TN each day, bringing the total activity to over $11.5TN in daily volume. 58% of respondents forecasted that the additional clearing activity will be driven by indirect participant Repo activity clearing.</li>
<li><span>Access Models:</span>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.dtcc.com/clearing-services/ficc-gov/sponsored-membership" target="_blank">FICC&rsquo;s Sponsored Service</a></span>&nbsp;continues to be the preferred access model for indirect participant activity (74% of respondents), however, survey respondents showed increased interest in the Agent Clearing Member (ACM) Service (43%). FICC expects to set up 7,000+ new intermediary-indirect participant relationships.</li>
<li><span>Done-Away Clearing:</span>&nbsp;FICC anticipates growing adoption of a done-away clearing model for indirect participants. 28% of respondents say they expect to facilitate Treasury clearing activity through a business area that offers done-away execution.</li>
<li><span>Margin:</span>&nbsp;Margin is expected to increase but is anticipated to be proportionate to the additional volume of activity. Treasury Repo and Buy/Sell activity estimates indicate an increase in aggregate margin (VaR) for the respondents&rsquo; portfolios of approximately $58.4BN, with approximately $27BN (or 46%) of the aggregate incremental VaR representing segregated indirect participant margin. The results underscore FICC&rsquo;s current efforts to provide margin efficiency through expanded end-user customer cross-margining opportunities.</li>
<li><span>Liquidity:</span>&nbsp;Survey results indicate a potential maximum daily liquidity need of US$84.5B, which would point to a total Capped Contingency Liquidity Facility (CCLF) size of US$109.9B under current parameters and the outlined assumptions. Since 2021, the CCLF facility has ranged between $71.0BN and $128.4BN. FICC will leverage these responses in its efforts to further diversify additional, cost-effective liquidity resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Providing updated and transparent information is critical in supporting firms as they get ready for expanded central clearing of Treasuries,&rdquo; said Laura Klimpel, Managing Director, Head of DTCC&rsquo;s Fixed Income and Financing Solutions. &ldquo;We remain committed to guiding and informing our members and the broader industry about the impact of the SEC&rsquo;s new requirements, to collaborating with market participants on continuously enhancing our offerings, and to supporting a smooth and orderly implementation.&rdquo;</p>

<title>ICE Gasoil Futures And Options At Record Open Interest With Record Q2 Trading Volumes In Gasoil Options - Performance Demonstrates Strength Of The Global Benchmark Post The EU’s Ban On Russian Diesel</title>

<div> Intercontinental Exchange, Inc., Low Sulphur Gasoil, open interest records, options activity, physically deliverable futures contract<br />
<br />
Summary: Intercontinental Exchange's Low Sulphur Gasoil markets hit open interest records, with options activity performing well and a physically deliverable futures contract. <div>
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE: ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today announced that its Low Sulphur Gasoil markets hit a series of open interest records through June 2024, reaching a high of 1.2 million across futures and options on July 1, 2024, equivalent to 120 million metric tons.</p>
<p>ICE Low Sulphur Gasoil sits at the center of middle distillates trading as the global benchmark for refined oil products. Gasoil futures and options open interest is up over 40% year-over-year (y/y), with trading volumes up 30% y/y.</p>
<p>Gasoil options activity has been performing particularly well, hitting record open interest of 234,570 contracts on July 3, while Gasoil options traded at record levels in Q2 2024 with 287,421 options traded. During Q2 2024, a record of approximately 16.2 million oil options contracts traded at ICE, including a record 13.5 million Brent options contracts. Customers can benefit from margin offsets as high as 98% when clearing ICE Gasoil alongside other oil positions at ICE.</p>
<p>ICE Gasoil is a physically deliverable futures contract for what is now ultra-low sulphur diesel. An average of over 100,000 tons has entered the delivery process each month since the start of 2024, demonstrating the success of the benchmark following ICE&rsquo;s changes to the methodology of the Gasoil contract to align it with sanctions preventing the delivery or export of Russian oil in the European Union which took effect from February 2023.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than 18 months on from ICE&rsquo;s first successful delivery of Russian-free barrels of gasoil, the contract continues as the most liquid distillate benchmark,&rdquo; said Jeff Barbuto, Global Head of Oil Markets at ICE. &ldquo;For 43 years, ICE&rsquo;s gasoil market has allowed customers to confidently participate in the physical delivery and trade of gasoil globally, and the record trading activity is a testament to the continued value participants find in the contract.&rdquo;</p>
<p>ICE Low Sulphur Gasoil forms part of ICE&rsquo;s global crude and refined product complex which includes Brent crude, the price barometer for three quarters of the world&rsquo;s internationally traded crude oil, alongside ICE Midland WTI (HOU), ICE WTI (Cushing), ICE Dubai (Platts), ICE Murban, as well as NY Harbor RBOB Gasoline and Heating Oil. These benchmarks are supported by over 800 related oil products, giving participants the ability to manage the price points of products at the point of consumption or production around the world. Open interest in ICE&rsquo;s global oil complex is up over 20% at 14 million contracts.</p>

<p>ACER recommends further improvements in ENTSOG&rsquo;s guidance documents, including to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Revise the Infrastructure Gaps Identification (IGI) methodology by taking into account current uncertainties in hydrogen system development and align the methodology with ENTSO-E&rsquo;s approach, specifying infrastructure needs in terms of required capacities per border.</li>
<li>Improve clarity on the use of assumptions throughout different stages of the TYNDP process.</li>
<li>Use more realistic infrastructure levels in line with expected developments in natural gas and hydrogen infrastructure.</li>
<li>Enhance stakeholder engagement by collaborating with industry stakeholders to develop joint methodologies for defining relevant assumptions and parameters.</li>
<li>Define and consult on a methodology to introduce a sensitivity analysis on the costs of hydrogen disruption, which significantly affect the benefits of infrastructure projects.</li>
<li>Limit the security of supply assessment outlined in Annex D3 of the draft TYNDP to natural gas infrastructures only.</li>

<div> anniversary, FIX Trading Community, electronic trading, innovation, global financial markets
Summary:<br />FIX Trading Community celebrates 30th anniversary, driving electronic trading innovation, transforming global financial markets, setting new standards for efficiency and transparency. <div>
<p>The FIX Trading Community (&lsquo;FIX&rsquo;), the non-profit, industry-driven standards body at the heart of global financial trading, proudly celebrates its 30th anniversary. Over the past three decades, FIX has been at the forefront of electronic trading innovation, transforming the landscape of global financial markets and setting new standards for efficiency, transparency, and accessibility.</p>
<p>Thirty years ago, the financial world relied on the telephone and manual processes to execute trades. Recognising the need for a more efficient and reliable system, Bob Lamoureux and Jacques Perold (Fidelity Investments), and Chris Morstatt and Jim Leman (Salomon Brothers) developed the Financial Information eXchange (FIX) protocol. Enabling electronic communication of equity trading data, FIX quickly became the industry standard.</p>
<h4><b>A Journey of Innovation and Growth</b></h4>
<p>From its inception, FIX has continually evolved to meet the changing needs of the financial industry. The first public version, FIX 2.7, was released in 1994, laying the foundation for the future of electronic trading. As the protocol advanced through numerous iterations, it introduced and expanded critical features such as advanced order handling, indications of interest (IOIs), and trade advertisements.</p>
<p>By the late 1990s, FIX had expanded to support Straight-Through Processing (STP), eliminating manual intervention in many post-trade processes. This era also saw the introduction of support for derivatives, fixed income and foreign exchange (FX) markets. Today, FIX is the de facto messaging standard for pre-trade and trade communication in global markets and continues to expand into the post-trade space and new asset classes.</p>
<h4><b>Transforming Modern Finance</b></h4>
<p>FIX's impact on the financial industry is profound. The protocol has driven exponential growth in trading volumes, enabling markets to become more liquid and efficient. It has democratised global market access, allowing participants from around the world to connect and trade seamlessly.</p>
<p>The evolution of FIX standards has supported the development and adoption of sophisticated trading styles and strategies, including algorithmic and high-frequency trading. These innovations have transformed modern trading, making it more dynamic, responsive, and efficient. Alongside this, FIX's commitment to enhancing post-trade processes has helped to enable faster clearing and settlement times, reducing errors and accelerating workflow.</p>
<h4><b>Empowering the Market</b></h4>
<p>FIX has facilitated more effective risk management and hedging. Traders can now better assess and manage their risk exposures, ensuring more stable and predictable outcomes. The protocol has also contributed to greater market transparency, improving market integrity and boosting investor confidence. The efficiencies brought about by FIX have led to lower trading costs, including reduced commissions and tighter spreads.</p>
<h4><b>Rich History, Bright Future</b></h4>
<p>As we celebrate this momentous milestone, we reflect on the incredible journey of the FIX Trading Community and its pivotal role in shaping the future of electronic trading. We look forward to continuing our mission of fostering innovation, collaboration, and excellence in global financial markets for many years to come.</p>

ANNA wins 'Best Reference Data Provider' at Waters Rankings 2024 for its ASB providing global identifier data and expanding coverage. Also issuing ISO standard identifiers for digital assets. <div>
<p><span>We are delighted to announce that the Association of National Numbering Agencies (ANNA) has won &lsquo;Best Reference Data Provider&rsquo; at the Waters Rankings 2024.&nbsp;<br /></span></p>
<p><span>These rankings recognise the initiatives, innovation and achievements of the industry's technology and data providers over the past 12 months. The Waters Rankings are a true reflection of the industry's best-in-class service providers, voted on by thousands of end-users across the buy and sell side.<br /></span></p>
<p><span>ANNA was awarded &lsquo;Best Reference Data Provider&rsquo; for the ANNA Service Bureau (ASB). The ASB is the provider of the most complete and current collection of identifier data available globally. Data is collected from over 120 individual National Numbering Agencies (NNAs) responsible for issuing the ISIN and other identifiers, for over 200 jurisdictions. ANNA and the ASB then provide this data to NNAs and financial institutions worldwide to support market transparency and the detection of systemic risk.<br /></span></p>
<p><span>Over the next 12 months, the number of contributing jurisdictions will expand and coverage is expected to increase from the current 112 million ISIN records. What&rsquo;s more, since November 2023, ANNA started issuing ISO standard identifiers for digital assets - the XT ISIN.&nbsp;<br /></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Stephan Dreyer, Managing Director for ANNA, said:&nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;We are very pleased to receive this award for the ASB. ISO standards have become a common language for financial transactions and processing around the world, but the need for evolution is constant. Whether it's regulation or new innovative assets that require clear guidelines to cater for challenges around allocation, it's a great honour to be recognised for ANNAs dedication to the development of identifier standards that support market transparency and efficiency worldwide.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>

<title>SGX Regulator’s Column: Potential Scenarios When General Offers Lead To Loss Of Public Float</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> SGX Listing Rules, Delisting, General Offer, Public Float, IFA <br />
Summary: SGX rules require 75% shareholder approval and fair offer for delisting. General offers must maintain public float or face suspension. <div>
<p><span>General Principle Applicable to Delistings&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The SGX Listing Rules provides for certain requirements to safeguard the interests of shareholders in the event of a delisting of an issuer. Under the SGX Listing Rules, Singapore Exchange Regulation (&ldquo;<span>SGX RegCo</span>&rdquo;) may agree to an application by an issuer to delist if:&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>the issuer convenes a general meeting to obtain shareholders&rsquo; approval for the delisting, and the resolution has been approved by at least 75% of the total number of issued shares held by independent shareholders<a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/#_ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;present and voting (&ldquo;<span>75% Independent Approval</span>&rdquo;); and</li>
<li>the independent financial adviser (&ldquo;<span>IFA</span>&rdquo;) has opined that the exit offer<a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/#_ftn2">[2]</a>&nbsp;offered to shareholders is fair and reasonable (&ldquo;<span>Fair &amp; Reasonable Offer</span>&rdquo;),&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>collectively, the &ldquo;<span>Voluntary Delisting Requirements</span>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>An offeror seeking to privatise an issuer may also elect to utilise other mechanisms, such as a general offer under the Singapore Code on Take-overs and Mergers (&ldquo;<span>General Offer</span>&rdquo;) (&ldquo;<span>Take-over Code</span>&rdquo;). Where an offeror has made a General Offer with the intention to privatise the issuer, unless it is exercising its right of compulsory acquisition, SGX RegCo will require that the Voluntary Delisting Requirements have, in principle, be adhered to before it will allow the issuer to be delisted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this regard, as stated in an earlier&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/media-centre/20190711-regulators-column-privatisations-through-general-offers">Regulator&rsquo;s Column: Privatisations through General Offers</a>, SGX RegCo will consider that the requirement for 75% Independent Approval is satisfied where,&nbsp;as at the close of the General Offer, the offeror has received acceptances from independent shareholders that represent at least 75% of the total number of issued shares held by independent shareholders (&ldquo;<span>75% Independent Acceptances</span>&rdquo;). The requirement for a Fair &amp; Reasonable Offer will be satisfied if the IFA has opined that the General Offer is fair and reasonable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The requirements for 75% Independent Acceptances and a fair and reasonable General Offer are conjunctive requirements for shareholder protection. A General Offer that sets a fair and reasonable price may nonetheless not receive the requisite shareholder acceptance; conversely, even if the General Offer finds favour with a substantial majority of shareholders, a fair and reasonable price is still necessary to take out the remainder of the shareholders who do not accept the General Offer.</p>
<p><span>Potential Scenarios When General Offers Lead to Loss of Public Float</span></p>
<p>The listing status of an issuer is defined by the tradability of its shares. When an offeror seeks to privatise an issuer, it seeks to remove its listing status &ndash; the result of which is that shareholders will no longer be able to trade the shares on the exchange.</p>
<p>Under the SGX Listing Rules, to ensure an orderly market, issuers must maintain a free float where at least 10% of the shares are held in public hands (&ldquo;<span>public float</span>&rdquo;). The purpose of this requirement is to provide an orderly secondary market in the securities during trading and to prevent a situation where the shares can be manipulated or cornered.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>SGX RegCo notes queries by shareholders and media commentary in respect of the applicability of the Voluntary Delisting Requirements to recent General Offers, particularly where the issuer has lost its public float pursuant to the General Offer. Should the issuer lose its public float pursuant to the General Offer, SGX RegCo may suspend the trading of the issuer&rsquo;s securities as at close of the General Offer. Thereafter, the scenarios that may occur will differ depending on whether the IFA has opined that the General Offer is fair and reasonable and whether the offeror has received 75% Independent Acceptances.</p>
<p>SGX RegCo wishes to highlight that, where any of the Voluntary Delisting Requirements have not, in principle, been satisfied, the offeror may also explore other options for privatisation, for example, an exit offer that complies with the SGX Listing Rules. However, it should be noted that, under the Take-over Code, the offeror may not make another offer on terms better than those made available under the previous General Offer until six months from the closure of the previous General Offer</p>
<p><img alt="SGX_Reg_Column_15Jul24" src="https://mondovisione.com/_assets/images/SGX_Reg_Column_15Jul24.jpg" title="SGX_Reg_Column_15Jul24" /></p>
<p> </p>
<div class="widget-media-caption-container"><span class="widget-media-caption text-caption">Potential scenarios where the issuer has lost its public float pursuant to a General Offer&nbsp;</span></div>
<p>
<p>SGX RegCo will not permit trading in an issuer&rsquo;s securities to be suspended for a prolonged period. Should the issuer (and the controlling shareholder, where applicable) fail to comply with the requirements in the Listing Rules, including the requirement to restore free float, SGX RegCo may utilise the range of enforcement powers available to it under the Listing Rules.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tan Boon Gin</p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer</p>
<p>SGX RegCo</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/#_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;Excluding the shares held by the offeror and parties acting in concert with it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/#_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;The exit offer must include a cash alternative as the default alternative.</p>

<div> SEC, Energy Absolute, Thailand, fraud, SET ESG Ratings
Summary: 
Energy Absolute removed from SET ESG Ratings due to fraud allegations against its directors and executives by SEC and referral to AMLO. <div>
<p>The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) removes Energy Absolute pcl (EA) from the current SET ESG Ratings list, effective July 15, 2024. This decision follows the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)&rsquo;s allegations against EA's directors and executives to the Department of Special Investigation (DSI) and subsequent referral to the Anti-Money Laundering Office (AMLO) in connection with fraud cases.</p>
<p>The SEC has filed a criminal complaint against Somphote Ahunai and Amorn Sapthaweekul, EA&rsquo;s directors and executives, along with Phornlert Techarattanopas, with the DSI for allegedly engaging in fraudulent activities to seek undue benefits for themselves and/or others. The case has also been forwarded to the AMLO. Consequently, <b>SET, through the Sustainable Investment (SET ESG Ratings) Committee, has decided to remove EA from the current SET ESG Ratings list.</b> <b>The decision was made because the company no longer meets the SET ESG Ratings qualification criteria</b>, which stipulate that &ldquo;either the company or its directors or executives must not be accused or found guilty by authorities or relevant agencies in matters related to corporate governance, social impact, or environmental impact.&rdquo;</p>

<div> EBA, EIOPA, ESMA, MiCA, crypto-assets<br />
<br />
The ESAs published guidelines for the classification of crypto-assets under MiCA, including a standardized test and templates for explanations and legal opinions.<br />
Comments on the consultation paper can be submitted by October 12, 2024. The ESAs will hold a virtual public hearing on September 23, 2024. MiCA regulates the issuance, offering, and trading of EMTs, ARTs, and other crypto-assets. The ESAs were mandated to develop guidelines for MiCA. <br />Summary: The ESAs published guidelines for the classification of crypto-assets under MiCA, along with a standardized test and templates for explanations and legal opinions. Comments on the consultation paper are open until October 12, 2024, and a virtual public hearing will be held on September 23, 2024. MiCA regulates the issuance, offering, and trading of EMTs, ARTs, and other crypto-assets, with a joint mandate for the ESAs to develop guidelines. <div>
<p>The three European Supervisory Authorities (EBA, EIOPA and ESMA &ndash; the ESAs) today published a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-07/ESA_2024_12_Consultation_Paper_Art_97_MiCA_Guidelines.pdf">consultation paper</a>&nbsp;on Guidelines under Markets in Crypto-assets Regulation (MiCA), establishing templates for explanations and legal opinions regarding the classification of crypto-assets along with a standardised test to foster a common approach to classification.</p>
<div class="dombanner"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify">To support market participants and supervisors in adopting a convergent approach to the classification of crypto-assets, the Guidelines propose a standardised test, as well as templates for explanations and legal opinions that provide descriptions of the regulatory classification of crypto-assets in the following cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Asset-referenced tokens&nbsp;(ARTs): The white paper for the issuance of ARTs, which contains comprehensive information about the crypto asset, must be accompanied by a legal opinion that explains the classification of the crypto asset &ndash; in particular, the fact it is not an EMT nor a crypto-asset that could be considered excluded from the scope of MiCA</li>
<li>Crypto-assets that are not ARTs or EMTs under MiCA: The white paper for the crypto-asset must be accompanied by an explanation of the classification of the crypto asset &ndash; in particular, the fact it is not an EMT, ART or crypto-asset excluded from the scope of MiCA.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<h4><span>Next Steps</span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify">Comments to the consultation paper&nbsp;can be sent&nbsp;by clicking on the "send your comments" button on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/events/consultation-guidelines-templates-explanations-and-opinions-and-standardised-test-classification"><span>consultation page</span></a>.&nbsp;The&nbsp;deadline for the submission of comments&nbsp;is&nbsp;<span>12 October 2024</span>.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">The ESAs will hold a&nbsp;<span>virtual public hearing</span>&nbsp;on the consultation paper on Monday, 23 September 2024<span>&nbsp;from 10:00 to&nbsp;12:00&nbsp;CEST</span>&nbsp;and invite interested stakeholders to register using this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/public-hearing-draft-joint-esa-guidelines-article-971-micar"><span>link</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span>by&nbsp;<span>19 September 2024 at 16:00 CEST</span>. The dial-in details&nbsp;will be communicated in due course&nbsp;to those who have registered for the meeting<a>.</a></p>
<p class="text-align-justify">All contributions received&nbsp;will be published&nbsp;following the end of the consultation, unless requested otherwise.</p>
<h4><span>Background</span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify">MiCA establishes regimes for regulating the issuance, offering to the public, and admission to trading of electronic money tokens (EMTs), asset-referenced tokens (ARTs), and other crypto-assets. The Regulation also establishes a framework for crypto-asset service provision and a joint mandate for the ESAs to develop the guidelines for application. These draft Guidelines are the only joint-ESA policy mandate under MiCA.</p>

<div> distressed, underserved, nonmetropolitan, CRA, geographies
Summary:<br />Federal bank agencies released 2024 list of distressed or underserved nonmetropolitan middle-income geographies for CRA consideration based on local economic conditions. Revitalization activities eligible for 12 months after publication. <div>
<p>Federal bank regulatory agencies today released the 2024 list of distressed or underserved nonmetropolitan middle-income geographies where certain bank activities are eligible for Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) credit.</p>
<p>Under the CRA, the agencies assess a bank's record of meeting the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound operations. The list released by the agencies includes distressed or underserved nonmetropolitan middle-income geographies where revitalization or stabilization activities are eligible to receive CRA consideration. The designations reflect local economic conditions, including unemployment, poverty, and population changes. Previous years' lists and criteria for designating these areas are available&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ffiec.gov/cra/distressed.htm">here</a>.</p>
<p>Revitalization or stabilization activities in these geographies are eligible to receive CRA consideration under the community development definition for 12 months after publication of the current list. As with past lists, the agencies apply a one-year lag period for geographies that were included in 2023 but are no longer designated as distressed or underserved in the current list.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Survey, SFC, Asset management, Wealth management, Hong Kong <br />
Summary: <br />
- Hong Kong maintains its position as a leading asset and wealth management hub <br />
- 54-56% of AUM from investors outside Mainland China and Hong Kong <br />
- 60% of assets managed in Hong Kong allocated to overseas markets <br />
- 2% year-on-year growth in overall AUM in 2023 <br />
- Number of Type 9 licensed firms increased by 12% to 2,161 as of June 2024 <br />
- Net fund inflows surged 342% in 2023 <br />
- Hong Kong-domiciled funds saw net fund inflows of $33 billion in the first quarter of 2024 <br />
- AUM of Mainland-related firms grew 4% to $2,676 billion <br />
- Number of registered OFCs more than doubled from 2022 <br /> <div>
<div class="newsc">
<p>The key benchmarking metrics in an annual survey by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) reaffirmed Hong Kong&rsquo;s position as a premier asset and wealth management hub with a highly-diversified investor base, globalised asset allocation and robust fund inflows.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the SFC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sfc.hk/-/media/EN/files/COM/Reports-and-surveys/AWMAS-2023_E.pdf?rev=5549c0965c604a2ba01e6014cf9731a7&amp;hash=574309F73EA20486078C0BA023F7CE47" target="_blank">Asset and Wealth Management Activities Survey 2023</a>&nbsp;published today (Notes 1 and 2), investors outside Mainland China and Hong Kong have consistently accounted for 54-56% of total asset under management (AUM) in the past five years, while 60% of the assets managed in Hong Kong are allocated to overseas markets. Over the past three years, the city also saw the number of Type 9 licensed firms (ie, asset management) increase steadily by 12% to 2,161 as of June 2024.</p>
<p>Overall AUM grew 2% year-on-year in 2023, while net fund inflows surged 342% (Note 3). In addition, Hong Kong-domiciled funds authorised by the SFC also showed strength. They continued to see net fund inflows of $33 billion (US$4.2 billion) in the first quarter of 2024 after rebounding by a robust 93% to $87 billion (US$11.1 billion) last year. Their AUM also further increased 3% for the first quarter after growing 5% in 2023 (Note 4).</p>
<p>&ldquo;The survey&rsquo;s findings underscored the enduring strengths of Hong Kong&rsquo;s asset and wealth management industry, particularly the market&rsquo;s growing breadth and depth, as well as its resilience in the face of unprecedented challenges and macro headwinds,&rdquo; said Ms Christina Choi, the SFC&rsquo;s Executive Director of Investment Products. &ldquo;These unique advantages would place Hong Kong in an enviable position to forge closer connectivity with Mainland, regional and global markets, thus further consolidating its status as an international financial centre.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other highlights of the report include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mainland-related firms continued to expand their footprint in the city, as the AUM of their asset and wealth management business grew 4% to $2,676 billion (US$343 billion), outperforming the industry average for another year. Their net fund inflows increased 16% to $153 billion (US$20 billion).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The strong growth momentum for open-ended fund companies (OFCs) persisted, as the number of registered OFCs more than doubled (up 118%) from 2022, showing asset managers continued to take advantage of the corporate fund structure in Hong Kong and the associated government grants.</li>
</ul>
<p>More details can be found in the Appendix of this press release.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Asset and wealth management business comprises asset management, fund advisory, private banking and private wealth management, SFC-authorised real estate investment trusts and assets held under trusts. Highlights of the survey are included in the Appendix of this press release.</li>
<li>This year, 1,192 firms took part in the SFC&rsquo;s annual Asset and Wealth Management Activities Survey, including SFC-licensed corporations engaging in asset management and fund advisory business, banks engaging in asset management, private banking and private wealth management business, and non-SFC licensed insurance companies registered under the Insurance Ordinance and trustees.</li>
<li>Unless stated otherwise, values given are in Hong Kong dollars and all comparisons are made on a year-on-year basis (ie, 2023 over 2022). Amounts shown in US dollars were converted at the prevailing exchange rate.</li>
<li>The number of Hong Kong-domiciled SFC-authorised funds increased to 914 in 2023 and further increased to 926 at the end of the first quarter of 2024.</li>

<div> cooperation, securities crimes, enforcement, collaboration, investors<br />
Summary:<br />
The SFC and CSRC discussed strengthening collaboration to tackle securities crimes, protect investors, and enhance enforcement through sharing priorities and technologies. <br /> <div>
<p>The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) recently held their 16<span>th</span>&nbsp;regular high-level meeting on enforcement cooperation. The focal point of the meeting in Kunming, Yunnan Province, was initiatives to strengthen collaboration.</p>
<p>The two regulatory agencies conducted in-depth discussions on bolstering enforcement cooperation in order to tackle cross-boundary securities crimes and misconduct more effectively, protect the interests of investors in Hong Kong and the Mainland, and reinforce Hong Kong&rsquo;s status as an international financial centre.</p>
<p>During the meeting, the two sides updated each other on their enforcement priorities, trends and progress, as well as the successful outcomes of their enforcement cooperation. Both parties also had productive dialogues on several key issues related to cross-boundary enforcement cooperation, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>exploring ways to strengthen cross-boundary enforcement cooperation against securities crimes and misconduct, with a view to achieving higher efficiency and comprehensive outcomes;</li>
<li>sharing the process for handling cases involving suspicious transactions and discussing the mechanism for referral of intelligence;</li>
<li>discussing the latest trends in ramp-and-dump market manipulation activities; and</li>
<li>sharing insights into the effective use of advanced technologies to enhance enforcement outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr Christopher Wilson, the SFC&rsquo;s Executive Director of Enforcement, stressed the significance of Hong Kong as an international financial hub in connecting the Mainland and global capital markets. As such, it is imperative for Hong Kong to protect investors&rsquo; interests and safeguard market reputation to maintain its status as an international financial centre. That being the case, Mr Wilson reiterated the importance of strengthening enforcement cooperation with the CSRC as closer collaboration will facilitate both agencies&rsquo; capabilities in combatting securities crimes and misconduct and enhance the effectiveness and deterrence of enforcement actions.</p>

Members of the public can watch the live meeting via webcast on www.sec.gov.</p>
<p>The Committee, which provides advice and recommendations to the Commission on rules, regulations, and policy matters relating to small businesses, will start the meeting by hearing Committee member observations on the state of small business capital raising. The Committee will also discuss recent changes to the SBIC program designed to increase access and diversify funding for small businesses, start-ups, and fund managers.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-84?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery" target="_blank">SBICs</a>&nbsp;are privately-owned and operated investment funds that make investments in U.S. small businesses and are licensed by the SBA. SBICs may obtain access to SBA-guaranteed loans to match privately raised capital, which increases the amount of capital these funds can invest in American small businesses.</p>
<p>To facilitate the discussion, members will hear from an SBIC fund and a practitioner who will, among other things: provide an overview of the SBIC program and recent changes, including the introduction of a new type of SBA-guaranteed loan to private funds; address the regulatory framework governing SBICs; and share their views on successes and challenges to date. The discussion will commence with remarks by Committee member&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sba.gov/person/bailey-g-devries" target="_blank">Bailey DeVries</a>, who leads the SBIC program in her role as the SBA&rsquo;s Associate Administrator and Head of Office of Investment and Innovation.</p>

<div> NGX Group, digital platform, primary market transactions, CBN Banking Recapitalisation, regulatory support<br />
<br />Summary: 
NGX Group launches NGX Invest, a digital platform for primary market transactions with regulatory support and potential for market transformation. <div>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap"><span>Nigerian Exchange Group (NGX Group) has unveiled NGX Invest, a groundbreaking digital platform designed to streamline Public Offerings and Rights Issues in the Nigerian capital market. The platform, which has received approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), is now live, promising an efficient, convenient, and seamless experience for managing primary market transactions.</span></p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap"><span>NGX Invest represents a significant leap forward in improving stakeholder experience within Nigeria's capital market. Building on the success of the country's first digital public offering in 2021 - which attracted over 150,000 new retail investors, 75% of whom were female and 85% under the age of 40 - NGX Invest enhances transparency and accessibility in primary market transactions.</span></p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap"><span>The launch of NGX Invest comes at a crucial time, coinciding with the Central Bank of Nigeria's (CBN) Banking Recapitalisation directive, which has prompted numerous offers for subscription and rights announcements by Nigerian banks. Both the CBN and SEC have provided robust regulatory support for this initiative. Investors can now access the platform at&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://invest.ngxgroup.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>&nbsp;</span></a><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://invest.ngxgroup.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://invest.ngxgroup.com</a><span>. Access Holdings Plc, FCMB Group and Fidelity Bank Plc are already utilizing the NGX Invest APIs to distribute their offerings to retail investors. More banks are in the process of onboarding to leverage this platform.</span></p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap"><span>Dr. Emomotimi Agama,&nbsp;Director-General of the Securities and Exchange Commission, commended the initiative, stating, "The e-Offering Platform&nbsp;aligns perfectly with our objective of futureproofing the Nigerian capital market. By digitalising and automating financial intermediation processes, we are fostering a more efficient, transparent, and inclusive capital market. At the Commission, our focus is on creating an enabling regulatory environment that promotes innovation without compromising compliance and investor protection. I commend NGX Group for its strategic investment in advancing our capital markets&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap"><span>Alhaji (Dr) Umaru Kwairanga, Group Chairman of NGX Group, commended the regulators, stating, "The supportive regulatory environment has provided a solid foundation that enabled the swift delivery of the platform. This reflects our mutual commitment to market development and will undoubtedly contribute to boosting the participation of retail investors in the capital market.&nbsp; As we strive for the market to play a larger role in Nigeria&rsquo;s economic development, the integration of technology, strong partnerships, and collaboration, alongside a positive policy environment, will be essential".</span></p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap"><span>Temi Popoola, Group Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of Nigerian Exchange Group (NGX Group), expressed enthusiasm for the new platform noting its significance in NGX Group&rsquo;s digital transformation journey and ability to enhance market access and foster economic growth. &ldquo;We sincerely appreciate SEC and CBN for their strong support and leadership. Our intermediaries and partners, including the Central Securities Clearing System (CSCS), have been instrumental in achieving this success. This platform demonstrates our commitment to innovation and strengthening Nigeria's capital markets, particularly as we support the banking sector's recapitalisation efforts&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap"><span>Popoola emphasised that NGX Invest is designed to significantly enhance the efficiency of public offering subscriptions and rights issue processes, streamlining operational workflows to better support issuers' capital-raising efforts.</span></p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap"><span>Jude Chiemeka, CEO of NGX, underscored the platform's transformative potential: "NGX Invest addresses the demand for a more efficient and transparent process in managing public offers and rights issues. It will expedite reconciliation and allotment processes, reduce unclaimed dividends, and boost investor confidence. All stakeholders - including investors, registrars, issuing houses, brokers, banks, and regulators - stand to benefit significantly from this innovation."</span></p>

<title>New York Department Of Financial Services Superintendent Harris Adopts Insurance Guidance To Combat Discrimination In Artificial Intelligence - Establishes Principles To Protect Consumers When Insurers Use Artificial Intelligence In Underwriting And Pricing</title>

<div> DFS, Superintendent Harris, guidance, artificial intelligence, insurance
Summary:
DFS Superintendent Harris issued guidance for insurers using AI, emphasizing fairness, validity, oversight, and transparency. Governor Hochul supports innovation. 
<br /><br /> <div>
<p>Today, Department of Financial Services (&ldquo;DFS&rdquo;) Superintendent Adrienne A. Harris adopted guidance to protect consumers from unfair or unlawful discrimination by insurers using artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>"New York has a strong track record of supporting responsible innovation while protecting consumers from financial harm,&rdquo;&nbsp;<span>said Superintendent Harris.&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s guidance builds on that legacy, ensuring that the implementation of AI in insurance does not perpetuate or amplify systemic biases that have resulted in unlawful or unfair discrimination, while safeguarding the stability of the marketplace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The use of external consumer data and information sources (&ldquo;ECDIS&rdquo;) and artificial intelligence systems (&ldquo;AIS&rdquo;) can benefit insurers and consumers by simplifying and expediting insurance underwriting and pricing processes, however, it is critical that insurers who utilize such technologies establish a proper governance and risk management framework to mitigate the potential harm to consumers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The guidance outlines DFS&rsquo;s expectations for how all insurers authorized to write insurance in New York State develop and manage the integration of ECDIS, AIS, and other predictive models. Pursuant to DFS&rsquo;s guidance, insurers are expected to:</p>
<ul>
<li>analyze ECDIS and AIS for unfair and unlawful discrimination, as defined in state and federal laws;</li>
<li>demonstrate the actuarial validity of ECDIS and AIS;</li>
<li>maintain a corporate governance framework that provides appropriate oversight of the insurer&rsquo;s overall outcome of the use of ECDIS and AIS; and&nbsp;</li>
<li>maintain appropriate transparency, risk management, and internal controls, including over third-party vendors and consumer disclosures.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DFS has finalized the guidance with careful consideration of the valuable feedback received from regulated entities and other key stakeholders, including trade associations, advisory firms, universities, and the broader public.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s announcement builds upon Governor Hochul&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a class="external" href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-unveils-fifth-proposal-2024-state-state-empire-ai-consortium-make-new-york" target="_blank">first-ever statewide policy</a>&nbsp;governing AI and commitment to making New York a leader in cutting-edge technology development and use.</p>

<title>Ontario Securities Commission Seeks Feedback On Proposed Process For Distributing Disgorged Funds To Harmed Investors</title>

<div> proposal, disgorgement, investors, distribution, OSC <br />
<br />Summary: <br /> The Ontario Securities Commission has proposed a new process for distributing disgorged funds to harmed investors, in line with recent legislative amendments. <div>
<p>The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) today published for comment a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/node/503431">rule proposal</a>&nbsp;that would establish a new process for returning money to harmed investors.</p>
<p>The proposed process would apply when disgorgement is ordered in an enforcement proceeding before the Capital Markets Tribunal or the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, and the OSC receives sufficient funds to make a distribution feasible.</p>
<p>The OSC is publishing the rule proposal to address recent legislative amendments to the Ontario<em>&nbsp;Securities Act</em>, the&nbsp;<em>Commodity Futures Act</em>, and the&nbsp;<em>Securities Commission Act, 2021</em>. Upon proclamation, the legislative amendments will create a statutory framework for the distribution of money received by the OSC under disgorgement orders.</p>
<p>The rule proposal outlines:</p>
<ul>
<li>the circumstances in which money received under disgorgement orders is required to be distributed;</li>
<li>the eligibility requirements for investors seeking a payment;</li>
<li>the process for distributing disgorged amounts in cases where a court-appointed administrator is not used; and</li>
<li>the use of other monetary sanctions and settlement payments to pay certain administrative costs in relation to the distribution of disgorged amounts.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Disgorgement is a type of monetary sanction imposed by the Capital Markets Tribunal or the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. Disgorgement sanctions require the respondent in a proceeding to pay any amounts they have obtained as a result of their non-compliance with securities law or commodity futures law. There is currently no prescribed process for making distributions to harmed investors from funds disgorged to the OSC.</p>
<p>While disgorgement orders are not imposed to compensate investors, the legislative amendments contemplate that, in circumstances established under the proposed rule, amounts received under these orders could be distributed to investors who incurred direct financial losses as a result of the conduct giving rise to the order.</p>
<p>Under the proposed rule, the OSC would be required to publish a report on each completed distribution to promote transparency and awareness about the distribution process.</p>
<p>The OSC will also develop plain-language resources to help investors understand the new statutory distribution framework and the payment application process.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.osc.ca/en/securities-law/instruments-rules-policies/1/11-502/proposed-osc-rule-11-502-distribution-amounts-paid-osc-under-disgorgement-orders-proposed">Proposed OSC Rule 11-502&nbsp;<em>Distribution of Amounts Paid to the OSC under Disgorgement Orders,&nbsp;</em>Proposed OSC Rule 11-503&nbsp;<em>(Commodity Futures Act) Distribution of Amounts Paid to the OSC under Disgorgement Orders&nbsp;</em>and their companion policies</a><span>&nbsp;</span>are available on the OSC&rsquo;s website.</p>
<p>Please submit comments in writing on or before October 9, 2024.</p>
<p>The mandate of the OSC is to provide protection to investors from unfair, improper or fraudulent practices, to foster fair, efficient and competitive capital markets and confidence in the capital markets, to foster capital formation, and to contribute to the stability of the financial system and the reduction of systemic risk. Investors are urged to check the registration of any persons or companies offering an investment opportunity and to review the OSC investor materials available at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/">https://www.osc.ca</a>.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Securities Commission, business conduct, derivatives market, B.C., National Instrument<br />
Summary: B.C. Securities Commission adopts business conduct rules for derivatives market, aligning with international standards and addressing specific provincial differences. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>The B.C. Securities Commission&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bcsc.bc.ca/securities-law/law-and-policy/bc-notices/current/bcn-202402-july-11-2024">today published</a>&nbsp;advanced notice of adoption of a comprehensive regime for regulating the business conduct of dealers and advisers in the over-the-counter derivatives market, including a number of provisions that are specific to B.C.</p>
<p>If approved by B.C.&rsquo;s Minister of Finance, National Instrument 93-101&nbsp;<em>Derivatives: Business Conduct</em>&nbsp;comes into force on September 28, 2024, and B.C. will join other Canadian securities regulators who published advanced notice of adoption in September 2023. With B.C.&rsquo;s adoption of the Instrument and its related Companion Policy, the rule will become a National Instrument.</p>
<p>The instrument to be adopted by B.C. includes several provisions that were necessary due to differences between B.C.&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Securities Act</em>&rsquo;s and securities legislation in other provinces.</p>
<p>For derivatives dealers and advisers, the framework establishes fundamental obligations that are aligned with international standards and include requirements related to fair dealing, conflicts of interest, suitability, reporting non-compliance, and record-keeping. The business conduct rule is intended to help protect market participants by improving transparency, increasing accountability, and promoting responsible business conduct in the derivatives market.</p>
<p>The business conduct rule was developed over an extensive three-stage consultation process that included a public roundtable to consider various regulatory, implementation, and compliance matters. In response to comments received during the most recent consultation, the final rule was streamlined to address potential negative impacts on derivatives market liquidity and to reduce implementation burden by better enabling firms to leverage their existing compliance systems.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<ol>
<li>In May, the FCA&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/finfluencers-charged-promoting-unauthorised-trading-scheme" title="'Finfluencers&rsquo; charged for promoting unauthorised trading scheme">announced charges against 9 individuals</a>&nbsp;in relation to an unauthorised foreign exchange trading scheme promoted on social media. &nbsp;</li>
<li>The defendants&rsquo; dates of birth (DoB) are as follows:&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p class="Indent2">a. Emmanuel Nwanze (DoB 07/01/1994)&nbsp;<br />b. Holly Thompson (also known as Holly Zucchero) (DoB 25/05/1990)&nbsp;<br />c. Biggs Chris (DoB 15/05/1992)&nbsp;<br />d. Jamie Clayton (DoB 18/11/1991)&nbsp;<br />e. Lauren Goodger (DoB 19/09/1986)&nbsp;<br />f. Rebecca Gormley (DoB 18/04/1998)&nbsp;<br />g. Yazmin Oukhellou (DoB 03/05/1994)&nbsp;<br />h. Scott Timlin (DoB 26/04/1988)&nbsp;<br />i. Eva Zapico (DoB 23/07/1998) &nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Mr Nwanze faces 1 count of breaching the General Prohibition under Section 19 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, and 1 count of unauthorised communications of financial promotions under Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Ms Thompson, Mr Chris, Mr Clayton, Ms Goodger, Ms Gormley, Ms Oukhellou, Mr Timlin and Ms Zapico each face 1 count of unauthorised communications of financial promotions under Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Breaching the General Prohibition is an offence under Sections 19 and 23 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 punishable upon conviction by a fine and/or up to 2 years&rsquo; imprisonment.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Communicating unauthorised financial promotions is an offence under Sections 21 and 25 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 punishable upon conviction by a fine and/or up to 2 years&rsquo; imprisonment. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Contracts For Difference (CFDs) are high-risk derivatives. The FCA has previously said that 80% of customers lose money when investing in CFDs because of the risks. They are often highly leveraged, which means they use debt to try and amplify returns, which can result in investors losing more than they invested. In the UK, the FCA has imposed <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/policy-statements/ps19-18-restricting-contract-difference-products" title="PS19/18: Restricting contract for difference products sold to retail clients">restrictions</a> on how CFDs and CFD-like options can be sold and marketed to retail customers. The FCA has been carrying out <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-highlights-continuing-concerns-about-problem-firms-cfd-sector" title="FCA highlights continuing concerns about problem firms in the CFD sector">work to address consumer harm in the UK</a>&nbsp;in this sector. &nbsp;</li>
<li>The FCA has published <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/finalised-guidance/fg24-1-finalised-guidance-financial-promotions-social-media" title="FG24/1: Finalised guidance on financial promotions on social media">finalised guidance on financial promotions on social media</a>&nbsp;to clarify our expectations for when firms and influencers use social media to communicate financial promotions, and to address emerging consumer harm that we&rsquo;ve seen arising from use of social media. &nbsp;</li>

<title>EBA Updates List Of Other Systemically Important Institutions</title>

<div> EBA, O-SIIs, transparency, assessment, banks<br />
<br />Summary: The European Banking Authority updated the list of systemically important institutions in the EU, aiming to increase transparency and providing overview and key facts. <div>
<ul>
<li><em>178 banks identified as systemically important in 2023.</em></li>
<li><em>The list aims&nbsp;to increase transparency in the EU.</em></li>
<li><em>The assessment of systemic importance remains under the remit of the national competent or designated authorities.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) updated today the list of other systemically important institutions (O-SIIs) in the EU, which, together with global systemically important institutions (G-SIIs), are identified as systemically important by the relevant authorities according to harmonised criteria laid down in the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/regulation-and-policy/own-funds/guidelines-on-criteria-to-to-assess-other-systemically-important-institutions-o-siis-"><span>EBA Guidelines</span></a><span>. This list is based on year-end-2023 data and includes the overall score calculated according to the EBA Guidelines and the capital buffer rate that the relevant authorities have set for the identified O-SIIs. The list is available also in a user-friendly visualisation tool.</span></p>
<p>The EBA Guidelines define the size, importance, complexity and interconnectedness as the criteria to identify O-SIIs. They also provide flexibility to relevant authorities to apply their supervisory judgment when deciding to include other institutions, which might have not been automatically identified as O-SIIs. This approach ensures a comparable assessment of all financial institutions across the EU, whilst still not excluding those firms that may be deemed systemically important for one jurisdiction on the basis of certain specificities.</p>
<p>The list published today aims to increase transparency in the EU by providing an overview of OSIIs, including some key facts about the banks identified. 178 banks were identified as systemically important in 2023 (at the highest level of&nbsp;consolidation in each country) with buffer rates ranging from 0.25% to 3%, as shown in the chart below.&nbsp;Relevant authorities disclose further details on the underlying rationale and identification process for their respective jurisdictions. This additional information may be relevant to understand the specific features of each O-SII and to get some insight in terms of supervisory judgment, optional indicators used, buffer decisions and phase-in implementation dates. As underlined in the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD), the assessment of systemic importance necessary to identify O-SIIs remains under the remit of the national competent or designated authorities.</p>

<div> security of supply, renewables, infrastructure, electricity market, flexibility

Summary:
- Integrated approach to electricity security, flexibility at the core
- Enhance distribution networks, empower consumers
- Accelerate transmission infrastructure development
- Apply 'Efficiency First' principle to grids and generation
- Strengthen independent regulators to address challenges <div>
<p>Today&rsquo;s ACER-CEER&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtUVVIEBQICVUxdAlYCHVZaBQAdUwoBVhpRV1IEV1cFVFdUD1IdUwBWUA5TUQIdVFsABB0GW1VWGlcDBwAZUFQEUgQAUFJQUQYFRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">position paper on the challenges of the future electricity system</a>&nbsp;calls on the European Commission, Council and Parliament to prioritise five key electricity and infrastructure challenges throughout the legislative process in their upcoming mandate(s).<br /><br />In short, the paper highlights the urgent need for Europe to facilitate the deployment of more intermittent renewables and to unlock a resilient, flexible and cost-effective electricity sector by</p>
<ol>
<li>Having an integrated pan-EU approach to electricity security of supply, with flexibility at its centre.</li>
<li>Enhancing electricity distribution networks and empowering consumers in decarbonised markets.</li>
<li>Moving quicker towards electricity transmission infrastructure development with an improved assessment at pan-European level, recognising and sharing the costs and benefits.</li>
<li>Applying the &lsquo;Efficiency First&rsquo; principle also to existing grids and generation, enhancing the capacity of what we already have.</li>
<li>Recognising that independent regulators can help address these challenges comprehensively and strengthen Member States&rsquo; trust in the EU electricity market.</li>
</ol>
<p>EU energy regulators are proposing a set of recommendations and commitments that will allow the EU as a whole and Member States to actively steer and harness the power of a new, rapidly emerging energy system that supports the clean energy transition. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing Member States with the tools to support each other in safeguarding security of supply and reducing local flexibility needs, by reaping the lessons of the recent energy crisis.</li>
<li>Exposing renewables producers and flexible resources (such as demand-response and storage) to market signals both at the investment stage and in daily operation, to moderate the costs of the energy transition.</li>
<li>Applying &lsquo;Efficiency First&rsquo; principles also to existing and soon-to-be-built grids (e.g. via innovative grid technologies to significantly increase the capacity of the grid). Furthermore, taking a more coordinated approach to grid development and usage moderates the needs and costs of additional network investment ahead.</li>
<li>Being aware that integrated markets are a key tool to achieve competitive EU electricity prices and to unlock innovation, EU institutions should focus on improving the:   
<ul>
<li>electricity forward market (to support efficient investments);</li>
<li>the day-ahead and intraday markets (for efficient operation of generation and flexible resources);&nbsp;and</li>
<li>retail markets (for delivering the necessary flexibility and providing consumers with choices fitting their preferences).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Unlocking distributed flexibility to reduce costs, by ensuring a fully neutral role of Distribution System Operators (DSOs) and that a range of pricing schemes (from dynamic to variable to fixed price contracts) is available to consumers.</li>
<li>Anchoring the benefits of a truly European electricity market through Member State commitment and trust that electricity will flow smoothly across borders, making cross-border capacities fully available for trade, and empowering independent public authorities (including regulators) to safeguard open borders and energy security of supply to the benefit of all EU citizens and businesses.</li>
</ul>

<br /><br />Summary: 
A study by Connect Energy Economics proposes a competitive market design to ensure a secure and cost-effective electricity supply. It aims to incentivize investment. It emphasizes the importance of a reliable power market to lower costs and create incentives for investments in controllable power. The study also calls for a focus on technology-neutral capacity mechanisms and emphasizes the need for a strengthened competitive market design. It highlights the advantages of a hedging obligation from the EU Electricity Market Directive and its potential to create suitable products for hedging price risks, thereby enabling electricity producers to generate secure income for financing their investments. <div>
<p>How can security of supply be efficiently guaranteed in the electricity market? This question was analysed by the Berlin-based consultancy Connect Energy Economics on behalf of the Association of Energy Market Innovators (BNE), the German Chamber of Industry and Commerce (DIHK) and the European Energy Exchange (EEX) in the current study &ldquo;The order of transformation &ndash; security of supply in the electricity market", which was published today.</p>
<p>Commenting on the results of the study, Achim Dercks, Deputy Managing Director of the German Chamber of Industry and Commerce, said:&nbsp;<em>"It is important for the economy that the electricity costs of a secure energy supply are limited for companies. The aim should therefore be to incentivise investment in the market instead of providing permanent state support for individual technologies. The study clearly shows that a reliable power supply is possible through market incentives."</em></p>
<p>Under the German government's planned power plant strategy, (hydrogen-ready) gas-fired power plants are to be put out to tender in the short term. In addition, the development of a market-based and technology-neutral capacity mechanism has been announced, which should be operational by 2028. The aim is to find a mechanism that ensures the supply of electricity even during hours of "dark doldrums" and guarantees system stability.</p>
<p>Author Marco Nicolosi, Managing Director of Connect Energy Economics, concludes:&nbsp;<em>"Strengthening the competitive electricity market enables a cost-effective and secure supply. Instead of discussing support schemes for power plants, which &ndash; as in the case of capacity markets &ndash; lead to a permanent need for support, incentives should be provided to strengthen the electricity market".</em></p>
<p>Robert Busch, Managing Director of the German Association of the New Energy Industry, agrees and emphasises:&nbsp;<em>"We need an intelligent framework instead of the planned promotion of capacities. It is unacceptable for us to suppress the market growth of various flexibilisation offers in favour of&nbsp;promoting natural gas power plants with a hydrogen mortgage that is uncertain at best. The foreseeable subsequent subsidy race between renewable energies and new power plants should also be avoided.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Instead, the hedging obligation from the European Electricity Market Directive (Art. 18a, source:&nbsp;<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ%3AL_202401711" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">LINK</a>) should be taken up in particular. The study describes the economic background and requirements that should be met for implementation.</p>
<p>A strengthened competitive market design can be implemented promptly and therefore enables rapid investment in new capacities. This is also because this mechanism is open to different technologies and innovations. This means that the economic costs of security of supply are lower compared to capacity markets. The national implementation of the hedging obligation is also in line with the European legal requirements of the internal market. Time-consuming state aid reviews by the EU are thus spared.</p>
<p>Peter Reitz, CEO of EEX, says:&nbsp;<em>"If the legislator consistently organises the hedging obligation, suitable products for hedging price risks that take into account the value of security of supply will be traded on the power market. This will allow electricity producers to generate secure income to finance their investments."</em></p>
<p>Busch, Dercks and Reitz agree:&nbsp;<em>"The baseline study has a central message. There is no need for permanent power plant subsidy schemes. The further development of the market design and the power market are suitable for creating the necessary incentives for investments in controllable power."</em></p>

<div> issuer, structured products, CONNEXOR, Spanish market, efficiency gains
Summary: Societe Generale uses CONNEXOR in the Spanish market, benefiting from efficiency gains, automation, and standardization, providing investors with more choice and reducing time to market.<br /><br /> <div>
<ul>
<li><span>As a key issuer of Structured Products, Societe Generale has become the first to use Connexor in the Spanish market, benefitting from major efficiency gains in the listing process of warrants, certificates, structured notes, fixed income and other products</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CONNEXOR has been successfully implemented by BME by admitting the first warrants from Societe Generale in a fully automated process. For issuers of structured products, CONNEXOR brings unprecedented automation and standardization benefits, including scalability through uniform processes, high data quality and cost savings.</p>
<p>As CONNEXOR enables issuers to increase the number and variety of structured products while reducing their time to market &ndash; a key element in a volatile market to offer attractive products &ndash; , investors in the Spanish market are expected to enjoy more choice to pursue their individual investment strategies.</p>
<p>Making CONNEXOR available to the Spanish market highlights the successful&nbsp; synergies created by BME and SIX. In close collaboration, they have increased the efficiency in the competitive landscape for structured products in the Spanish Market. CONNEXOR is used within the whole BME value chain, including Iberclear as well as the Primary and Secondary Market.</p>
<p>Further important milestones to strengthen the competitive position of BME are the reduction on listing and trading fees, the streamlining of the review process of the legal documentation to&nbsp; improve the listing process for more efficiency and the implementation of a 4 digit quotation in the leverage product segment for a more granular pricing.</p>
<p>Andr&eacute; Buck, Head FI, Structured Products &amp; CONNEXOR, Exchanges, SIX, comments: &ldquo;We are very pleased that Societe Generale has started to use CONNEXOR in the Spanish market. This highlights how SIX enables financial institutions to focus on their core business while reducing operational risks and costs, making markets more efficient for the benefit of both issuers and investors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>H&eacute;lio da Silva Cl&aacute;udio, Head of Public Distribution International at Societe Generale: &ldquo;As a long standing user of CONNEXOR for the Swiss and European market, we have now started using the innovative services for the Spanish Market, which represents a key milestone for us to keep growing our presence as a leader on the Listed Products market in Spain.&ldquo;</p>

These benefits have been realized through the digital transformation of electronic Bills of Lading (eBLs) and related trade documents.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>WaveBL is a leading blockchain-based platform for digitizing electronic trade documents. Its growing global network is designed to facilitate the fast, efficient, and cost-effective transmission of eBLs globally. By introducing the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) with its digital counterpart, the verifiable LEI (vLEI), WaveBL is aiming to obtain and utilize accurate, verified digital identity data of the shippers, consignees, and other legal entities engaged in the movement of goods around the world.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>By encouraging companies to use data from their LEI records or to obtain new LEIs, WaveBL is enhancing the reliability and accuracy of the information within its global network address book. This will increase transparency across the shipping industry and boost the confidence of all stakeholders involved, including regulatory supervisors.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>An LEI is a unique ISO-standardized 20-character code assigned to a legal entity. Each LEI links to a verified company identity record held in the Global LEI Index, an open, globally recognized data bank that is free for all to access. This enables anyone to verify that an organization is indeed who it claims to be. To date, over 2.6 million LEIs have been issued globally. A vLEI is a digital counterpart to an LEI. It makes automatic recognition of an entity's LEI possible in digital processes.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>WaveBL CEO Noam Rosenfeld comments: "The integration of the LEIs into our platform represents a monumental step towards achieving a seamless digital trade environment. By ensuring the accuracy of digital identities, we are enhancing trust and transparency within our network and setting the stage for global interoperability. However, enabling automatic verification of digital credentials is a prerequisite in this regard. Currently, WaveBL handles verification processes on a platform level. As WaveBL is in search of a globally accepted standard, we have found that, the introduction of vLEIs could radically streamline this process by providing a trusted automated and universally accepted solution for verifying companies' digital identities worldwide."</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Alexandre Kech, CEO of GLEIF, comments: "By introducing LEIs and vLEIs into its platform, WaveBL is expected to enhanced the speed, accuracy, and reliability of its digital identity verification, fostering greater interoperability and security in global trade. By integrating the LEI into digital supply chain systems, enterprises are not only increasing efficiency and reducing the costs of paperwork but also equipping their industry with the tools needed to fight fraud and other forms of financial crime. I applaud WaveBL's efforts and am excited to see our collaboration continue as the vLEI ecosystem continues to gather momentum around the world."</span></span></span></p>

<title>Retail Investors Bearish On Both S&amp;P 500 And NASDAQ 100 Despite Index Rallies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li>Spectrum's SERIX sentiment indicates a bearish trend for both the S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ 100, despite recent rises in points for the index</li>
<li>Both US indices are strongly driven by &lsquo;Glorious Seven&rsquo; stocks: NVIDIA, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, Apple and Tesla</li>
<li>NVIDIA remains the strongest single stock driving US indices, with Artificial Intelligence (AI) being a suspected primary driver of this trend</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spectrum Markets (&ldquo;Spectrum&rdquo;), the pan-European trading venue designed for retail investors, has published its SERIX sentiment data for European retail investors for June, revealing bearish trading behaviour for both US indices, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ 100.</p>
<p>The SERIX value for the S&amp;P 500 fell to 93 points, whereas on June 28<sup>th</sup> at market closure, the S&amp;P 500 index climbed up to 5,460 points. Similarly, SERIX sentiment on NASDAQ 100 fell to 96 points while the index itself rose to 19,682 points.</p>
<p>The SERIX value indicates retail investor sentiment, with a number above 100 marking bullish sentiment, and a number below 100 indicating bearish sentiment. (See below for more information on the methodology).</p>
<p><b>Market opinion</b></p>
<p>&ldquo;The strong performance of NVIDIA has significantly boosted both US indices. However, some retail investors may now be sceptical about the sustainability of this growth or may simply be engaging in profit-taking,&rdquo; says Michael Hall, Head of Distribution at Spectrum Markets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both US indices are strongly driven by the &lsquo;Glorious Seven&rsquo; stocks: NVIDIA, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, Apple and Tesla. Eight of the ten largest companies in the world are based in the United States, five of which are pure technology stocks closely tied to Artificial Intelligence (AI). The development and impact of AI will continue to play a crucial role and strongly influence both major US indices,&rdquo; Hall concludes.</p>
<p><b>Spectrum&rsquo;s June data</b></p>
<p>In June 2024, order book turnover on Spectrum was &euro;201.5 million, with 34.7% of trades taking place outside of traditional hours (i.e., between 17:30 and 9:00 CET)</p>
<p>The order book turnover was distributed among various underlying assets as follows: 76.2% on indices, 5.1% on currency pairs, 8.9% on commodities, 8.1% on equities and 1.7% on cryptocurrencies. The top three traded underlying markets were NASDAQ 100 (26.2%), DAX 40 (23.9%), and DOW 30 (11.3%).</p>
<p>Looking at the SERIX data for the top three underlying markets, the NASDAQ 100 and DOW 30 both remained bearish at 96 and 99 respectively, and the DAX 40 increased from a bearish 98 to a bullish&nbsp; 101.</p>

<table border="0" style="width: 100%;">

<tr>
<td>
<div>
<p align="center"><b>Calculating SERIX data</b></p>
<p>The Spectrum European Retail Investor Index (SERIX), uses the trading venue&rsquo;s pan-European trading data to shed light on investor sentiment towards current development in financial markets.</p>
<p>The index is calculated on a monthly basis by analysing retail investor trades placed and subtracting the proportion of bearish trades from the proportion of bullish trades, to give a single figure (rebased at 100) that indicates the strength and direction of sentiment:</p>
<p align="center"><i>SERIX = (% bullish trades - % bearish trades) + 100</i><span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Trades where long instruments are bought and trades where short instruments are sold are both considered bullish trades, while trades where long instruments are sold and trades where short instruments are bought are considered bearish trades. Trades that are matched by retail clients are disregarded. (For a detailed methodology and examples, please visit this <a href="https://www.spectrum-markets.com/the-venue/spectrum-european-retail-investor-index?utm_source=Press%20Release%20-%20EN&amp;utm_medium=SERIX%20LINK&amp;utm_campaign=May%20Volumes%20Press%20Release&amp;utm_content=">link</a>).</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Overhauls Listing Rules To Boost Growth And Innovation On UK Stock Markets</title>

<div> financial conduct authority, listing rules, UK market, investors, capital market
<br />
Summary:<br />
New FCA listing rules simplify UK listings, align with international standards, remove voting requirements, and support economic growth. Effective July 29, 2024. <div>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>The new rules are the biggest changes to the listing regime in over 3 decades. They aim to support a wider range of companies to issue their shares on a UK exchange, increasing opportunities for investors.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/policy-statements/ps24-6-primary-markets-effectiveness-review-feedback-cp23-31-final-uk-listing-rules" title="PS24/6: Primary Markets Effectiveness Review: Feedback to CP23/31 and final UK Listing Rules">rules published today</a>, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has set out a simplified listings regime with a single category and streamlined eligibility for those companies seeking to list their shares in the UK.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The overhaul of listing rules better aligns the UK&rsquo;s regime with international market standards. It also ensures investors will have the information they need to make decisions about their money, while maintaining appropriate investor protections to hold the management of the companies they co-own to account.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new rules remove the need for votes on significant or related party transactions and offer flexibility around enhanced voting rights. Shareholder approval for key events, like reverse takeovers and decisions to take the company&rsquo;s shares off an exchange, is still required. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The changes to listing rules follow extensive engagement across the market. The FCA has been clear that the new rules involve allowing greater risk, but believes the changes set out will better reflect the risk appetite the economy needs to achieve growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new rules will apply from 29 July 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sarah Pritchard, Executive Director, Markets and International, at the FCA said:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>'A thriving capital market is vital in delivering investment to growing companies plus returns and choice to investors. That&rsquo;s why we are acting to make it more straightforward for those seeking to list in the UK, while retaining vital protections so investors can help steer the businesses they co-own.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>'Regulation is only part of the answer in helping the UK achieve sustainable growth. Other factors also play a significant role in influencing where a company decides to list. We&rsquo;re committed to continually working together with all those who have a part to play in supporting a thriving UK capital market and thank everyone who has contributed to this work so far.'</p>
<p>Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves said:</p>
<p>'The financial services sector is central to the UK economy, and at the heart of this government&rsquo;s growth mission.</p>
<p>'These new rules represent a significant first step towards reinvigorating our capital markets, bringing the UK in line with international counterparts and ensuring we attract the most innovative companies to list here.'</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<ol>
<li>Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/policy-statements/ps24-6-primary-markets-effectiveness-review-feedback-cp23-31-final-uk-listing-rules" title="PS24/6: Primary Markets Effectiveness Review: Feedback to CP23/31 and final UK Listing Rules">Policy Statement</a>.</li>
<li>The rules will go live on 29 July 2024 following a short implementation period. We considered all the feedback received and have proceeded to finalise the implementation in line with the timeframes and approach consulted previously. We believe this timeline will enable the benefits of the reforms to be realised as soon as possible.&nbsp;</li>
<li>According to the UK Listing Review, the number of listed companies in the UK has fallen by about 40% from a recent peak in 2008. Between 2015 and 2020, the UK accounted for only 5% of Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) globally.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The FCA has already published final rules on some of the recommendations from Lord Hill&rsquo;s UK Listing Review and the&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-kalifa-review-of-uk-fintech" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kalifa Review on UK fintech.<span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;Read&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/policy/ps21-22.pdf" target="_blank">PS21/22: Primary Market Effectiveness Review: Feedback and final changes to the Listing Rules.</a>&nbsp;</li>
<li>The&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-listings-review" rel="noopener" target="_blank">UK Listing Review<span class="ext"></span></a>, Chaired by Lord Hill, also made a recommendation to the FCA to consider changes to the Listing Rules in relation to SPACs (Special Purpose Acquisition Companies) in its final report published on 3 March 2021. The FCA published&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/policy-statements/ps21-10-investor-protection-measures-spacs-listing-rules" target="_blank">final rules</a> on strengthening investor protections in SPACs in July 2021 and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/discussion/dp22-2.pdf" target="_blank">feedback</a>&nbsp;to our discussion document in May 2022.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The new rules support the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/corporate-documents/our-approach-consumers#:~:text=Our%20objectives,-We%20have%20a&amp;text=protect%20consumers%20%E2%80%93%20we%20secure%20an,in%20the%20interests%20of%20consumers">FCA&rsquo;s primary objective to protect consumers and markets, as well as its secondary objective to promote competition</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>As well as complying with the new regime, companies must also continue to have corporate governance in place and engage with their shareholders.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Changes to the Official List will start to appear from 26 July 2024 ahead of the implementation date of 29 July 2024.</li>
<li>The date of publication of this Policy Statement and the UK Listing Rules Instrument 2024 (FCA 2024/23) is 11 July 2024. An applicant for the admission of securities that has made a complete submission to the FCA for an eligibility review for listing&nbsp;<span>by 4:00pm on 11 July 2024</span>&nbsp;will (where the securities have not been admitted to listing prior to 29 July 2024) be treated as an &lsquo;in-flight applicant&rsquo; under the UK Listing Rules Instrument.</li>

Summary:<br />
Euronext launches Euronext Wireless Network (EWIN) in London, offering faster order transmission, 100% resilient, reduced latency, direct microwave link, supported by major financial institutions. <div>
<p align="justify"><span>Euronext, the leading pan-European market infrastructure, today announced the successful launch of its new London-based microwave service, the Euronext Wireless Network (EWIN). Euronext is the first exchange in Europe to offer &ldquo;Plug &amp; Play&rdquo; order entry in London via microwave technology. This service is set to significantly enhance the speed of order transmission between London, UK, and Bergamo, Italy, where Euronext&rsquo;s core data centre is located, offering unparallelled improvements in latency for our many London-based members.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>The Euronext Wireless Network (EWIN) is a fully resilient service with 100% fibre back-up, providing order submission via microwaves from London Equinix LD4 to Bergamo Aruba IT3 in less than 4 milliseconds. This new service is provided in collaboration with McKay Brothers, the largest independent microwave network provider in Europe.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>The EWIN microwave network represents a major technological advancement in the financial services sector. By leveraging the faster transmission speeds of microwave technology, EWIN provides a direct and highly efficient communication pathway that significantly reduces the time it takes to send orders to Euronext&rsquo;s single liquidity pool, powered by the single technology platform Optiq</span><span>&reg;</span><span>.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>EWIN combines several key benefits, providing Euronext members with a technological edge in the fast-paced world of financial trading. First of all, the service has been designed with full straight-through processing (STP). EWIN also has full fibre back-up, making it 100% resilient. EWIN significantly reduces latency, ensuring faster and more reliable order execution. Lastly, it creates a direct microwave link between London and Bergamo, two major financial data hubs in Europe. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have confirmed the deployment of the new technology since its go-live date.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>St&eacute;phane Boujnah, CEO of Euronext and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext, said:&nbsp;</span><span>&ldquo;Euronext continuously invests and innovates to improve access to its markets, which offer the largest liquidity pool in Europe covering seven European markets, a unified order book, technology platform and harmonised rule book.

<div> reforms, financial advice regulation, ASIC, superannuation, FSG
<br />
The Treasury Laws Amendments Act 2024 advances financial advice regulation, clarifies superannuation trustee charges, streamlines fee renewal, and updates FSG requirements. 
<br /><br />Summary: The DBFO Act advances financial advice regulation, clarifies superannuation trustee charges, streamlines fee renewal, updates FSG requirements, governs conflicted remuneration, and sets consent requirements. <div>
<p>ASIC acknowledges royal assent of the&nbsp;<em>Treasury Laws Amendments (Delivering Better Financial Outcomes and Other Measures) Act 2024</em>&nbsp;(DBFO Act).</p>
<p>Royal assent of the DBFO Act marks an important step in advancing reforms to financial advice regulation as part of the Commonwealth Government&rsquo;s response to recommendations 7, 8, 10, 13.1&ndash;13.5 and 13.7&ndash;13.9 of the Quality of Advice Review.</p>
<p>Reforms under DBFO Act include:</p>
<ul>

<li>introducing new standardised consent requirements for life risk insurance, general insurance and consumer credit insurance commissions.</li>
</ul>

<title>"Growth And Opportunities In The ILS Market: A Singapore Perspective" - Speech By Mr Lim Cheng Khai, Executive Director, Financial Markets Development Department, Monetary Authority Of Singapore, At The Artemis ILS Asia 2024 On 11 July 2024</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Steve Evans, Editor-in-Chief of Artemis<br />Ladies and gentlemen<br /><br /><span><span>Introduction</span></span></p>
<p>1.&nbsp;<span> </span>Good morning. Thank you for having me back at the Artemis ILS Asia Conference. I am happy to see the conference back for its sixth installation in Singapore. To our international guests, a warm welcome.<br /><br />2.&nbsp;<span> </span>Artemis Asia is always a highlight in the insurance industry&rsquo;s calendar of events. It is an important platform for risk cedants, sponsors and investors to exchange insights and identify valuable opportunities in the ILS market, with a focus on Asia.<br /><br /><span><span>A Growing ILS Market</span></span></p>
<p>3.&nbsp;<span> </span><span>The global ILS market experienced strong growth in the number of issuances in 2023, which continued into 2024.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Alternative reinsurance capital exceeded the US$110 billion mark in the second quarter of this year, after breaking the US$100 billion mark for the first time last year&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/growth-and-opportunities-in-the-ils-market#1">[1]</a></span>&nbsp;.</li>
<li>The catastrophe bond market saw a record issuance volume of US$15 billion in 2023&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/growth-and-opportunities-in-the-ils-market#2">[2]</a></span>&nbsp;, partly driven by growing participation in ILS markets. 
<ul>
<li>13 new cedants entered the catastrophe bond market last year, accounting for US$2.1 billion of capital&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/growth-and-opportunities-in-the-ils-market#3">[3]</a></span>&nbsp;.</li>
<li>There was also good growth in first time cedants from France, Germany, Korea and New Zealand, covering wind and earthquake perils.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This growth in ILS issuances covering non-US risks is attractive to fund managers and investors, who are keen to diversify their ILS portfolio to include more non-US exposures.</li>
<li>This momentum continues in 2024. In the first half alone, new catastrophe bond issuances have already reached US$12.1 billion&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/growth-and-opportunities-in-the-ils-market#4">[4]</a></span>&nbsp;, or 80% of the full year volume in 2023. 
<ul>
<li>This included Puerto Rico Parametric Re Ltd. which was the first issuance by the Government of Puerto Rico.</li>
<li>This year also saw the issuance of the first catastrophe bond to cover cloud outage risks&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/growth-and-opportunities-in-the-ils-market#5">[5]</a></span>&nbsp;, a segment of the cyber reinsurance market where retrocessional coverage is often lacking.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Singapore saw four catastrophe bond renewals this year &ndash; a vote of confidence from the cedants on Singapore&rsquo;s value as an ILS domicile&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/growth-and-opportunities-in-the-ils-market#6">[6]</a></span>&nbsp;.</li>
<li>We also continue to receive interest from potential issuers covering risks from India and Africa.</li>
</ul>
<p><span><span>Capturing Investor Interest</span></span></p>
<p>4.&nbsp;<span> </span><span>ILS investors have enjoyed good returns and relatively lower volatility, and also portfolio diversification benefits.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>ILS have low correlation with traditional financial assets that dominate most portfolios.</li>
<li>They can also offer a competitive risk-return profile relative to other financial assets.<br /> 
<ul>
<li>Last year, the average yield of an ILS fund and cat bond fund reached record highs of 15.4%&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/growth-and-opportunities-in-the-ils-market#7">[7]</a></span>&nbsp;and 19.7%&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/growth-and-opportunities-in-the-ils-market#8">[8]</a></span>&nbsp;respectively. They outperformed other alternative asset classes, such as infrastructure, real estate and hedge funds&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/growth-and-opportunities-in-the-ils-market#9">[9]</a></span>&nbsp;.</li>
<li>ILS instruments have delivered better annual returns than comparable assets of similar credit quality. Over the past fifteen years, ILS instruments&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/growth-and-opportunities-in-the-ils-market#10">[10]</a></span>&nbsp;delivered annualised&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/growth-and-opportunities-in-the-ils-market#11">[11]</a></span>&nbsp;returns of 6.42%&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/growth-and-opportunities-in-the-ils-market#12">[12]</a></span>&nbsp;. This compares with 4.86%&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/growth-and-opportunities-in-the-ils-market#13">[13]</a></span>&nbsp;for similarly-rated high yield bonds, over the same period.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>At the same time, ILS instruments also experienced lower volatility than traditional financial assets &ndash; 4 times lower than the S&amp;P 500 and 3 times lower than high yield bonds.</li>
<li>The attractive returns from ILS assets are capturing mindshare, with greater interest and growing demand from clients in Asia, albeit from a small base.</li>
</ul>
<p>5.&nbsp;<span> </span><span>ILS can also help investors achieve their ESG objectives.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>In 2020, Mexico&rsquo;s catastrophe bond supported by the World Bank, was the first catastrophe bond where the proceeds could be used by the World Bank Group&rsquo;s International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, or IBRD, to fund sustainable development programmes in its member countries&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/growth-and-opportunities-in-the-ils-market#14">[14]</a></span>&nbsp;. The World Bank has continued this practice since.</li>
<li>In the past two years, two catastrophe bonds that were issued in Singapore invested their bond proceeds into sustainable collateral, in the form of Sustainable Development Bonds issued by the IBRD.<br /> 
<ul>
<li>The collateral finances projects under the World Bank Group that achieve positive environmental and social outcomes in country programmes, such as increasing renewable energy supply or increasing access to water and sanitation services.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Such structures can help cedants to align ILS issuances with their own ESG objectives, while making ILS more attractive to investors with ESG mandates.</li>
</ul>
<p>6.&nbsp;<span> </span><span>There is good potential for the growing institutional and private wealth investor base in Asia, including Singapore, to invest in ILS.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Traditionally, ILS investors have been pension funds, institutional investors, and private wealth clients in North America, Europe and Japan.</li>
<li>The accumulation of family wealth and institutional capital in Asia-Pacific presents opportunity to tap into a bigger investor pool.<br /> 
<ul>
<li>From 2011 to 2022, total assets under management or AUM in Asia-Pacific grew at an annual rate of 14%, outpacing the global average of 9%&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/growth-and-opportunities-in-the-ils-market#15">[15]</a></span>&nbsp;.</li>
<li>Wealth in the Asia-Pacific affluent segment is estimated to expand at an annual rate of 11% from 2021 to 2026&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/growth-and-opportunities-in-the-ils-market#16">[16]</a></span>&nbsp;. There will also be continued growth in pension assets. This is estimated to reach US$32.4 trillion&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/growth-and-opportunities-in-the-ils-market#17">[17]</a></span>&nbsp;, driven by reforms to existing pension systems and shifts towards alternative investments&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/growth-and-opportunities-in-the-ils-market#18">[18]</a></span>&nbsp;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>7.&nbsp;<span> </span><span>To promote investor interest, MAS has been working with industry partners on investor outreach and education.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>In the past year, we have partnered SGX, Aon, and Amundi to host investor education sessions. MAS has also engaged private banks, and the Wealth Management Institute in Singapore to build mindshare on ILS as an asset class.</li>
<li>While some are not immediately ready to allocate capital to ILS, it is an important first step for the private wealth segment and institutional asset owners to be apprised of opportunities in this asset class.</li>
<li>Market participants have also shared with us that they are beginning to see some private wealth clients in Singapore allocating to ILS, through their banks&rsquo; discretionary allocations.</li>
<li>We welcome more stakeholders in the ILS ecosystem to partner with MAS and other opinion multipliers to engage the investor base in Singapore.</li>
</ul>
<p>8.&nbsp;<span> </span><span>Against these tailwinds of increasing ILS volumes and a growing pool of investors, ILS fund managers too, have grown their assets under management.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>The combined AUM for the top tier ILS fund managers globally has increased by 4.2%&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/growth-and-opportunities-in-the-ils-market#19">[19]</a></span>&nbsp;over the past six months to US$80 billion&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/growth-and-opportunities-in-the-ils-market#20">[20]</a></span>&nbsp;.</li>
<li>MAS has been engaging some ILS fund managers that are considering setting up offices in Singapore.</li>
</ul>
<p><span><span>Opportunities in Asia</span></span></p>
<p>9.&nbsp;<span> </span><span>Asia also presents a good match for investors and fund managers&rsquo; demand for geographical diversification in their ILS portfolios.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Asia is vulnerable to climate risks and natural disasters.<br /> 
<ul>
<li>Over the past thirty years, Asia-Pacific countries experienced six natural disasters yearly on average, double that of countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, and triple that of sub-Saharan Africa&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/growth-and-opportunities-in-the-ils-market#21">[21]</a></span>&nbsp;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is scope for private-public partnerships to help Asian governments, at sovereign and municipal levels, to tap the alternative risk transfer market to protect key assets, or vulnerable segments of their population, from natural catastrophes.</li>
<li>This is already common in Latin America and some African states. Countries such as Jamaica, Mexico, Chile and Peru, with the support of the World Bank, have issued catastrophe bonds in recent years.<br /> 
<ul>
<li>It enhanced their governments&rsquo; ability to undertake reconstruction and rehabilitation of housing and public infrastructure in the events of natural perils, while maintaining fiscal resilience. And this lessened impact on the livelihoods of their citizenry.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For example, the Peru catastrophe bond was triggered by a magnitude 8.0 earthquake in 2019. The payout of US$60 million aided Peru&rsquo;s recovery from the earthquake.</li>
<li>The World Bank is growing its capabilities in Singapore, to actively support the risk financing needs and promote solutions in Asia.</li>
<li>To facilitate proper pricing and underwriting, we will need better data and risk modelling.</li>
<li>Singapore is committed to supporting these efforts.<br /> 
<ul>
<li>To address data gaps, Singapore, in partnership with the ASEAN Secretariat and the Nanyang Technological University Institute of Catastrophe Risk Management, supported the ASEAN Disaster Risk Financing and Insurance Phase 2 programme (ADRFI-2). A data exchange and analytics portal which provides high resolution exposure and loss data to ASEAN member states has been developed, to support ASEAN governments to manage and mitgate their natural catastrophe risk exposures.</li>
<li>We also have a growing base of professional service providers and insurance expertise to support ILS issuances, including legal professionals, insurance managers, risk modellers, claims reviewers and loss reserve specialists in Singapore.</li>
<li>Lastly, issuers can tap on MAS&rsquo; ILS Grant scheme, which defrays the costs of ILS issuances in Singapore. The ILS grant scheme has supported 28 catastrophe bond issuances over the past 5 years, raising a total of US$4.4 billion. It was enhanced in 2023 to allow cedants to issue a broader spectrum of ILS instruments, including sidecars and collateralised reinsurance arrangements. We are also looking into the required regulatory, tax and legal infrastructure required to support these instruments, and will progressively implement them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span><span>Innovation in ILS Markets</span></span></p>
<p>10.&nbsp;<span> </span><span>Looking ahead, the ILS market will continue to innovate and grow, to meet market needs and demand for risk transfer and sharing. Just like how the ILS concept all began in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>The twinning of ESG features with ILS is one.&nbsp;</span>For example, Generali published its Green ILS Framework in 2019 and issued its first green catastrophe bond in 2021 &ndash; a &euro;200 million transaction that freed up &euro;28.1 million of regulatory capital for the insurer and avoided 35.1 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/growth-and-opportunities-in-the-ils-market#22">[22]</a></span>&nbsp;. 
<ul>
<li>In the debut Generali green catastrophe bond, the solvency capital that was freed-up was channelled towards investment in green assets or underwriting green businesses.</li>
<li>The Green ILS proceeds would also be invested in a portfolio of green high quality liquid assets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>Another recent innovation is the use of blockchain and smart contracts to make the issuance and trading of catastrophe bonds more efficient and transparent.</span><br /> 
<ul>
<li>This began in 2016 when Nephila and Allianz successfully piloted the use of smart contract in a natural catastrophe swap transaction. This was followed the following year by the first issuance of a private catastrophe bond on a blockchain.</li>
<li>Just two days ago, Schroders Capital, in partnership with Hannover Re, announced the launch of a pilot ILS tokenisation project which aims to enhance how ILS assets are managed and invested&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/growth-and-opportunities-in-the-ils-market#23">[23]</a></span>&nbsp;. During testing, it successfully enabled reinsurance contracts to be tokenised and traded on a public blockchain. It enabled many time-consuming processes to be automated, and reduced settlement time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>11.&nbsp;<span> </span>We encourage the ILS industry to also use Singapore as a test-bed for innovative products, tapping on our deep sustainable finance and digital assets eco-systems here.<br /><br />12.&nbsp;<span> </span>To round up, MAS will continue to work closely with the ILS industry to offer Singapore as a conducive base for Asia&rsquo;s ILS market, and match Asia&rsquo;s risk financing needs with growing investor interest.<br /><br />13.&nbsp;<span> </span>I look forward to our discussions today, and I wish you a fruitful time at Artemis ILS Asia 2024.<br /><br />Thank you.</p>

<div class="row">
<div id="article">
<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-md-8">
<p>Thank you, Jacky. I am happy to be here in Adelaide and appreciate the opportunity to speak with all of you.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20240710a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;Considering the significant developments in the global economy over the past few years, now is an appropriate time to reflect on the economic reverberations the COVID-19 shock caused around the world. Examining the common inflation experiences and monetary policy challenges across several countries, including Australia and the United States, is a helpful exercise for policymakers and economists alike. Today, I will first talk about how monetary policymakers responded in similar fashion to the COVID-19 pandemic and, later, to high inflation during the recovery. I will discuss common features of the recent inflation experience across countries and the importance of global shocks. With disinflation in train across most countries, I will consider what we can learn from past cycles of monetary easing. I will finish with a discussion of how the use of alternative scenarios could help monetary policymakers communicate how they might respond to a range of possible economic outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Common Monetary Policy Response to the Pandemic</strong><br />In the spring of 2020, economies around the world shut down or sharply limited business activity, especially for in-person services, including dining out and traveling. Governments introduced extraordinary fiscal support aimed at alleviating the socioeconomic effects of the pandemic. And, to prevent sharp financial and economic deterioration, most central banks responded aggressively by lowering policy rates, ramping up asset purchases, and taking other actions to support the flow of credit to households and businesses. Those efforts were sustained throughout 2020 and much of 2021, as the initial turmoil in financial markets subsided but the health situation remained uncertain.</p>
<p>Advanced economy central banks that had positive policy rates before the pandemic, including the Fed and the central banks of Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom, cut these rates to near zero, as shown in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/cook-20240710-fig1.PNG" id="fig2">figure 1.</a>&nbsp;Central banks that entered the pandemic with policy rates already at zero, such as Sweden, or negative&mdash;including the euro area, Japan, and Switzerland&mdash;left their rates unchanged. Meanwhile, almost all emerging market economy (EME) central banks cut their policy rates. Although central banks acted quickly to reduce rates, policymakers cited a few reasons to refrain from deeper cuts: Among EME policymakers, concerns were expressed that further lowering rates risked exacerbating capital outflows, while some advanced economy central banks commented that further rate cuts, particularly in negative territory, could harm banks' financial health or would provide little additional monetary stimulus.</p>
<p>Many central banks also conducted significant asset purchases. These purchases were initially aimed at restoring market functioning and providing liquidity, but they also were seen as lowering long-term yields and easing broader financial conditions. The Fed and the Bank of England (BOE) restarted their purchases, while the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Swedish Riksbank increased the pace of their existing programs. And here, the Reserve Bank of Australia began asset purchases and introduced a target for the three-year government bond yield at the same level as its overnight rate.</p>
<p><strong>The Rise of Inflation and the Common Monetary Policy Response</strong><br />Over the course of 2021, as financial conditions improved, a strong recovery in consumer demand outpaced still constrained supply capacity in many countries, leading to production and transportation bottlenecks, which ultimately resulted in inflation. The surge in inflation was initially mostly concentrated in finished goods and commodities but later spread to services.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20240710a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;As the economy started reopening with the lifting of lockdowns and rollout of vaccines, demand for services picked up. Similar to what played out with goods, the pickup in demand for services ran into a constrained supply of service workers. As services are more labor intensive than goods, and labor supply was still reeling from the consequences of the pandemic, the rebalancing of consumption from goods to services led to higher rates of inflation and nominal wage growth.</p>
<p>In response to rising inflation, central banks around the world started to remove some of the support that they provided during the height of the pandemic. As a first step, central banks let many of the emergency support programs&mdash;in which they had bought assets other than national government bonds&mdash;expire. Next, central banks generally began to taper their purchases of government securities and then to end net purchases late in 2021 or the first half of 2022.</p>
<p>Then some central banks began to raise interest rates. The first to do so were EME central banks that saw particularly sharp increases in inflation driven by exchange rate depreciation and by the surge in prices for food, which makes up a large part of the consumption baskets in their economies. Advanced economy central banks generally were more patient on raising interest rates in 2021, as inflation expectations in their economies were better anchored than in emerging economies. Among advanced economy central banks, the first to hike in the autumn of 2021 were central banks in Norway and New Zealand, whose economies had strong recoveries. The BOE first raised its policy rate in December 2021, citing a strong labor market and sharply rising inflation. The Bank of Canada and the Fed began to raise rates in March 2022, and the ECB first raised its deposit rate (from negative 0.5 percent to zero) in July 2022. Most advanced economy central banks undertook a sequence of policy actions in which they first began to raise their policy rates and later began to reduce the size of their balance sheets over time.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding the Rise and Fall of Inflation in Recent Years</strong><br />The inflation surge in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic was synchronized across advanced and emerging economies, as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/cook-20240710-fig2.PNG" id="fig3">figure 2</a>&nbsp;illustrates. The rapid increase in prices reflected an upswing in demand for goods, strained supply chains, tight labor markets, and sharp hikes in commodity prices exacerbated by Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The run-up was not only for overall headline inflation, but also for its core components.</p>
<p>A plethora of factors can explain the global co-movement in headline and core inflation. First, fluctuations in global food and energy prices broadly pass through to consumer prices in individual countries. But there are other possible explanations, including global supply constraints and synchronous policy responses. The pandemic experience was also a stark reminder of the importance of international trade and input-output linkages for the propagation of supply shocks&mdash;for example, production and shipping disruptions in the semiconductor industry in Asia constraining production and creating important price pressures in downstream markets, such as motor vehicles in the U.S.</p>
<p>Research on the recent inflation episode is still very much in its infancy, and I look forward to learning from the ongoing work on the subject. One important contribution already is Ben Bernanke and Olivier Blanchard's analysis of pandemic-era inflation in 11 economies. Separate teams for each of the 11 economies estimated a comparable model of inflation and its drivers. They find for the U.S. and, with some variation, for other countries that "relative price shocks and sectoral shortages drove the initial surge in inflation, but as these effects have reversed, tight labor markets in most (although not all) countries have become a relatively more important factor."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20240710a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a></p>
<p>In a recent FEDS Notes article, economists at the Federal Reserve Board took head-on the task of decomposing world inflation into common and country-specific components and using this decomposition to analyze the sources of inflation around the world.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20240710a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;Despite the different approach, they reached conclusions broadly in line with those of Bernanke and Blanchard. As shown in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/cook-20240710-fig3.PNG" id="fig4">figure 3</a>, they find that the global components of inflation accounted for a large part of the variation in the average inflation around the world during the post-COVID period. This is an experience with precedents during the oil price shocks of the 1970s and the 1980s.</p>
<p>This study also found that the global components of inflation also predict the path of near-term inflation. Historically, once global components start moving, they maintain the course and take time to reverse. This persistence and the recent decline in global components of core and noncore inflation suggest that the world disinflationary process will continue, as shown in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/cook-20240710-fig4.PNG" id="fig5">figure 4</a>. The predicted path is in line with a gradual return of inflation toward central bank targets.</p>
<p>Of note, as shown in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/cook-20240710-fig5.PNG" id="fig6">figure 5</a>, the authors find that the post-pandemic rise in global inflation was linked to both commodity-driven price shocks and shocks to global economic activity&mdash;such as the sharp decline and rebound in activity due to the COVID‑19 pandemic and the associated labor market shortages. This situation contrasts with the 1970s and 1980s, when commodity price shocks played a prominent role in inflation's fluctuations. Additionally, idiosyncratic shocks were important drivers of the surge in global inflation in 2022 and its decline in 2023. These shocks may capture economy-specific forces, including natural gas disruptions that more greatly affected European economies than others in the aftermath of Russia's war on Ukraine.</p>
<p>In sum, through the lens of the model, the ongoing disinflation is driven by waning effects of commodity price shocks and by a gradual normalization of global economic activity, amid the resolution of shortages and imbalances in labor markets.</p>
<p><strong>Current Common Monetary Policy Challenges</strong><br />With global components of inflation turning down, most countries have experienced a significant fall in inflation relative to its peak. Similarly, most central banks stopped raising their policy rates over the past year. Some are considering how long to keep rates at restrictive levels or, if inflation picks up again, whether to raise rates further. The Bank of Canada, the ECB, the Swedish Riksbank, and the Swiss National Bank, have begun to cut policy rates, highlighting progress toward meeting inflation goals amid sustained softness in economic activity. Indeed, unlike in the U.S., the level of gross domestic product (GDP) in some advanced economies remains well below what would be implied by their respective pre-COVID GDP trends.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20240710a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;Even among those cutting rates, however, the future path of the policy rate is generally seen as dependent on a continuing decline of inflation toward target levels.</p>
<p>For all central banks, the question is how best to ensure continued disinflation while avoiding unnecessary damage to the economy. The generally desired outcome is a soft landing, in which inflation returns to the central bank's target inflation level or range without inducing a recession or a large increase in unemployment. How likely is such a scenario? It may be too soon to definitively say for the current economic cycle. But Fed Board staff have examined past episodes of monetary policy easing in 13 advanced economies over the past five decades. They find that soft landings are rare, according to their analysis published in another recent FEDS Notes article.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20240710a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;In most of the cases that they studied, central banks were not successful in bringing inflation back to near target in a timely manner. And when they were successful in taming inflation, it often was associated with a recession.</p>
<p>However, soft landings are not unprecedented. When such a landing occurred, on average it was associated with a smaller preceding policy tightening. Soft landings were also more likely when policy easing began with inflation already close to target and when there was a relatively firm growth backdrop. In the U.S., what I have seen so far appears to be consistent with a soft landing: Inflation has fallen significantly from its peak, and the labor market has gradually cooled but remains strong. Of course, I am closely monitoring incoming data to see how the economy further develops.</p>
<p>It is possible that some features of the recent inflation episode may make a soft landing more likely in countries around the globe. As I discussed, Bernanke and Blanchard found that much of the inflation episode came from relative price shocks and sectoral shortages that have since been resolved. And while they found that tight labor markets have since taken over as the main drivers of inflation, there are signs that such tightness is easing. For instance, in the U.S., the ratio of vacancies to unemployment has fallen back to its pre-pandemic level and the rate of voluntary quits has declined, as workers are less confident of finding a better job. Thus, my baseline forecast (and that of many outside observers) is that inflation will continue to move toward target over time, without much further rise in unemployment.</p>
<p><strong>Monetary Policy Communications</strong><br />Of course, forecasts are subject to considerable uncertainty, and policymakers must consider a range of possible outcomes. A key challenge of monetary policy communications is discussing how policy would respond to changes in the economic outlook. Central bankers are faced with a tradeoff between predictability and flexibility. On the one hand, many observers would like to know in advance what the path for the policy rate will be, while, on the other hand, a central bank needs to remain nimble and data dependent. As a result, central bankers often try to convey their "reaction function" so observers understand how policy might adapt to incoming data and the implications for the economic outlook.</p>
<p>In his recent review of forecasting for monetary policymaking and communications at the BOE, Ben Bernanke suggested that the Bank consider supplementing its published forecasts with the use of alternative scenarios to help the public understand its policy reaction function.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20240710a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;For similar reasons I try to incorporate a discussion of alternative scenarios in my own speeches. Fed policymakers, like those at many other central banks, also benefit from staff analysis using models to explore how the forecast would change relative to the baseline if certain assumptions are changed. The challenge is how to use such alternative scenarios in our official communications.</p>
<p>Policy communications are an area where we can learn a lot from what other central banks have done, and communication practices have developed over time. The BOE was an early innovator with its fan charts, which emphasized that its forecasts for GDP and inflation were subject to growing uncertainty the longer the time horizon. Of course, forecasts for economic variables need to be conditioned on some assumption of the path of policy rates. While early practice was to condition on unchanged rates or on the path of rates implied by market pricing, some central banks innovated by publishing their own forecasts for policy rates. This was originally done by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand and later by the Norges Bank and the Riksbank. Since 2012, the Federal Reserve's Summary of Economic Projections also includes the path of the policy rate that each policymaker "deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20240710a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a>&nbsp;I continue to take great interest in communications and other monetary policy practices by foreign central banks.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I think it is clear we have learned much from the experience of the past few years. I must stress that the human toll of the pandemic cannot and should not be overlooked. Purely in terms of economics, the recent period does stand out as an unusual case study. Economies around the world effectively faced the same shock at nearly the same moment. We were then able to observe how various economies around the world responded to the shock, including the actions of central banks and fiscal policymakers. I am glad to have highlighted some of the interesting research that has begun to explore this space, and I am sure much more study on this unique time in our history will soon occur, and that can be powerful. What is not unique to the pandemic is that we often have common macroeconomic experiences and face common monetary policy challenges, which is what makes discussions like the one today so valuable.</p>
<p>Thank you. It is a pleasure to be here in Adelaide. I look forward to continuing our conversation.</p>

<title>Sterling Trading Tech Resources Its Successful Asia Initiative With Local Business Development And Client Service, Korea, Hong Kong, And Singapore Markets To Benefit From Industry Experts</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sterling-trading-tech-resources-its-successful-asia-initiative-with-local-busine/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sterling-trading-tech-resources-its-successful-asia-initiative-with-local-busine/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Following on its two previous strategic announcements of launching Asia in 2024, today Sterling Trading Tech (Sterling), in response to local market demand, is building the initiative further by resourcing it with local business development experts.</span></p>
<p><span>Industry veterans Clara Lee and Jason Yoon-Hendricks have been recruited as APAC Sales Directors. Both have extensive experience in business development and relationship management. Lee was previously with Eventus and MSCI (in analytics). Prior to Sterling, Yoon-Hendricks has served with Refinitiv, Thomson Reuters, and REDI Global Technology. They are responsible for building out Asia market share &ndash; part of Sterling&rsquo;s overall growth plan and trajectory.</span></p>
<p><span>Korea, Hong Kong, and Singapore increasingly seek sophisticated OMS and Risk models as well as trading capability that can provide firms with a competitive advantage. Sterling is poised to meet that demand.&nbsp;To date, 2024 has&nbsp;seen substantial interest in and success with Sterling&rsquo;s approach.</span></p>
<p><span>Sterling&rsquo;s multi-asset OMS enhances liquidity and alpha generation in U.S. equities and options. It fosters client growth and competitiveness by creating operational and infrastructure efficiencies. Sterling OMS offers real-time balances and positions, advanced margin methodologies, customizable risk controls, broad reporting capabilities, and API connectivity, enabling seamless trading. Advanced order queuing allows traders to place orders at any time and receive international orders in real time outside of U.S. trading hours.</span></p>
<p><span>The Risk &amp; Margin capability is delivered across a menu of technical alternatives, covers U.S. &amp; International equities and options, Fixed Income and Futures and delivers proprietary and unique RegTech capability. This includes Risk &amp; Margin together in one system, and RegT and Custom House Policy Updates in real time. Post-execution analysis is done using real-time market data.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Said Jennifer Nayar, Sterling Trading Tech CEO: &ldquo;Our overall Asia initiative has proven to be productive YTD in 2024 and merits this prudent investment in local business development. Both Clara and Jason each bring with them substantial networks, local expertise, and broad and deep knowledge of client demands. We anticipate exponential growth as a result of their efforts and are excited to have them on the team.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>Said Andrew Actman, Managing Director of Business Development, at Sterling: &ldquo;Our expectation that Asia was underserved in the robust OMS and Risk and Margin models that Sterling delivers has proven to be correct. As we look to our Asia strategy, we now have local presence to focus on creating continued opportunities and to service clients already onboarded.&rdquo;</span></p>

<title>US Office Of The Comptroller Of The Currency Amends Enforcement Action Against Citibank, Assesses $75 Million Civil Money Penalty</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> amendment, Citibank, OCC, deficiency, penalty
Summary: 
The OCC issued an amendment to the Cease and Desist Order against Citibank, imposing a $75 million penalty for compliance violations. The bank must address deficiencies in risk management, compliance, data governance, and internal controls. The penalty will be paid to the U.S. Treasury. The Federal Reserve Board also took a related action against Citigroup. <div>
<p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) today issued an amendment to its October 7, 2020, Cease and Desist Order against Citibank, N.A, Sioux Falls, South Dakota, related to deficiencies in enterprise-wide risk management, compliance risk management, data governance, and internal controls (2020 Order).</p>
<p>The amendment is based on the bank&rsquo;s failure to meet remediation milestones and make sufficient and sustainable progress towards compliance with the 2020 Order. It was issued to ensure Citibank prioritizes the remediation work, including through the allocation of sufficient resources.</p>
<p>The amendment supplements but does not replace the 2020 Order, which remains in full force and effect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Citibank must see through its transformation and fully address in a timely manner its longstanding deficiencies,&rdquo; said Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael J. Hsu. &ldquo;While the bank&rsquo;s board and management have made meaningful progress overall, including taking necessary steps to simplify the bank, certain persistent weaknesses remain, in particular with regard to data. Today&rsquo;s amendment requires the bank to refocus its efforts on taking necessary corrective actions and ensuring appropriate resources are allocated for this purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The OCC also assessed a $75 million civil money penalty against Citibank based on the bank&rsquo;s violations of the 2020 Order and lack of processes to monitor the impact of data quality concerns on regulatory reporting.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve Board took a separate but related action against Citigroup, the bank's holding company.</p>
<p>The OCC penalty will be paid to the U.S. Treasury.</p>

<div> Fed Listens, Event, Monetary policy, Chicago, Economic conditions
Summary:<br />
Fed Listens event in Chicago to discuss economic conditions, childcare, and employment. Panelists and audience provide insights to inform policymaking. <div>
<p>Thank you, Austan, for the warm welcome. It is really a pleasure to join you in Chicago for this year's&nbsp;<em>Fed Listens</em>&nbsp;event.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240710a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;When we started&nbsp;<em>Fed Listens</em>&nbsp;back in 2019, the initiative was part of a broad, comprehensive review of the decisionmaking framework we use to pursue our monetary policy goals of maximum employment and price stability. In the years that followed, we have met with people from across the country and from a wide variety of backgrounds and experiences to learn about how the economy has been recovering from the COVID experience.</p>
<p>Each&nbsp;<em>Fed Listens</em>&nbsp;event created a wonderful opportunity to take a step back, to ask questions of those who are directly impacted by our policies and the prevailing economic conditions, and then really&nbsp;<em>listen&nbsp;</em>to their feedback. I am extremely proud that&nbsp;<em>Fed Listens</em>&nbsp;has grown and developed into an ongoing venue for the Federal Reserve Board and the Reserve Banks to foster an ongoing conversation and discussion with those who are directly experiencing current economic conditions.</p>
<p>As many of you may recall, at last year's&nbsp;<em>Fed Listens&nbsp;</em>event here in Chicago, we discussed youth employment and joining the labor force following the pandemic, which were especially inspiring. So, in that spirit, today is not only a wonderful opportunity to continue this important conversation in the Seventh District, but also an opportunity to dig deeper into issues that affect local families through the childcare industry, working parents, and employers.</p>
<p>Austan and I enjoyed getting to know our panelists better earlier today, and I am looking forward to learning more about their experiences through the upcoming panels and discussions. I am also very pleased to welcome our audience&mdash;both in person and those tuning in online. I view&nbsp;<em>Fed Listens</em>&nbsp;as an excellent example of Board and System convenings that enable us to gain important insights about economic conditions by engaging directly with those experiencing the economy.</p>
<p>As you all know, Fed officials and economists review a vast amount of economic data on a regular basis. Discussions like those we will engage in today provide color and context to supplement the other economic data we monitor. Your perspectives help us gain deeper insights into how we are meeting our dual mandate of maintaining maximum employment and stable prices.</p>
<p>A better understanding of a wide variety of this type of data, from the considerations families face in making spending decisions (including the costs of childcare) to factors weighed by business owners in applying for loans and offering benefits to help attract top talent, all provide better insight into our data collection. These conversations help us to gain perspective on how Americans in different areas of the country are faring. Some of the issues discussed today may be unique to the Seventh District, but certainly many of these themes and dynamics are present throughout the country and across all 12 Federal Reserve Districts. Seeking out local perspectives is one of the great advantages of the Federal Reserve System's regional structure and of the&nbsp;<em>Fed Listens&nbsp;</em>structure in particular.</p>
<p>Earlier, I had the pleasure to meet each of the panelists you'll hear from today. Their varied experiences and backgrounds across sectors lay an important foundation for today's discussion. We hope that our attendees will also join in to share your own observations as you experience these issues in your own lives, businesses, and communities. Your perspective will help to inform our work as policymakers with the responsibility to promote a strong and vibrant economy for all Americans.</p>
<p>So with that, I would like to say, thank you again, Austan, and especially to recognize your entire Chicago Fed team for hosting this&nbsp;<em>Fed Listens</em>&nbsp;event today and for the opportunity to be part of this discussion.</p>
<p>Without further ado, I am delighted to get our conversation started by turning things over to Robin Newberger, who is a policy advisor here at the Chicago Fed.</p>

<div> Securities, Enforcement Division, Crypto, Fraud, Investor harm
Summary:
Gurbir S. Grewal, the director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, delivered a speech at a symposium on regulating finance in the changing administrative state, addressing the application of securities laws to crypto asset securities, investor harm, compliance, and public trust. He discussed the history of the securities laws and the need to differentiate between the substance and form of transactions in applying these laws. Grewal also emphasized the need for robust enforcement to protect investors and enhance public trust. In the epilogue, Grewal provided an update on recent developments in crypto markets, including the increase in investor complaints, the decline in public trust, and the SEC's continued efforts to address noncompliance and protect investors. <div>

<p>What follows is a speech I delivered at the William &amp; Mary Business Law Review&rsquo;s Third Annual Symposium entitled &ldquo;Regulating Finance in a Changing Administrative State&rdquo; on April 1, 2023. Since then, there have been many developments in the world of crypto asset securities, some of which I address in an epilogue to the speech, below.</p>

<p>I. Everything &ldquo;New&rdquo; is Old&mdash;Really Old&mdash;and Well-Established</p>
<p>II. Investors in Crypto Asset Securities Are Being Harmed as We Speak</p>
<p>III. Innovation and Compliance Are Not Incompatible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>IV. Public Trust Requires Robust Enforcement of the Securities Laws.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Epilogue</p>
<p class="text-align-center"><a id="intro"></a>Introduction</p>
<p>Thank you to the&nbsp;<i>William &amp; Mary Business Law Review</i>&nbsp;for hosting this symposium and for inviting me to participate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thrilled to be back at my law school alma mater. This is a special place &ndash; one that not only helped me hone my legal skills, but also one that helped mold me into a &ldquo;citizen lawyer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For me, it was my experience with the late Professor John Levy and participating in the legal aid clinic that he ran that first showed me how we can use our law degrees to not only protect, but also to uplift others. It&rsquo;s an experience that has helped shape my entire public service journey.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m grateful that the law school continues to train excellent citizen lawyers&mdash;a number of whom I&rsquo;ve had the privilege of working with during my time as New Jersey Attorney General and now at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (&ldquo;SEC&rdquo;).</p>
<p>I am equally grateful that in developing the next generation of citizen lawyers the law school is emphasizing inclusion &ndash; a core value that has guided much of my work.</p>
<p class="text-align-center">* * *</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s topic &ndash; &ldquo;Regulating Finance in a Changing Administrative State&rdquo; &ndash; is no doubt a timely one, but also one that could easily serve as my job description. And the panels you&rsquo;ve organized touch on nearly every aspect of our work in the Enforcement Division.</p>
<p>So naturally, I have many thoughts I would like to share with you, but before I do, I must make clear that my remarks today are in my official capacity as the Director of the Division of Enforcement, but do not necessarily reflect the views of the Commission, the Commissioners, or other members of the staff.</p>
<p>Perhaps I should also add to that disclaimer that the views I plan to share this morning may not be the most popular you will hear today. I think that is because the theme underlying this symposium is a concept that I not only disagree with, but is also one that is frequently advanced in some corners&mdash;that technological innovations have so dramatically transformed the financial markets since the 1930s, when Congress first passed the federal securities laws and created the SEC to enforce them,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[1]</a>&nbsp;that those laws are now somehow ill-suited to regulate our financial markets, especially when it comes to crypto assets.</p>
<p>Some of our critics&mdash;perhaps a number of you&mdash;argue, instead, that new, bespoke rules and regulations are needed for this particular industry. They believe that this is best achieved either through notice and comment agency rulemaking or by Congress developing an entirely new regulatory framework for crypto assets.</p>
<p>At the same time, a number of defendants are using newly crafted legal concepts like the &ldquo;major questions doctrine,&rdquo; to challenge certain SEC enforcement actions as being beyond the authorities Congress delegated to the SEC.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[2]</a></p>
<p>You will no doubt discuss all of these issues and more throughout the day, but in many cases you will do so in the abstract. What I would like to do this morning is provide you with some context because the securities laws are anything but abstract to the millions of investors that are harmed when promoters of securities, including crypto asset securities, and others engage in fraudulent activity or otherwise violate our rules and regulations.</p>
<p class="text-align-center"><a id="everything"></a>I. Everything &ldquo;New&rdquo; is Old&mdash;Really Old&mdash;and Well-Established</p>
<p>The history of our securities laws makes clear that Congress always intended the definition of what is a security to be principles-based and flexible to cover the many kinds of schemes where promoters seek others&rsquo; money and promise profits in return.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[3]</a></p>
<p>Following the stock market crash of 1929, in the midst of the Great Depression and during a period of grave economic crisis, there was a general loss of trust in our financial markets. In response, Congress passed the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which created the SEC, to protect investors and the markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[4]</a></p>
<p>A key feature of the Securities Act was to require companies offering &ldquo;securities&rdquo; and raising money from the public to register their offerings with the SEC and to provide investors full, fair, and truthful disclosures of material information about their offerings, their financial health, and their executives.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[5]</a>&nbsp;The Act defined &ldquo;securities&rdquo; broadly to include various kinds of investments, including what it called an &ldquo;investment contract.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[6]</a></p>
<p>No sooner was the Act passed than companies began arguing that whatever they were doing did not constitute the offer and sale of securities and, therefore, they did not need to comply with the law&rsquo;s registration requirements. To support their positions, the companies often focused on the name or form of the product or transaction, not its substance. They argued that because their form of offering was not specifically enumerated by statute, it did not need to be registered.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[7]</a></p>
<p>Sound familiar?</p>
<p>And as happens today, back then the SEC sued to stop ongoing unregistered securities offerings. Time and again, federal courts focused on the economic reality of the transactions at issue and the broad investor protections Congress intended to advance in enacting the federal securities laws.</p>
<p>And time and again, those courts determined that the transactions at issue&mdash;ranging from investment opportunities in oil barrels to fishing boats to silver foxes&mdash;did in fact constitute the offer or sale of securities.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[8]</a><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>And then in 1946, the Supreme Court issued its seminal opinion in&nbsp;<i>SEC v. Howey</i>, setting forth the test for what constitutes an &ldquo;investment contract,&rdquo; and therefore a security, for purposes of the federal securities laws.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[9]</a>&nbsp;The Court explained that Congress intended &ldquo;investment contract&rdquo; to apply broadly to a variety of situations in which individuals invested money in a common enterprise with the expectation that they would earn a profit through the efforts of others.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[10]</a>&nbsp;This approach &ldquo;embodie[d] a flexible rather than a static principle, one that is capable of adaptation to meet the countless and variable schemes devised by those who seek the use of the money of others on the promise of profits.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[11]</a></p>
<p>And&nbsp;<i>Howey&nbsp;</i>has proven to be a remarkably flexible and resilient test that courts have since applied to find a wide variety of offerings to be investment contracts and, thus, securities. The list includes offerings related to whiskey, cosmetics, self-improvement courses, and pay phones,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[12]</a>&nbsp;as well as a surprising number of creatures: earthworms, beavers, chinchillas, and even cattle embryos.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[13]</a></p>
<p>Notably, none of these offerings involved stocks or bonds or the kinds of investments you or I might have in our portfolios. And that&rsquo;s really the point of&nbsp;<i>Howey</i>: whether something is a security depends on the&nbsp;<i>substance</i>&nbsp;of the transaction &ndash; not its name, not its form, and not its underlying technology.</p>
<p>As Justice Thurgood Marshall put it decades later, &ldquo;Congress painted with a broad brush,&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[14]</a>&nbsp;and its &ldquo;purpose in enacting the securities laws was to regulate investments, in whatever form they are made and by whatever name they are called.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[15]</a></p>
<p>Critics who now dismiss&nbsp;<i>Howey&nbsp;</i>as outdated because it involved orange groves nearly 80 years ago and demand a new regulatory regime overlook this history and, I think, completely miss the point: the definition of a security is, and has always been, principles-based to allow for the flexibility that comes with innovative investment products, technology-driven or otherwise.</p>
<p class="text-align-center"><a id="investors"></a>II. Investors in Crypto Asset Securities Are Being Harmed as We Speak</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, the &ldquo;major question&rdquo; for us is: are investors being hurt within our remit? If the answer is yes, then we must act, and we must do so with a sense of urgency. And increasingly, the answer to that question has been yes.</p>
<p>The current turmoil in the crypto markets is taking a real toll on everyday Americans. According to one survey, approximately 16% of U.S. adults have invested, traded, or used crypto, and among that group approximately 46% report their investments have done worse than they expected.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[16]</a>&nbsp;While some of this may be the result of natural market forces, some of it is certainly due to fraud and other unlawful activity.</p>
<p>Let me give you an overview of the type of activity we are encountering because it&rsquo;s quite often left out of conversations like the ones you will have at this conference. To date, the SEC has charged many issuers with failing to register initial coin offerings, as well as their offerings of so-called lend, earn, and staking products, meaning that the offerings lacked required disclosures &ndash; disclosures that ensure that investors can make informed investment decisions.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[17]</a></p>
<p>The SEC has also alleged in a number of our actions that certain unregistered crypto offerings are nothing but straight rips, Ponzi schemes, affinity frauds, or other types of scams.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[18]</a></p>
<p>In the actions the SEC has recently brought in this space, our allegations have described, among other things:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Body">Products labeled as &ldquo;defi&rdquo; offerings that are neither decentralized, nor finance, but rather frauds;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[19]</a></li>
<li class="Body">Stablecoins that are neither stable, nor coins, but rather fraudulent;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[20]</a></li>
<li class="Body">So-called &ldquo;trusted&rdquo; protocols and &ldquo;smart contracts&rdquo; that, despite representations to the contrary, can be, and are, used to manipulate the market for crypto asset securities;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[21]</a></li>
<li class="Body">Platforms, protocols, and exchanges that fail to provide any details about their cybersecurity risks subjected to malicious attacks that result in investor harm;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[22]</a>&nbsp;and</li>
<li class="Body">In the end, investors, large and small, defrauded, and billions in customer assets misused or stolen.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[23]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of these alleged schemes have resulted in lines of investor victims at the doors of bankruptcy courts hoping to recover a fraction of their hard-earned money.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[24]</a></p>
<p>And just this week, the SEC alleged that a noncompliant crypto intermediary simultaneously acted as exchange, broker, and clearing agency without registering with the SEC&mdash;thereby putting investors at risk from conflicts of interest and inadequate oversight.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[25]</a></p>
<p>So, while we can appreciate the innovation around, and the technological advancements of, blockchain and distributed ledger technology, we must also be cognizant of the risks and harms to investors associated with the related products and offerings. As in any other space, we have a duty to analyze whether the activity is subject to the federal securities laws and, if so, whether those laws have been violated.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s precisely what we have done. Over the last decade, based on Enforcement Division investigations and recommendations, the SEC has brought well over 100 crypto-related actions involving unlawful activity across the crypto markets as I have just outlined.</p>
<p>And in every case, where federal courts have had to determine whether there were &ldquo;securities&rdquo; at issue, the courts have applied the&nbsp;<i>Howey</i>&nbsp;test&mdash;looked at the economic realities of the offerings, and, even though the offerings at issue involved supposedly novel technologies, rejected defense arguments that they were not securities.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[26]</a></p>
<p>During this same period, the SEC has spoken clearly and consistently about the applicability of the securities laws in the crypto space, citing decades of Supreme Court precedent explaining the test for determining whether something is an &ldquo;investment contract,&rdquo; and thus a security.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[27]</a></p>
<p>To put it bluntly, there is not a lawyer or market participant in this area that does not know the applicable regulatory framework and tests. As Chair Gensler has stated, &ldquo;Not liking the message isn&rsquo;t the same thing as not receiving it.&rdquo;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29">[28]</a>&nbsp;That is also likely why courts have rejected &ldquo;fair notice&rdquo; and due process arguments in a number of these actions.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30">[29]</a></p>
<p class="text-align-center"><a id="innovation"></a>III. Innovation and Compliance Are Not Incompatible</p>
<p>I would like to turn now to another topic that also sometimes gets lost in the headlines, and that is the importance of compliance in the crypto markets.</p>
<p>First, when issuers of crypto asset securities do not comply with registration requirements, investors and analysts do not get mandatory disclosures about the issuer, their offerings, and their financial condition. Investors cannot make informed investment decisions without that information. Disclosures that are especially important in a market of thousands of different offerings involving technology that most laypeople do not understand.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31">[30]</a></p>
<p>Second, in a compliant securities market, separate functions generally are performed by different legal entities, each of which are subject to separate regulations that protect investors. This creates separation and even a healthy degree of antagonism between the functions: brokers do not want to execute their clients&rsquo; trades on questionable exchanges, and exchanges do not want to work with unreliable clearing agencies. Importantly, national securities exchanges do not take custody of assets that trade on the exchange and thus do not have the ability to lend them out or use them to make risky bets.</p>
<p>In contrast, in the crypto world sometimes these functions collapse under one roof, as we alleged just this week with respect to the Beaxy exchange.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32">[31]</a>&nbsp;This aggregation of functions creates significant conflicts of interest and exponentially increases risk of investor harm as we saw with the collapse of FTX, where we allege that Sam Bankman-Fried and others not only fraudulently raised billions of dollars from investors in FTX, but also misused billions in funds belonging to FTX&rsquo;s trading customers.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33">[32]</a></p>
<p>Finally, in a compliant securities market, the firms fulfilling these various functions, such as exchanges, broker-dealers, and clearinghouses, are subject to supervision, oversight, and examination by the SEC.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34">[33]</a>&nbsp;Among other things, they are required to maintain books and records and make them available to the SEC, and they are required to have internal controls.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35">[34]</a>&nbsp;This all provides additional, essential layers of protection for investors.</p>
<p>The quarrel, therefore, is with noncompliant actors, not the technology or its promises. The technology is actually beside the point. We have to regulate markets and protect investors based on current realities and existing risks. There are no exceptions to the application of the federal securities laws based on the future potential or benefits that an offering may provide.</p>
<p>Moreover, innovation and compliance with the securities laws are not mutually exclusive. As Chair Gensler has repeatedly stated, the SEC staff stand ready to work with crypto entrepreneurs and understand the need to be flexible in applying our disclosure requirements.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36">[35]</a></p>
<p class="text-align-center"><a id="public"></a>IV. Public Trust Requires Robust Enforcement of the Securities Laws</p>
<p>I would like to finish by touching on a topic that&rsquo;s important to this conversation and a bit personal for me: public trust.</p>
<p>In my early speeches as Enforcement Director, I spoke about the declining trust in our financial institutions and markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37">[36]</a>&nbsp;While there is no single cause for this decline, it is in part due to the perception that we&mdash;the regulators&mdash;are failing to hold bad actors accountable, coupled with the belief that there are two sets of rules: one for the big and powerful and another for everyone else.</p>
<p>None of this is abstract either. I&rsquo;ve seen it firsthand as a federal, county, and state prosecutor. I saw it firsthand speaking to victims as my state&rsquo;s attorney general, and I see it now in this role. And the effects of this diminished trust can be especially pronounced among minority and marginalized communities.</p>
<p>For example, studies show that a majority of Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, and LGBTQ Americans feel that traditional financial institutions &ldquo;are not meant for people like me.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38">[37]</a>&nbsp;Due to historical injustices and negative experiences, many members of these communities may also have skepticism, or outright hostility, towards the government.</p>
<p>This lack of trust can lead to further victimization. I&rsquo;ve seen this with certain types of affinity frauds, especially among immigrant communities, where the perpetrator may appeal to the victims&rsquo; closeness to their own community and potentially their suspicion of outsiders.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39">[38]</a></p>
<p>Not infrequently, we encounter suspicion so strong that the victims are reluctant to cooperate with us or believe our allegations even in the face of overwhelming evidence of the fraud.</p>
<p>And through these experiences, I have developed a playbook, one that we are employing at the Enforcement Division, to protect investors and reclaim and enhance public trust. It&rsquo;s built on three principles:&nbsp;<span><i>robust enforcement</i></span>&nbsp;&ndash; moving our investigations with a sense of urgency and addressing emerging risks;&nbsp;<span><i>robust remedies</i></span>&nbsp;&ndash; seeking penalties and remedies at levels adequate to both hold bad actors accountable and deter misconduct; and&nbsp;<span><i>robust compliance &shy;&shy;</i>&shy;&shy;&ndash;&nbsp;</span>working with market participants and gatekeepers to create a culture of compliance and cooperation to prevent misconduct.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40">[39]</a></p>
<p>Another response to this decline in trust has been the &ldquo;predatory inclusion&rdquo; tactics of crypto entities directed at Black, brown, and other marginalized communities.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41">[40]</a>&nbsp;Here, I&rsquo;m talking about the familiar (but so far unsupported) narratives that crypto will be predicated on a permissionless and trustless environment; that it will increase financial inclusion;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42">[41]</a>&nbsp;that it will uplift the unbanked or underbanked; that it will help them build wealth and increase upward mobility; and that if you &ldquo;step right up, everyone&rsquo;s a winner.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43">[42]</a></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also seen predatory tactics on full display in case after case, where the SEC has alleged that &ldquo;influencers&rdquo; are touting unregistered offerings to investors without disclosing that they are being compensated to do so.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44">[43]</a>&nbsp;We allege they do so by lying about their returns from their own, in some cases fictional, crypto investments, and without disclosing they are being paid tens of thousands of dollars for their tweets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45">[44]</a></p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s the direct result of these efforts or for other reasons beyond the scope of this presentation, crypto assets are the only major financial products that Black Americans are more likely to own than white Americans.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46">[45]</a>&nbsp;And there is some evidence that Black and brown investors have now been disproportionately harmed during the downturn of crypto markets over the last two years.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47">[46]</a></p>
<p>But despite such losses in the crypto industry, distrust in the traditional financial system is still driving investors towards crypto. We saw that just a few weeks ago when the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and questions about the stability of the wider banking system pushed increased interest in crypto assets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48">[47]</a></p>
<p>In some ways, we are now at the intersection of the two responses to addressing diminished public trust I just outlined. People who looked to crypto as a refuge from the ills of traditional finance are now experiencing those same ills in the crypto markets. They are being harmed by the very types of behavior that led Congress to create the securities laws in the first place&mdash;the same behaviors that have led to reduced trust in the markets: misstatements or misleading disclosures, conflicts of interest, and insiders abusing their positions for personal advantages at the expense of ordinary investors.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49">[48]</a></p>
<p>I believe that in this moment, we have to leverage the playbook I described. We must act with all the tools at our disposal to protect investors and enhance public trust and confidence in our markets.</p>
<p>This means continuing to get behind the labels, focusing on substance over form, ensuring that actors comply with the securities laws, and holding those that do not accountable, without fear or favor.</p>
<p class="text-align-center"><a id="conclusion"></a>Conclusion</p>
<p>In the end, I believe that it should be against this backdrop of real investor harm, precedent, and the need to enhance public trust and confidence in our markets, that you consider the familiar industry talking points (or tweets in this day and age), that I&rsquo;m certain you&rsquo;ll hear (or reference) throughout the day&mdash;that according to some we are exceeding our authority, regulating by enforcement, stifling innovation, and driving it overseas.</p>
<p>As long as investors in securities are being harmed now, we must act now.</p>
<p>Thank you again to the&nbsp;<i>William &amp; Mary Business Law Review</i>&nbsp;for inviting me to speak to you today. I am privileged to have had this opportunity and I hope that you have a great, contextualized discussion today.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p class="text-align-center"><a id="epilogue"></a>Epilogue</p>
<p>By the time I became Enforcement Director in July 2021, the SEC had already brought dozens of enforcement actions to address widespread noncompliance in the crypto markets. But, noncompliance, and the attendant investor risk, remained pervasive. Meanwhile, four months later, the combined market capitalization of crypto assets reached approximately $3 trillion.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50">[49]</a>&nbsp;This marked a 15-fold increase from just two years earlier.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51">[50]</a>&nbsp;Soon after, however, the crypto market cratered, abetted by a series of high-profile failures and bankruptcies of major firms that caused extensive investor losses.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52">[51]</a>&nbsp;It lost two-thirds of its market capitalization in just nine months, shedding value even quicker than it had gained it.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53">[52]</a><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>In short, my tenure as Director has coincided with extreme volatility and investor risk in the crypto markets. This has been vividly demonstrated by the dramatic increase in the number of complaints about crypto that investors submitted to the SEC&rsquo;s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy (&ldquo;OIEA&rdquo;), from 820 in fiscal year 2019,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54">[53]</a>&nbsp;the first year that OIEA&rsquo;s annual list of Top Ten Categories of Complaints included crypto, to 5,357 in fiscal year 2023.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55">[54]</a></p>
<p>In response to this upheaval and rampant noncompliance, we have redoubled our enforcement efforts, some of which I was privileged to highlight in my speech at William &amp; Mary. Perhaps unsurprisingly, there have been even more developments in the crypto markets since those remarks. Just days later, the Pew Research Center released a survey finding that nearly a third of Americans who had ever invested in, traded, or used crypto, no longer held any.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56">[55]</a>&nbsp;The number of lower-income Americans who had gotten out of crypto was even higher, at 43%,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57">[56]</a>&nbsp;providing another vivid rejoinder to the narrative that crypto will uplift the unbanked, help them build wealth, and increase upward mobility.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58">[57]</a></p>
<p>The same survey found that a whopping three-quarters of Americans who have heard about crypto do not believe that crypto is reliable and safe.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59">[58]</a>&nbsp;Given the continued noncompliance in this space, they have good reasons to be concerned. For example, in June 2023, the SEC charged the operators of the largest crypto asset trading platform in the world with allegedly combining the functions of an exchange, broker, dealer, and clearing agency without complying with the registration provisions of the federal securities laws applicable to any of those functions, depriving investors of crucial investor protections.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60">[59]</a>&nbsp;The SEC&rsquo;s complaint also alleged that the operators commingled certain customer assets and attempted to evade U.S. securities laws by announcing sham controls that they disregarded so that they could keep high-value U.S. customers on their platforms.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61">[60]</a></p>
<p>The next day, the SEC also charged the operator of the largest crypto asset trading platform in the United States with intertwining the traditional services of an exchange, broker, and clearing agency without complying with the registration provisions applicable to any of them.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn62" name="_ftnref62">[61]</a>&nbsp;Taken together, these matters, which were brought just about two months after my remarks, highlight what I believe to be the continued risk to investors in the crypto markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn63" name="_ftnref63">[62]</a></p>
<p>As if that were not enough, the Enforcement Division continues to address fraud and noncompliance in new and old forms in the crypto space. Among others, the SEC filed its first actions charging the illegal unregistered offerings of crypto asset securities in the form of purported non-fungible tokens (NFTs), applying the same well-trod test discussed above to determine that the NFTs were offered and sold as &ldquo;investment contracts,&rdquo; and therefore were securities.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn64" name="_ftnref64">[63]</a>&nbsp;The SEC also brought its first case charging a purportedly decentralized autonomous organization with failing to register its pooled crypto asset vehicles as investment companies, as required under the federal securities laws.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn65" name="_ftnref65">[64]</a>&nbsp;And in another recent action, the SEC brought charges against individuals allegedly responsible for a $1.7 billion crypto asset-related pyramid scheme.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn66" name="_ftnref66">[65]</a></p>
<p>Also notable, since my remarks, several courts have issued rulings in ongoing litigation expressly reaffirming&nbsp;<i>Howey&rsquo;s&nbsp;</i>application to crypto assets and rejecting not only the defendants&rsquo; blanket arguments that the crypto assets at issue were not securities, but also, in the cases where the court addressed it, their attempt to invoke the &ldquo;major questions doctrine.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn67" name="_ftnref67">[66]</a></p>
<p>In addition, in April 2024, the SEC completed its first trial involving crypto asset securities. After a nine-day trial, a jury in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York found the defendants liable for orchestrating what the SEC alleged was a years-long fraud involving crypto asset securities that led to massive investor losses when the scheme unraveled.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn68" name="_ftnref68">[67]</a>&nbsp;Following the verdict, the defendants agreed to pay more than $4.5 billion in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn69" name="_ftnref69">[68]</a></p>
<p>In sum, the crypto markets remain fast-moving, volatile, and, I believe, rife with investor risk. But as the foregoing remarks and this epilogue make clear (and if the past and my remarks at William &amp; Mary are prologue), the Division of Enforcement has moved with urgency, and will continue to do so, to fulfill our investor protection mandate in these markets.</p>

<div> NGX, Impact Board, sustainability instruments, green bond, Nigeria <br />
NGX introduces Impact Board for sustainability instruments, coinciding with Green Bond Advisory Group Meeting, aiming to drive responsible investing. <br /><br />Summary: NGX launches Impact Board for sustainable finance, attracting domestic and international investment, setting new standard for responsible investing in Nigeria. <div>
<p>Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) has unveiled its Impact Board, a dedicated platform for listing sustainability instruments, following approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This initiative was announced during a Closing Gong Ceremony in Lagos on Wednesday, July 10th, honoring Mr. Balarabe Abbas Lawal, Minister of Environment, and commemorating the 8th Green Bond Advisory Group Meeting.</p>
<p>The ceremony, which saw Mr. Lawal, Co-Chair, Green Bond Advisory Group Meeting, engage with investors and stakeholders on the proposed federal government Green Bond issuance, brought together key figures in Nigeria's financial and environmental sectors. Attendees included Dr. Emomotimi Agama, Director-General of the SEC, alongside delegates from the Debt Management Office, Ministry of Environment, issuers, and issuing houses.</p>
<p>This launch marks a pivotal moment in NGX's steadfast commitment to integrating sustainability into the core of Nigeria's capital market. By providing a high-visibility platform for sustainability instruments, NGX aims to usher in a new era of responsible investing, offering forward-thinking issuers access to purpose-driven capital.</p>
<p>Addressing the pressing environmental challenges facing the country, Mr. Lawal emphasized, "With issues like flooding, pollution, and deforestation, we urgently need funds to tackle them. This is why we are approaching the market." His sentiment was echoed by Dr. Agama, who affirmed SEC's support: "We are ready to bolster the sustainable finance market, aiming to deepen it with diverse instruments that contribute to Nigeria's sustainable development."</p>
<p>Alhaji (Dr.) Umaru Kwairanga, Group Chairman, Nigerian Exchange Group (NGX Group) highlighted NGX's capabilities, stating, "We possess the capacity, resources, and technology to raise the funds required by the Federal Ministry of Environment and the Nigerian economy to achieve the goals outlined in the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals."</p>
<p>Mr. Ahonsi Unuigbe, Chairman of NGX, underscored the significance of the Impact Board, noting its potential to encourage issuers like the Federal Government to leverage the market for financing strategic, sustainability-focused projects.</p>
<p>Further emphasizing the Group's commitment, Mr. Temi Popoola, Group Managing Director and CEO of NGX Group, stated, "We are dedicated to driving sustainability with the right frameworks, which is why giving visibility to this class of instruments is crucial for achieving our goals."</p>
<p>Mr. Jude Chiemeka, CEO of NGX, framed the launch as more than just a new platform, describing it as "a paradigm shift in how we approach finance and development." This sentiment was reinforced by Mr. Abimbola Babalola, Head of Trading and Products at NGX, who highlighted the Board's potential to foster capital-raising opportunities and create new tradeable products for investors.</p>
<p>The timing of the Impact Board's launch, coinciding with the 8th Green Bond Advisory Group Meeting, underscores the growing momentum behind sustainable finance initiatives in Nigeria. This synergy between governmental environmental strategies and market-driven solutions promises to accelerate the country's progress towards its sustainability goals.</p>
<p>As Nigeria steps into this new chapter of sustainable finance, the Impact Board stands poised to attract both domestic and international investment, driving growth and supporting the nation's sustainable development agenda. This innovative platform not only represents NGX's vision for the future but also sets a new standard for responsible investing in Africa's largest economy, potentially serving as a model for other emerging markets.</p>

<div> Severe weather, Cape of Good Hope, container traffic, LSEG Shipping Research, strong cyclone
Summary:<br />Severe weather halts container traffic near Cape of Good Hope. LSEG analysis shows no ships passing since July 8th. Predicts a record-breaking Atlantic hurricane season. AAO positive phase may signal the end of strong cyclones. Another cyclone may impact South Africa later this week. Waves off South Africa coincided with a strong cyclone and below-normal temperatures. <div>
<p><span>Severe weather conditions near the Cape of Good Hope has brought container traffic to a halt this week according to analysis by LSEG Shipping Research.</span></p>
<p><span>Since Monday 8<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;July, daily transit data and vessel location data via the LSEG Workspace Interactive Map show no containerships passing the Cape&nbsp;of&nbsp;Good&nbsp;Hope &ndash; adding to congestion and delays exacerbated by the Red Sea crisis. The Interactive Map layer shows marine weather and waves over 10m high.</span></p>
<p><span><b>Fabrice Maille, Global Head of&nbsp;Shipping &amp; Agriculture at LSEG</b>, comments:&nbsp;<i>"We have a complete stop at the Cape&nbsp;of&nbsp;Good&nbsp;Hope for containerships &ndash; east and west. There is no significant change in Red Sea traffic so far, but several containerships have made turnarounds and/or are waiting&nbsp;off the coast of Durban.&rdquo;</i></span></p>
<p><span><b>Isaac Hankes, Senior Weather Analyst, at LSEG</b>&nbsp;noted that the waves off the South Africa coast coincided with a strong cyclone that impacted the region on the last Sunday, and it was associated with temperatures that were well below normal.</span></p>
<p><span>He comments:<i>&nbsp;&ldquo;This was a powerful cyclone (with winds that generated the waves), but we are not seeing anything extraordinary in the data. Something comparable happened in early June, for example. These events are like a cold air outbreak in the South Africa winter, in the Northern Hemisphere context.&rdquo;</i></span></p>
<p><span>He also added:<i>&nbsp;&ldquo;There is another cyclone likely to impact South Africa later this week, so the issue with the waves may continue yet with respect to shipping issues. However, the AAO will soon move into its positive phase, which could signal the end&nbsp;of&nbsp;strong cyclones after the one later this week.&rdquo;</i></span></p>
<p><span>These precedents support LSEG Commodities' recent forecast that showcased a possibly record-breaking Atlantic hurricane season this year, which is following the expected pattern after the effects of Beryl as an exceptionally strong storm for this time of the year.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>Thanks very much to our hosts at Asia House today. It is a great pleasure to be here and have the opportunity to discuss the outlook for UK monetary policy with such a distinguished group.</p>
<h3>Transformation</h3>
<p>The monetary policy function at the Bank of England has recently been the subject of a review by ex-Federal Reserve Chair (and Nobel laureate in economics) Ben Bernanke. The results of this review were published as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/independent-evaluation-office/forecasting-for-monetary-policy-making-and-communication-at-the-bank-of-england-a-review/forecasting-for-monetary-policy-making-and-communication-at-the-bank-of-england-a-review">Forecasting for monetary policy making and communication at the Bank of England</a>.</p>
<p>The recommendations embodied in this review point to a need for reform: both in how the Bank of England&rsquo;s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) operates, and in the support provided to the Committee by Bank of England staff. Such change is entailed by a need to respond to the challenges posed by structural changes to the economy. Among these changes number (inter alia): the global financial crisis; the Covid-19 pandemic; the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and its impact on international energy and food prices; events in the Middle East; climate change; and the technological possibilities and threats of artificial intelligence. (The list could go on.)</p>
<p><strong>Strategy&nbsp;</strong>- Piecemeal change to the existing policy framework is no longer sufficient to address emerging new challenges. A comprehensive approach that internalises the spillovers among data analyses, macroeconomic forecasting, interest rate choices and policy communication is required. &lsquo;<strong>The whole is greater than the sum of the parts</strong>&rsquo;.</p>
<p>We need to be conscious of how all these elements fit together. In our internal discussions at the Bank of England, we have often used the metaphor of a single thread hanging off an expensive sweater. It is tempting to pull on that hanging thread to restore the pristine appearance of the sweater. And sometimes such an approach works. But the danger exists that pulling on the single thread leads to a wider unravelling of the cloth. In the extreme, the whole garment might disintegrate in our hands.</p>
<p>This metaphor cautions against making cosmetically appealing short-term changes to the policymaking framework, for fear that they may have wider and deeper side effects over time that go well beyond what had originally been envisaged. The UK monetary policymaking framework may have run that risk in the past &ndash; and paid the penalty on occasion. Developing a better understanding of how policy measures and choices interact with one another &ndash; of the structural relationships among them, to use the economic jargon &ndash; is the only way of managing this risk.</p>
<p><strong>Change&nbsp;</strong>- Any new monetary policy strategy for the UK also needs to embody a judicious mix of the old and the new.</p>
<p>It would obviously be ill-advised to discard those elements of the existing policy framework that have performed well in recent challenging times. Among these I would list many of the basic institutional features of the UK system: an independent MPC; a price stability mandate for monetary policy established in legislation; operationalisation of that mandate in the form of a quantified target for inflation; and accountability of MPC members to Parliament. Retaining these elements is key: &lsquo;<strong>we don&rsquo;t want to throw the baby out with the bath water</strong>&rsquo;.</p>
<p>As reflected in last month&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/may/ben-broadbent-ccbs-new-evidence-on-the-monetary-transmission-mechanism-workshop">valedictory speech</a>&nbsp;of my sadly now former colleague (indeed former boss) Ben Broadbent &ndash; and also in last Monday evening&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/july/speech-by-jonathan-haskel-at-escoe-kings-college-london">valedictory</a>&nbsp;of my equally sadly soon-to-be-former colleague (but not boss) Jonathan Haskel &ndash; this institutional framework has proved central to the considerable improvement in UK monetary policy performance over recent decades.</p>
<p>These two eminent economists both provide compelling evidence that the contrast between: (1) on the one hand, the prompt return of UK inflation to target following the significant external impulses generated by Covid and the invasion of Ukraine; and (2) on the other hand, the higher and much more persistent profile of UK inflation following the 1970s oil price shocks, owes much to these institutional improvements.</p>
<p>But equally, while retaining these benefits of institutional innovations associated with the adoption of inflation targeting, we also need to recognise the need for changes to the strategy in the face of changes in context and circumstance. And we must be open to learning from the experience and guidance of others.</p>
<p>Together with members of the Bank of England&rsquo;s modelling team, I was privileged to spend time last week with my former colleagues at the European Central Bank in Frankfurt. We drew valuable lessons from their experiences and expertise. A few weeks ago, the Centre for Central Banking Studies at the Bank of England hosted a workshop for central bank chief economists at which Prof. Bernanke very generously offered views on his recent report, triggering a rich discussion of the strategic challenges facing macroeconomic forecasting and monetary policy.</p>
<p>Not only do such events offer an opportunity for mutually beneficial exchanges of views and ventilation of ideas within the central banking community, but also &ndash; in those areas where Prof. Bernanke has identified that the Bank of England has work to do &ndash; they allow us to draw on the experience of others, avoid the pitfalls of implementing incremental changes to the framework, short circuit the costly process of learning-by-doing, and leapfrog directly to more modern methods.</p>
<p><strong>Patience&nbsp;</strong>- All these efforts take time. There is a premium on having the patience to ensure that multiple difficult, interrelated and therefore complex decisions are taken correctly.</p>
<p>I have spoken in the past of the need to &lsquo;<strong>get the basics right</strong>&rsquo; in reforming the MPC&rsquo;s monetary policy strategy. Our external audiences will inevitably focus on the visible aspects of the strategy that are central to policy communication. But these may be among the last to change in response to the recommendations of Prof. Bernanke&rsquo;s review: the form of policy presentation should follow the substance of policy formulation, not lead it.</p>
<p>A good decision is easier to communicate and rationalise than a poor decision. Expending effort on cosmetic issues at the expense of getting the fundamental analyses and decision processes right is to have &lsquo;the tail wagging the dog&rsquo;.</p>
<p>All this implies a natural sequencing of reform efforts: start by getting the enabling and foundational aspects of data collection and management right; then develop the models and frameworks to analyse the data; move on to designing the processes required to ensure policy makers are presented with the analysis in a manner and according to a schedule that maximises the likelihood they will take the best decision; assess how those policy decisions and their rationale should be presented to external stakeholders, including financial market participants, the media and the general public; and finally design a mechanism to collect feedback, so the impact of those decisions and their communication can be assessed.</p>
<p>But in practice all these efforts will proceed &ndash; and indeed are already proceeding &ndash; in parallel. Making them consistent is a significant organisational challenge. And, of course, we are not starting from scratch.</p>
<p>To illustrate, today the Bank of England is publishing its annual&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/about/get-involved/citizens-panels/your-voice-2024-insights-from-the-boe-outreach-programmes?sc_mode=normal" target="_blank">Outreach Report<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external">&nbsp;</span></a>, which describes the role and impact of the Bank&rsquo;s various outreach programmes in facilitating conversations with our various communities: the Citizens Panel, the Youth Forum and the Community Panels.</p>
<p>Over the past couple of years, I have been closely involved in this important work, which entails both collecting information and perspectives from our stakeholders &ndash; notably about the effects of persistently higher energy prices on UK households&rsquo; cost-of-living &ndash; as well as offering opportunities to present the sometimes difficult rationale for monetary policy decisions to hard-to-reach audiences. These efforts embody both data collection and policy communication &ndash; and, as such, they do not easily fit within the sequencing that would be followed if designing the new monetary policy strategy involved starting with a blank piece of paper, completely from scratch.</p>
<h3>Conjuncture</h3>
<p>For all the emphasis I have placed on the renewal of the MPC monetary policy strategy, the MPC must also conduct monetary policy today. This brings me to the current monetary policy conjuncture.</p>
<p>As I am sure you all well know, the MPC voted to leave Bank Rate unchanged at 5&frac14;% at its last meeting in June.</p>
<p>Of course, it is welcome news that the MPC&rsquo;s target variable &ndash; headline UK CPI inflation &ndash; has returned to the 2% target in May. But the MPC&rsquo;s remit makes clear that the inflation target holds at all times. It is not enough to meet the target in a transitory or fleeting way. Rather the MPC must achieve the inflation target on a lasting and sustainable basis.</p>
<p>Given the famous long and variable lags in monetary policy transmission, this requires that the MPC adopt a medium-term orientation and forward-looking approach in its formulation of monetary policy. That naturally points in the direction of placing an inflation forecast close to the centre of its policy discussion, as has indeed been the case for many years.</p>
<p>But when forecasting inflation becomes difficult &ndash; as has proved to be the case at the Bank of England and elsewhere over the past decade &ndash; an approach that places the inflation forecast at the centre of its policy framework comes under stress. That has been recognised in one of the key recommendations made by Prof. Bernanke in his view &ndash; to downplay the role of the MPC&rsquo;s baseline inflation forecast in the discussion and presentation of its policy decisions.</p>
<p>Of course, if one analytical tool is to be downplayed, there must be other tools upon which to place greater reliance. Prof. Bernanke has emphasised the role to be played by scenarios and policy simulations.</p>
<p>As an intermediate and pragmatic step to address the difficulties with forecasting in the face of the profound structural shocks to the UK economy, in recent years the MPC has emphasised that it is focused on the persistent component of overall inflation, since it is this component which &ndash; by nature &ndash; will still be embodied in price developments at the horizon where monetary policy decisions taken today have their greatest impact on inflation. In so doing, the MPC maintains its necessarily medium-term and forward-looking orientation.</p>
<p>More specifically, the MPC has emphasised three key indicators of inflation persistence: labour market tightness; pay growth; and services price inflation. On the basis of recent outturns, at the margin recent developments in these indicators have hinted towards some upside risk to my assessment of inflation persistence.</p>
<p>But these are noisy data series. More generally, the MPC has long recognised that it is difficult to distinguish the signal about underlying persistent inflation dynamics from the inevitable noise in any one release when assessing the news in the month-to-month data flow.</p>
<p>Viewed through this lens, it is hard to dispute the case that inflation persistence in the UK continues to prove &ndash; well &ndash; persistent. That is perhaps to be expected.</p>
<p>The difficulty in extracting signals about changes in the low frequency persistent component of inflation from noisy higher frequency indicators has not disappeared. Nor is it likely to in the coming months.</p>
<p>More data will come before we take our next policy decision at the MPC meeting on 1 August. But we have to be realistic about how much any one or two releases can add to our assessment.</p>
<p>While the MPC must remain open to the possibility that compelling new evidence could emerge which would lead the Committee (or individual members of it) to a revised opinion, it should also remain cautious in seeing any single data as either a necessary or sufficient trigger for that re-assessment.</p>
<p>In parallel with these various kinks in the data flow, time is also passing. And with monetary policy in restrictive territory, the extent to which the MPC is bearing down on underlying inflation also has a time dimension. The total quantum of monetary policy restriction is partly determined by the length of time that Bank Rate is held at a restrictive level. So the MPC&rsquo;s interpretation of the data needs to be placed against an assessment of how restrictive the overall stance of monetary policy is and has been, as well as a view on how that restriction is being transmitted to price developments.</p>
<p>It is easy to get frustrated with this. But it is important that the MPC maintains the right strategic orientation &ndash; and remains true to the framework it has articulated to deal with current challenges. Unless we have reason to shift to a new framework for policy discussions, there is a premium on acting consistently within our established machinery. It takes a framework to beat a framework.</p>
<p>The challenges associated with forecasting notwithstanding, the MPC continues to make substantial progress.</p>
<p>The current restrictive monetary policy stance continues to bear down on the persistent component of UK inflation. The MPC needs to ensure that the degree of cumulative restriction in the monetary policy stance is sufficient to ensure that the persistent dynamic in recent inflation indicators is squeezed out of the system in a way that is consistent with a timely and sustained return of CPI inflation to the 2% target.</p>
<p>At annual rates still not far from 6%, annual services price inflation and wage growth continue to point to an uncomfortable strength in those underlying inflation dynamics.</p>
<p>But the latest data also remains consistent with the view that these inflationary pressures have now been contained, and may be starting to revert towards levels that are more consistent with the achievement of the inflation target.</p>
<p>The challenge for the MPC is to get the balance right: enough monetary policy restriction to achieve the inflation target, but neither too much nor too little for fear of destabilising the economy.&nbsp;<strong>&lsquo;Twas ever thus</strong>.</p>
<p>Until the transformation agenda in response to the Bernanke review bears fruit, what complicates matters is how the outlook for inflation persistence stemming from analysis of the evolution of our three &lsquo;key indicators&rsquo; can be reconciled with the MPC&rsquo;s macroeconomic forecast &ndash; and, in particular, the inflation outlook at the policy-relevant two- to three-year horizon. The MPC&rsquo;s judgements around inflation persistence are crucial to determining the shape and profile of the inflation forecast at that horizon.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding Prof. Bernanke&rsquo;s recommendation to downplay the baseline inflation forecast, in the meantime being clear about the character of these judgements about inflation persistence and how their evolution informs the MPC&rsquo;s inflation forecast remains important.</p>
<p>Behind the MPC&rsquo;s inflation persistence judgement lies a structural view of price and wage setting behaviour in the UK economy. We don&rsquo;t simply need to observe developments in the key indicators, but rather we need to explain &ndash; both to ourselves and to our various external audiences &ndash; why there is greater persistence in current inflation dynamics than our standard model framework would imply, even after we have taken account of the extent of slack in the economy.</p>
<p>Based on that view, I will propose a few potential ways to interpret the inflation persistence judgements embedded in the forecast.</p>
<p>On one view, these judgements could reflect decaying second round effects in price and wage inflation following the big external shocks associated with the pandemic and Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine. Those effects may take longer to decay than any second-round effects embodied in conventional models and frameworks, but they are not fundamentally different &ndash; it is simply a question of the half-life of those second-round effects just being somewhat longer.</p>
<p>In this case, the challenge for the MPC is to decide whether to let this greater persistence play out or to act to bring inflation down more quickly while accepting the cost in terms of activity and employment that this implies. In other words, the MPC faces a traditional &lsquo;trade-off&rsquo; situation.</p>
<p>On another view, the inflation persistence judgments could represent a more permanent change to price, wage and margin setting behaviour, perhaps associated with changes in the pay structure, different competitive dynamics in the markets for labour, product and services, or with high degrees of real income resistance.</p>
<p>For any given level of slack in the economy, the momentum of nominal dynamics in price / wage / cost / margin setting behaviour may simply be stronger.</p>
<p>In that scenario, ultimately the MPC will be left with no choice but to maintain a restrictive monetary policy to weigh against such incipient stronger inflationary dynamics for the 2% inflation target is to be achieved on a lasting basis. That is the Committee&rsquo;s mandate.</p>
<p>Viewed through his lens, the persistence judgements represent a deterioration in the supply side of the UK economy: they capture an under-estimation of the NAIRU (or equivalently an over-estimation of potential output).</p>
<p>It is apparent from this discussion that the character of inflation persistence has implications for the conduct of monetary policy.</p>
<p>When drawing implications from the evolution of the &lsquo;key indicators of inflation persistence&rsquo; for the MPC&rsquo;s monetary policy assessment, it is important to address what those indicators tell us about the nature of inflation persistence. This goes beyond a quantitative mapping from those indicators into an inflation forecast. A more structural interpretation of inflation persistence is required. And further work is needed to provide this.</p>
<p>In particular, separating households&rsquo; inflation perceptions from households&rsquo; and firms&rsquo; short-term inflation expectations &ndash; and then seeking to separate both from inflation itself &ndash; remains a difficult empirical challenge. Distinguishing &lsquo;catch-up dynamics&rsquo;, which might be expected to dissipate over time (even if relatively slowly), from &lsquo;de-anchoring dynamics&rsquo; that might have a more long-lasting character and represent a deterioration on the supply side, remains key.</p>
<p>This all said, in the absence of any big new shocks, the &ldquo;when-rather-than-if&rdquo; characterisation of prospective Bank Rate cuts still seems appropriate.</p>
<p>The views expressed in these remarks are not necessarily those of the Bank of England or the Monetary Policy Committee.</p>
<p>I would particularly like to thank Saba Alam and Iris Hall for their help in the preparation of these remarks.</p>
<p>The text has also benefitted from helpful comments from Andrew Bailey, Jamie Bell, Sarah Breeden, Fabrizio Cadamagnani, Alan Castle, Clare Lombardelli, Jonathan Haskel, Rich Harrison, Adrian Paul, Kate Reinold, Fergal Shortall and Danny Walker for which I am most grateful.</p>
<p>Opinions (and all remaining errors and omissions) are my own.</p>

<p>The reason I wanted to speak today is because I believe Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) are absolutely vital.&nbsp;<strong>We need to work out how to bring out the best in each other, so that we can keep moving society forward</strong>.</p>
<p>I have been the Chief Financial Officer of the Bank of England for the last 5 years. It has been an honour to serve the UK during Covid, Brexit, the cost of living crisis, and against a challenging geopolitical backdrop. During this time, I have had my hands full with the Bank of England&rsquo;s balance sheet, which grew to over &pound;1 trillion during the pandemic.</p>
<h3>Personal journey</h3>
<p><strong>I have spent the last twenty years in financial services&hellip;but that was never the plan!</strong></p>
<p>I was born in London, and my family lived in Highgate at the time. We moved progressively South to Wimbledon and then to Purley, where I grew up.</p>
<p>My parents worked hard and inspired me to work hard. My Dad was awarded a scholarship by the Government of Ghana to study in the UK after coming 3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;in West Africa for his A-Levels. He came to study engineering at the Camborne School of Mines. My Mum, totally separately, came from Ghana to the UK when she was 18, to study midwifery at Liverpool University. She went on to work for the NHS for 40 years, and I saw her juggle long shifts, while raising a family.</p>
<p>From the age of 7, I had my heart set on being a doctor, so that I could help people. I went to Old Palace, a fantastic all girls school, in Croydon, where I had the most incredible headmistress, Miss Hilton. She believed in me, and that went a long way.</p>
<p>I read Chemistry at Oxford University, because I wanted to help create a drug to help people with cancer. My Masters focused on creating molecules with anti-tumorous properties. At Oxford, I was inspired by the late, great Professor Sir Jack Baldwin &ndash; he was one of the most eminent British Chemists of our time. He believed in me, and he chose me to be part of his research group. I then got a junior research fellowship at Princeton University.</p>
<p>After some time working in the labs, behind a fumehood, I experienced some of the highs of research, as I created lots of new compounds, and my work was published in an international journal. But, I started to realise that I wanted to work in a more fast-paced and more socially interactive environment. I wanted to use my creative and experimentation skills to solve problems. And, in the background, I had a part-time job working in fashion at Burberry in London to pay my student debt. We had a lot of well known customers coming through our doors, and the fashion world gave me an alternative to wearing a white lab coat and goggles to work every day!</p>
<p>Fast forward, I trained as a Chartered Accountant at Ernst &amp; Young in London. I became an Investment Banker at UBS, and during the global financial crisis, I travelled around the world doing M&amp;A deals. Then I did different CFO roles at Barclays.</p>
<p>When I was on maternity leave, I was approached about becoming the CFO of the Bank of England. And as they say, the rest is history.</p>
<p>When I joined the Bank, I was the youngest Executive Director. I was 36, which makes me a millennial (just about!), and I was also the first black executive in the Bank&rsquo;s 329 year history.</p>
<p>I have learned to balance work and family, as I have 4 young children ranging from a baby to an 8-year old. So I have been busy juggling work and home&hellip;</p>
<p>As I reflect back over the years, there are some key things that have helped:</p>
<p>Firstly, I have been&nbsp;<strong>flexible</strong>&nbsp;about what I do, and changing direction. This has been a consistent theme. New things come up. New people come up<strong>. I like experiencing different things and gravitate towards people I enjoy spending time with, because work needs to be fun!</strong></p>
<p>Secondly, having my own sense of&nbsp;<strong>inner fulfilment</strong>&nbsp;is important. There&rsquo;s no point in waiting for people to thank you and give you credit for the work you are doing - otherwise, you could be waiting a long time! People are busy, people have other things on their mind, so there&rsquo;s no point dwelling on things you can&rsquo;t change. I get satisfaction from doing purposeful work.</p>
<p>Thirdly, there will be barriers. Of course there will be. That&rsquo;s always been my experience. But there will always be key people, who believe in you, and who will help you figure it out during the toughest times<strong>. Family, friends, mentors, and sponsors. People who you can lean on to give you support and encouragement</strong>. And that&rsquo;s what I have found has made the difference.</p>
<h3>How am I helping to drive Diversity and Inclusion across modern business?</h3>
<p>At the Bank, I&rsquo;m the co-Executive sponsor of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.</p>
<p>I enjoy the social purpose aspect of my role. I do a lot of outreach. I love meeting people from different communities, businesses and charities; people across the public and private sector. I have the opportunity to contribute to different industry discussions at a national level, and to speak at international fora like the G20, and the International Monetary Fund. I try to engage, listen, and share experiences to drive positive change.</p>
<p>At the Bank, we have<strong>&nbsp;focussed on creating an inclusive culture, where everyone can thrive. Our visible and invisible diversity is what will help us achieve better outcomes for our society</strong>.</p>
<p>During the pandemic, we made DEI a strategic priority for the Bank, and I was delighted when the Governor, Andrew Bailey, asked me to be the co-Executive sponsor.</p>
<p>In 2020, after Black Lives Matter, the Bank of England commissioned a Court Review of Ethnic diversity. We found that outcomes were very different for white and ethnic minority colleagues, and also that we needed to do more to achieve gender equality. I have helped the Bank respond to this, and I will make sure we continue to prioritise this, against a trend of global efforts reducing in this space.</p>
<h4>Targets</h4>
<p>We have set formal targets for the recruitment and retention of diverse staff at various levels at the Bank, particularly for women and ethnic minorities.&nbsp;<strong>We are tracking progress because what gets measured gets done.</strong>&nbsp;At the highest level in the organisation, Court, our board has a good mix of gender and ethnic diversity. And we are working towards meeting our targets at&nbsp;<strong>all</strong>&nbsp;levels.</p>
<h4>Diversity alone won&rsquo;t get us where we want to be:</h4>
<p>1.&nbsp;<strong>Inclusion matters.</strong></p>
<p>2.&nbsp;<strong>Equal pay and career progression matters.</strong></p>
<p>3.<strong>&nbsp;Allyship matters</strong>.</p>
<p>And, finally, to close&hellip;.&nbsp;<strong>What I would like to see more than anything, is for diverse people to be fully accepted and valued when they are ordinary, not just when they are exceptional&hellip;.&nbsp;</strong>That&rsquo;s when we&rsquo;ll know we are really moving society forward.</p>
<p>Thank you Suki Sandhu, and the INvolve team for everything you are doing. And thank you all for listening.</p>
<p>I would like to thank my Bank colleagues and chairs of our employee networks, for the vital work they are doing to drive inclusion in the workplace. Also Mohini Gurung and Catherine Milton for proofreading this speech.</p>

<div> Financial Stability Oversight Council, Digital Assets, Regulation, Market, Enforcement
Summary: The CFTC Chairman emphasized the need for legislation to regulate the digital asset market, enacting principles-based oversight, funding, customer protections, AML/KYC requirements, and education/outreach. <br /><br /> <div>
<div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item">
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>Introduction</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Chairwoman Stabenow, Ranking Member Boozman, and members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today as Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC or Agency) to discuss the state of the digital asset commodity market.&nbsp; Before I begin, I would like to recognize and thank my fellow CFTC Commissioners and CFTC staff for their dedication and commitment to serving the American public.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>State of the Digital Asset Commodity Market</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>During my almost seven-years at the CFTC as both a Commissioner and as Chairman, I have observed the digital asset market evolve significantly, expanding and collapsing, at times with periods of high volatility. &nbsp;It has also facilitated countless scandals and fraudulent activity, some very small and typical in criminal form, others massive in scale and profile.&nbsp; I have watched the market as it has piqued the interest of both novice and sophisticated investors, and have seen some of our nation&rsquo;s most established financial institutions build businesses driven by digital assets.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>What has concerned me most throughout the expansion of this digital asset class is that while everyday Americans fall victim to one digital asset scam after another, there remains no completed legislative response. &nbsp;I have repeatedly been asked by members of Congress what I am doing to protect their constituents.&nbsp; I believe the single most important thing I have done, and continue to do, is advocate to this body to fill the regulatory gap.&nbsp; I am not alone in my concerns.&nbsp; In 2022, a Financial Stability Oversight Council report highlighted that there is a gap in regulation of the spot market for digital assets that are not securities.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam48?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp; This gap for non-security tokens continues to constitute a majority of the digital asset market measured by market capitalization.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam48?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the risks that this unregulated market poses to U.S. investors, I have consistently and publicly called for new legislative authority for the CFTC,</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam48?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;including before this Committee.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam48?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Congress must act quickly in order for regulators, like the CFTC, to provide basic customer protections that are core to U.S. financial markets.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Further, based on my observations as Chairman, I do not believe inaction will quash public interest for digital assets; it will only result in greater risk to our financial markets and investors. &nbsp;As the digital asset market continues to integrate into traditional financial institutions, concerns regarding broader market resiliency and perhaps even financial stability will ripen.&nbsp; In short, our current trajectory is not sustainable.&nbsp; Federal legislation is urgently needed to create a pathway for a regulatory framework that will protect American investors and possibly the financial system from future risk.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>Enforcement</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>It has been almost nine years since the CFTC brought its first enforcement action in connection with an illegal Bitcoin operation.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam48?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp; Since that time, the agency has been aggressive in using our powerful, but limited anti-fraud and anti-manipulation authorities.&nbsp; In total, the CFTC has brought over 135 digital commodity cases resulting in billions in penalties and restitution.&nbsp; All along, CFTC enforcement staff has worked closely with our civil and criminal law enforcement partners at the federal and state levels.&nbsp; The escalating rate of digital asset enforcement cases since 2020 mirrors the accelerated and sustained adoption of digital assets by U.S. investors.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Just last week, a District Court in the Northern District of Illinois entered summary judgment in favor of the CFTC in a case involving fraud by an unregistered entity that promised steady returns in digital asset commodities such as Bitcoin and Ether.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam48?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp; In its decision, the court re-affirmed that both Bitcoin and Ether are commodities under the Commodity Exchange Act.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>In fiscal year 2023, actions involving digital asset-related allegations comprised almost half of our enforcement docket.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam48?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp; Of the 47 enforcement actions involving digital assets commodities, 35 alleged misconduct in the spot market.&nbsp; Ultimately, the CFTC, whose primary responsibility is overseeing the multi-trillion-dollar U.S. derivatives markets, is committing nearly half its enforcement resources to a market it does not have the authority or appropriated resources to regulate.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Nearly a decade of digital asset experience has given CFTC staff a deep understanding of the market and underlying technology that supports it.&nbsp; Market regulators like the CFTC were built precisely for situations we find ourselves in today.&nbsp; The flawed notion that regulating an asset class legitimizes it misses the point of our responsibilities.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>International Progress</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Concurrent with my duties as CFTC Chairman, I have the privilege of serving as the Vice-Chairman of the International Organization of Securities Commissions, more commonly known as IOSCO.&nbsp; IOSCO&rsquo;s member agencies regulate more than 95% of the world&rsquo;s securities markets in over 130 jurisdictions.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam48?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp; In this role, I have observed both major and developing economies establish regulatory frameworks for digital assets.&nbsp; From Asia, the Middle East, the European Union, the United Kingdom, and South America, what started as pilot programs and draft legislation just a few years ago, has developed into established global regulatory systems.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The delta between the U.S. and our international counterparts preserves weaknesses that are exploited by bad actors, and prohibits us from much needed coordination efforts.&nbsp; Further, and primarily for the members of this Committee to consider, any potential economic benefits and innovation arising from this technology ultimately will be stymied without regulatory certainty.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>Legislative Priorities to Achieve Success</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>As this Committee continues to consider legislation to fill the regulatory gap, I would like to focus your attention on the components of a framework that would ensure the CFTC has the tools to provide customer and market protections.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>First, the principles-based oversight model has served the CFTC and its regulated markets well, striking an appropriate balance between clear outcomes-based requirements, and measured flexibility to meet those outcomes.&nbsp; Core principles such as compliance with fair and orderly trading, system safeguards, financial resource requirements, and products not being readily susceptible to fraud or manipulation, to name just a few, serve as a solid foundation to build transparent and resilient markets, regardless of asset class.&nbsp; In light of the novel nature of digital assets, the CFTC would then, consistent with a legislative mandate, tailor rules to meet the risk and characteristic profile.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Second, appropriate funding is necessary to meet the mandate of any legislatively enacted regulatory program.&nbsp; A permanent fee-for-service model, exclusively assessed on digital asset registrants, and that is commensurate with the responsibilities outlined in a bill, is critical.&nbsp; As with other fee-for-service models, congressional appropriators and the agency should work in tandem to set budget levels and subsequently set fees to meet those budget levels.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Third, given the retail-oriented nature of the digital asset market, legislative authority for the CFTC to require registrants to provide a comprehensive disclosure regime regarding a commodity token&rsquo;s structure, purpose, market-based characteristics, and general risks is also critical to ensure investors have access to material information.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Fourth, it is essential that legislation provide comprehensive authority for anti-money laundering, know-your-customer, and a customer identification program, built off of existing requirements for market participants.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Fifth, given the important role the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) plays in the oversight of security-based digital tokens, the Committee should consider a disciplined, balanced framework for the determination of tokens as commodities or securities under existing law.&nbsp; The SEC and CFTC have a longstanding partnership that facilitates strong, robust regulation of securities and derivatives markets.&nbsp; I am confident that the two agencies will continue working closely, ensuring a reliable, fair, and efficient system for listing and trading of digital assets on regulated exchanges.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Finally, given the broad adoption of digital assets by a significant portion of the American population,</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam48?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;a comprehensive education and outreach program, building off of the CFTC&rsquo;s Office of Customer Education and Outreach, will enable the investing public to understand both the risks and opportunities of this technology.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>Conclusion</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>I am encouraged by this Committee&rsquo;s continued efforts, dating back to 2022, to fill the gap in regulation, prioritizing customer protections and market stability.&nbsp; In addition to this Committee&rsquo;s work, there have been other important steps taken in Congress to address the need for comprehensive regulation of the digital asset commodity market.&nbsp; The principles and regulatory foundations that have made our capital markets and derivatives markets the deepest, most liquid, and most resilient in the world provide an effective model for the digital asset commodity market.&nbsp; We need to act thoughtfully, but with urgency, to fill this harmful regulatory gap in order to give American investors the protection they deserve.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>I thank the Committee for your focus in this area, and&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>look forward to answering your questions.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<div> Keywords: valuation, climate risk, equity, uncertainties, transition costs <br />
Summary: 
- New research extends valuation techniques to estimate the effect of climate and economic uncertainties on global equity values.
- Study evaluates impact of greenhouse gas emissions trajectories on equity values under various scenarios.
- Key factors influencing equity valuation include emissions abatement, climate tipping points, and central bank actions.
- Study indicates the need for prompt abatement action to keep losses below 10%, with over 40% of global equity value at risk without acceleration.
- Methodological innovations include a fully probabilistic approach, state-dependent discounting, and joint analysis of transition costs and physical risks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
<p><b><i>New EDHEC-Risk Climate Impact Institution research: </i></b><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b></p>
<ul>
<li><b><i>Extends valuation techniques to estimate the effect on global equity values of climate and economic uncertainties, financial contingencies, transition costs and physical risks. </i></b></li>
<li><b><i>Evaluates the impact on global equity values of different greenhouse gas emissions trajectories under multiple climate and economic scenarios. </i></b></li>
<li><b><i>Identifies aggressiveness of emissions abatement, location of climate tipping points, and ability and willingness</i></b> <b><i>of central banks to lower rates during economic distress as key impact factors of equity valuation.</i></b></li>
<li><b><i>Indicates that prompt and robust abatement action is needed to keep losses below 10%. Conversely, over 40% of global equity value is at risk if decarbonisation efforts do not accelerate, with losses exceeding 50% when climate tipping points are factored in.</i></b></li>
</ul>
<p><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b></p>
<p>In a new study, <a href="https://climateimpact.edhec.edu/sites/ercii/files/pdf/ercii_publication_how_does_climate_risk_affect_equity_valuations.pdf"><i>How Does Climate Risk Affect Global Equity Valuations? A Novel Approach</i></a>, EDHEC-Risk Climate Impact Institute addresses key limitations of current climate-aware valuation approaches to produce novel insights. The paper, conducted within the research chair established by EDHEC Business School and Scientific Beta, reveals that the impact of climate risk on global equity valuation can be significant, especially in scenarios with limited climate action.</p>
<p>Key Findings:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>The uncertainty of climate and economic outcomes and the state dependence of discounting</b> are two key and much neglected contributors to changes in equity valuation. </li>
<li>The magnitude of losses depends on the <b>aggressiveness of emission abatement policy</b>; the <b>presence or otherwise of tipping points</b>; on the extent of Central Banks&rsquo; willingness and ability to <b>lower rates in states of economic distress</b>.</li>
<li>Severe impact on equity valuation can be obtained with very plausible combinations of policies and physical outcomes; and there is considerably more downside than upside risk &ndash; <b>over 40% of global equity value is at risk unless decarbonisation efforts accelerate and losses could exceed 50% with near climate tipping points</b>.</li>
<li><b>Prompt and robust abatement action is needed</b> to keep losses below 10%. </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Methodological Innovations:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Fully Probabilistic Approach</b>: incorporating climate and economic uncertainties into a probabilistic framework for a more realistic and comprehensive evaluation of potential outcomes.</li>
<li><b>State-Dependent Discounting:</b> recognising that physical damages from climate change impair cashflows in a state-dependent manner and allowing discount factors to be determined by economic conditions and damages, which highlights the neglected role of state-dependent discounting.</li>
<li><b>Joint Analysis of Transition Costs and Physical Risks:</b> upgrading a popular integrated climate economics assessment model to estimate the effect of transition costs (associated with regulatory measures to curb greenhouse gas emissions) and physical damages on the value of global equity stock, providing a unified view of climate-related financial risks.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Ducoulombier, Director of EDHEC-Risk Climate Impact Institute</b> states:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The research team led by Professor Rebonato has upgraded mainstream integrated assessment models to incorporate the progress of climate science and make them fit for financial applications. By modelling the considerable uncertainty in the physical and economical dimensions of climate change and linking it to top-down equity valuation, this study debunks the notion that the value of financial assets may be immune to climate changes and provides additional support for bold climate action.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Professor Ricardo Rebonato, Scientific Director of EDHEC-Risk Climate Impact Institute</b>, adds:</p>
<p>&ldquo;These results&ndash;obtained with mild assumptions&ndash;underline the importance of uncertainty and state-dependent discounting for climate-aware equity valuation.&nbsp; Our approach shows that it is possible and fruitful to integrate climate risks into financial analysis and we will be working further to develop theoretically solid and practically implementable tools for climate-aware investment management.&rdquo;</p>

Summary: The FTSE Mondo Visione Exchanges Index tracks market cap, performance, and capital returns of 33 exchanges and trading floors. <div>
<p>Exchanges heavily reliant on cash equities have faced challenging times due to a shortage of listings and low valuations, prompting some firms to reassess their current listings. In contrast, exchanges with a diversified business model have weathered these conditions more successfully.</p>
<p>The FTSE Mondo Visione Exchanges Index concluded June at 71,426.00 points, reflecting a 0.4% decline from its May 2024 value of 71,725.78.</p>
<p>The top 5 exchanges by market capitalisation at the end of June were:</p>

<div> campaign, awareness, investor education, protection, collaboration
<br />
Summary: 
World Investor Week raises awareness for investor education and protection, covering themes like technology, fraud prevention, and sustainable finance. Collaboration among IOSCO members is emphasized. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>The World Investor Week (WIW) is a week-long, global campaign to raise awareness of the importance of investor education and protection, and to highlight the various initiatives of securities regulators in these two critical areas.</p>
<p>WIW has two primary objectives, namely (i) to disseminate key messages that support investor education, investor protection and financial literacy; and (ii) to foster learning opportunities for investors. The campaign also aims to strengthen collaboration among IOSCO members on investor education and protection initiatives.</p>
<p>Launching on 7 October 2024 and spanning the course of the week, organizations representing over 100 jurisdictions will come together to drive awareness around trending issues which impact investors around the world.</p>
<p>Principal themes include</p>
<ul>
<li>Technology &amp; Digital Finance</li>
<li>Crypto Assets</li>
<li>Sustainable Finance</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These will be complemented with discussions and workshops on</p>
<ul>
<li>Fraud and Scam Prevention</li>
<li>Investor Resilience</li>
<li>Basics of Investing</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Jean-Paul Servais, Chair of IOSCO&rsquo;s Board, and Chairman, Financial Services and Markets Authority, Belgium</strong>, said: "Last year&rsquo;s World Investor Week saw the involvement of 118 jurisdictions and reached almost 730 million individuals. We have to keep the ball rolling as with technological advancements and increased use of AI, new challenges arise. We also see how crypto, fractional trading, gamification and copy-trading are trending.</p>
<p>I am confident that WIW2024 will build on the success of previous years to drive greater investor awareness of these issues and look forward to contribute to its success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s themes were agreed by IOSCO&rsquo;s Committee 8 which conducts its work on retail investor education and financial literacy and includes 38 members from both established and emerging markets.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Pasquale Munaf&ograve;, Senior Officer, Commissione Nazionale per le Societ&agrave; e la Borsa, Italy, and Chair of IOSCO&rsquo;s Committee 8</strong>, said: &ldquo;The principal themes we have identified this year result from extensive engagement with all Committee 8 members and unanimously reflect the most urgent issues facing investors today.

<p>The Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the premier post-trade market infrastructure for the global financial services industry, today announced the launch of a new public-facing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dtcc.com/managing-risk/stress-testing-and-liquidity-risk-management/ccfl-public-calculator" target="_blank">Value at Risk (VaR) calculator</a>. The calculator provides market participants with the ability to evaluate potential margin and Clearing Fund obligations associated with becoming a Member of DTCC&rsquo;s Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC) Government Securities Division (GSD).</p>
<p>With U.S. Treasury Clearing activity processed through FICC expected to rise by US$4 trillion daily after the SEC&rsquo;s expanded clearing mandate is implemented in 2025 and 2026, DTCC&rsquo;s VaR calculator will be a crucial tool for firms to accurately determine VaR and potential margin obligations for any simulated portfolio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;VaR is a widely used risk management concept in the financial services industry and is the primary component of GSD&rsquo;s Clearing Fund requirements,&rdquo; said Tim Hulse, Managing Director, Financial Risk &amp; Governance, at DTCC. &ldquo;The calculator considers factors such as historical data, volatility and confidence levels to estimate VaR, increasing market transparency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The new calculator provides market participants with the opportunity to calculate potential Margin obligations on a simulated portfolio, for given positions and market value, using FICC&rsquo;s VaR methodology.</p>
<p>Hulse added, &ldquo;FICC understands the urgency and importance of evaluating firms&rsquo; risk exposure associated with the expansion of U.S. Treasury Clearing. The VaR calculator provides market participants with increased transparency into these obligations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As part of its commitment to the industry, DTCC continues to assess calculators, tools, and enhanced access methods to support the expansion of U.S. Treasury clearing activity.</p>

<p class="paragraph"><span class="normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-US">Bridgewise,  the financial research intelligence platform for global securities, announced today the launch of a new fund analysis solution that will provide market-leading levels of detail into funds and their underlying assets. Powered by AI, Bridgewise will enable for  the first time deep analysis of fund holdings, past performance, and fee structure, providing coverage for the vast majority of funds on the market.

<p class="paragraph"><span class="normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-US">This is precisely the problem AI is well placed to solve.

There is no way for a human to provide a detailed fundamental analysis on each and every asset in popular funds, especially when some funds are composed of thousands of individual stocks. The time  it would take to complete such an analysis would quickly stretch to a full year or more. Our AI technologies not only allow for a previously unobtainable level of depth of fund analysis, but also nearly universal coverage of funds, each one with the same level  of detailed analysis along with buy/sell recommendations for the individual stocks in the fund.&rdquo;</span></span><span class="eop"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li> <strong><em><span>H1 2024 research budgets increased both as a proportion of AUM as well as in absolute terms</span></em></strong> </li>
<li> <strong><em><span>As a proportion of assets managed, US budgets rose 15%, with European budgets also rising but by a more modest 4%</span></em></strong> </li>
<li> <strong><em><span>The survey indicates that the cycle of endless price depreciation and budget cuts across the board in investment research has come to an end&nbsp;</span></em></strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Substantive Research, the research and data spend analytics provider for the buy side, today publishes the findings of its latest survey into investment research pricing, budgeting and consumption, looking at how research spending has evolved during the first half of 2024.</span></p>
<p><span>The FCA&rsquo;s&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.fca.org.uk%2Fpublication%2Fconsultation%2Fcp24-7.pdf/1/010201909b6ef946-96cc3681-a4d9-4f26-88c9-76d68edee636-000000/fjPm2srx-Lt4cux1DN-Ke3w7Cyo=382" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>April 2024 Consultation Paper</span></a><span>&nbsp;on &ldquo;Payment Optionality for Investment Research&rdquo; has ignited a debate on whether asset managers in Europe can, or should return their research costs back to their end investors after six years of paying these costs from their own P&amp;Ls post-MiFID II. The proposed optionality from the FCA comes with many caveats and obligations, and the market views its adoption as being highly dependent on whether there will be push-back from end investors, as asset managers explore this option.</span></p>
<p><span>Substantive Research undertook its latest survey of the buy side to understand the impact that proposed payment optionality is having on the consumption of investment research, and how differences in US and European regulations affect pricing and payments.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Survey findings</span></strong></p>
<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fsubstantiveresearch.com%2Finsights-and-press%2Finvestment-research-budgets-slide-again-despite-imminent-rebundling-freedoms%2F/1/010201909b6ef946-96cc3681-a4d9-4f26-88c9-76d68edee636-000000/ksWNqVufGeoSH0HoU07RejuDu6U=382" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>Previous analysis</span></a><span>&nbsp;in 2023 had shown that budgets in the US had increased as a proportion of AUM, and dipped only very slightly in the UK/EU by the same measure. However, in monetary terms, budgets still fell by 6.5% globally as AUM was down across the universe surveyed.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>In the first half of 2024, Substantive Research&rsquo;s analysis has shown that budgets are increasing both as a proportion of AUM as well as in absolute terms:</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li> <span>As a proportion of assets managed, US budgets rose 15%, with European budgets also rising by a more modest 4%. This shows why politicians have been pressuring the UK and EU regulators to help European asset managers return these costs back to their end investor clients. As the cycle moves on, US research budgets bounce back much more quickly - their investment professionals have more money to spend on external research from brokers and independent providers.&nbsp;</span> </li>
<li> <span>Overall, in monetary terms budgets increased by 2.2%. &ldquo;Although a modest rise, this fundamentally changes the dynamics of the research market. Within that figure, some providers are increasing pricing and driving greater consumption of meetings and calls with their sector analysts. We are back to a market of winners and losers, instead of almost all research providers experiencing price deflation year after year,&rdquo;&nbsp;</span><strong><span>said Mike Carrodus, CEO, of Substantive Research</span></strong><span>.</span> </li>
<li> <span>Brokers still dominate research budgets, taking 85% of spend annually, which has decreased by 1% since 2023, with tooling and analytics solutions benefitting accordingly and growing from 4% to 5% of research budget allocations. Substantive predicts that spending on analytics and research tooling will accelerate in the next budgeting cycle for 2025 &ndash; interest is high and these vendors are climbing up the provider list.</span> </li>
<li> <span>Independent Research Providers (IRPs) and Expert Networks remain unchanged at 8% and 2% respectively of annual budgets on average.&nbsp;</span> </li>
<li> <span>Concentration of research budgets to the top 10 brokers rose very slightly from 54.8% to 54.9%, a key metric to monitor in future, to see if the FCA&rsquo;s reforms do indeed spur greater competition as desired.&nbsp;</span> </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Mike Carrodus, CEO of Substantive Research, commented:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;We saw last year that research budgets were stabilising and now we have the confirmation that the trend has turned. However, when compared with six years of price depreciation, this recovery does not take us anywhere near where research spending was pre-MiFID II. What this does do, is set the scene for the FCA&rsquo;s new rules later this summer, with the key question being &lsquo;Will the new FCA freedoms accelerate European research spending up to a US level and trend ahead?&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>He added:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>&ldquo;Much will depend on the reaction from the asset managers&rsquo; end investor clients, and even if research costs do end up chargeable to asset owners once again the new procurement rigour in research valuation and payments from the buy side is going nowhere. If this market is to reflate materially, there will need to be new demand for new asset classes, and new supply required to justify additional payments in future - a change in funding will not arbitrarily drive research pricing back to pre-MiFID II levels.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Universe of organisations covered in the study</span></strong><span>:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>60 asset management firms; 60%/40% Headquartered Europe/North America; Total AUM represented $20tr+; 75%/25% Long-only/Hedge Fund.</span></p>

<title>Islamic Fintech Firm Offa Launches Fast And Innovative Buy-To-Let Finance - Modern, Paperless Service Disrupts Traditionally Cumbersome Islamic Finance Market</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Offa, the UK&rsquo;s first Sharia-compliant bridge finance fintech, has today launched an innovative new buy-to-let finance (BTL) service &ndash; with fast funding decisions delivered via a modern paperless process &ndash; aiming to disrupt and transform the traditionally old-fashioned and cumbersome world of Islamic finance.</span></p>
<p><span>Powered by the latest software, Offa&rsquo;s BTL service meets the needs of both Muslim and non-Muslim property investors with its flexible property finance solutions and end-to-end digital processes, making it fast and easy to apply and get a quick decision.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Sagheer Malik, Offa&rsquo;s Chief Commercial Officer</span>&nbsp;and MD&nbsp;<span>of Retail Finance, said: &ldquo;Offa is all about a high-quality modern service and speed is crucial in real estate. With the launch of our ultra-quick buy-to-let service, combined with our teams&rsquo; decades of industry experience, we are bringing Islamic finance into the 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;century, leaving behind the onerous paperwork and cumbersome systems that many customers have typically suffered in the past.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;Our streamlined digital application process &ndash; which is unparalleled in the Islamic finance market &ndash; means clients can potentially get a fair decision within minutes, depending on credit rating and risk criteria.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span><a name="_Hlk169771199"></a><a name="_Hlk169795384"></a><span>These Islamic BTL products are available to new and seasoned landlords who are British residents or UK expats. Instead of using interest, Offa&rsquo;s BTL product involves the Islamic finance principles of co-ownership-with-leasing. Customers acquire the property in partnership with Offa and make monthly payments to increase their share, over time owning it.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Another key feature of Offa&rsquo;s BTL product is that where a customer&rsquo;s rental income is not sufficient for the required affordability criteria for the BTL finance, Offa allows them to make up the difference with their personal monthly income (commonly known in the industry as top-slicing).</span></p>
<p><span>The service is available to anyone purchasing property in England and Wales aged 21 or over where the property&rsquo;s value is between &pound;60,000 and &pound;1 million. First-time landlords can also apply, and Offa&rsquo;s BTL solutions are also available for houses in multiple occupancy (HMOs).</span></p>
<p><span>Offa provides an ethical finance model designed in accordance with Islamic finance principles, which means not charging interest and investment into sectors deemed harmful to society &ndash; such as alcohol, tobacco, and the arms trade.</span></p>
<p><span>In April, Offa announced a &pound;100 million credit line for its bridge finance arm from a fund managed by UAE-based Gulf Islamic Investments Group (GII). The credit line is the largest of its kind outside of the Gulf, creating significant capacity for the Birmingham-headquartered business to expand and diversify its financial propositions in the UK property market.</span></p>
