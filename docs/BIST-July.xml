<p><span><span><span><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Department of Justice&rsquo;s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section&rsquo;s National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET) announced today they convened the first Fraud Disruption Conference to work on efforts to combat a type of fraud commonly known as &ldquo;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/RomanceScam.html"><span>pig butchering</span></a><span>.&rdquo;&nbsp;<a name="_Hlk169518470"></a>It is estimated that Americans are scammed out of billions per year, making this a top law enforcement priority.<a name="_Hlk169518470"></a></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>This is the first of a series of Fraud Disruption conferences the CFTC will host with these and other partners to discuss various financial frauds to explore new avenues to combat or disrupt the scams.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&ldquo;It is devastating to hear countless stories of everyday Americans being targeted and defrauded by global criminal organizations,&rdquo; said Chairman Behnam. &ldquo;It has been a longstanding priority of mine to reenergize and grow our customer protection initiatives to combat retail fraud and protect the most vulnerable among us. I thank our CFTC staff for their dedication, and our longstanding partners at the Department of Justice and all others involved. By working together, we can tackle this problem.&rdquo;</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The working group addressed strategies to prevent victimization; using technology to disrupt the fraud; and collaboration on enforcement efforts. Several agencies also collaborated on an anti-victimization messaging campaign to warn Americans to remain vigilant against emerging fraud threats.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>In addition to speakers from law enforcement and regulatory agencies, participants heard remarks from CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam and DOJ NCET Director Claudia Quiroz.</span></span></span></p>

<div> DFS, Superintendent Harris, guidance, artificial intelligence, insurance
Summary:
DFS Superintendent Harris issued guidance for insurers using AI, emphasizing fairness, validity, oversight, and transparency. Governor Hochul supports innovation. 
<br><br> <div>
<p>Today, Department of Financial Services (&ldquo;DFS&rdquo;) Superintendent Adrienne A. Harris adopted guidance to protect consumers from unfair or unlawful discrimination by insurers using artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>"New York has a strong track record of supporting responsible innovation while protecting consumers from financial harm,&rdquo;&nbsp;<span>said Superintendent Harris.&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s guidance builds on that legacy, ensuring that the implementation of AI in insurance does not perpetuate or amplify systemic biases that have resulted in unlawful or unfair discrimination, while safeguarding the stability of the marketplace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The use of external consumer data and information sources (&ldquo;ECDIS&rdquo;) and artificial intelligence systems (&ldquo;AIS&rdquo;) can benefit insurers and consumers by simplifying and expediting insurance underwriting and pricing processes, however, it is critical that insurers who utilize such technologies establish a proper governance and risk management framework to mitigate the potential harm to consumers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The guidance outlines DFS&rsquo;s expectations for how all insurers authorized to write insurance in New York State develop and manage the integration of ECDIS, AIS, and other predictive models. Pursuant to DFS&rsquo;s guidance, insurers are expected to:</p>
<ul>
<li>analyze ECDIS and AIS for unfair and unlawful discrimination, as defined in state and federal laws;</li>
<li>demonstrate the actuarial validity of ECDIS and AIS;</li>
<li>maintain a corporate governance framework that provides appropriate oversight of the insurer&rsquo;s overall outcome of the use of ECDIS and AIS; and&nbsp;</li>
<li>maintain appropriate transparency, risk management, and internal controls, including over third-party vendors and consumer disclosures.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DFS has finalized the guidance with careful consideration of the valuable feedback received from regulated entities and other key stakeholders, including trade associations, advisory firms, universities, and the broader public.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s announcement builds upon Governor Hochul&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a class="external" href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-unveils-fifth-proposal-2024-state-state-empire-ai-consortium-make-new-york" target="_blank">first-ever statewide policy</a>&nbsp;governing AI and commitment to making New York a leader in cutting-edge technology development and use.</p>

<title>Ontario Securities Commission Seeks Feedback On Proposed Process For Distributing Disgorged Funds To Harmed Investors</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> proposal, disgorgement, investors, distribution, OSC <br>
<br>Summary: <br> The Ontario Securities Commission has proposed a new process for distributing disgorged funds to harmed investors, in line with recent legislative amendments. <div>
<p>The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) today published for comment a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/node/503431">rule proposal</a>&nbsp;that would establish a new process for returning money to harmed investors.</p>
<p>The proposed process would apply when disgorgement is ordered in an enforcement proceeding before the Capital Markets Tribunal or the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, and the OSC receives sufficient funds to make a distribution feasible.</p>
<p>The OSC is publishing the rule proposal to address recent legislative amendments to the Ontario<em>&nbsp;Securities Act</em>, the&nbsp;<em>Commodity Futures Act</em>, and the&nbsp;<em>Securities Commission Act, 2021</em>. Upon proclamation, the legislative amendments will create a statutory framework for the distribution of money received by the OSC under disgorgement orders.</p>
<p>The rule proposal outlines:</p>
<ul>
<li>the circumstances in which money received under disgorgement orders is required to be distributed;</li>
<li>the eligibility requirements for investors seeking a payment;</li>
<li>the process for distributing disgorged amounts in cases where a court-appointed administrator is not used; and</li>
<li>the use of other monetary sanctions and settlement payments to pay certain administrative costs in relation to the distribution of disgorged amounts.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Disgorgement is a type of monetary sanction imposed by the Capital Markets Tribunal or the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. Disgorgement sanctions require the respondent in a proceeding to pay any amounts they have obtained as a result of their non-compliance with securities law or commodity futures law. There is currently no prescribed process for making distributions to harmed investors from funds disgorged to the OSC.</p>
<p>While disgorgement orders are not imposed to compensate investors, the legislative amendments contemplate that, in circumstances established under the proposed rule, amounts received under these orders could be distributed to investors who incurred direct financial losses as a result of the conduct giving rise to the order.</p>
<p>Under the proposed rule, the OSC would be required to publish a report on each completed distribution to promote transparency and awareness about the distribution process.</p>
<p>The OSC will also develop plain-language resources to help investors understand the new statutory distribution framework and the payment application process.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.osc.ca/en/securities-law/instruments-rules-policies/1/11-502/proposed-osc-rule-11-502-distribution-amounts-paid-osc-under-disgorgement-orders-proposed">Proposed OSC Rule 11-502&nbsp;<em>Distribution of Amounts Paid to the OSC under Disgorgement Orders,&nbsp;</em>Proposed OSC Rule 11-503&nbsp;<em>(Commodity Futures Act) Distribution of Amounts Paid to the OSC under Disgorgement Orders&nbsp;</em>and their companion policies</a><span>&nbsp;</span>are available on the OSC&rsquo;s website.</p>
<p>Please submit comments in writing on or before October 9, 2024.</p>
<p>The mandate of the OSC is to provide protection to investors from unfair, improper or fraudulent practices, to foster fair, efficient and competitive capital markets and confidence in the capital markets, to foster capital formation, and to contribute to the stability of the financial system and the reduction of systemic risk. Investors are urged to check the registration of any persons or companies offering an investment opportunity and to review the OSC investor materials available at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/">https://www.osc.ca</a>.</p>

<title>B.C. Securities Commission Adopts Business Conduct Rule For Derivatives Dealers And Advisers</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Securities Commission, business conduct, derivatives market, B.C., National Instrument<br>
Summary: B.C. Securities Commission adopts business conduct rules for derivatives market, aligning with international standards and addressing specific provincial differences. <br><br> <div>
<p>The B.C. Securities Commission&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bcsc.bc.ca/securities-law/law-and-policy/bc-notices/current/bcn-202402-july-11-2024">today published</a>&nbsp;advanced notice of adoption of a comprehensive regime for regulating the business conduct of dealers and advisers in the over-the-counter derivatives market, including a number of provisions that are specific to B.C.</p>
<p>If approved by B.C.&rsquo;s Minister of Finance, National Instrument 93-101&nbsp;<em>Derivatives: Business Conduct</em>&nbsp;comes into force on September 28, 2024, and B.C. will join other Canadian securities regulators who published advanced notice of adoption in September 2023. With B.C.&rsquo;s adoption of the Instrument and its related Companion Policy, the rule will become a National Instrument.</p>
<p>The instrument to be adopted by B.C. includes several provisions that were necessary due to differences between B.C.&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Securities Act</em>&rsquo;s and securities legislation in other provinces.</p>
<p>For derivatives dealers and advisers, the framework establishes fundamental obligations that are aligned with international standards and include requirements related to fair dealing, conflicts of interest, suitability, reporting non-compliance, and record-keeping. The business conduct rule is intended to help protect market participants by improving transparency, increasing accountability, and promoting responsible business conduct in the derivatives market.</p>
<p>The business conduct rule was developed over an extensive three-stage consultation process that included a public roundtable to consider various regulatory, implementation, and compliance matters. In response to comments received during the most recent consultation, the final rule was streamlined to address potential negative impacts on derivatives market liquidity and to reduce implementation burden by better enabling firms to leverage their existing compliance systems.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<ol>
<li>In May, the FCA&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/finfluencers-charged-promoting-unauthorised-trading-scheme" title="'Finfluencers&rsquo; charged for promoting unauthorised trading scheme">announced charges against 9 individuals</a>&nbsp;in relation to an unauthorised foreign exchange trading scheme promoted on social media. &nbsp;</li>
<li>The defendants&rsquo; dates of birth (DoB) are as follows:&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p class="Indent2">a. Emmanuel Nwanze (DoB 07/01/1994)&nbsp;<br />b. Holly Thompson (also known as Holly Zucchero) (DoB 25/05/1990)&nbsp;<br />c. Biggs Chris (DoB 15/05/1992)&nbsp;<br />d. Jamie Clayton (DoB 18/11/1991)&nbsp;<br />e. Lauren Goodger (DoB 19/09/1986)&nbsp;<br />f. Rebecca Gormley (DoB 18/04/1998)&nbsp;<br />g. Yazmin Oukhellou (DoB 03/05/1994)&nbsp;<br />h. Scott Timlin (DoB 26/04/1988)&nbsp;<br />i. Eva Zapico (DoB 23/07/1998) &nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Mr Nwanze faces 1 count of breaching the General Prohibition under Section 19 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, and 1 count of unauthorised communications of financial promotions under Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Ms Thompson, Mr Chris, Mr Clayton, Ms Goodger, Ms Gormley, Ms Oukhellou, Mr Timlin and Ms Zapico each face 1 count of unauthorised communications of financial promotions under Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Breaching the General Prohibition is an offence under Sections 19 and 23 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 punishable upon conviction by a fine and/or up to 2 years&rsquo; imprisonment.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Communicating unauthorised financial promotions is an offence under Sections 21 and 25 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 punishable upon conviction by a fine and/or up to 2 years&rsquo; imprisonment. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Contracts For Difference (CFDs) are high-risk derivatives. The FCA has previously said that 80% of customers lose money when investing in CFDs because of the risks. They are often highly leveraged, which means they use debt to try and amplify returns, which can result in investors losing more than they invested. In the UK, the FCA has imposed <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/policy-statements/ps19-18-restricting-contract-difference-products" title="PS19/18: Restricting contract for difference products sold to retail clients">restrictions</a> on how CFDs and CFD-like options can be sold and marketed to retail customers. The FCA has been carrying out <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-highlights-continuing-concerns-about-problem-firms-cfd-sector" title="FCA highlights continuing concerns about problem firms in the CFD sector">work to address consumer harm in the UK</a>&nbsp;in this sector. &nbsp;</li>
<li>The FCA has published <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/finalised-guidance/fg24-1-finalised-guidance-financial-promotions-social-media" title="FG24/1: Finalised guidance on financial promotions on social media">finalised guidance on financial promotions on social media</a>&nbsp;to clarify our expectations for when firms and influencers use social media to communicate financial promotions, and to address emerging consumer harm that we&rsquo;ve seen arising from use of social media. &nbsp;</li>

<title>EBA Updates List Of Other Systemically Important Institutions</title>

<div> EBA, O-SIIs, transparency, assessment, banks<br />
<br />Summary: The European Banking Authority updated the list of systemically important institutions in the EU, aiming to increase transparency and providing overview and key facts. <div>
<ul>
<li><em>178 banks identified as systemically important in 2023.</em></li>
<li><em>The list aims&nbsp;to increase transparency in the EU.</em></li>
<li><em>The assessment of systemic importance remains under the remit of the national competent or designated authorities.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) updated today the list of other systemically important institutions (O-SIIs) in the EU, which, together with global systemically important institutions (G-SIIs), are identified as systemically important by the relevant authorities according to harmonised criteria laid down in the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/regulation-and-policy/own-funds/guidelines-on-criteria-to-to-assess-other-systemically-important-institutions-o-siis-"><span>EBA Guidelines</span></a><span>. This list is based on year-end-2023 data and includes the overall score calculated according to the EBA Guidelines and the capital buffer rate that the relevant authorities have set for the identified O-SIIs. The list is available also in a user-friendly visualisation tool.</span></p>
<p>The EBA Guidelines define the size, importance, complexity and interconnectedness as the criteria to identify O-SIIs. They also provide flexibility to relevant authorities to apply their supervisory judgment when deciding to include other institutions, which might have not been automatically identified as O-SIIs. This approach ensures a comparable assessment of all financial institutions across the EU, whilst still not excluding those firms that may be deemed systemically important for one jurisdiction on the basis of certain specificities.</p>
<p>The list published today aims to increase transparency in the EU by providing an overview of OSIIs, including some key facts about the banks identified. 178 banks were identified as systemically important in 2023 (at the highest level of&nbsp;consolidation in each country) with buffer rates ranging from 0.25% to 3%, as shown in the chart below.&nbsp;Relevant authorities disclose further details on the underlying rationale and identification process for their respective jurisdictions. This additional information may be relevant to understand the specific features of each O-SII and to get some insight in terms of supervisory judgment, optional indicators used, buffer decisions and phase-in implementation dates. As underlined in the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD), the assessment of systemic importance necessary to identify O-SIIs remains under the remit of the national competent or designated authorities.</p>

<div> security of supply, renewables, infrastructure, electricity market, flexibility

Summary:
- Integrated approach to electricity security, flexibility at the core
- Enhance distribution networks, empower consumers
- Accelerate transmission infrastructure development
- Apply 'Efficiency First' principle to grids and generation
- Strengthen independent regulators to address challenges <div>
<p>Today&rsquo;s ACER-CEER&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtUVVIEBQICVUxdAlYCHVZaBQAdUwoBVhpRV1IEV1cFVFdUD1IdUwBWUA5TUQIdVFsABB0GW1VWGlcDBwAZUFQEUgQAUFJQUQYFRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">position paper on the challenges of the future electricity system</a>&nbsp;calls on the European Commission, Council and Parliament to prioritise five key electricity and infrastructure challenges throughout the legislative process in their upcoming mandate(s).<br /><br />In short, the paper highlights the urgent need for Europe to facilitate the deployment of more intermittent renewables and to unlock a resilient, flexible and cost-effective electricity sector by</p>
<ol>
<li>Having an integrated pan-EU approach to electricity security of supply, with flexibility at its centre.</li>
<li>Enhancing electricity distribution networks and empowering consumers in decarbonised markets.</li>
<li>Moving quicker towards electricity transmission infrastructure development with an improved assessment at pan-European level, recognising and sharing the costs and benefits.</li>
<li>Applying the &lsquo;Efficiency First&rsquo; principle also to existing grids and generation, enhancing the capacity of what we already have.</li>
<li>Recognising that independent regulators can help address these challenges comprehensively and strengthen Member States&rsquo; trust in the EU electricity market.</li>
</ol>
<p>EU energy regulators are proposing a set of recommendations and commitments that will allow the EU as a whole and Member States to actively steer and harness the power of a new, rapidly emerging energy system that supports the clean energy transition. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing Member States with the tools to support each other in safeguarding security of supply and reducing local flexibility needs, by reaping the lessons of the recent energy crisis.</li>
<li>Exposing renewables producers and flexible resources (such as demand-response and storage) to market signals both at the investment stage and in daily operation, to moderate the costs of the energy transition.</li>
<li>Applying &lsquo;Efficiency First&rsquo; principles also to existing and soon-to-be-built grids (e.g. via innovative grid technologies to significantly increase the capacity of the grid). Furthermore, taking a more coordinated approach to grid development and usage moderates the needs and costs of additional network investment ahead.</li>
<li>Being aware that integrated markets are a key tool to achieve competitive EU electricity prices and to unlock innovation, EU institutions should focus on improving the:   
<ul>
<li>electricity forward market (to support efficient investments);</li>
<li>the day-ahead and intraday markets (for efficient operation of generation and flexible resources);&nbsp;and</li>
<li>retail markets (for delivering the necessary flexibility and providing consumers with choices fitting their preferences).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Unlocking distributed flexibility to reduce costs, by ensuring a fully neutral role of Distribution System Operators (DSOs) and that a range of pricing schemes (from dynamic to variable to fixed price contracts) is available to consumers.</li>
<li>Anchoring the benefits of a truly European electricity market through Member State commitment and trust that electricity will flow smoothly across borders, making cross-border capacities fully available for trade, and empowering independent public authorities (including regulators) to safeguard open borders and energy security of supply to the benefit of all EU citizens and businesses.</li>
</ul>

A study by Connect Energy Economics proposes a competitive market design to ensure a secure and cost-effective electricity supply. It aims to incentivize investment. It emphasizes the importance of a reliable power market to lower costs and create incentives for investments in controllable power. The study also calls for a focus on technology-neutral capacity mechanisms and emphasizes the need for a strengthened competitive market design. It highlights the advantages of a hedging obligation from the EU Electricity Market Directive and its potential to create suitable products for hedging price risks, thereby enabling electricity producers to generate secure income for financing their investments.
<br /><br />Summary: 
A study by Connect Energy Economics proposes a competitive market design to ensure a secure and cost-effective electricity supply. It aims to incentivize investment. It emphasizes the importance of a reliable power market to lower costs and create incentives for investments in controllable power. The study also calls for a focus on technology-neutral capacity mechanisms and emphasizes the need for a strengthened competitive market design. It highlights the advantages of a hedging obligation from the EU Electricity Market Directive and its potential to create suitable products for hedging price risks, thereby enabling electricity producers to generate secure income for financing their investments. <div>
<p>How can security of supply be efficiently guaranteed in the electricity market? This question was analysed by the Berlin-based consultancy Connect Energy Economics on behalf of the Association of Energy Market Innovators (BNE), the German Chamber of Industry and Commerce (DIHK) and the European Energy Exchange (EEX) in the current study &ldquo;The order of transformation &ndash; security of supply in the electricity market", which was published today.</p>
<p>Commenting on the results of the study, Achim Dercks, Deputy Managing Director of the German Chamber of Industry and Commerce, said:&nbsp;<em>"It is important for the economy that the electricity costs of a secure energy supply are limited for companies. The aim should therefore be to incentivise investment in the market instead of providing permanent state support for individual technologies. The study clearly shows that a reliable power supply is possible through market incentives."</em></p>
<p>Under the German government's planned power plant strategy, (hydrogen-ready) gas-fired power plants are to be put out to tender in the short term. In addition, the development of a market-based and technology-neutral capacity mechanism has been announced, which should be operational by 2028. The aim is to find a mechanism that ensures the supply of electricity even during hours of "dark doldrums" and guarantees system stability.</p>
<p>Author Marco Nicolosi, Managing Director of Connect Energy Economics, concludes:&nbsp;<em>"Strengthening the competitive electricity market enables a cost-effective and secure supply. Instead of discussing support schemes for power plants, which &ndash; as in the case of capacity markets &ndash; lead to a permanent need for support, incentives should be provided to strengthen the electricity market".</em></p>
<p>Robert Busch, Managing Director of the German Association of the New Energy Industry, agrees and emphasises:&nbsp;<em>"We need an intelligent framework instead of the planned promotion of capacities. It is unacceptable for us to suppress the market growth of various flexibilisation offers in favour of&nbsp;promoting natural gas power plants with a hydrogen mortgage that is uncertain at best. The foreseeable subsequent subsidy race between renewable energies and new power plants should also be avoided.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Instead, the hedging obligation from the European Electricity Market Directive (Art. 18a, source:&nbsp;<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ%3AL_202401711" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">LINK</a>) should be taken up in particular. The study describes the economic background and requirements that should be met for implementation.</p>
<p>A strengthened competitive market design can be implemented promptly and therefore enables rapid investment in new capacities. This is also because this mechanism is open to different technologies and innovations. This means that the economic costs of security of supply are lower compared to capacity markets. The national implementation of the hedging obligation is also in line with the European legal requirements of the internal market. Time-consuming state aid reviews by the EU are thus spared.</p>
<p>Peter Reitz, CEO of EEX, says:&nbsp;<em>"If the legislator consistently organises the hedging obligation, suitable products for hedging price risks that take into account the value of security of supply will be traded on the power market. This will allow electricity producers to generate secure income to finance their investments."</em></p>
<p>Busch, Dercks and Reitz agree:&nbsp;<em>"The baseline study has a central message. There is no need for permanent power plant subsidy schemes. The further development of the market design and the power market are suitable for creating the necessary incentives for investments in controllable power."</em></p>
<p>The study by Connect Energy Economics was commissioned by BNE, DIHK and EEX and is available for download at the following link:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.connect-ee.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Connect_Ordnung_der_Transformation_2024.pdf" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">LINK</a></p>

<div> issuer, structured products, CONNEXOR, Spanish market, efficiency gains
Summary: Societe Generale uses CONNEXOR in the Spanish market, benefiting from efficiency gains, automation, and standardization, providing investors with more choice and reducing time to market.<br /><br /> <div>
<ul>
<li><span>As a key issuer of Structured Products, Societe Generale has become the first to use Connexor in the Spanish market, benefitting from major efficiency gains in the listing process of warrants, certificates, structured notes, fixed income and other products</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CONNEXOR has been successfully implemented by BME by admitting the first warrants from Societe Generale in a fully automated process. For issuers of structured products, CONNEXOR brings unprecedented automation and standardization benefits, including scalability through uniform processes, high data quality and cost savings.</p>
<p>As CONNEXOR enables issuers to increase the number and variety of structured products while reducing their time to market &ndash; a key element in a volatile market to offer attractive products &ndash; , investors in the Spanish market are expected to enjoy more choice to pursue their individual investment strategies.</p>
<p>Making CONNEXOR available to the Spanish market highlights the successful&nbsp; synergies created by BME and SIX. In close collaboration, they have increased the efficiency in the competitive landscape for structured products in the Spanish Market. CONNEXOR is used within the whole BME value chain, including Iberclear as well as the Primary and Secondary Market.</p>
<p>Further important milestones to strengthen the competitive position of BME are the reduction on listing and trading fees, the streamlining of the review process of the legal documentation to&nbsp; improve the listing process for more efficiency and the implementation of a 4 digit quotation in the leverage product segment for a more granular pricing.</p>
<p>Andr&eacute; Buck, Head FI, Structured Products &amp; CONNEXOR, Exchanges, SIX, comments: &ldquo;We are very pleased that Societe Generale has started to use CONNEXOR in the Spanish market. This highlights how SIX enables financial institutions to focus on their core business while reducing operational risks and costs, making markets more efficient for the benefit of both issuers and investors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>H&eacute;lio da Silva Cl&aacute;udio, Head of Public Distribution International at Societe Generale: &ldquo;As a long standing user of CONNEXOR for the Swiss and European market, we have now started using the innovative services for the Spanish Market, which represents a key milestone for us to keep growing our presence as a leader on the Listed Products market in Spain.&ldquo;</p>

These benefits have been realized through the digital transformation of electronic Bills of Lading (eBLs) and related trade documents.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>WaveBL is a leading blockchain-based platform for digitizing electronic trade documents. Its growing global network is designed to facilitate the fast, efficient, and cost-effective transmission of eBLs globally. By introducing the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) with its digital counterpart, the verifiable LEI (vLEI), WaveBL is aiming to obtain and utilize accurate, verified digital identity data of the shippers, consignees, and other legal entities engaged in the movement of goods around the world.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>By encouraging companies to use data from their LEI records or to obtain new LEIs, WaveBL is enhancing the reliability and accuracy of the information within its global network address book. This will increase transparency across the shipping industry and boost the confidence of all stakeholders involved, including regulatory supervisors.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>An LEI is a unique ISO-standardized 20-character code assigned to a legal entity. Each LEI links to a verified company identity record held in the Global LEI Index, an open, globally recognized data bank that is free for all to access. This enables anyone to verify that an organization is indeed who it claims to be. To date, over 2.6 million LEIs have been issued globally. A vLEI is a digital counterpart to an LEI. It makes automatic recognition of an entity's LEI possible in digital processes.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>WaveBL CEO Noam Rosenfeld comments: "The integration of the LEIs into our platform represents a monumental step towards achieving a seamless digital trade environment. By ensuring the accuracy of digital identities, we are enhancing trust and transparency within our network and setting the stage for global interoperability. However, enabling automatic verification of digital credentials is a prerequisite in this regard. Currently, WaveBL handles verification processes on a platform level. As WaveBL is in search of a globally accepted standard, we have found that, the introduction of vLEIs could radically streamline this process by providing a trusted automated and universally accepted solution for verifying companies' digital identities worldwide."</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Alexandre Kech, CEO of GLEIF, comments: "By introducing LEIs and vLEIs into its platform, WaveBL is expected to enhanced the speed, accuracy, and reliability of its digital identity verification, fostering greater interoperability and security in global trade. By integrating the LEI into digital supply chain systems, enterprises are not only increasing efficiency and reducing the costs of paperwork but also equipping their industry with the tools needed to fight fraud and other forms of financial crime. I applaud WaveBL's efforts and am excited to see our collaboration continue as the vLEI ecosystem continues to gather momentum around the world."</span></span></span></p>

<title>Retail Investors Bearish On Both S&amp;P 500 And NASDAQ 100 Despite Index Rallies</title>

<ul>
<li>Spectrum's SERIX sentiment indicates a bearish trend for both the S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ 100, despite recent rises in points for the index</li>
<li>Both US indices are strongly driven by &lsquo;Glorious Seven&rsquo; stocks: NVIDIA, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, Apple and Tesla</li>
<li>NVIDIA remains the strongest single stock driving US indices, with Artificial Intelligence (AI) being a suspected primary driver of this trend</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spectrum Markets (&ldquo;Spectrum&rdquo;), the pan-European trading venue designed for retail investors, has published its SERIX sentiment data for European retail investors for June, revealing bearish trading behaviour for both US indices, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ 100.</p>
<p>The SERIX value for the S&amp;P 500 fell to 93 points, whereas on June 28<sup>th</sup> at market closure, the S&amp;P 500 index climbed up to 5,460 points. Similarly, SERIX sentiment on NASDAQ 100 fell to 96 points while the index itself rose to 19,682 points.</p>
<p>The SERIX value indicates retail investor sentiment, with a number above 100 marking bullish sentiment, and a number below 100 indicating bearish sentiment. (See below for more information on the methodology).</p>
<p><b>Market opinion</b></p>
<p>&ldquo;The strong performance of NVIDIA has significantly boosted both US indices. However, some retail investors may now be sceptical about the sustainability of this growth or may simply be engaging in profit-taking,&rdquo; says Michael Hall, Head of Distribution at Spectrum Markets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both US indices are strongly driven by the &lsquo;Glorious Seven&rsquo; stocks: NVIDIA, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, Apple and Tesla. Eight of the ten largest companies in the world are based in the United States, five of which are pure technology stocks closely tied to Artificial Intelligence (AI). The development and impact of AI will continue to play a crucial role and strongly influence both major US indices,&rdquo; Hall concludes.</p>
<p><b>Spectrum&rsquo;s June data</b></p>
<p>In June 2024, order book turnover on Spectrum was &euro;201.5 million, with 34.7% of trades taking place outside of traditional hours (i.e., between 17:30 and 9:00 CET)</p>
<p>The order book turnover was distributed among various underlying assets as follows: 76.2% on indices, 5.1% on currency pairs, 8.9% on commodities, 8.1% on equities and 1.7% on cryptocurrencies. The top three traded underlying markets were NASDAQ 100 (26.2%), DAX 40 (23.9%), and DOW 30 (11.3%).</p>
<p>Looking at the SERIX data for the top three underlying markets, the NASDAQ 100 and DOW 30 both remained bearish at 96 and 99 respectively, and the DAX 40 increased from a bearish 98 to a bullish&nbsp; 101.</p>

<table border="0" style="width: 100%;">

<div>
<p align="center"><b>Calculating SERIX data</b></p>
<p>The Spectrum European Retail Investor Index (SERIX), uses the trading venue&rsquo;s pan-European trading data to shed light on investor sentiment towards current development in financial markets.</p>
<p>The index is calculated on a monthly basis by analysing retail investor trades placed and subtracting the proportion of bearish trades from the proportion of bullish trades, to give a single figure (rebased at 100) that indicates the strength and direction of sentiment:</p>
<p align="center"><i>SERIX = (% bullish trades - % bearish trades) + 100</i><span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Trades where long instruments are bought and trades where short instruments are sold are both considered bullish trades, while trades where long instruments are sold and trades where short instruments are bought are considered bearish trades. Trades that are matched by retail clients are disregarded.

<br />
Summary:<br />
New FCA listing rules simplify UK listings, align with international standards, remove voting requirements, and support economic growth. Effective July 29, 2024. <div>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>The new rules are the biggest changes to the listing regime in over 3 decades. They aim to support a wider range of companies to issue their shares on a UK exchange, increasing opportunities for investors.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/policy-statements/ps24-6-primary-markets-effectiveness-review-feedback-cp23-31-final-uk-listing-rules" title="PS24/6: Primary Markets Effectiveness Review: Feedback to CP23/31 and final UK Listing Rules">rules published today</a>, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has set out a simplified listings regime with a single category and streamlined eligibility for those companies seeking to list their shares in the UK.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The overhaul of listing rules better aligns the UK&rsquo;s regime with international market standards. It also ensures investors will have the information they need to make decisions about their money, while maintaining appropriate investor protections to hold the management of the companies they co-own to account.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new rules remove the need for votes on significant or related party transactions and offer flexibility around enhanced voting rights. Shareholder approval for key events, like reverse takeovers and decisions to take the company&rsquo;s shares off an exchange, is still required. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The changes to listing rules follow extensive engagement across the market. The FCA has been clear that the new rules involve allowing greater risk, but believes the changes set out will better reflect the risk appetite the economy needs to achieve growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new rules will apply from 29 July 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sarah Pritchard, Executive Director, Markets and International, at the FCA said:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>'A thriving capital market is vital in delivering investment to growing companies plus returns and choice to investors. That&rsquo;s why we are acting to make it more straightforward for those seeking to list in the UK, while retaining vital protections so investors can help steer the businesses they co-own.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>'Regulation is only part of the answer in helping the UK achieve sustainable growth. Other factors also play a significant role in influencing where a company decides to list. We&rsquo;re committed to continually working together with all those who have a part to play in supporting a thriving UK capital market and thank everyone who has contributed to this work so far.'</p>
<p>Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves said:</p>
<p>'The financial services sector is central to the UK economy, and at the heart of this government&rsquo;s growth mission.</p>
<p>'These new rules represent a significant first step towards reinvigorating our capital markets, bringing the UK in line with international counterparts and ensuring we attract the most innovative companies to list here.'</p>
<h3>Background</h3>

<li>Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/policy-statements/ps24-6-primary-markets-effectiveness-review-feedback-cp23-31-final-uk-listing-rules" title="PS24/6: Primary Markets Effectiveness Review: Feedback to CP23/31 and final UK Listing Rules">Policy Statement</a>.</li>
<li>The rules will go live on 29 July 2024 following a short implementation period. We considered all the feedback received and have proceeded to finalise the implementation in line with the timeframes and approach consulted previously. We believe this timeline will enable the benefits of the reforms to be realised as soon as possible.&nbsp;</li>
<li>According to the UK Listing Review, the number of listed companies in the UK has fallen by about 40% from a recent peak in 2008. Between 2015 and 2020, the UK accounted for only 5% of Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) globally.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The FCA has already published final rules on some of the recommendations from Lord Hill&rsquo;s UK Listing Review and the&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-kalifa-review-of-uk-fintech" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kalifa Review on UK fintech.<span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;Read&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/policy/ps21-22.pdf" target="_blank">PS21/22: Primary Market Effectiveness Review: Feedback and final changes to the Listing Rules.</a>&nbsp;</li>
<li>The&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-listings-review" rel="noopener" target="_blank">UK Listing Review<span class="ext"></span></a>, Chaired by Lord Hill, also made a recommendation to the FCA to consider changes to the Listing Rules in relation to SPACs (Special Purpose Acquisition Companies) in its final report published on 3 March 2021. The FCA published&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/policy-statements/ps21-10-investor-protection-measures-spacs-listing-rules" target="_blank">final rules</a> on strengthening investor protections in SPACs in July 2021 and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/discussion/dp22-2.pdf" target="_blank">feedback</a>&nbsp;to our discussion document in May 2022.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The new rules support the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/corporate-documents/our-approach-consumers#:~:text=Our%20objectives,-We%20have%20a&amp;text=protect%20consumers%20%E2%80%93%20we%20secure%20an,in%20the%20interests%20of%20consumers">FCA&rsquo;s primary objective to protect consumers and markets, as well as its secondary objective to promote competition</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>As well as complying with the new regime, companies must also continue to have corporate governance in place and engage with their shareholders.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Changes to the Official List will start to appear from 26 July 2024 ahead of the implementation date of 29 July 2024.</li>
<li>The date of publication of this Policy Statement and the UK Listing Rules Instrument 2024 (FCA 2024/23) is 11 July 2024. An applicant for the admission of securities that has made a complete submission to the FCA for an eligibility review for listing&nbsp;<span>by 4:00pm on 11 July 2024</span>&nbsp;will (where the securities have not been admitted to listing prior to 29 July 2024) be treated as an &lsquo;in-flight applicant&rsquo; under the UK Listing Rules Instrument.</li>

Summary:<br />
Euronext launches Euronext Wireless Network (EWIN) in London, offering faster order transmission, 100% resilient, reduced latency, direct microwave link, supported by major financial institutions. <div>
<p align="justify"><span>Euronext, the leading pan-European market infrastructure, today announced the successful launch of its new London-based microwave service, the Euronext Wireless Network (EWIN). Euronext is the first exchange in Europe to offer &ldquo;Plug &amp; Play&rdquo; order entry in London via microwave technology. This service is set to significantly enhance the speed of order transmission between London, UK, and Bergamo, Italy, where Euronext&rsquo;s core data centre is located, offering unparallelled improvements in latency for our many London-based members.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>The Euronext Wireless Network (EWIN) is a fully resilient service with 100% fibre back-up, providing order submission via microwaves from London Equinix LD4 to Bergamo Aruba IT3 in less than 4 milliseconds. This new service is provided in collaboration with McKay Brothers, the largest independent microwave network provider in Europe.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>The EWIN microwave network represents a major technological advancement in the financial services sector. By leveraging the faster transmission speeds of microwave technology, EWIN provides a direct and highly efficient communication pathway that significantly reduces the time it takes to send orders to Euronext&rsquo;s single liquidity pool, powered by the single technology platform Optiq</span><span>&reg;</span><span>.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>EWIN combines several key benefits, providing Euronext members with a technological edge in the fast-paced world of financial trading. First of all, the service has been designed with full straight-through processing (STP). EWIN also has full fibre back-up, making it 100% resilient. EWIN significantly reduces latency, ensuring faster and more reliable order execution. Lastly, it creates a direct microwave link between London and Bergamo, two major financial data hubs in Europe. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have confirmed the deployment of the new technology since its go-live date.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>St&eacute;phane Boujnah, CEO of Euronext and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext, said:&nbsp;</span><span>&ldquo;Euronext continuously invests and innovates to improve access to its markets, which offer the largest liquidity pool in Europe covering seven European markets, a unified order book, technology platform and harmonised rule book. The launch of the Euronext Wireless Network, known as EWIN, marks an important milestone in Euronext&rsquo;s commitment to innovation and excellence in the financial markets. With EWIN, we are enhancing our technological infrastructure to reinforce Euronext&rsquo;s position as the leading listing and trading venue in Europe, and to provide our members with the tools they need to thrive in an increasingly competitive environment.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>St&eacute;phane Tyč, Co-Founder of McKay Brothers and Quincy Data, said:&nbsp;</span><span>&ldquo;We are honoured to support Euronext's creation of a groundbreaking wireless order entry offer.

<div> reforms, financial advice regulation, ASIC, superannuation, FSG
<br />
The Treasury Laws Amendments Act 2024 advances financial advice regulation, clarifies superannuation trustee charges, streamlines fee renewal, and updates FSG requirements. 
<br /><br />Summary: The DBFO Act advances financial advice regulation, clarifies superannuation trustee charges, streamlines fee renewal, updates FSG requirements, governs conflicted remuneration, and sets consent requirements. <div>
<p>ASIC acknowledges royal assent of the&nbsp;<em>Treasury Laws Amendments (Delivering Better Financial Outcomes and Other Measures) Act 2024</em>&nbsp;(DBFO Act).</p>
<p>Royal assent of the DBFO Act marks an important step in advancing reforms to financial advice regulation as part of the Commonwealth Government&rsquo;s response to recommendations 7, 8, 10, 13.1&ndash;13.5 and 13.7&ndash;13.9 of the Quality of Advice Review.</p>
<p>Reforms under DBFO Act include:</p>
<ul>
<li>clarifying the legal basis in the&nbsp;<em>Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993&nbsp;</em>for superannuation trustees to charge individual members for financial advice from their superannuation account, and clarifying associated tax consequences under the&nbsp;<em>Income Tax Assessment Act 1997</em>,</li>
<li>streamlining ongoing fee renewal and consent requirements, including removing the requirement to provide a fee disclosure statement,</li>
<li>providing more flexibility in how Financial Services Guide (FSG) requirements can be met,</li>
<li>simplifying and clarifying the provisions governing conflicted remuneration, and</li>
<li>introducing new standardised consent requirements for life risk insurance, general insurance and consumer credit insurance commissions.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Industry should be aware of the reforms, including transitional periods if applicable, and have, or be in the process of updating, systems and processes as required.</p>
<p>ASIC has registered&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2024L00864/asmade/text">ASIC Corporations (Amendment) Instrument 2024/554</a></em>&nbsp;which makes consequential amendments to ASIC instruments to reflect the changes to FSG requirements.

Changes to PF 209 will apply only to entities applying for an Australian financial services licence going forward.</p>
<p>Over the coming months, ASIC will update regulatory guidance impacted by the DBFO Act. For more information about the reforms under the DBFO Act, including a summary of its transitional timeframes, and regulatory guidance that ASIC anticipates updating, visit&nbsp;<a href="https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-services/regulatory-reforms/delivering-better-financial-outcomes-dbfo-package/" title="Delivering Better Financial Outcomes (DBFO) package">Delivering Better Financial Outcomes (DBFO) package</a>.</p>

<title>"Growth And Opportunities In The ILS Market: A Singapore Perspective" - Speech By Mr Lim Cheng Khai, Executive Director, Financial Markets Development Department, Monetary Authority Of Singapore, At The Artemis ILS Asia 2024 On 11 July 2024</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/growth-and-opportunities-in-the-ils-market-a-singapore-perspective-speech-b/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Steve Evans, Editor-in-Chief of Artemis<br />Ladies and gentlemen<br /><br /><span><span>Introduction</span></span></p>
<p>1.&nbsp;<span> </span>Good morning. Thank you for having me back at the Artemis ILS Asia Conference. I am happy to see the conference back for its sixth installation in Singapore. To our international guests, a warm welcome.<br /><br />2.&nbsp;<span> </span>Artemis Asia is always a highlight in the insurance industry&rsquo;s calendar of events. It is an important platform for risk cedants, sponsors and investors to exchange insights and identify valuable opportunities in the ILS market, with a focus on Asia.<br /><br /><span><span>A Growing ILS Market</span></span></p>
<p>3.&nbsp;<span> </span><span>The global ILS market experienced strong growth in the number of issuances in 2023, which continued into 2024.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Alternative reinsurance capital exceeded the US$110 billion mark in the second quarter of this year, after breaking the US$100 billion mark for the first time last year&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/growth-and-opportunities-in-the-ils-market#1">[1]</a></span>&nbsp;.</li>
<li>The catastrophe bond market saw a record issuance volume of US$15 billion in 2023&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/growth-and-opportunities-in-the-ils-market#2">[2]</a></span>&nbsp;, partly driven by growing participation in ILS markets. 
<ul>
<li>13 new cedants entered the catastrophe bond market last year, accounting for US$2.1 billion of capital&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/growth-and-opportunities-in-the-ils-market#3">[3]</a></span>&nbsp;.</li>
<li>There was also good growth in first time cedants from France, Germany, Korea and New Zealand, covering wind and earthquake perils.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This growth in ILS issuances covering non-US risks is attractive to fund managers and investors, who are keen to diversify their ILS portfolio to include more non-US exposures.</li>
<li>This momentum continues in 2024. In the first half alone, new catastrophe bond issuances have already reached US$12.1 billion&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/growth-and-opportunities-in-the-ils-market#4">[4]</a></span>&nbsp;, or 80% of the full year volume in 2023. 
<ul>
<li>This included Puerto Rico Parametric Re Ltd. which was the first issuance by the Government of Puerto Rico.</li>
<li>This year also saw the issuance of the first catastrophe bond to cover cloud outage risks&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/growth-and-opportunities-in-the-ils-market#5">[5]</a></span>&nbsp;, a segment of the cyber reinsurance market where retrocessional coverage is often lacking.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Singapore saw four catastrophe bond renewals this year &ndash; a vote of confidence from the cedants on Singapore&rsquo;s value as an ILS domicile&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/growth-and-opportunities-in-the-ils-market#6">[6]</a></span>&nbsp;.</li>
<li>We also continue to receive interest from potential issuers covering risks from India and Africa.</li>
</ul>
<p><span><span>Capturing Investor Interest</span></span></p>
<p>4.&nbsp;<span> </span><span>ILS investors have enjoyed good returns and relatively lower volatility, and also portfolio diversification benefits.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>ILS have low correlation with traditional financial assets that dominate most portfolios.</li>
<li>They can also offer a competitive risk-return profile relative to other financial assets.<br /> 
<ul>
<li>Last year, the average yield of an ILS fund and cat bond fund reached record highs of 15.4%&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/growth-and-opportunities-in-the-ils-market#7">[7]</a></span>&nbsp;and 19.7%&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/growth-and-opportunities-in-the-ils-market#8">[8]</a></span>&nbsp;respectively. They outperformed other alternative asset classes, such as infrastructure, real estate and hedge funds&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/growth-and-opportunities-in-the-ils-market#9">[9]</a></span>&nbsp;.</li>
<li>ILS instruments have delivered better annual returns than comparable assets of similar credit quality. Over the past fifteen years, ILS instruments&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/growth-and-opportunities-in-the-ils-market#10">[10]</a></span>&nbsp;delivered annualised&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/growth-and-opportunities-in-the-ils-market#11">[11]</a></span>&nbsp;returns of 6.42%&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/growth-and-opportunities-in-the-ils-market#12">[12]</a></span>&nbsp;. This compares with 4.86%&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/growth-and-opportunities-in-the-ils-market#13">[13]</a></span>&nbsp;for similarly-rated high yield bonds, over the same period.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>At the same time, ILS instruments also experienced lower volatility than traditional financial assets &ndash; 4 times lower than the S&amp;P 500 and 3 times lower than high yield bonds.</li>
<li>The attractive returns from ILS assets are capturing mindshare, with greater interest and growing demand from clients in Asia, albeit from a small base.</li>
</ul>
<p>5.&nbsp;<span> </span><span>ILS can also help investors achieve their ESG objectives.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>In 2020, Mexico&rsquo;s catastrophe bond supported by the World Bank, was the first catastrophe bond where the proceeds could be used by the World Bank Group&rsquo;s International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, or IBRD, to fund sustainable development programmes in its member countries&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/growth-and-opportunities-in-the-ils-market#14">[14]</a></span>&nbsp;. The World Bank has continued this practice since.</li>
<li>In the past two years, two catastrophe bonds that were issued in Singapore invested their bond proceeds into sustainable collateral, in the form of Sustainable Development Bonds issued by the IBRD.<br /> 
<ul>
<li>The collateral finances projects under the World Bank Group that achieve positive environmental and social outcomes in country programmes, such as increasing renewable energy supply or increasing access to water and sanitation services.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Such structures can help cedants to align ILS issuances with their own ESG objectives, while making ILS more attractive to investors with ESG mandates.</li>
</ul>
<p>6.&nbsp;<span> </span><span>There is good potential for the growing institutional and private wealth investor base in Asia, including Singapore, to invest in ILS.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Traditionally, ILS investors have been pension funds, institutional investors, and private wealth clients in North America, Europe and Japan.</li>
<li>The accumulation of family wealth and institutional capital in Asia-Pacific presents opportunity to tap into a bigger investor pool.<br /> 
<ul>
<li>From 2011 to 2022, total assets under management or AUM in Asia-Pacific grew at an annual rate of 14%, outpacing the global average of 9%&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/growth-and-opportunities-in-the-ils-market#15">[15]</a></span>&nbsp;.</li>
<li>Wealth in the Asia-Pacific affluent segment is estimated to expand at an annual rate of 11% from 2021 to 2026&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/growth-and-opportunities-in-the-ils-market#16">[16]</a></span>&nbsp;. There will also be continued growth in pension assets. This is estimated to reach US$32.4 trillion&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/growth-and-opportunities-in-the-ils-market#17">[17]</a></span>&nbsp;, driven by reforms to existing pension systems and shifts towards alternative investments&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/growth-and-opportunities-in-the-ils-market#18">[18]</a></span>&nbsp;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>7.&nbsp;<span> </span><span>To promote investor interest, MAS has been working with industry partners on investor outreach and education.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>In the past year, we have partnered SGX, Aon, and Amundi to host investor education sessions. MAS has also engaged private banks, and the Wealth Management Institute in Singapore to build mindshare on ILS as an asset class.</li>
<li>While some are not immediately ready to allocate capital to ILS, it is an important first step for the private wealth segment and institutional asset owners to be apprised of opportunities in this asset class.</li>
<li>Market participants have also shared with us that they are beginning to see some private wealth clients in Singapore allocating to ILS, through their banks&rsquo; discretionary allocations.</li>
<li>We welcome more stakeholders in the ILS ecosystem to partner with MAS and other opinion multipliers to engage the investor base in Singapore.</li>
</ul>
<p>8.&nbsp;<span> </span><span>Against these tailwinds of increasing ILS volumes and a growing pool of investors, ILS fund managers too, have grown their assets under management.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>The combined AUM for the top tier ILS fund managers globally has increased by 4.2%&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/growth-and-opportunities-in-the-ils-market#19">[19]</a></span>&nbsp;over the past six months to US$80 billion&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/growth-and-opportunities-in-the-ils-market#20">[20]</a></span>&nbsp;.</li>
<li>MAS has been engaging some ILS fund managers that are considering setting up offices in Singapore.</li>
</ul>
<p><span><span>Opportunities in Asia</span></span></p>
<p>9.&nbsp;<span> </span><span>Asia also presents a good match for investors and fund managers&rsquo; demand for geographical diversification in their ILS portfolios.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Asia is vulnerable to climate risks and natural disasters.<br /> 
<ul>
<li>Over the past thirty years, Asia-Pacific countries experienced six natural disasters yearly on average, double that of countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, and triple that of sub-Saharan Africa&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/growth-and-opportunities-in-the-ils-market#21">[21]</a></span>&nbsp;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is scope for private-public partnerships to help Asian governments, at sovereign and municipal levels, to tap the alternative risk transfer market to protect key assets, or vulnerable segments of their population, from natural catastrophes.</li>
<li>This is already common in Latin America and some African states. Countries such as Jamaica, Mexico, Chile and Peru, with the support of the World Bank, have issued catastrophe bonds in recent years.<br /> 
<ul>
<li>It enhanced their governments&rsquo; ability to undertake reconstruction and rehabilitation of housing and public infrastructure in the events of natural perils, while maintaining fiscal resilience. And this lessened impact on the livelihoods of their citizenry.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For example, the Peru catastrophe bond was triggered by a magnitude 8.0 earthquake in 2019. The payout of US$60 million aided Peru&rsquo;s recovery from the earthquake.</li>
<li>The World Bank is growing its capabilities in Singapore, to actively support the risk financing needs and promote solutions in Asia.</li>
<li>To facilitate proper pricing and underwriting, we will need better data and risk modelling.</li>
<li>Singapore is committed to supporting these efforts.<br /> 
<ul>
<li>To address data gaps, Singapore, in partnership with the ASEAN Secretariat and the Nanyang Technological University Institute of Catastrophe Risk Management, supported the ASEAN Disaster Risk Financing and Insurance Phase 2 programme (ADRFI-2). A data exchange and analytics portal which provides high resolution exposure and loss data to ASEAN member states has been developed, to support ASEAN governments to manage and mitgate their natural catastrophe risk exposures.</li>
<li>We also have a growing base of professional service providers and insurance expertise to support ILS issuances, including legal professionals, insurance managers, risk modellers, claims reviewers and loss reserve specialists in Singapore.</li>
<li>Lastly, issuers can tap on MAS&rsquo; ILS Grant scheme, which defrays the costs of ILS issuances in Singapore. The ILS grant scheme has supported 28 catastrophe bond issuances over the past 5 years, raising a total of US$4.4 billion. It was enhanced in 2023 to allow cedants to issue a broader spectrum of ILS instruments, including sidecars and collateralised reinsurance arrangements. We are also looking into the required regulatory, tax and legal infrastructure required to support these instruments, and will progressively implement them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span><span>Innovation in ILS Markets</span></span></p>
<p>10.&nbsp;<span> </span><span>Looking ahead, the ILS market will continue to innovate and grow, to meet market needs and demand for risk transfer and sharing. Just like how the ILS concept all began in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>The twinning of ESG features with ILS is one.&nbsp;</span>For example, Generali published its Green ILS Framework in 2019 and issued its first green catastrophe bond in 2021 &ndash; a &euro;200 million transaction that freed up &euro;28.1 million of regulatory capital for the insurer and avoided 35.1 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/growth-and-opportunities-in-the-ils-market#22">[22]</a></span>&nbsp;. 
<ul>
<li>In the debut Generali green catastrophe bond, the solvency capital that was freed-up was channelled towards investment in green assets or underwriting green businesses.</li>
<li>The Green ILS proceeds would also be invested in a portfolio of green high quality liquid assets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>Another recent innovation is the use of blockchain and smart contracts to make the issuance and trading of catastrophe bonds more efficient and transparent.</span><br /> 
<ul>
<li>This began in 2016 when Nephila and Allianz successfully piloted the use of smart contract in a natural catastrophe swap transaction. This was followed the following year by the first issuance of a private catastrophe bond on a blockchain.</li>
<li>Just two days ago, Schroders Capital, in partnership with Hannover Re, announced the launch of a pilot ILS tokenisation project which aims to enhance how ILS assets are managed and invested&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2024/growth-and-opportunities-in-the-ils-market#23">[23]</a></span>&nbsp;. During testing, it successfully enabled reinsurance contracts to be tokenised and traded on a public blockchain. It enabled many time-consuming processes to be automated, and reduced settlement time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>11.&nbsp;<span> </span>We encourage the ILS industry to also use Singapore as a test-bed for innovative products, tapping on our deep sustainable finance and digital assets eco-systems here.<br /><br />12.&nbsp;<span> </span>To round up, MAS will continue to work closely with the ILS industry to offer Singapore as a conducive base for Asia&rsquo;s ILS market, and match Asia&rsquo;s risk financing needs with growing investor interest.<br /><br />13.&nbsp;<span> </span>I look forward to our discussions today, and I wish you a fruitful time at Artemis ILS Asia 2024.<br /><br />Thank you.</p>

<div class="row">
<div id="article">
<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-md-8">
<p>Thank you, Jacky. I am happy to be here in Adelaide and appreciate the opportunity to speak with all of you.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20240710a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;Considering the significant developments in the global economy over the past few years, now is an appropriate time to reflect on the economic reverberations the COVID-19 shock caused around the world. Examining the common inflation experiences and monetary policy challenges across several countries, including Australia and the United States, is a helpful exercise for policymakers and economists alike. Today, I will first talk about how monetary policymakers responded in similar fashion to the COVID-19 pandemic and, later, to high inflation during the recovery. I will discuss common features of the recent inflation experience across countries and the importance of global shocks. With disinflation in train across most countries, I will consider what we can learn from past cycles of monetary easing. I will finish with a discussion of how the use of alternative scenarios could help monetary policymakers communicate how they might respond to a range of possible economic outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Common Monetary Policy Response to the Pandemic</strong><br />In the spring of 2020, economies around the world shut down or sharply limited business activity, especially for in-person services, including dining out and traveling. Governments introduced extraordinary fiscal support aimed at alleviating the socioeconomic effects of the pandemic. And, to prevent sharp financial and economic deterioration, most central banks responded aggressively by lowering policy rates, ramping up asset purchases, and taking other actions to support the flow of credit to households and businesses. Those efforts were sustained throughout 2020 and much of 2021, as the initial turmoil in financial markets subsided but the health situation remained uncertain.</p>
<p>Advanced economy central banks that had positive policy rates before the pandemic, including the Fed and the central banks of Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom, cut these rates to near zero, as shown in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/cook-20240710-fig1.PNG" id="fig2">figure 1.</a>&nbsp;Central banks that entered the pandemic with policy rates already at zero, such as Sweden, or negative&mdash;including the euro area, Japan, and Switzerland&mdash;left their rates unchanged. Meanwhile, almost all emerging market economy (EME) central banks cut their policy rates. Although central banks acted quickly to reduce rates, policymakers cited a few reasons to refrain from deeper cuts: Among EME policymakers, concerns were expressed that further lowering rates risked exacerbating capital outflows, while some advanced economy central banks commented that further rate cuts, particularly in negative territory, could harm banks' financial health or would provide little additional monetary stimulus.</p>
<p>Many central banks also conducted significant asset purchases. These purchases were initially aimed at restoring market functioning and providing liquidity, but they also were seen as lowering long-term yields and easing broader financial conditions. The Fed and the Bank of England (BOE) restarted their purchases, while the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Swedish Riksbank increased the pace of their existing programs. And here, the Reserve Bank of Australia began asset purchases and introduced a target for the three-year government bond yield at the same level as its overnight rate.</p>
<p><strong>The Rise of Inflation and the Common Monetary Policy Response</strong><br />Over the course of 2021, as financial conditions improved, a strong recovery in consumer demand outpaced still constrained supply capacity in many countries, leading to production and transportation bottlenecks, which ultimately resulted in inflation. The surge in inflation was initially mostly concentrated in finished goods and commodities but later spread to services.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20240710a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;As the economy started reopening with the lifting of lockdowns and rollout of vaccines, demand for services picked up. Similar to what played out with goods, the pickup in demand for services ran into a constrained supply of service workers. As services are more labor intensive than goods, and labor supply was still reeling from the consequences of the pandemic, the rebalancing of consumption from goods to services led to higher rates of inflation and nominal wage growth.</p>
<p>In response to rising inflation, central banks around the world started to remove some of the support that they provided during the height of the pandemic. As a first step, central banks let many of the emergency support programs&mdash;in which they had bought assets other than national government bonds&mdash;expire. Next, central banks generally began to taper their purchases of government securities and then to end net purchases late in 2021 or the first half of 2022.</p>
<p>Then some central banks began to raise interest rates. The first to do so were EME central banks that saw particularly sharp increases in inflation driven by exchange rate depreciation and by the surge in prices for food, which makes up a large part of the consumption baskets in their economies. Advanced economy central banks generally were more patient on raising interest rates in 2021, as inflation expectations in their economies were better anchored than in emerging economies. Among advanced economy central banks, the first to hike in the autumn of 2021 were central banks in Norway and New Zealand, whose economies had strong recoveries. The BOE first raised its policy rate in December 2021, citing a strong labor market and sharply rising inflation. The Bank of Canada and the Fed began to raise rates in March 2022, and the ECB first raised its deposit rate (from negative 0.5 percent to zero) in July 2022. Most advanced economy central banks undertook a sequence of policy actions in which they first began to raise their policy rates and later began to reduce the size of their balance sheets over time.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding the Rise and Fall of Inflation in Recent Years</strong><br />The inflation surge in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic was synchronized across advanced and emerging economies, as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/cook-20240710-fig2.PNG" id="fig3">figure 2</a>&nbsp;illustrates. The rapid increase in prices reflected an upswing in demand for goods, strained supply chains, tight labor markets, and sharp hikes in commodity prices exacerbated by Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The run-up was not only for overall headline inflation, but also for its core components.</p>
<p>A plethora of factors can explain the global co-movement in headline and core inflation. First, fluctuations in global food and energy prices broadly pass through to consumer prices in individual countries. But there are other possible explanations, including global supply constraints and synchronous policy responses. The pandemic experience was also a stark reminder of the importance of international trade and input-output linkages for the propagation of supply shocks&mdash;for example, production and shipping disruptions in the semiconductor industry in Asia constraining production and creating important price pressures in downstream markets, such as motor vehicles in the U.S.</p>
<p>Research on the recent inflation episode is still very much in its infancy, and I look forward to learning from the ongoing work on the subject. One important contribution already is Ben Bernanke and Olivier Blanchard's analysis of pandemic-era inflation in 11 economies. Separate teams for each of the 11 economies estimated a comparable model of inflation and its drivers. They find for the U.S. and, with some variation, for other countries that "relative price shocks and sectoral shortages drove the initial surge in inflation, but as these effects have reversed, tight labor markets in most (although not all) countries have become a relatively more important factor."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20240710a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a></p>
<p>In a recent FEDS Notes article, economists at the Federal Reserve Board took head-on the task of decomposing world inflation into common and country-specific components and using this decomposition to analyze the sources of inflation around the world.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20240710a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;Despite the different approach, they reached conclusions broadly in line with those of Bernanke and Blanchard. As shown in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/cook-20240710-fig3.PNG" id="fig4">figure 3</a>, they find that the global components of inflation accounted for a large part of the variation in the average inflation around the world during the post-COVID period. This is an experience with precedents during the oil price shocks of the 1970s and the 1980s.</p>
<p>This study also found that the global components of inflation also predict the path of near-term inflation. Historically, once global components start moving, they maintain the course and take time to reverse. This persistence and the recent decline in global components of core and noncore inflation suggest that the world disinflationary process will continue, as shown in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/cook-20240710-fig4.PNG" id="fig5">figure 4</a>. The predicted path is in line with a gradual return of inflation toward central bank targets.</p>
<p>Of note, as shown in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/images/cook-20240710-fig5.PNG" id="fig6">figure 5</a>, the authors find that the post-pandemic rise in global inflation was linked to both commodity-driven price shocks and shocks to global economic activity&mdash;such as the sharp decline and rebound in activity due to the COVID‑19 pandemic and the associated labor market shortages. This situation contrasts with the 1970s and 1980s, when commodity price shocks played a prominent role in inflation's fluctuations. Additionally, idiosyncratic shocks were important drivers of the surge in global inflation in 2022 and its decline in 2023. These shocks may capture economy-specific forces, including natural gas disruptions that more greatly affected European economies than others in the aftermath of Russia's war on Ukraine.</p>
<p>In sum, through the lens of the model, the ongoing disinflation is driven by waning effects of commodity price shocks and by a gradual normalization of global economic activity, amid the resolution of shortages and imbalances in labor markets.</p>
<p><strong>Current Common Monetary Policy Challenges</strong><br />With global components of inflation turning down, most countries have experienced a significant fall in inflation relative to its peak. Similarly, most central banks stopped raising their policy rates over the past year. Some are considering how long to keep rates at restrictive levels or, if inflation picks up again, whether to raise rates further. The Bank of Canada, the ECB, the Swedish Riksbank, and the Swiss National Bank, have begun to cut policy rates, highlighting progress toward meeting inflation goals amid sustained softness in economic activity. Indeed, unlike in the U.S., the level of gross domestic product (GDP) in some advanced economies remains well below what would be implied by their respective pre-COVID GDP trends.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20240710a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;Even among those cutting rates, however, the future path of the policy rate is generally seen as dependent on a continuing decline of inflation toward target levels.</p>
<p>For all central banks, the question is how best to ensure continued disinflation while avoiding unnecessary damage to the economy. The generally desired outcome is a soft landing, in which inflation returns to the central bank's target inflation level or range without inducing a recession or a large increase in unemployment. How likely is such a scenario? It may be too soon to definitively say for the current economic cycle. But Fed Board staff have examined past episodes of monetary policy easing in 13 advanced economies over the past five decades. They find that soft landings are rare, according to their analysis published in another recent FEDS Notes article.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20240710a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;In most of the cases that they studied, central banks were not successful in bringing inflation back to near target in a timely manner. And when they were successful in taming inflation, it often was associated with a recession.</p>
<p>However, soft landings are not unprecedented. When such a landing occurred, on average it was associated with a smaller preceding policy tightening. Soft landings were also more likely when policy easing began with inflation already close to target and when there was a relatively firm growth backdrop. In the U.S., what I have seen so far appears to be consistent with a soft landing: Inflation has fallen significantly from its peak, and the labor market has gradually cooled but remains strong. Of course, I am closely monitoring incoming data to see how the economy further develops.</p>
<p>It is possible that some features of the recent inflation episode may make a soft landing more likely in countries around the globe. As I discussed, Bernanke and Blanchard found that much of the inflation episode came from relative price shocks and sectoral shortages that have since been resolved. And while they found that tight labor markets have since taken over as the main drivers of inflation, there are signs that such tightness is easing. For instance, in the U.S., the ratio of vacancies to unemployment has fallen back to its pre-pandemic level and the rate of voluntary quits has declined, as workers are less confident of finding a better job. Thus, my baseline forecast (and that of many outside observers) is that inflation will continue to move toward target over time, without much further rise in unemployment.</p>
<p><strong>Monetary Policy Communications</strong><br />Of course, forecasts are subject to considerable uncertainty, and policymakers must consider a range of possible outcomes. A key challenge of monetary policy communications is discussing how policy would respond to changes in the economic outlook. Central bankers are faced with a tradeoff between predictability and flexibility. On the one hand, many observers would like to know in advance what the path for the policy rate will be, while, on the other hand, a central bank needs to remain nimble and data dependent. As a result, central bankers often try to convey their "reaction function" so observers understand how policy might adapt to incoming data and the implications for the economic outlook.</p>
<p>In his recent review of forecasting for monetary policymaking and communications at the BOE, Ben Bernanke suggested that the Bank consider supplementing its published forecasts with the use of alternative scenarios to help the public understand its policy reaction function.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20240710a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;For similar reasons I try to incorporate a discussion of alternative scenarios in my own speeches. Fed policymakers, like those at many other central banks, also benefit from staff analysis using models to explore how the forecast would change relative to the baseline if certain assumptions are changed. The challenge is how to use such alternative scenarios in our official communications.</p>
<p>Policy communications are an area where we can learn a lot from what other central banks have done, and communication practices have developed over time. The BOE was an early innovator with its fan charts, which emphasized that its forecasts for GDP and inflation were subject to growing uncertainty the longer the time horizon. Of course, forecasts for economic variables need to be conditioned on some assumption of the path of policy rates. While early practice was to condition on unchanged rates or on the path of rates implied by market pricing, some central banks innovated by publishing their own forecasts for policy rates. This was originally done by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand and later by the Norges Bank and the Riksbank. Since 2012, the Federal Reserve's Summary of Economic Projections also includes the path of the policy rate that each policymaker "deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability."<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20240710a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a>&nbsp;I continue to take great interest in communications and other monetary policy practices by foreign central banks.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I think it is clear we have learned much from the experience of the past few years. I must stress that the human toll of the pandemic cannot and should not be overlooked. Purely in terms of economics, the recent period does stand out as an unusual case study. Economies around the world effectively faced the same shock at nearly the same moment. We were then able to observe how various economies around the world responded to the shock, including the actions of central banks and fiscal policymakers. I am glad to have highlighted some of the interesting research that has begun to explore this space, and I am sure much more study on this unique time in our history will soon occur, and that can be powerful. What is not unique to the pandemic is that we often have common macroeconomic experiences and face common monetary policy challenges, which is what makes discussions like the one today so valuable.</p>
<p>Thank you. It is a pleasure to be here in Adelaide. I look forward to continuing our conversation.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Following on its two previous strategic announcements of launching Asia in 2024, today Sterling Trading Tech (Sterling), in response to local market demand, is building the initiative further by resourcing it with local business development experts.</span></p>
<p><span>Industry veterans Clara Lee and Jason Yoon-Hendricks have been recruited as APAC Sales Directors. Both have extensive experience in business development and relationship management. Lee was previously with Eventus and MSCI (in analytics). Prior to Sterling, Yoon-Hendricks has served with Refinitiv, Thomson Reuters, and REDI Global Technology. They are responsible for building out Asia market share &ndash; part of Sterling&rsquo;s overall growth plan and trajectory.</span></p>
<p><span>Korea, Hong Kong, and Singapore increasingly seek sophisticated OMS and Risk models as well as trading capability that can provide firms with a competitive advantage. Sterling is poised to meet that demand.&nbsp;To date, 2024 has&nbsp;seen substantial interest in and success with Sterling&rsquo;s approach.</span></p>

We anticipate exponential growth as a result of their efforts and are excited to have them on the team.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>Said Andrew Actman, Managing Director of Business Development, at Sterling: &ldquo;Our expectation that Asia was underserved in the robust OMS and Risk and Margin models that Sterling delivers has proven to be correct. As we look to our Asia strategy, we now have local presence to focus on creating continued opportunities and to service clients already onboarded.&rdquo;</span></p>

<title>US Office Of The Comptroller Of The Currency Amends Enforcement Action Against Citibank, Assesses $75 Million Civil Money Penalty</title>

<div> amendment, Citibank, OCC, deficiency, penalty
Summary: 
The OCC issued an amendment to the Cease and Desist Order against Citibank, imposing a $75 million penalty for compliance violations. The bank must address deficiencies in risk management, compliance, data governance, and internal controls. The penalty will be paid to the U.S. Treasury. The Federal Reserve Board also took a related action against Citigroup. <div>
<p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) today issued an amendment to its October 7, 2020, Cease and Desist Order against Citibank, N.A, Sioux Falls, South Dakota, related to deficiencies in enterprise-wide risk management, compliance risk management, data governance, and internal controls (2020 Order).</p>
<p>The amendment is based on the bank&rsquo;s failure to meet remediation milestones and make sufficient and sustainable progress towards compliance with the 2020 Order. It was issued to ensure Citibank prioritizes the remediation work, including through the allocation of sufficient resources.</p>
<p>The amendment supplements but does not replace the 2020 Order, which remains in full force and effect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Citibank must see through its transformation and fully address in a timely manner its longstanding deficiencies,&rdquo; said Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael J. Hsu. &ldquo;While the bank&rsquo;s board and management have made meaningful progress overall, including taking necessary steps to simplify the bank, certain persistent weaknesses remain, in particular with regard to data. Today&rsquo;s amendment requires the bank to refocus its efforts on taking necessary corrective actions and ensuring appropriate resources are allocated for this purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The OCC also assessed a $75 million civil money penalty against Citibank based on the bank&rsquo;s violations of the 2020 Order and lack of processes to monitor the impact of data quality concerns on regulatory reporting.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve Board took a separate but related action against Citigroup, the bank's holding company.</p>
<p>The OCC penalty will be paid to the U.S. Treasury.</p>

<div> Fed Listens, Event, Monetary policy, Chicago, Economic conditions
Summary:<br />
Fed Listens event in Chicago to discuss economic conditions, childcare, and employment. Panelists and audience provide insights to inform policymaking. <div>
<p>Thank you, Austan, for the warm welcome. It is really a pleasure to join you in Chicago for this year's&nbsp;<em>Fed Listens</em>&nbsp;event.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20240710a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;When we started&nbsp;<em>Fed Listens</em>&nbsp;back in 2019, the initiative was part of a broad, comprehensive review of the decisionmaking framework we use to pursue our monetary policy goals of maximum employment and price stability. In the years that followed, we have met with people from across the country and from a wide variety of backgrounds and experiences to learn about how the economy has been recovering from the COVID experience.</p>
<p>Each&nbsp;<em>Fed Listens</em>&nbsp;event created a wonderful opportunity to take a step back, to ask questions of those who are directly impacted by our policies and the prevailing economic conditions, and then really&nbsp;<em>listen&nbsp;</em>to their feedback. I am extremely proud that&nbsp;<em>Fed Listens</em>&nbsp;has grown and developed into an ongoing venue for the Federal Reserve Board and the Reserve Banks to foster an ongoing conversation and discussion with those who are directly experiencing current economic conditions.</p>
<p>As many of you may recall, at last year's&nbsp;<em>Fed Listens&nbsp;</em>event here in Chicago, we discussed youth employment and joining the labor force following the pandemic, which were especially inspiring. So, in that spirit, today is not only a wonderful opportunity to continue this important conversation in the Seventh District, but also an opportunity to dig deeper into issues that affect local families through the childcare industry, working parents, and employers.</p>
<p>Austan and I enjoyed getting to know our panelists better earlier today, and I am looking forward to learning more about their experiences through the upcoming panels and discussions. I am also very pleased to welcome our audience&mdash;both in person and those tuning in online. I view&nbsp;<em>Fed Listens</em>&nbsp;as an excellent example of Board and System convenings that enable us to gain important insights about economic conditions by engaging directly with those experiencing the economy.</p>
<p>As you all know, Fed officials and economists review a vast amount of economic data on a regular basis. Discussions like those we will engage in today provide color and context to supplement the other economic data we monitor. Your perspectives help us gain deeper insights into how we are meeting our dual mandate of maintaining maximum employment and stable prices.</p>
<p>A better understanding of a wide variety of this type of data, from the considerations families face in making spending decisions (including the costs of childcare) to factors weighed by business owners in applying for loans and offering benefits to help attract top talent, all provide better insight into our data collection. These conversations help us to gain perspective on how Americans in different areas of the country are faring. Some of the issues discussed today may be unique to the Seventh District, but certainly many of these themes and dynamics are present throughout the country and across all 12 Federal Reserve Districts. Seeking out local perspectives is one of the great advantages of the Federal Reserve System's regional structure and of the&nbsp;<em>Fed Listens&nbsp;</em>structure in particular.</p>
<p>Earlier, I had the pleasure to meet each of the panelists you'll hear from today. Their varied experiences and backgrounds across sectors lay an important foundation for today's discussion. We hope that our attendees will also join in to share your own observations as you experience these issues in your own lives, businesses, and communities. Your perspective will help to inform our work as policymakers with the responsibility to promote a strong and vibrant economy for all Americans.</p>
<p>So with that, I would like to say, thank you again, Austan, and especially to recognize your entire Chicago Fed team for hosting this&nbsp;<em>Fed Listens</em>&nbsp;event today and for the opportunity to be part of this discussion.</p>
<p>Without further ado, I am delighted to get our conversation started by turning things over to Robin Newberger, who is a policy advisor here at the Chicago Fed.</p>
<hr align="left" size="1" width="33%" />

Summary:
Gurbir S. Grewal, the director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, delivered a speech at a symposium on regulating finance in the changing administrative state, addressing the application of securities laws to crypto asset securities, investor harm, compliance, and public trust. He discussed the history of the securities laws and the need to differentiate between the substance and form of transactions in applying these laws. Grewal also emphasized the need for robust enforcement to protect investors and enhance public trust. In the epilogue, Grewal provided an update on recent developments in crypto markets, including the increase in investor complaints, the decline in public trust, and the SEC's continued efforts to address noncompliance and protect investors. <div>

<p>What follows is a speech I delivered at the William &amp; Mary Business Law Review&rsquo;s Third Annual Symposium entitled &ldquo;Regulating Finance in a Changing Administrative State&rdquo; on April 1, 2023. Since then, there have been many developments in the world of crypto asset securities, some of which I address in an epilogue to the speech, below.</p>

<p class="text-align-center"><a id="intro"></a>Introduction</p>
<p>Thank you to the&nbsp;<i>William &amp; Mary Business Law Review</i>&nbsp;for hosting this symposium and for inviting me to participate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thrilled to be back at my law school alma mater. This is a special place &ndash; one that not only helped me hone my legal skills, but also one that helped mold me into a &ldquo;citizen lawyer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For me, it was my experience with the late Professor John Levy and participating in the legal aid clinic that he ran that first showed me how we can use our law degrees to not only protect, but also to uplift others. It&rsquo;s an experience that has helped shape my entire public service journey.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m grateful that the law school continues to train excellent citizen lawyers&mdash;a number of whom I&rsquo;ve had the privilege of working with during my time as New Jersey Attorney General and now at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (&ldquo;SEC&rdquo;).</p>
<p>I am equally grateful that in developing the next generation of citizen lawyers the law school is emphasizing inclusion &ndash; a core value that has guided much of my work.</p>
<p class="text-align-center">* * *</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s topic &ndash; &ldquo;Regulating Finance in a Changing Administrative State&rdquo; &ndash; is no doubt a timely one, but also one that could easily serve as my job description. And the panels you&rsquo;ve organized touch on nearly every aspect of our work in the Enforcement Division.</p>
<p>So naturally, I have many thoughts I would like to share with you, but before I do, I must make clear that my remarks today are in my official capacity as the Director of the Division of Enforcement, but do not necessarily reflect the views of the Commission, the Commissioners, or other members of the staff.</p>
<p>Perhaps I should also add to that disclaimer that the views I plan to share this morning may not be the most popular you will hear today. I think that is because the theme underlying this symposium is a concept that I not only disagree with, but is also one that is frequently advanced in some corners&mdash;that technological innovations have so dramatically transformed the financial markets since the 1930s, when Congress first passed the federal securities laws and created the SEC to enforce them,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[1]</a>&nbsp;that those laws are now somehow ill-suited to regulate our financial markets, especially when it comes to crypto assets.</p>
<p>Some of our critics&mdash;perhaps a number of you&mdash;argue, instead, that new, bespoke rules and regulations are needed for this particular industry. They believe that this is best achieved either through notice and comment agency rulemaking or by Congress developing an entirely new regulatory framework for crypto assets.</p>
<p>At the same time, a number of defendants are using newly crafted legal concepts like the &ldquo;major questions doctrine,&rdquo; to challenge certain SEC enforcement actions as being beyond the authorities Congress delegated to the SEC.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[2]</a></p>
<p>You will no doubt discuss all of these issues and more throughout the day, but in many cases you will do so in the abstract. What I would like to do this morning is provide you with some context because the securities laws are anything but abstract to the millions of investors that are harmed when promoters of securities, including crypto asset securities, and others engage in fraudulent activity or otherwise violate our rules and regulations.</p>
<p class="text-align-center"><a id="everything"></a>I. Everything &ldquo;New&rdquo; is Old&mdash;Really Old&mdash;and Well-Established</p>
<p>The history of our securities laws makes clear that Congress always intended the definition of what is a security to be principles-based and flexible to cover the many kinds of schemes where promoters seek others&rsquo; money and promise profits in return.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[3]</a></p>
<p>Following the stock market crash of 1929, in the midst of the Great Depression and during a period of grave economic crisis, there was a general loss of trust in our financial markets. In response, Congress passed the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which created the SEC, to protect investors and the markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[4]</a></p>
<p>A key feature of the Securities Act was to require companies offering &ldquo;securities&rdquo; and raising money from the public to register their offerings with the SEC and to provide investors full, fair, and truthful disclosures of material information about their offerings, their financial health, and their executives.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[5]</a>&nbsp;The Act defined &ldquo;securities&rdquo; broadly to include various kinds of investments, including what it called an &ldquo;investment contract.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[6]</a></p>
<p>No sooner was the Act passed than companies began arguing that whatever they were doing did not constitute the offer and sale of securities and, therefore, they did not need to comply with the law&rsquo;s registration requirements. To support their positions, the companies often focused on the name or form of the product or transaction, not its substance. They argued that because their form of offering was not specifically enumerated by statute, it did not need to be registered.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[7]</a></p>
<p>Sound familiar?</p>
<p>And as happens today, back then the SEC sued to stop ongoing unregistered securities offerings. Time and again, federal courts focused on the economic reality of the transactions at issue and the broad investor protections Congress intended to advance in enacting the federal securities laws.</p>
<p>And time and again, those courts determined that the transactions at issue&mdash;ranging from investment opportunities in oil barrels to fishing boats to silver foxes&mdash;did in fact constitute the offer or sale of securities.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[8]</a><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>And then in 1946, the Supreme Court issued its seminal opinion in&nbsp;<i>SEC v. Howey</i>, setting forth the test for what constitutes an &ldquo;investment contract,&rdquo; and therefore a security, for purposes of the federal securities laws.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[9]</a>&nbsp;The Court explained that Congress intended &ldquo;investment contract&rdquo; to apply broadly to a variety of situations in which individuals invested money in a common enterprise with the expectation that they would earn a profit through the efforts of others.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[10]</a>&nbsp;This approach &ldquo;embodie[d] a flexible rather than a static principle, one that is capable of adaptation to meet the countless and variable schemes devised by those who seek the use of the money of others on the promise of profits.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[11]</a></p>
<p>And&nbsp;<i>Howey&nbsp;</i>has proven to be a remarkably flexible and resilient test that courts have since applied to find a wide variety of offerings to be investment contracts and, thus, securities. The list includes offerings related to whiskey, cosmetics, self-improvement courses, and pay phones,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[12]</a>&nbsp;as well as a surprising number of creatures: earthworms, beavers, chinchillas, and even cattle embryos.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[13]</a></p>
<p>Notably, none of these offerings involved stocks or bonds or the kinds of investments you or I might have in our portfolios. And that&rsquo;s really the point of&nbsp;<i>Howey</i>: whether something is a security depends on the&nbsp;<i>substance</i>&nbsp;of the transaction &ndash; not its name, not its form, and not its underlying technology.</p>
<p>As Justice Thurgood Marshall put it decades later, &ldquo;Congress painted with a broad brush,&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[14]</a>&nbsp;and its &ldquo;purpose in enacting the securities laws was to regulate investments, in whatever form they are made and by whatever name they are called.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[15]</a></p>
<p>Critics who now dismiss&nbsp;<i>Howey&nbsp;</i>as outdated because it involved orange groves nearly 80 years ago and demand a new regulatory regime overlook this history and, I think, completely miss the point: the definition of a security is, and has always been, principles-based to allow for the flexibility that comes with innovative investment products, technology-driven or otherwise.</p>
<p class="text-align-center"><a id="investors"></a>II. Investors in Crypto Asset Securities Are Being Harmed as We Speak</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, the &ldquo;major question&rdquo; for us is: are investors being hurt within our remit? If the answer is yes, then we must act, and we must do so with a sense of urgency. And increasingly, the answer to that question has been yes.</p>
<p>The current turmoil in the crypto markets is taking a real toll on everyday Americans. According to one survey, approximately 16% of U.S. adults have invested, traded, or used crypto, and among that group approximately 46% report their investments have done worse than they expected.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[16]</a>&nbsp;While some of this may be the result of natural market forces, some of it is certainly due to fraud and other unlawful activity.</p>
<p>Let me give you an overview of the type of activity we are encountering because it&rsquo;s quite often left out of conversations like the ones you will have at this conference. To date, the SEC has charged many issuers with failing to register initial coin offerings, as well as their offerings of so-called lend, earn, and staking products, meaning that the offerings lacked required disclosures &ndash; disclosures that ensure that investors can make informed investment decisions.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[17]</a></p>
<p>The SEC has also alleged in a number of our actions that certain unregistered crypto offerings are nothing but straight rips, Ponzi schemes, affinity frauds, or other types of scams.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[18]</a></p>
<p>In the actions the SEC has recently brought in this space, our allegations have described, among other things:</p>
<ul>
<li class="Body">Products labeled as &ldquo;defi&rdquo; offerings that are neither decentralized, nor finance, but rather frauds;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[19]</a></li>
<li class="Body">Stablecoins that are neither stable, nor coins, but rather fraudulent;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[20]</a></li>
<li class="Body">So-called &ldquo;trusted&rdquo; protocols and &ldquo;smart contracts&rdquo; that, despite representations to the contrary, can be, and are, used to manipulate the market for crypto asset securities;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[21]</a></li>
<li class="Body">Platforms, protocols, and exchanges that fail to provide any details about their cybersecurity risks subjected to malicious attacks that result in investor harm;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[22]</a>&nbsp;and</li>
<li class="Body">In the end, investors, large and small, defrauded, and billions in customer assets misused or stolen.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[23]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of these alleged schemes have resulted in lines of investor victims at the doors of bankruptcy courts hoping to recover a fraction of their hard-earned money.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[24]</a></p>
<p>And just this week, the SEC alleged that a noncompliant crypto intermediary simultaneously acted as exchange, broker, and clearing agency without registering with the SEC&mdash;thereby putting investors at risk from conflicts of interest and inadequate oversight.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[25]</a></p>
<p>So, while we can appreciate the innovation around, and the technological advancements of, blockchain and distributed ledger technology, we must also be cognizant of the risks and harms to investors associated with the related products and offerings. As in any other space, we have a duty to analyze whether the activity is subject to the federal securities laws and, if so, whether those laws have been violated.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s precisely what we have done. Over the last decade, based on Enforcement Division investigations and recommendations, the SEC has brought well over 100 crypto-related actions involving unlawful activity across the crypto markets as I have just outlined.</p>
<p>And in every case, where federal courts have had to determine whether there were &ldquo;securities&rdquo; at issue, the courts have applied the&nbsp;<i>Howey</i>&nbsp;test&mdash;looked at the economic realities of the offerings, and, even though the offerings at issue involved supposedly novel technologies, rejected defense arguments that they were not securities.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[26]</a></p>
<p>During this same period, the SEC has spoken clearly and consistently about the applicability of the securities laws in the crypto space, citing decades of Supreme Court precedent explaining the test for determining whether something is an &ldquo;investment contract,&rdquo; and thus a security.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[27]</a></p>
<p>To put it bluntly, there is not a lawyer or market participant in this area that does not know the applicable regulatory framework and tests. As Chair Gensler has stated, &ldquo;Not liking the message isn&rsquo;t the same thing as not receiving it.&rdquo;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29">[28]</a>&nbsp;That is also likely why courts have rejected &ldquo;fair notice&rdquo; and due process arguments in a number of these actions.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30">[29]</a></p>
<p class="text-align-center"><a id="innovation"></a>III. Innovation and Compliance Are Not Incompatible</p>
<p>I would like to turn now to another topic that also sometimes gets lost in the headlines, and that is the importance of compliance in the crypto markets.</p>
<p>First, when issuers of crypto asset securities do not comply with registration requirements, investors and analysts do not get mandatory disclosures about the issuer, their offerings, and their financial condition. Investors cannot make informed investment decisions without that information. Disclosures that are especially important in a market of thousands of different offerings involving technology that most laypeople do not understand.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31">[30]</a></p>
<p>Second, in a compliant securities market, separate functions generally are performed by different legal entities, each of which are subject to separate regulations that protect investors. This creates separation and even a healthy degree of antagonism between the functions: brokers do not want to execute their clients&rsquo; trades on questionable exchanges, and exchanges do not want to work with unreliable clearing agencies. Importantly, national securities exchanges do not take custody of assets that trade on the exchange and thus do not have the ability to lend them out or use them to make risky bets.</p>
<p>In contrast, in the crypto world sometimes these functions collapse under one roof, as we alleged just this week with respect to the Beaxy exchange.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32">[31]</a>&nbsp;This aggregation of functions creates significant conflicts of interest and exponentially increases risk of investor harm as we saw with the collapse of FTX, where we allege that Sam Bankman-Fried and others not only fraudulently raised billions of dollars from investors in FTX, but also misused billions in funds belonging to FTX&rsquo;s trading customers.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33">[32]</a></p>
<p>Finally, in a compliant securities market, the firms fulfilling these various functions, such as exchanges, broker-dealers, and clearinghouses, are subject to supervision, oversight, and examination by the SEC.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34">[33]</a>&nbsp;Among other things, they are required to maintain books and records and make them available to the SEC, and they are required to have internal controls.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35">[34]</a>&nbsp;This all provides additional, essential layers of protection for investors.</p>
<p>The quarrel, therefore, is with noncompliant actors, not the technology or its promises. The technology is actually beside the point. We have to regulate markets and protect investors based on current realities and existing risks. There are no exceptions to the application of the federal securities laws based on the future potential or benefits that an offering may provide.</p>
<p>Moreover, innovation and compliance with the securities laws are not mutually exclusive. As Chair Gensler has repeatedly stated, the SEC staff stand ready to work with crypto entrepreneurs and understand the need to be flexible in applying our disclosure requirements.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36">[35]</a></p>
<p class="text-align-center"><a id="public"></a>IV. Public Trust Requires Robust Enforcement of the Securities Laws</p>
<p>I would like to finish by touching on a topic that&rsquo;s important to this conversation and a bit personal for me: public trust.</p>
<p>In my early speeches as Enforcement Director, I spoke about the declining trust in our financial institutions and markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37">[36]</a>&nbsp;While there is no single cause for this decline, it is in part due to the perception that we&mdash;the regulators&mdash;are failing to hold bad actors accountable, coupled with the belief that there are two sets of rules: one for the big and powerful and another for everyone else.</p>
<p>None of this is abstract either. I&rsquo;ve seen it firsthand as a federal, county, and state prosecutor. I saw it firsthand speaking to victims as my state&rsquo;s attorney general, and I see it now in this role. And the effects of this diminished trust can be especially pronounced among minority and marginalized communities.</p>
<p>For example, studies show that a majority of Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, and LGBTQ Americans feel that traditional financial institutions &ldquo;are not meant for people like me.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38">[37]</a>&nbsp;Due to historical injustices and negative experiences, many members of these communities may also have skepticism, or outright hostility, towards the government.</p>
<p>This lack of trust can lead to further victimization. I&rsquo;ve seen this with certain types of affinity frauds, especially among immigrant communities, where the perpetrator may appeal to the victims&rsquo; closeness to their own community and potentially their suspicion of outsiders.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39">[38]</a></p>
<p>Not infrequently, we encounter suspicion so strong that the victims are reluctant to cooperate with us or believe our allegations even in the face of overwhelming evidence of the fraud.</p>
<p>And through these experiences, I have developed a playbook, one that we are employing at the Enforcement Division, to protect investors and reclaim and enhance public trust. It&rsquo;s built on three principles:&nbsp;<span><i>robust enforcement</i></span>&nbsp;&ndash; moving our investigations with a sense of urgency and addressing emerging risks;&nbsp;<span><i>robust remedies</i></span>&nbsp;&ndash; seeking penalties and remedies at levels adequate to both hold bad actors accountable and deter misconduct; and&nbsp;<span><i>robust compliance &shy;&shy;</i>&shy;&shy;&ndash;&nbsp;</span>working with market participants and gatekeepers to create a culture of compliance and cooperation to prevent misconduct.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40">[39]</a></p>
<p>Another response to this decline in trust has been the &ldquo;predatory inclusion&rdquo; tactics of crypto entities directed at Black, brown, and other marginalized communities.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41">[40]</a>&nbsp;Here, I&rsquo;m talking about the familiar (but so far unsupported) narratives that crypto will be predicated on a permissionless and trustless environment; that it will increase financial inclusion;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42">[41]</a>&nbsp;that it will uplift the unbanked or underbanked; that it will help them build wealth and increase upward mobility; and that if you &ldquo;step right up, everyone&rsquo;s a winner.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43">[42]</a></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also seen predatory tactics on full display in case after case, where the SEC has alleged that &ldquo;influencers&rdquo; are touting unregistered offerings to investors without disclosing that they are being compensated to do so.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44">[43]</a>&nbsp;We allege they do so by lying about their returns from their own, in some cases fictional, crypto investments, and without disclosing they are being paid tens of thousands of dollars for their tweets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45">[44]</a></p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s the direct result of these efforts or for other reasons beyond the scope of this presentation, crypto assets are the only major financial products that Black Americans are more likely to own than white Americans.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46">[45]</a>&nbsp;And there is some evidence that Black and brown investors have now been disproportionately harmed during the downturn of crypto markets over the last two years.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47">[46]</a></p>
<p>But despite such losses in the crypto industry, distrust in the traditional financial system is still driving investors towards crypto. We saw that just a few weeks ago when the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and questions about the stability of the wider banking system pushed increased interest in crypto assets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48">[47]</a></p>
<p>In some ways, we are now at the intersection of the two responses to addressing diminished public trust I just outlined. People who looked to crypto as a refuge from the ills of traditional finance are now experiencing those same ills in the crypto markets. They are being harmed by the very types of behavior that led Congress to create the securities laws in the first place&mdash;the same behaviors that have led to reduced trust in the markets: misstatements or misleading disclosures, conflicts of interest, and insiders abusing their positions for personal advantages at the expense of ordinary investors.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49">[48]</a></p>
<p>I believe that in this moment, we have to leverage the playbook I described. We must act with all the tools at our disposal to protect investors and enhance public trust and confidence in our markets.</p>
<p>This means continuing to get behind the labels, focusing on substance over form, ensuring that actors comply with the securities laws, and holding those that do not accountable, without fear or favor.</p>
<p class="text-align-center"><a id="conclusion"></a>Conclusion</p>
<p>In the end, I believe that it should be against this backdrop of real investor harm, precedent, and the need to enhance public trust and confidence in our markets, that you consider the familiar industry talking points (or tweets in this day and age), that I&rsquo;m certain you&rsquo;ll hear (or reference) throughout the day&mdash;that according to some we are exceeding our authority, regulating by enforcement, stifling innovation, and driving it overseas.</p>
<p>As long as investors in securities are being harmed now, we must act now.</p>
<p>Thank you again to the&nbsp;<i>William &amp; Mary Business Law Review</i>&nbsp;for inviting me to speak to you today. I am privileged to have had this opportunity and I hope that you have a great, contextualized discussion today.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
<p class="text-align-center"><a id="epilogue"></a>Epilogue</p>
<p>By the time I became Enforcement Director in July 2021, the SEC had already brought dozens of enforcement actions to address widespread noncompliance in the crypto markets. But, noncompliance, and the attendant investor risk, remained pervasive. Meanwhile, four months later, the combined market capitalization of crypto assets reached approximately $3 trillion.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50">[49]</a>&nbsp;This marked a 15-fold increase from just two years earlier.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51">[50]</a>&nbsp;Soon after, however, the crypto market cratered, abetted by a series of high-profile failures and bankruptcies of major firms that caused extensive investor losses.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52">[51]</a>&nbsp;It lost two-thirds of its market capitalization in just nine months, shedding value even quicker than it had gained it.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53">[52]</a><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>In short, my tenure as Director has coincided with extreme volatility and investor risk in the crypto markets. This has been vividly demonstrated by the dramatic increase in the number of complaints about crypto that investors submitted to the SEC&rsquo;s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy (&ldquo;OIEA&rdquo;), from 820 in fiscal year 2019,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54">[53]</a>&nbsp;the first year that OIEA&rsquo;s annual list of Top Ten Categories of Complaints included crypto, to 5,357 in fiscal year 2023.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55">[54]</a></p>
<p>In response to this upheaval and rampant noncompliance, we have redoubled our enforcement efforts, some of which I was privileged to highlight in my speech at William &amp; Mary. Perhaps unsurprisingly, there have been even more developments in the crypto markets since those remarks. Just days later, the Pew Research Center released a survey finding that nearly a third of Americans who had ever invested in, traded, or used crypto, no longer held any.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56">[55]</a>&nbsp;The number of lower-income Americans who had gotten out of crypto was even higher, at 43%,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57">[56]</a>&nbsp;providing another vivid rejoinder to the narrative that crypto will uplift the unbanked, help them build wealth, and increase upward mobility.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58">[57]</a></p>
<p>The same survey found that a whopping three-quarters of Americans who have heard about crypto do not believe that crypto is reliable and safe.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59">[58]</a>&nbsp;Given the continued noncompliance in this space, they have good reasons to be concerned. For example, in June 2023, the SEC charged the operators of the largest crypto asset trading platform in the world with allegedly combining the functions of an exchange, broker, dealer, and clearing agency without complying with the registration provisions of the federal securities laws applicable to any of those functions, depriving investors of crucial investor protections.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60">[59]</a>&nbsp;The SEC&rsquo;s complaint also alleged that the operators commingled certain customer assets and attempted to evade U.S. securities laws by announcing sham controls that they disregarded so that they could keep high-value U.S. customers on their platforms.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61">[60]</a></p>
<p>The next day, the SEC also charged the operator of the largest crypto asset trading platform in the United States with intertwining the traditional services of an exchange, broker, and clearing agency without complying with the registration provisions applicable to any of them.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn62" name="_ftnref62">[61]</a>&nbsp;Taken together, these matters, which were brought just about two months after my remarks, highlight what I believe to be the continued risk to investors in the crypto markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn63" name="_ftnref63">[62]</a></p>
<p>As if that were not enough, the Enforcement Division continues to address fraud and noncompliance in new and old forms in the crypto space. Among others, the SEC filed its first actions charging the illegal unregistered offerings of crypto asset securities in the form of purported non-fungible tokens (NFTs), applying the same well-trod test discussed above to determine that the NFTs were offered and sold as &ldquo;investment contracts,&rdquo; and therefore were securities.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn64" name="_ftnref64">[63]</a>&nbsp;The SEC also brought its first case charging a purportedly decentralized autonomous organization with failing to register its pooled crypto asset vehicles as investment companies, as required under the federal securities laws.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn65" name="_ftnref65">[64]</a>&nbsp;And in another recent action, the SEC brought charges against individuals allegedly responsible for a $1.7 billion crypto asset-related pyramid scheme.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn66" name="_ftnref66">[65]</a></p>
<p>Also notable, since my remarks, several courts have issued rulings in ongoing litigation expressly reaffirming&nbsp;<i>Howey&rsquo;s&nbsp;</i>application to crypto assets and rejecting not only the defendants&rsquo; blanket arguments that the crypto assets at issue were not securities, but also, in the cases where the court addressed it, their attempt to invoke the &ldquo;major questions doctrine.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn67" name="_ftnref67">[66]</a></p>
<p>In addition, in April 2024, the SEC completed its first trial involving crypto asset securities. After a nine-day trial, a jury in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York found the defendants liable for orchestrating what the SEC alleged was a years-long fraud involving crypto asset securities that led to massive investor losses when the scheme unraveled.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn68" name="_ftnref68">[67]</a>&nbsp;Following the verdict, the defendants agreed to pay more than $4.5 billion in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/grewal-remarks-age-crypto-070224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn69" name="_ftnref69">[68]</a></p>
<p>In sum, the crypto markets remain fast-moving, volatile, and, I believe, rife with investor risk. But as the foregoing remarks and this epilogue make clear (and if the past and my remarks at William &amp; Mary are prologue), the Division of Enforcement has moved with urgency, and will continue to do so, to fulfill our investor protection mandate in these markets.</p>

NGX introduces Impact Board for sustainability instruments, coinciding with Green Bond Advisory Group Meeting, aiming to drive responsible investing. <br /><br />Summary: NGX launches Impact Board for sustainable finance, attracting domestic and international investment, setting new standard for responsible investing in Nigeria. <div>
<p>Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) has unveiled its Impact Board, a dedicated platform for listing sustainability instruments, following approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This initiative was announced during a Closing Gong Ceremony in Lagos on Wednesday, July 10th, honoring Mr. Balarabe Abbas Lawal, Minister of Environment, and commemorating the 8th Green Bond Advisory Group Meeting.</p>
<p>The ceremony, which saw Mr. Lawal, Co-Chair, Green Bond Advisory Group Meeting, engage with investors and stakeholders on the proposed federal government Green Bond issuance, brought together key figures in Nigeria's financial and environmental sectors. Attendees included Dr. Emomotimi Agama, Director-General of the SEC, alongside delegates from the Debt Management Office, Ministry of Environment, issuers, and issuing houses.</p>
<p>This launch marks a pivotal moment in NGX's steadfast commitment to integrating sustainability into the core of Nigeria's capital market. By providing a high-visibility platform for sustainability instruments, NGX aims to usher in a new era of responsible investing, offering forward-thinking issuers access to purpose-driven capital.</p>
<p>Addressing the pressing environmental challenges facing the country, Mr. Lawal emphasized, "With issues like flooding, pollution, and deforestation, we urgently need funds to tackle them. This is why we are approaching the market." His sentiment was echoed by Dr. Agama, who affirmed SEC's support: "We are ready to bolster the sustainable finance market, aiming to deepen it with diverse instruments that contribute to Nigeria's sustainable development."</p>
<p>Alhaji (Dr.) Umaru Kwairanga, Group Chairman, Nigerian Exchange Group (NGX Group) highlighted NGX's capabilities, stating, "We possess the capacity, resources, and technology to raise the funds required by the Federal Ministry of Environment and the Nigerian economy to achieve the goals outlined in the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals."</p>
<p>Mr. Ahonsi Unuigbe, Chairman of NGX, underscored the significance of the Impact Board, noting its potential to encourage issuers like the Federal Government to leverage the market for financing strategic, sustainability-focused projects.</p>
<p>Further emphasizing the Group's commitment, Mr. Temi Popoola, Group Managing Director and CEO of NGX Group, stated, "We are dedicated to driving sustainability with the right frameworks, which is why giving visibility to this class of instruments is crucial for achieving our goals."</p>
<p>Mr. Jude Chiemeka, CEO of NGX, framed the launch as more than just a new platform, describing it as "a paradigm shift in how we approach finance and development." This sentiment was reinforced by Mr. Abimbola Babalola, Head of Trading and Products at NGX, who highlighted the Board's potential to foster capital-raising opportunities and create new tradeable products for investors.</p>
<p>The timing of the Impact Board's launch, coinciding with the 8th Green Bond Advisory Group Meeting, underscores the growing momentum behind sustainable finance initiatives in Nigeria. This synergy between governmental environmental strategies and market-driven solutions promises to accelerate the country's progress towards its sustainability goals.</p>
<p>As Nigeria steps into this new chapter of sustainable finance, the Impact Board stands poised to attract both domestic and international investment, driving growth and supporting the nation's sustainable development agenda. This innovative platform not only represents NGX's vision for the future but also sets a new standard for responsible investing in Africa's largest economy, potentially serving as a model for other emerging markets.</p>

<title>LSEG Shipping Research: Extreme Weather Disruptions At The Cape Of Good Hope Bring Container Traffic To A Standstill</title>

<div> Severe weather, Cape of Good Hope, container traffic, LSEG Shipping Research, strong cyclone
Summary:<br />Severe weather halts container traffic near Cape of Good Hope. LSEG analysis shows no ships passing since July 8th. Predicts a record-breaking Atlantic hurricane season. AAO positive phase may signal the end of strong cyclones. Another cyclone may impact South Africa later this week. Waves off South Africa coincided with a strong cyclone and below-normal temperatures. <div>
<p><span>Severe weather conditions near the Cape of Good Hope has brought container traffic to a halt this week according to analysis by LSEG Shipping Research.</span></p>
<p><span>Since Monday 8<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;July, daily transit data and vessel location data via the LSEG Workspace Interactive Map show no containerships passing the Cape&nbsp;of&nbsp;Good&nbsp;Hope &ndash; adding to congestion and delays exacerbated by the Red Sea crisis. The Interactive Map layer shows marine weather and waves over 10m high.</span></p>
<p><span><b>Fabrice Maille, Global Head of&nbsp;Shipping &amp; Agriculture at LSEG</b>, comments:&nbsp;<i>"We have a complete stop at the Cape&nbsp;of&nbsp;Good&nbsp;Hope for containerships &ndash; east and west. There is no significant change in Red Sea traffic so far, but several containerships have made turnarounds and/or are waiting&nbsp;off the coast of Durban.&rdquo;</i></span></p>
<p><span><b>Isaac Hankes, Senior Weather Analyst, at LSEG</b>&nbsp;noted that the waves off the South Africa coast coincided with a strong cyclone that impacted the region on the last Sunday, and it was associated with temperatures that were well below normal.</span></p>
<p><span>He comments:<i>&nbsp;&ldquo;This was a powerful cyclone (with winds that generated the waves), but we are not seeing anything extraordinary in the data. Something comparable happened in early June, for example. These events are like a cold air outbreak in the South Africa winter, in the Northern Hemisphere context.&rdquo;</i></span></p>
<p><span>He also added:<i>&nbsp;&ldquo;There is another cyclone likely to impact South Africa later this week, so the issue with the waves may continue yet with respect to shipping issues. However, the AAO will soon move into its positive phase, which could signal the end&nbsp;of&nbsp;strong cyclones after the one later this week.&rdquo;</i></span></p>
<p><span>These precedents support LSEG Commodities' recent forecast that showcased a possibly record-breaking Atlantic hurricane season this year, which is following the expected pattern after the effects of Beryl as an exceptionally strong storm for this time of the year.</span></p>

<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>Thanks very much to our hosts at Asia House today. It is a great pleasure to be here and have the opportunity to discuss the outlook for UK monetary policy with such a distinguished group.</p>
<h3>Transformation</h3>
<p>The monetary policy function at the Bank of England has recently been the subject of a review by ex-Federal Reserve Chair (and Nobel laureate in economics) Ben Bernanke. The results of this review were published as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/independent-evaluation-office/forecasting-for-monetary-policy-making-and-communication-at-the-bank-of-england-a-review/forecasting-for-monetary-policy-making-and-communication-at-the-bank-of-england-a-review">Forecasting for monetary policy making and communication at the Bank of England</a>.</p>
<p>The recommendations embodied in this review point to a need for reform: both in how the Bank of England&rsquo;s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) operates, and in the support provided to the Committee by Bank of England staff. Such change is entailed by a need to respond to the challenges posed by structural changes to the economy. Among these changes number (inter alia): the global financial crisis; the Covid-19 pandemic; the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and its impact on international energy and food prices; events in the Middle East; climate change; and the technological possibilities and threats of artificial intelligence. (The list could go on.)</p>
<p><strong>Strategy&nbsp;</strong>- Piecemeal change to the existing policy framework is no longer sufficient to address emerging new challenges. A comprehensive approach that internalises the spillovers among data analyses, macroeconomic forecasting, interest rate choices and policy communication is required. &lsquo;<strong>The whole is greater than the sum of the parts</strong>&rsquo;.</p>
<p>We need to be conscious of how all these elements fit together. In our internal discussions at the Bank of England, we have often used the metaphor of a single thread hanging off an expensive sweater. It is tempting to pull on that hanging thread to restore the pristine appearance of the sweater. And sometimes such an approach works. But the danger exists that pulling on the single thread leads to a wider unravelling of the cloth. In the extreme, the whole garment might disintegrate in our hands.</p>
<p>This metaphor cautions against making cosmetically appealing short-term changes to the policymaking framework, for fear that they may have wider and deeper side effects over time that go well beyond what had originally been envisaged. The UK monetary policymaking framework may have run that risk in the past &ndash; and paid the penalty on occasion. Developing a better understanding of how policy measures and choices interact with one another &ndash; of the structural relationships among them, to use the economic jargon &ndash; is the only way of managing this risk.</p>
<p><strong>Change&nbsp;</strong>- Any new monetary policy strategy for the UK also needs to embody a judicious mix of the old and the new.</p>
<p>It would obviously be ill-advised to discard those elements of the existing policy framework that have performed well in recent challenging times. Among these I would list many of the basic institutional features of the UK system: an independent MPC; a price stability mandate for monetary policy established in legislation; operationalisation of that mandate in the form of a quantified target for inflation; and accountability of MPC members to Parliament. Retaining these elements is key: &lsquo;<strong>we don&rsquo;t want to throw the baby out with the bath water</strong>&rsquo;.</p>
<p>As reflected in last month&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/may/ben-broadbent-ccbs-new-evidence-on-the-monetary-transmission-mechanism-workshop">valedictory speech</a>&nbsp;of my sadly now former colleague (indeed former boss) Ben Broadbent &ndash; and also in last Monday evening&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2024/july/speech-by-jonathan-haskel-at-escoe-kings-college-london">valedictory</a>&nbsp;of my equally sadly soon-to-be-former colleague (but not boss) Jonathan Haskel &ndash; this institutional framework has proved central to the considerable improvement in UK monetary policy performance over recent decades.</p>
<p>These two eminent economists both provide compelling evidence that the contrast between: (1) on the one hand, the prompt return of UK inflation to target following the significant external impulses generated by Covid and the invasion of Ukraine; and (2) on the other hand, the higher and much more persistent profile of UK inflation following the 1970s oil price shocks, owes much to these institutional improvements.</p>
<p>But equally, while retaining these benefits of institutional innovations associated with the adoption of inflation targeting, we also need to recognise the need for changes to the strategy in the face of changes in context and circumstance. And we must be open to learning from the experience and guidance of others.</p>
<p>Together with members of the Bank of England&rsquo;s modelling team, I was privileged to spend time last week with my former colleagues at the European Central Bank in Frankfurt. We drew valuable lessons from their experiences and expertise. A few weeks ago, the Centre for Central Banking Studies at the Bank of England hosted a workshop for central bank chief economists at which Prof. Bernanke very generously offered views on his recent report, triggering a rich discussion of the strategic challenges facing macroeconomic forecasting and monetary policy.</p>
<p>Not only do such events offer an opportunity for mutually beneficial exchanges of views and ventilation of ideas within the central banking community, but also &ndash; in those areas where Prof. Bernanke has identified that the Bank of England has work to do &ndash; they allow us to draw on the experience of others, avoid the pitfalls of implementing incremental changes to the framework, short circuit the costly process of learning-by-doing, and leapfrog directly to more modern methods.</p>
<p><strong>Patience&nbsp;</strong>- All these efforts take time. There is a premium on having the patience to ensure that multiple difficult, interrelated and therefore complex decisions are taken correctly.</p>
<p>I have spoken in the past of the need to &lsquo;<strong>get the basics right</strong>&rsquo; in reforming the MPC&rsquo;s monetary policy strategy. Our external audiences will inevitably focus on the visible aspects of the strategy that are central to policy communication. But these may be among the last to change in response to the recommendations of Prof. Bernanke&rsquo;s review: the form of policy presentation should follow the substance of policy formulation, not lead it.</p>
<p>A good decision is easier to communicate and rationalise than a poor decision. Expending effort on cosmetic issues at the expense of getting the fundamental analyses and decision processes right is to have &lsquo;the tail wagging the dog&rsquo;.</p>
<p>All this implies a natural sequencing of reform efforts: start by getting the enabling and foundational aspects of data collection and management right; then develop the models and frameworks to analyse the data; move on to designing the processes required to ensure policy makers are presented with the analysis in a manner and according to a schedule that maximises the likelihood they will take the best decision; assess how those policy decisions and their rationale should be presented to external stakeholders, including financial market participants, the media and the general public; and finally design a mechanism to collect feedback, so the impact of those decisions and their communication can be assessed.</p>
<p>But in practice all these efforts will proceed &ndash; and indeed are already proceeding &ndash; in parallel. Making them consistent is a significant organisational challenge. And, of course, we are not starting from scratch.</p>
<p>To illustrate, today the Bank of England is publishing its annual&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/about/get-involved/citizens-panels/your-voice-2024-insights-from-the-boe-outreach-programmes?sc_mode=normal" target="_blank">Outreach Report<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external">&nbsp;</span></a>, which describes the role and impact of the Bank&rsquo;s various outreach programmes in facilitating conversations with our various communities: the Citizens Panel, the Youth Forum and the Community Panels.</p>
<p>Over the past couple of years, I have been closely involved in this important work, which entails both collecting information and perspectives from our stakeholders &ndash; notably about the effects of persistently higher energy prices on UK households&rsquo; cost-of-living &ndash; as well as offering opportunities to present the sometimes difficult rationale for monetary policy decisions to hard-to-reach audiences. These efforts embody both data collection and policy communication &ndash; and, as such, they do not easily fit within the sequencing that would be followed if designing the new monetary policy strategy involved starting with a blank piece of paper, completely from scratch.</p>
<h3>Conjuncture</h3>
<p>For all the emphasis I have placed on the renewal of the MPC monetary policy strategy, the MPC must also conduct monetary policy today. This brings me to the current monetary policy conjuncture.</p>
<p>As I am sure you all well know, the MPC voted to leave Bank Rate unchanged at 5&frac14;% at its last meeting in June.</p>
<p>Of course, it is welcome news that the MPC&rsquo;s target variable &ndash; headline UK CPI inflation &ndash; has returned to the 2% target in May. But the MPC&rsquo;s remit makes clear that the inflation target holds at all times. It is not enough to meet the target in a transitory or fleeting way. Rather the MPC must achieve the inflation target on a lasting and sustainable basis.</p>
<p>Given the famous long and variable lags in monetary policy transmission, this requires that the MPC adopt a medium-term orientation and forward-looking approach in its formulation of monetary policy. That naturally points in the direction of placing an inflation forecast close to the centre of its policy discussion, as has indeed been the case for many years.</p>
<p>But when forecasting inflation becomes difficult &ndash; as has proved to be the case at the Bank of England and elsewhere over the past decade &ndash; an approach that places the inflation forecast at the centre of its policy framework comes under stress. That has been recognised in one of the key recommendations made by Prof. Bernanke in his view &ndash; to downplay the role of the MPC&rsquo;s baseline inflation forecast in the discussion and presentation of its policy decisions.</p>
<p>Of course, if one analytical tool is to be downplayed, there must be other tools upon which to place greater reliance. Prof. Bernanke has emphasised the role to be played by scenarios and policy simulations.</p>
<p>As an intermediate and pragmatic step to address the difficulties with forecasting in the face of the profound structural shocks to the UK economy, in recent years the MPC has emphasised that it is focused on the persistent component of overall inflation, since it is this component which &ndash; by nature &ndash; will still be embodied in price developments at the horizon where monetary policy decisions taken today have their greatest impact on inflation. In so doing, the MPC maintains its necessarily medium-term and forward-looking orientation.</p>
<p>More specifically, the MPC has emphasised three key indicators of inflation persistence: labour market tightness; pay growth; and services price inflation. On the basis of recent outturns, at the margin recent developments in these indicators have hinted towards some upside risk to my assessment of inflation persistence.</p>
<p>But these are noisy data series. More generally, the MPC has long recognised that it is difficult to distinguish the signal about underlying persistent inflation dynamics from the inevitable noise in any one release when assessing the news in the month-to-month data flow.</p>
<p>Viewed through this lens, it is hard to dispute the case that inflation persistence in the UK continues to prove &ndash; well &ndash; persistent. That is perhaps to be expected.</p>
<p>The difficulty in extracting signals about changes in the low frequency persistent component of inflation from noisy higher frequency indicators has not disappeared. Nor is it likely to in the coming months.</p>
<p>More data will come before we take our next policy decision at the MPC meeting on 1 August. But we have to be realistic about how much any one or two releases can add to our assessment.</p>
<p>While the MPC must remain open to the possibility that compelling new evidence could emerge which would lead the Committee (or individual members of it) to a revised opinion, it should also remain cautious in seeing any single data as either a necessary or sufficient trigger for that re-assessment.</p>
<p>In parallel with these various kinks in the data flow, time is also passing. And with monetary policy in restrictive territory, the extent to which the MPC is bearing down on underlying inflation also has a time dimension. The total quantum of monetary policy restriction is partly determined by the length of time that Bank Rate is held at a restrictive level. So the MPC&rsquo;s interpretation of the data needs to be placed against an assessment of how restrictive the overall stance of monetary policy is and has been, as well as a view on how that restriction is being transmitted to price developments.</p>
<p>It is easy to get frustrated with this. But it is important that the MPC maintains the right strategic orientation &ndash; and remains true to the framework it has articulated to deal with current challenges. Unless we have reason to shift to a new framework for policy discussions, there is a premium on acting consistently within our established machinery. It takes a framework to beat a framework.</p>
<p>The challenges associated with forecasting notwithstanding, the MPC continues to make substantial progress.</p>
<p>The current restrictive monetary policy stance continues to bear down on the persistent component of UK inflation. The MPC needs to ensure that the degree of cumulative restriction in the monetary policy stance is sufficient to ensure that the persistent dynamic in recent inflation indicators is squeezed out of the system in a way that is consistent with a timely and sustained return of CPI inflation to the 2% target.</p>
<p>At annual rates still not far from 6%, annual services price inflation and wage growth continue to point to an uncomfortable strength in those underlying inflation dynamics.</p>
<p>But the latest data also remains consistent with the view that these inflationary pressures have now been contained, and may be starting to revert towards levels that are more consistent with the achievement of the inflation target.</p>
<p>The challenge for the MPC is to get the balance right: enough monetary policy restriction to achieve the inflation target, but neither too much nor too little for fear of destabilising the economy.&nbsp;<strong>&lsquo;Twas ever thus</strong>.</p>
<p>Until the transformation agenda in response to the Bernanke review bears fruit, what complicates matters is how the outlook for inflation persistence stemming from analysis of the evolution of our three &lsquo;key indicators&rsquo; can be reconciled with the MPC&rsquo;s macroeconomic forecast &ndash; and, in particular, the inflation outlook at the policy-relevant two- to three-year horizon. The MPC&rsquo;s judgements around inflation persistence are crucial to determining the shape and profile of the inflation forecast at that horizon.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding Prof. Bernanke&rsquo;s recommendation to downplay the baseline inflation forecast, in the meantime being clear about the character of these judgements about inflation persistence and how their evolution informs the MPC&rsquo;s inflation forecast remains important.</p>
<p>Behind the MPC&rsquo;s inflation persistence judgement lies a structural view of price and wage setting behaviour in the UK economy. We don&rsquo;t simply need to observe developments in the key indicators, but rather we need to explain &ndash; both to ourselves and to our various external audiences &ndash; why there is greater persistence in current inflation dynamics than our standard model framework would imply, even after we have taken account of the extent of slack in the economy.</p>
<p>Based on that view, I will propose a few potential ways to interpret the inflation persistence judgements embedded in the forecast.</p>
<p>On one view, these judgements could reflect decaying second round effects in price and wage inflation following the big external shocks associated with the pandemic and Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine. Those effects may take longer to decay than any second-round effects embodied in conventional models and frameworks, but they are not fundamentally different &ndash; it is simply a question of the half-life of those second-round effects just being somewhat longer.</p>
<p>In this case, the challenge for the MPC is to decide whether to let this greater persistence play out or to act to bring inflation down more quickly while accepting the cost in terms of activity and employment that this implies. In other words, the MPC faces a traditional &lsquo;trade-off&rsquo; situation.</p>
<p>On another view, the inflation persistence judgments could represent a more permanent change to price, wage and margin setting behaviour, perhaps associated with changes in the pay structure, different competitive dynamics in the markets for labour, product and services, or with high degrees of real income resistance.</p>
<p>For any given level of slack in the economy, the momentum of nominal dynamics in price / wage / cost / margin setting behaviour may simply be stronger.</p>
<p>In that scenario, ultimately the MPC will be left with no choice but to maintain a restrictive monetary policy to weigh against such incipient stronger inflationary dynamics for the 2% inflation target is to be achieved on a lasting basis. That is the Committee&rsquo;s mandate.</p>
<p>Viewed through his lens, the persistence judgements represent a deterioration in the supply side of the UK economy: they capture an under-estimation of the NAIRU (or equivalently an over-estimation of potential output).</p>
<p>It is apparent from this discussion that the character of inflation persistence has implications for the conduct of monetary policy.</p>
<p>When drawing implications from the evolution of the &lsquo;key indicators of inflation persistence&rsquo; for the MPC&rsquo;s monetary policy assessment, it is important to address what those indicators tell us about the nature of inflation persistence. This goes beyond a quantitative mapping from those indicators into an inflation forecast. A more structural interpretation of inflation persistence is required. And further work is needed to provide this.</p>
<p>In particular, separating households&rsquo; inflation perceptions from households&rsquo; and firms&rsquo; short-term inflation expectations &ndash; and then seeking to separate both from inflation itself &ndash; remains a difficult empirical challenge. Distinguishing &lsquo;catch-up dynamics&rsquo;, which might be expected to dissipate over time (even if relatively slowly), from &lsquo;de-anchoring dynamics&rsquo; that might have a more long-lasting character and represent a deterioration on the supply side, remains key.</p>
<p>This all said, in the absence of any big new shocks, the &ldquo;when-rather-than-if&rdquo; characterisation of prospective Bank Rate cuts still seems appropriate.</p>
<p>The views expressed in these remarks are not necessarily those of the Bank of England or the Monetary Policy Committee.</p>
<p>I would particularly like to thank Saba Alam and Iris Hall for their help in the preparation of these remarks.</p>
<p>The text has also benefitted from helpful comments from Andrew Bailey, Jamie Bell, Sarah Breeden, Fabrizio Cadamagnani, Alan Castle, Clare Lombardelli, Jonathan Haskel, Rich Harrison, Adrian Paul, Kate Reinold, Fergal Shortall and Danny Walker for which I am most grateful.</p>
<p>Opinions (and all remaining errors and omissions) are my own.</p>

<h2>Speech</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The reason I wanted to speak today is because I believe Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) are absolutely vital.&nbsp;<strong>We need to work out how to bring out the best in each other, so that we can keep moving society forward</strong>.</p>
<p>I have been the Chief Financial Officer of the Bank of England for the last 5 years. It has been an honour to serve the UK during Covid, Brexit, the cost of living crisis, and against a challenging geopolitical backdrop. During this time, I have had my hands full with the Bank of England&rsquo;s balance sheet, which grew to over &pound;1 trillion during the pandemic.</p>
<h3>Personal journey</h3>
<p><strong>I have spent the last twenty years in financial services&hellip;but that was never the plan!</strong></p>
<p>I was born in London, and my family lived in Highgate at the time. We moved progressively South to Wimbledon and then to Purley, where I grew up.</p>
<p>My parents worked hard and inspired me to work hard. My Dad was awarded a scholarship by the Government of Ghana to study in the UK after coming 3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;in West Africa for his A-Levels. He came to study engineering at the Camborne School of Mines. My Mum, totally separately, came from Ghana to the UK when she was 18, to study midwifery at Liverpool University. She went on to work for the NHS for 40 years, and I saw her juggle long shifts, while raising a family.</p>
<p>From the age of 7, I had my heart set on being a doctor, so that I could help people. I went to Old Palace, a fantastic all girls school, in Croydon, where I had the most incredible headmistress, Miss Hilton. She believed in me, and that went a long way.</p>
<p>I read Chemistry at Oxford University, because I wanted to help create a drug to help people with cancer. My Masters focused on creating molecules with anti-tumorous properties. At Oxford, I was inspired by the late, great Professor Sir Jack Baldwin &ndash; he was one of the most eminent British Chemists of our time. He believed in me, and he chose me to be part of his research group. I then got a junior research fellowship at Princeton University.</p>
<p>After some time working in the labs, behind a fumehood, I experienced some of the highs of research, as I created lots of new compounds, and my work was published in an international journal. But, I started to realise that I wanted to work in a more fast-paced and more socially interactive environment. I wanted to use my creative and experimentation skills to solve problems. And, in the background, I had a part-time job working in fashion at Burberry in London to pay my student debt. We had a lot of well known customers coming through our doors, and the fashion world gave me an alternative to wearing a white lab coat and goggles to work every day!</p>
<p>Fast forward, I trained as a Chartered Accountant at Ernst &amp; Young in London. I became an Investment Banker at UBS, and during the global financial crisis, I travelled around the world doing M&amp;A deals. Then I did different CFO roles at Barclays.</p>
<p>When I was on maternity leave, I was approached about becoming the CFO of the Bank of England. And as they say, the rest is history.</p>
<p>When I joined the Bank, I was the youngest Executive Director. I was 36, which makes me a millennial (just about!), and I was also the first black executive in the Bank&rsquo;s 329 year history.</p>
<p>I have learned to balance work and family, as I have 4 young children ranging from a baby to an 8-year old. So I have been busy juggling work and home&hellip;</p>
<p>As I reflect back over the years, there are some key things that have helped:</p>
<p>Firstly, I have been&nbsp;<strong>flexible</strong>&nbsp;about what I do, and changing direction. This has been a consistent theme. New things come up. New people come up<strong>. I like experiencing different things and gravitate towards people I enjoy spending time with, because work needs to be fun!</strong></p>
<p>Secondly, having my own sense of&nbsp;<strong>inner fulfilment</strong>&nbsp;is important. There&rsquo;s no point in waiting for people to thank you and give you credit for the work you are doing - otherwise, you could be waiting a long time! People are busy, people have other things on their mind, so there&rsquo;s no point dwelling on things you can&rsquo;t change. I get satisfaction from doing purposeful work.</p>
<p>Thirdly, there will be barriers. Of course there will be. That&rsquo;s always been my experience. But there will always be key people, who believe in you, and who will help you figure it out during the toughest times<strong>. Family, friends, mentors, and sponsors. People who you can lean on to give you support and encouragement</strong>. And that&rsquo;s what I have found has made the difference.</p>
<h3>How am I helping to drive Diversity and Inclusion across modern business?</h3>
<p>At the Bank, I&rsquo;m the co-Executive sponsor of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.</p>
<p>I enjoy the social purpose aspect of my role. I do a lot of outreach. I love meeting people from different communities, businesses and charities; people across the public and private sector. I have the opportunity to contribute to different industry discussions at a national level, and to speak at international fora like the G20, and the International Monetary Fund. I try to engage, listen, and share experiences to drive positive change.</p>
<p>At the Bank, we have<strong>&nbsp;focussed on creating an inclusive culture, where everyone can thrive. Our visible and invisible diversity is what will help us achieve better outcomes for our society</strong>.</p>
<p>During the pandemic, we made DEI a strategic priority for the Bank, and I was delighted when the Governor, Andrew Bailey, asked me to be the co-Executive sponsor.</p>
<p>In 2020, after Black Lives Matter, the Bank of England commissioned a Court Review of Ethnic diversity. We found that outcomes were very different for white and ethnic minority colleagues, and also that we needed to do more to achieve gender equality. I have helped the Bank respond to this, and I will make sure we continue to prioritise this, against a trend of global efforts reducing in this space.</p>
<h4>Targets</h4>
<p>We have set formal targets for the recruitment and retention of diverse staff at various levels at the Bank, particularly for women and ethnic minorities.&nbsp;<strong>We are tracking progress because what gets measured gets done.</strong>&nbsp;At the highest level in the organisation, Court, our board has a good mix of gender and ethnic diversity. And we are working towards meeting our targets at&nbsp;<strong>all</strong>&nbsp;levels.</p>
<h4>Diversity alone won&rsquo;t get us where we want to be:</h4>
<p>1.&nbsp;<strong>Inclusion matters.</strong></p>
<p>2.&nbsp;<strong>Equal pay and career progression matters.</strong></p>
<p>3.<strong>&nbsp;Allyship matters</strong>.</p>
<p>And, finally, to close&hellip;.&nbsp;<strong>What I would like to see more than anything, is for diverse people to be fully accepted and valued when they are ordinary, not just when they are exceptional&hellip;.&nbsp;</strong>That&rsquo;s when we&rsquo;ll know we are really moving society forward.</p>
<p>Thank you Suki Sandhu, and the INvolve team for everything you are doing. And thank you all for listening.</p>
<p>I would like to thank my Bank colleagues and chairs of our employee networks, for the vital work they are doing to drive inclusion in the workplace. Also Mohini Gurung and Catherine Milton for proofreading this speech.</p>

<div> Financial Stability Oversight Council, Digital Assets, Regulation, Market, Enforcement
Summary: The CFTC Chairman emphasized the need for legislation to regulate the digital asset market, enacting principles-based oversight, funding, customer protections, AML/KYC requirements, and education/outreach. <br /><br /> <div>
<div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field--item">
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>Introduction</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Chairwoman Stabenow, Ranking Member Boozman, and members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today as Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC or Agency) to discuss the state of the digital asset commodity market.&nbsp; Before I begin, I would like to recognize and thank my fellow CFTC Commissioners and CFTC staff for their dedication and commitment to serving the American public.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>State of the Digital Asset Commodity Market</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>During my almost seven-years at the CFTC as both a Commissioner and as Chairman, I have observed the digital asset market evolve significantly, expanding and collapsing, at times with periods of high volatility. &nbsp;It has also facilitated countless scandals and fraudulent activity, some very small and typical in criminal form, others massive in scale and profile.&nbsp; I have watched the market as it has piqued the interest of both novice and sophisticated investors, and have seen some of our nation&rsquo;s most established financial institutions build businesses driven by digital assets.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>What has concerned me most throughout the expansion of this digital asset class is that while everyday Americans fall victim to one digital asset scam after another, there remains no completed legislative response. &nbsp;I have repeatedly been asked by members of Congress what I am doing to protect their constituents.&nbsp; I believe the single most important thing I have done, and continue to do, is advocate to this body to fill the regulatory gap.&nbsp; I am not alone in my concerns.&nbsp; In 2022, a Financial Stability Oversight Council report highlighted that there is a gap in regulation of the spot market for digital assets that are not securities.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam48?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp; This gap for non-security tokens continues to constitute a majority of the digital asset market measured by market capitalization.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam48?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the risks that this unregulated market poses to U.S. investors, I have consistently and publicly called for new legislative authority for the CFTC,</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam48?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;including before this Committee.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam48?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Congress must act quickly in order for regulators, like the CFTC, to provide basic customer protections that are core to U.S. financial markets.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Further, based on my observations as Chairman, I do not believe inaction will quash public interest for digital assets; it will only result in greater risk to our financial markets and investors. &nbsp;As the digital asset market continues to integrate into traditional financial institutions, concerns regarding broader market resiliency and perhaps even financial stability will ripen.&nbsp; In short, our current trajectory is not sustainable.&nbsp; Federal legislation is urgently needed to create a pathway for a regulatory framework that will protect American investors and possibly the financial system from future risk.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>Enforcement</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>It has been almost nine years since the CFTC brought its first enforcement action in connection with an illegal Bitcoin operation.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam48?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp; Since that time, the agency has been aggressive in using our powerful, but limited anti-fraud and anti-manipulation authorities.&nbsp; In total, the CFTC has brought over 135 digital commodity cases resulting in billions in penalties and restitution.&nbsp; All along, CFTC enforcement staff has worked closely with our civil and criminal law enforcement partners at the federal and state levels.&nbsp; The escalating rate of digital asset enforcement cases since 2020 mirrors the accelerated and sustained adoption of digital assets by U.S. investors.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Just last week, a District Court in the Northern District of Illinois entered summary judgment in favor of the CFTC in a case involving fraud by an unregistered entity that promised steady returns in digital asset commodities such as Bitcoin and Ether.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam48?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp; In its decision, the court re-affirmed that both Bitcoin and Ether are commodities under the Commodity Exchange Act.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>In fiscal year 2023, actions involving digital asset-related allegations comprised almost half of our enforcement docket.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam48?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp; Of the 47 enforcement actions involving digital assets commodities, 35 alleged misconduct in the spot market.&nbsp; Ultimately, the CFTC, whose primary responsibility is overseeing the multi-trillion-dollar U.S. derivatives markets, is committing nearly half its enforcement resources to a market it does not have the authority or appropriated resources to regulate.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Nearly a decade of digital asset experience has given CFTC staff a deep understanding of the market and underlying technology that supports it.&nbsp; Market regulators like the CFTC were built precisely for situations we find ourselves in today.&nbsp; The flawed notion that regulating an asset class legitimizes it misses the point of our responsibilities.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>International Progress</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Concurrent with my duties as CFTC Chairman, I have the privilege of serving as the Vice-Chairman of the International Organization of Securities Commissions, more commonly known as IOSCO.&nbsp; IOSCO&rsquo;s member agencies regulate more than 95% of the world&rsquo;s securities markets in over 130 jurisdictions.</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam48?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp; In this role, I have observed both major and developing economies establish regulatory frameworks for digital assets.&nbsp; From Asia, the Middle East, the European Union, the United Kingdom, and South America, what started as pilot programs and draft legislation just a few years ago, has developed into established global regulatory systems.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The delta between the U.S. and our international counterparts preserves weaknesses that are exploited by bad actors, and prohibits us from much needed coordination efforts.&nbsp; Further, and primarily for the members of this Committee to consider, any potential economic benefits and innovation arising from this technology ultimately will be stymied without regulatory certainty.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>Legislative Priorities to Achieve Success</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>As this Committee continues to consider legislation to fill the regulatory gap, I would like to focus your attention on the components of a framework that would ensure the CFTC has the tools to provide customer and market protections.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>First, the principles-based oversight model has served the CFTC and its regulated markets well, striking an appropriate balance between clear outcomes-based requirements, and measured flexibility to meet those outcomes.&nbsp; Core principles such as compliance with fair and orderly trading, system safeguards, financial resource requirements, and products not being readily susceptible to fraud or manipulation, to name just a few, serve as a solid foundation to build transparent and resilient markets, regardless of asset class.&nbsp; In light of the novel nature of digital assets, the CFTC would then, consistent with a legislative mandate, tailor rules to meet the risk and characteristic profile.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Second, appropriate funding is necessary to meet the mandate of any legislatively enacted regulatory program.&nbsp; A permanent fee-for-service model, exclusively assessed on digital asset registrants, and that is commensurate with the responsibilities outlined in a bill, is critical.&nbsp; As with other fee-for-service models, congressional appropriators and the agency should work in tandem to set budget levels and subsequently set fees to meet those budget levels.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Third, given the retail-oriented nature of the digital asset market, legislative authority for the CFTC to require registrants to provide a comprehensive disclosure regime regarding a commodity token&rsquo;s structure, purpose, market-based characteristics, and general risks is also critical to ensure investors have access to material information.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Fourth, it is essential that legislation provide comprehensive authority for anti-money laundering, know-your-customer, and a customer identification program, built off of existing requirements for market participants.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Fifth, given the important role the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) plays in the oversight of security-based digital tokens, the Committee should consider a disciplined, balanced framework for the determination of tokens as commodities or securities under existing law.&nbsp; The SEC and CFTC have a longstanding partnership that facilitates strong, robust regulation of securities and derivatives markets.&nbsp; I am confident that the two agencies will continue working closely, ensuring a reliable, fair, and efficient system for listing and trading of digital assets on regulated exchanges.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Finally, given the broad adoption of digital assets by a significant portion of the American population,</span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam48?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;a comprehensive education and outreach program, building off of the CFTC&rsquo;s Office of Customer Education and Outreach, will enable the investing public to understand both the risks and opportunities of this technology.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><i><span><span>Conclusion</span></span></i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>I am encouraged by this Committee&rsquo;s continued efforts, dating back to 2022, to fill the gap in regulation, prioritizing customer protections and market stability.&nbsp; In addition to this Committee&rsquo;s work, there have been other important steps taken in Congress to address the need for comprehensive regulation of the digital asset commodity market.&nbsp; The principles and regulatory foundations that have made our capital markets and derivatives markets the deepest, most liquid, and most resilient in the world provide an effective model for the digital asset commodity market.&nbsp; We need to act thoughtfully, but with urgency, to fill this harmful regulatory gap in order to give American investors the protection they deserve.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>I thank the Committee for your focus in this area, and&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>look forward to answering your questions.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<div> Keywords: valuation, climate risk, equity, uncertainties, transition costs <br />
Summary: 
- New research extends valuation techniques to estimate the effect of climate and economic uncertainties on global equity values.
- Study evaluates impact of greenhouse gas emissions trajectories on equity values under various scenarios.
- Key factors influencing equity valuation include emissions abatement, climate tipping points, and central bank actions.
- Study indicates the need for prompt abatement action to keep losses below 10%, with over 40% of global equity value at risk without acceleration.
- Methodological innovations include a fully probabilistic approach, state-dependent discounting, and joint analysis of transition costs and physical risks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

</ul>
<p><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b></p>
<p>In a new study, <a href="https://climateimpact.edhec.edu/sites/ercii/files/pdf/ercii_publication_how_does_climate_risk_affect_equity_valuations.pdf"><i>How Does Climate Risk Affect Global Equity Valuations? A Novel Approach</i></a>, EDHEC-Risk Climate Impact Institute addresses key limitations of current climate-aware valuation approaches to produce novel insights. The paper, conducted within the research chair established by EDHEC Business School and Scientific Beta, reveals that the impact of climate risk on global equity valuation can be significant, especially in scenarios with limited climate action.</p>
<p>Key Findings:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>The uncertainty of climate and economic outcomes and the state dependence of discounting</b> are two key and much neglected contributors to changes in equity valuation. </li>
<li>The magnitude of losses depends on the <b>aggressiveness of emission abatement policy</b>; the <b>presence or otherwise of tipping points</b>; on the extent of Central Banks&rsquo; willingness and ability to <b>lower rates in states of economic distress</b>.</li>
<li>Severe impact on equity valuation can be obtained with very plausible combinations of policies and physical outcomes; and there is considerably more downside than upside risk &ndash; <b>over 40% of global equity value is at risk unless decarbonisation efforts accelerate and losses could exceed 50% with near climate tipping points</b>.</li>
<li><b>Prompt and robust abatement action is needed</b> to keep losses below 10%. </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Methodological Innovations:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Fully Probabilistic Approach</b>: incorporating climate and economic uncertainties into a probabilistic framework for a more realistic and comprehensive evaluation of potential outcomes.</li>
<li><b>State-Dependent Discounting:</b> recognising that physical damages from climate change impair cashflows in a state-dependent manner and allowing discount factors to be determined by economic conditions and damages, which highlights the neglected role of state-dependent discounting.</li>
<li><b>Joint Analysis of Transition Costs and Physical Risks:</b> upgrading a popular integrated climate economics assessment model to estimate the effect of transition costs (associated with regulatory measures to curb greenhouse gas emissions) and physical damages on the value of global equity stock, providing a unified view of climate-related financial risks.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Ducoulombier, Director of EDHEC-Risk Climate Impact Institute</b> states:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The research team led by Professor Rebonato has upgraded mainstream integrated assessment models to incorporate the progress of climate science and make them fit for financial applications. By modelling the considerable uncertainty in the physical and economical dimensions of climate change and linking it to top-down equity valuation, this study debunks the notion that the value of financial assets may be immune to climate changes and provides additional support for bold climate action.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Professor Ricardo Rebonato, Scientific Director of EDHEC-Risk Climate Impact Institute</b>, adds:</p>
<p>&ldquo;These results&ndash;obtained with mild assumptions&ndash;underline the importance of uncertainty and state-dependent discounting for climate-aware equity valuation.&nbsp; Our approach shows that it is possible and fruitful to integrate climate risks into financial analysis and we will be working further to develop theoretically solid and practically implementable tools for climate-aware investment management.&rdquo;</p>

Summary: The FTSE Mondo Visione Exchanges Index tracks market cap, performance, and capital returns of 33 exchanges and trading floors. <div>
<p>Exchanges heavily reliant on cash equities have faced challenging times due to a shortage of listings and low valuations, prompting some firms to reassess their current listings. In contrast, exchanges with a diversified business model have weathered these conditions more successfully.</p>
<p>The FTSE Mondo Visione Exchanges Index concluded June at 71,426.00 points, reflecting a 0.4% decline from its May 2024 value of 71,725.78.</p>
<p>The top 5 exchanges by market capitalisation at the end of June were:</p>

<div> campaign, awareness, investor education, protection, collaboration
<br />
Summary: 
World Investor Week raises awareness for investor education and protection, covering themes like technology, fraud prevention, and sustainable finance. Collaboration among IOSCO members is emphasized. <br /><br /> <div>
<p>The World Investor Week (WIW) is a week-long, global campaign to raise awareness of the importance of investor education and protection, and to highlight the various initiatives of securities regulators in these two critical areas.</p>
<p>WIW has two primary objectives, namely (i) to disseminate key messages that support investor education, investor protection and financial literacy; and (ii) to foster learning opportunities for investors. The campaign also aims to strengthen collaboration among IOSCO members on investor education and protection initiatives.</p>
<p>Launching on 7 October 2024 and spanning the course of the week, organizations representing over 100 jurisdictions will come together to drive awareness around trending issues which impact investors around the world.</p>
<p>Principal themes include</p>
<ul>
<li>Technology &amp; Digital Finance</li>
<li>Crypto Assets</li>
<li>Sustainable Finance</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These will be complemented with discussions and workshops on</p>
<ul>
<li>Fraud and Scam Prevention</li>
<li>Investor Resilience</li>
<li>Basics of Investing</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Jean-Paul Servais, Chair of IOSCO&rsquo;s Board, and Chairman, Financial Services and Markets Authority, Belgium</strong>, said: "Last year&rsquo;s World Investor Week saw the involvement of 118 jurisdictions and reached almost 730 million individuals. We have to keep the ball rolling as with technological advancements and increased use of AI, new challenges arise. We also see how crypto, fractional trading, gamification and copy-trading are trending.</p>
<p>I am confident that WIW2024 will build on the success of previous years to drive greater investor awareness of these issues and look forward to contribute to its success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s themes were agreed by IOSCO&rsquo;s Committee 8 which conducts its work on retail investor education and financial literacy and includes 38 members from both established and emerging markets.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Pasquale Munaf&ograve;, Senior Officer, Commissione Nazionale per le Societ&agrave; e la Borsa, Italy, and Chair of IOSCO&rsquo;s Committee 8</strong>, said: &ldquo;The principal themes we have identified this year result from extensive engagement with all Committee 8 members and unanimously reflect the most urgent issues facing investors today. We also collaborate very closely with other relevant committees to ensure a comprehensive and unified approach to investor protection and education.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By placing the spotlight on these critical areas, we aim to empower and protect investors worldwide, providing them with the knowledge and tools needed to navigate an increasingly complex financial landscape.&rdquo;</p>

<div> Announcement, DTCC, VaR calculator, FICC, U.S. Treasury Clearing <br />
Summary:<br />
DTCC launches VaR calculator for firms to evaluate margin and Clearing Fund obligations for FICC membership amidst expected rise in U.S. Treasury Clearing activity. <div>
<p>The Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the premier post-trade market infrastructure for the global financial services industry, today announced the launch of a new public-facing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dtcc.com/managing-risk/stress-testing-and-liquidity-risk-management/ccfl-public-calculator" target="_blank">Value at Risk (VaR) calculator</a>. The calculator provides market participants with the ability to evaluate potential margin and Clearing Fund obligations associated with becoming a Member of DTCC&rsquo;s Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC) Government Securities Division (GSD).</p>
<p>With U.S. Treasury Clearing activity processed through FICC expected to rise by US$4 trillion daily after the SEC&rsquo;s expanded clearing mandate is implemented in 2025 and 2026, DTCC&rsquo;s VaR calculator will be a crucial tool for firms to accurately determine VaR and potential margin obligations for any simulated portfolio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;VaR is a widely used risk management concept in the financial services industry and is the primary component of GSD&rsquo;s Clearing Fund requirements,&rdquo; said Tim Hulse, Managing Director, Financial Risk &amp; Governance, at DTCC. &ldquo;The calculator considers factors such as historical data, volatility and confidence levels to estimate VaR, increasing market transparency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The new calculator provides market participants with the opportunity to calculate potential Margin obligations on a simulated portfolio, for given positions and market value, using FICC&rsquo;s VaR methodology.</p>
<p>Hulse added, &ldquo;FICC understands the urgency and importance of evaluating firms&rsquo; risk exposure associated with the expansion of U.S. Treasury Clearing. The VaR calculator provides market participants with increased transparency into these obligations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As part of its commitment to the industry, DTCC continues to assess calculators, tools, and enhanced access methods to support the expansion of U.S. Treasury clearing activity.</p>

<p class="paragraph"><span class="normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-US">Bridgewise,  the financial research intelligence platform for global securities, announced today the launch of a new fund analysis solution that will provide market-leading levels of detail into funds and their underlying assets. Powered by AI, Bridgewise will enable for  the first time deep analysis of fund holdings, past performance, and fee structure, providing coverage for the vast majority of funds on the market.

<p class="paragraph"><span class="normaltextrun"><span lang="EN-US">This is precisely the problem AI is well placed to solve.

There is no way for a human to provide a detailed fundamental analysis on each and every asset in popular funds, especially when some funds are composed of thousands of individual stocks. The time  it would take to complete such an analysis would quickly stretch to a full year or more. Our AI technologies not only allow for a previously unobtainable level of depth of fund analysis, but also nearly universal coverage of funds, each one with the same level  of detailed analysis along with buy/sell recommendations for the individual stocks in the fund.&rdquo;</span></span><span class="eop"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li> <strong><em><span>H1 2024 research budgets increased both as a proportion of AUM as well as in absolute terms</span></em></strong> </li>
<li> <strong><em><span>As a proportion of assets managed, US budgets rose 15%, with European budgets also rising but by a more modest 4%</span></em></strong> </li>
<li> <strong><em><span>The survey indicates that the cycle of endless price depreciation and budget cuts across the board in investment research has come to an end&nbsp;</span></em></strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Substantive Research, the research and data spend analytics provider for the buy side, today publishes the findings of its latest survey into investment research pricing, budgeting and consumption, looking at how research spending has evolved during the first half of 2024.</span></p>
<p><span>The FCA&rsquo;s&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.fca.org.uk%2Fpublication%2Fconsultation%2Fcp24-7.pdf/1/010201909b6ef946-96cc3681-a4d9-4f26-88c9-76d68edee636-000000/fjPm2srx-Lt4cux1DN-Ke3w7Cyo=382" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>April 2024 Consultation Paper</span></a><span>&nbsp;on &ldquo;Payment Optionality for Investment Research&rdquo; has ignited a debate on whether asset managers in Europe can, or should return their research costs back to their end investors after six years of paying these costs from their own P&amp;Ls post-MiFID II. The proposed optionality from the FCA comes with many caveats and obligations, and the market views its adoption as being highly dependent on whether there will be push-back from end investors, as asset managers explore this option.</span></p>
<p><span>Substantive Research undertook its latest survey of the buy side to understand the impact that proposed payment optionality is having on the consumption of investment research, and how differences in US and European regulations affect pricing and payments.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Survey findings</span></strong></p>
<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fsubstantiveresearch.com%2Finsights-and-press%2Finvestment-research-budgets-slide-again-despite-imminent-rebundling-freedoms%2F/1/010201909b6ef946-96cc3681-a4d9-4f26-88c9-76d68edee636-000000/ksWNqVufGeoSH0HoU07RejuDu6U=382" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>Previous analysis</span></a><span>&nbsp;in 2023 had shown that budgets in the US had increased as a proportion of AUM, and dipped only very slightly in the UK/EU by the same measure. However, in monetary terms, budgets still fell by 6.5% globally as AUM was down across the universe surveyed.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>In the first half of 2024, Substantive Research&rsquo;s analysis has shown that budgets are increasing both as a proportion of AUM as well as in absolute terms:</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li> <span>As a proportion of assets managed, US budgets rose 15%, with European budgets also rising by a more modest 4%. This shows why politicians have been pressuring the UK and EU regulators to help European asset managers return these costs back to their end investor clients. As the cycle moves on, US research budgets bounce back much more quickly - their investment professionals have more money to spend on external research from brokers and independent providers.&nbsp;</span> </li>
<li> <span>Overall, in monetary terms budgets increased by 2.2%. &ldquo;Although a modest rise, this fundamentally changes the dynamics of the research market. Within that figure, some providers are increasing pricing and driving greater consumption of meetings and calls with their sector analysts. We are back to a market of winners and losers, instead of almost all research providers experiencing price deflation year after year,&rdquo;&nbsp;</span><strong><span>said Mike Carrodus, CEO, of Substantive Research</span></strong><span>.</span> </li>
<li> <span>Brokers still dominate research budgets, taking 85% of spend annually, which has decreased by 1% since 2023, with tooling and analytics solutions benefitting accordingly and growing from 4% to 5% of research budget allocations. Substantive predicts that spending on analytics and research tooling will accelerate in the next budgeting cycle for 2025 &ndash; interest is high and these vendors are climbing up the provider list.</span> </li>
<li> <span>Independent Research Providers (IRPs) and Expert Networks remain unchanged at 8% and 2% respectively of annual budgets on average.&nbsp;</span> </li>
<li> <span>Concentration of research budgets to the top 10 brokers rose very slightly from 54.8% to 54.9%, a key metric to monitor in future, to see if the FCA&rsquo;s reforms do indeed spur greater competition as desired.&nbsp;</span> </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Mike Carrodus, CEO of Substantive Research, commented:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;We saw last year that research budgets were stabilising and now we have the confirmation that the trend has turned. However, when compared with six years of price depreciation, this recovery does not take us anywhere near where research spending was pre-MiFID II. What this does do, is set the scene for the FCA&rsquo;s new rules later this summer, with the key question being &lsquo;Will the new FCA freedoms accelerate European research spending up to a US level and trend ahead?&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>He added:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>&ldquo;Much will depend on the reaction from the asset managers&rsquo; end investor clients, and even if research costs do end up chargeable to asset owners once again the new procurement rigour in research valuation and payments from the buy side is going nowhere. If this market is to reflate materially, there will need to be new demand for new asset classes, and new supply required to justify additional payments in future - a change in funding will not arbitrarily drive research pricing back to pre-MiFID II levels.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Universe of organisations covered in the study</span></strong><span>:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>60 asset management firms; 60%/40% Headquartered Europe/North America; Total AUM represented $20tr+; 75%/25% Long-only/Hedge Fund.</span></p>

<title>Islamic Fintech Firm Offa Launches Fast And Innovative Buy-To-Let Finance - Modern, Paperless Service Disrupts Traditionally Cumbersome Islamic Finance Market</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Offa, the UK&rsquo;s first Sharia-compliant bridge finance fintech, has today launched an innovative new buy-to-let finance (BTL) service &ndash; with fast funding decisions delivered via a modern paperless process &ndash; aiming to disrupt and transform the traditionally old-fashioned and cumbersome world of Islamic finance.</span></p>
<p><span>Powered by the latest software, Offa&rsquo;s BTL service meets the needs of both Muslim and non-Muslim property investors with its flexible property finance solutions and end-to-end digital processes, making it fast and easy to apply and get a quick decision.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Sagheer Malik, Offa&rsquo;s Chief Commercial Officer</span>&nbsp;and MD&nbsp;<span>of Retail Finance, said: &ldquo;Offa is all about a high-quality modern service and speed is crucial in real estate. With the launch of our ultra-quick buy-to-let service, combined with our teams&rsquo; decades of industry experience, we are bringing Islamic finance into the 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;century, leaving behind the onerous paperwork and cumbersome systems that many customers have typically suffered in the past.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;Our streamlined digital application process &ndash; which is unparalleled in the Islamic finance market &ndash; means clients can potentially get a fair decision within minutes, depending on credit rating and risk criteria.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span><a name="_Hlk169771199"></a><a name="_Hlk169795384"></a><span>These Islamic BTL products are available to new and seasoned landlords who are British residents or UK expats. Instead of using interest, Offa&rsquo;s BTL product involves the Islamic finance principles of co-ownership-with-leasing. Customers acquire the property in partnership with Offa and make monthly payments to increase their share, over time owning it.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Another key feature of Offa&rsquo;s BTL product is that where a customer&rsquo;s rental income is not sufficient for the required affordability criteria for the BTL finance, Offa allows them to make up the difference with their personal monthly income (commonly known in the industry as top-slicing).</span></p>
<p><span>The service is available to anyone purchasing property in England and Wales aged 21 or over where the property&rsquo;s value is between &pound;60,000 and &pound;1 million. First-time landlords can also apply, and Offa&rsquo;s BTL solutions are also available for houses in multiple occupancy (HMOs).</span></p>
<p><span>Offa provides an ethical finance model designed in accordance with Islamic finance principles, which means not charging interest and investment into sectors deemed harmful to society &ndash; such as alcohol, tobacco, and the arms trade.</span></p>
<p><span>In April, Offa announced a &pound;100 million credit line for its bridge finance arm from a fund managed by UAE-based Gulf Islamic Investments Group (GII). The credit line is the largest of its kind outside of the Gulf, creating significant capacity for the Birmingham-headquartered business to expand and diversify its financial propositions in the UK property market.</span></p>
