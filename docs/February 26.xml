<title>FIX Recommends Regulatory Approaches To AI In Trading: Monetary Authority Of Singapore Consultation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>The FIX Trading Community, the industry association that manages the world&rsquo;s trading language, the FIX Protocol, has proposed ten key recommendations for regulating AI in trading, in response to the Monetary Authority of Singapore&rsquo;s (MAS) consultation,&nbsp;<i>Consultation Paper on Guidelines on Artificial Intelligence Risk Management</i>, which closed on January 31.</p>
<p>Executive Director Jim Kaye said the consultation was both valuable and timely, enabling FIX and its member firms to come together to address the complex issue of AI, with which all firms around the world are currently grappling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was an immensely useful exercise in teasing out both overarching themes and technical challenges,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s allowed us to propose some practical measures that will be very helpful to firms as we, as an industry, meet the risks and opportunities that AI presents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Machine learning has been the backbone of algorithmic trading for decades, but the advent of large language models, and high-profile examples of their failings, have thrown AI into the spotlight. The interconnected nature of global markets means that one AI catastrophe could potentially have far-reaching consequences, and the speed at which the AI industry is moving means both regulators and participants are highly focused on this topic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This consultation allowed us to think about AI from all angles &ndash; from Board accountability (critical) to existing frameworks that could be used to help manage AI risks,&rdquo; Kaye said. &ldquo;The MAS proposals are an excellent start &ndash; we think that with some additional depth, they will be a good framework for firms to manage risk as AI adoption moves ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>FIX&rsquo;s recommendations include ten key points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Agreeing a globally recognised definition and taxonomy for what &ldquo;AI&rdquo; means in a trading context. Without this, and particularly if firms are left to define AI for themselves, there will be inconsistency between both firms and markets, and regulatory arbitrage. Standards and publications that can be referenced include Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) and ISO 24030.</li>
<li>Making Boards accountable for AI governance effectiveness &ndash; not just AI governance existence.</li>
<li>Anchoring AI regulatory guidelines to existing constructs for operational resilience and market integrity, such as MiFID RTS 6 which requires firms to both annually self-assess and validate their algo trading systems as well as to certify non-contribution to market disorder on every significant change; and the EU&rsquo;s Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) ICT risk management frameworks.</li>
<li>Specifically considering the way large language models (LLMs) are integrated into algorithms and calculators, including potential downstream workflow and decision-making impacts.</li>
<li>Establishing cross-functional committees to ensure risk management across the organisation, and ensuring these committees also have oversight of third-party AI-related suppliers.</li>
<li>Creating internal and regulator-facing disclosure patterns analogous to food labelling: what data was used, training approach, evaluation results, mitigations, limitations, intended use, and user-data protection.</li>
<li>Supporting the creation and maintenance of AI inventories, the granularity of which will necessarily be well beyond typical algo inventories.</li>
<li>Imposing the proposed risk dimensions of impact, complexity and reliance with the addition of a further two dimension: interconnectedness/contagion potential; and change sensitivity/nonlinearity &ndash; ie the butterfly effect, where small changes can lead to material&nbsp;differences in AI behaviour.</li>
<li>Strengthening the proposed standards, processes and controls through the AI lifecycle. FIX Trading Community&rsquo;s significant work on algorithm testing and certification could be referenced here.</li>
<li>Revising the definition of &ldquo;significant/material change&rdquo; so that retraining, data refreshes, fine-tuning, prompt/policy-layer changes, and infrastructure/latency changes are each evaluated under a clear, risk-based materiality test, that may require re-approval and re-testing.</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;There is no doubt that Silicon Valley&rsquo;s &lsquo;move fast and break things&rsquo; approach is at odds with the conservative approach that must be taken to protect the integrity of our global capital markets,&rdquo; Kaye said. &ldquo;When it comes to AI, it&rsquo;s critical that the entire capital markets industry works together to ensure we protect our financial system as well as we possibly can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The FIX Trading Community is the only independent global community where capital markets firms come together to solve common issues and shape the evolution of capital markets. FIX groups in over 60 countries are working on a range of global issues including digital assets; reference data; carbon trading; AI; algo trading; FICC and ETFs, while country and regional committees work together to manage local regulation and market structure matters.

<title>ASX Announces CEO Transition</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asx-announces-ceo-transition-2026210/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>ASX Limited (ASX) announces today that Managing Director and CEO Helen Lofthouse will step down in May 2026, following an 11 year career at ASX.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Appointed CEO in 2022, the announcement of Ms Lofthouse&rsquo;s planned departure comes as ASX makes final preparations to deliver the first phase of the CHESS project which is targeting go-live in April 2026.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having overseen a new transformation agenda and technology modernisation program, and with the CHESS project on firm footing, the Board and Ms Lofthouse have determined it is the right time for new leadership to take the Group into its next phase of transformation.</p>
<p><b>ASX Chair David Clarke said:</b> &ldquo;Helen took the CEO role at an exceptionally challenging time for ASX. She took the difficult decision to stop the previous CHESS project and reset it, and she has driven a significant uplift in our technology investment and delivery, and risk focus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After careful consideration, and as we approach go-live for CHESS Release 1, the Board and Helen have agreed this marks an appropriate turning point to commence the transition to a new CEO.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will be looking for a new leader to extend the foundations built in recent years and drive the business forward while keeping customers and the market at the heart of our purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Ms Lofthouse said:</b> &ldquo;It has been a privilege to serve at ASX for more than a decade and to spend four years leading an organisation that is at centre of Australia&rsquo;s financial markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since becoming CEO we have reset the CHESS project, refreshed our strategy, expanded technology investment and delivered a series of technology and resilience upgrades. While the pace of change has been intense in recent years, I&rsquo;m very proud of our achievements in modernising technology, enhancing customer engagement, developing Group capabilities, and shifting our culture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been a rewarding but demanding journey with enormous personal growth. Having reflected on what ASX needs for its next phase, together with the Board we have agreed that this is the right time for a new person to bring fresh energy to the work ahead. We&rsquo;ve made great strides even as we&rsquo;ve faced challenges and I want to thank everyone at ASX for their dedication and support&nbsp; and our customers for their partnership.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Succession</h2>
<p>The Board has engaged Korn Ferry to support a comprehensive process to identify our next CEO. The global search will also consider internal candidates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr Clarke said: &ldquo;Our search process is underway and we will assess leaders who have strong credentials in financial markets, transformation and risk management. The Board has confidence in the capability and experience of ASX&rsquo;s executive leadership team, and internal candidates will be considered alongside external candidates as part of a robust process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;While the search process will be comprehensive, it will not slow our momentum to deliver strategic priorities and the Board maintains ongoing and active oversight. Our Executive team remain fully accountable for execution of key deliverables and there is no change to our major initiatives and programs.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">&ldquo;The Board&rsquo;s focus is on operating reliable, resilient critical market infrastructure and ensuring we play an active stewardship role to deliver a future-focused exchange.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Nasdaq Dubai Welcomes Al Masraf’s USD 500 Million Debut Bond Following Strong Investor Demand</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li>Investor demand exceeded USD 1.3 billion, representing a 2.6x oversubscription from regional and international investors.</li>
<li>Total outstanding value of debt securities listed on Nasdaq Dubai now exceeds USD 147.3 billion.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nasdaq Dubai has welcomed the listing of a USD 500 million bond issued by Arab Bank for Investment and Foreign Trade PJSC (Al Masraf), marking the Bank&rsquo;s debut in the international debt capital markets and reinforcing Dubai&rsquo;s position as a leading hub for global fixed-income issuances.</p>
<p>Issued under Al Masraf&rsquo;s USD 5 billion Medium Term Note (EMTN) Programme, the five-year bond matures on 29 January 2031 and carries a coupon of 5.113% per annum, equivalent to a credit spread of 125 basis points over U.S. Treasuries. The issuance attracted strong investor demand, with the order book peaking at over USD 1.3 billion, representing an oversubscription rate of 2.6 times.</p>
<p>The transaction drew participation from a diversified base of regional and international investors, including some of the world&rsquo;s largest fund managers, banks, private banks, pension funds, and insurance companies. The mandate for the issuance was announced on 16 January, with pricing completed on 22 January following a series of investor meetings held across Hong Kong, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the UAE.</p>
<p>Rated &lsquo;A&rsquo; by Fitch, the bond is listed on both the London Stock Exchange&rsquo;s International Securities Market and Nasdaq Dubai.</p>
<p>To mark the listing, Fuad Mohamed, CEO, Al Masraf, rang the market-opening bell at Nasdaq Dubai, alongside Hamed Ali, CEO of Nasdaq Dubai and Dubai Financial Market (DFM), and senior representatives from both organizations.</p>
<p><b>Fuad Mohamed, CEO of Al Masraf,</b> stated: &ldquo;The strong investor demand, reflects the investors&rsquo; belief in Al Masraf&rsquo;s renewed strategic direction, reinforced management, and the positive strides on financial metrics over the last 12 months. Our capital market debut in the Bank&rsquo;s Golden Jubilee year allows us to penetrate the international markets and reach out to a diverse investor base while at the same time reinvigorates the relations with our esteemed regional partners.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Hamed Ali, CEO of Nasdaq Dubai and DFM, </b>said<b>: </b>&ldquo;Al Masraf&rsquo;s debut bond listing reflects strong and sustained investor confidence in high-quality regional issuers and underscores the continued development of the UAE&rsquo;s debt capital markets. The strong response to this issuance reflects the quality of the credit and the continued appeal of Dubai as a venue for international debt listings, reinforcing the role of Dubai&rsquo;s markets in supporting regional issuers&rsquo; access to global capital.&rdquo;<b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>The total outstanding value of debt securities listed on Nasdaq Dubai exceeds USD <b>147.3</b> billion. This reflects the depth and diversity of issuers accessing Dubai&rsquo;s international debt markets across sovereign, financial institution, and corporate segments.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>SGX Group (Singapore Exchange) today reported robust trading activity for January, with record exchange-traded fund (ETF) turnover and stronger participation from both retail and institutional investors driving growth in its stock market. Derivatives volume across equities, FX and commodities rose to the highest in almost six years, reflecting continued institutional demand for trusted risk-management tools.</p>
<p>Turnover value in the stock market increased 66% year-on-year (y-o-y) in January to S$34.6 billion, with securities daily average value (SDAV) up 58% y-o-y at S$1.65 billion. Derivatives total traded volume climbed 34% y-o-y to 32.1 million contracts &ndash; the highest since March 2020 &ndash; while derivatives daily average volume (DAV) gained 27% y-o-y to about 1.6 million contracts.</p>
<p>Key highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Growing interest in stocks beyond benchmark index:&nbsp;</strong>Stock market momentum<strong>&nbsp;</strong>in January was broad based across all client segments, with demand extending beyond index names as more stocks achieved at least S$1 million in daily turnover.

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><dl class="qanda"><dt>Q.</dt><dd>
<p>Press reports indicate that the FSA initiated an on-site inspection of The Prudential Life Insurance Company, Ltd. on January 29 over suspected improper handling of funds and other misconduct. The reports also state that the inspection, previously scheduled for February 5, was moved forward. Could you confirm whether this is accurate? In addition, please share your views on the case and the FSA&rsquo;s policy response.</p>
</dd><dt class="ans">A.</dt><dd>
<p>We are aware of the reports in question. In light of multiple instances at the company involving inappropriate handling of funds by employees and former employees with respect to policyholders and others, the FSA is also examining the company&rsquo;s handling of customer information and the actual state of its sales practices. At this stage, it would be premature to comment on factual matters, including the company&rsquo;s handling of customer information, and we will therefore refrain from doing so. In any event, based on our findings, we will take strict and appropriate supervisory action.</p>

<title>EACH’s Women In Clearing Series – Getting Inspired By María José Gómez Yubero, Head Of Resolution At CNMV</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Following the successful launch of the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/12789353/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><b>Women in Clearing Network</b></a>,<b>&nbsp;</b>in March 2024 the&nbsp;<b>EACH&rsquo;s Women in Clearing Series&nbsp;</b>was inaugurated. This is an initiative with the objective of featuring a key female leader on a regular basis to inspire other professionals in the industry.</p>
<p>We begin the New Year with inspiration from&nbsp;Mar&iacute;a Jos&eacute;. Mar&iacute;a Jos&eacute; is a financial regulator at the Spanish National Securities Market Commission (CNMV), where she works on financial stability, resolution and market infrastructures, with a particular focus on central counterparties (CCPs). She has extensive experience in supervision, investor protection, financial stability, and international cooperation, and actively contributes to global discussions on clearing, resolution and financial market resilience.</p>
<p>She is committed to modern, effective and citizen-oriented supervision, aligned with the principles of market integrity, transparency and investor protection, which form part of her professional DNA. Alongside her regulatory work, she is engaged in academic research and teaching in financial regulation, and is passionate about reading, culture and lifelong learning. Her leadership style is collaborative, inclusive and results-oriented, with a strong focus on teamwork, trust and continuous improvement.</p>
<p>Mar&iacute;a Jos&eacute;&nbsp;has volunteered to share with us her personal and professional journey by responding to three questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>What was the aspect of yourself that you had to work on the most to get to where you are now?</b></li>
</ul>
<p>One of the key aspects I had to work on was my own confidence. Early in my career, especially in highly technical and traditionally male-dominated environments, I had to learn not to underestimate myself or hesitate to step forward. Experience taught me that competence grows through&nbsp;<i>learning by doing</i>, and that credibility and authority are built by leading by example, consistency and hard work, by striving for excellence and genuinely enjoying what you do, whatever your role may be. Over time, I also learned the importance of trusting my own judgement while remaining open to learning from others through active listening, as well as the value of a strong humanistic education in broadening perspective and enriching professional growth.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>What key tip would you give for professionals to successfully develop in their careers?</b></li>
</ul>
<p>My main advice would be to invest continuously in learning, not only technical skills but also broader knowledge and human skills. Keeping an open mind, listening carefully, and understanding the perspectives of different stakeholders is essential, particularly in complex sectors such as clearing. I would also stress the value of mentoring, intergenerational and multidisciplinary teamwork, and building strong, cohesive teams. Finally, never feel inferior or afraid of new challenges. Commitment, curiosity and teamwork make a real difference over time.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>How do you see the future of clearing in 10 years?</b></li>
</ul>
<p>In the next decade, clearing will become even more central to financial stability, while undergoing a profound technological and structural transformation. Central counterparties will operate in a more digital, interconnected and accelerated environment, marked by shorter settlement cycles, the move towards continuous trading, greater automation, and the gradual integration of technologies such as distributed ledger technology and artificial intelligence, with the potential medium-term application of quantum computing. These innovations will enhance efficiency and transparency, but will also shift risks towards operational resilience, cyber security, liquidity management and governance, requiring crisis management and resolution frameworks to evolve accordingly, and authorities, infrastructures and market participants to remain continuously prepared for stress scenarios.</p>
<p>At the same time, the future of clearing in Europe will depend less on the degree of concentration of infrastructures and more on effective interoperability, coordinated supervision and strong institutional cooperation. A diversified but well-connected clearing ecosystem, supported by robust regulatory frameworks, will be key to combining innovation, competitiveness and systemic resilience in an increasingly global and digital financial system.</p>
<p>You could hear more about Mar&iacute;a Jos&eacute; by&nbsp;<b><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7426646737064185857" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">watching this video link</a>&nbsp;</b>or by reading the attached document and using&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://eachccp.eu/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Maria-Jose-Gomez-Yubero-Head-of-Resolution-CNMV.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">this link</a>.</p>
<p>We would like to thank Mar&iacute;a Jos&eacute; for her insightful contribution! We look forward to continuing the EACH&rsquo;s Women in Clearing Series by hosting many skilled women leaders to inspire other professionals in the clearing sector!</p>

<title>Remarks At The Asset Management Derivatives Forum 2026: Treasuries And Tokenization, SEC Commissioner Mark T. Uyeda, Austin, Texas, Feb. 9, 2026</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>Good morning and thank you, Lindsey [Keljo], for the introduction.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;I appreciate the turnout&mdash;early on a Monday morning&mdash;the day after the Super Bowl. For those folks in this room, I know that you find topics like Treasury clearing and tokenizing the securities markets as important as slot formations and nickel coverages. Thus, my remarks will focus on the current status of the SEC&rsquo;s efforts to implement the Treasury Clearing Rule<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2">[2]</a>&nbsp;and facilitate tokenization of the securities markets.</p>
<h1>I. Treasury Clearing Update</h1>
<p>The U.S. Treasury market remains the cornerstone of global financial stability, supporting everything from mortgage pricing to corporate financing to central bank reserves. With nearly $29 trillion in marketable Treasury debt,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3">[3]</a>&nbsp;it is the deepest and most liquid capital market in the world. Its smooth functioning depends on the coordinated efforts of countless stakeholders&mdash;including market participants, clearing agencies, infrastructure providers, and other regulators.</p>
<p>I first became involved in discussions regarding the potential mandatory clearing of Treasuries when I served on detail to the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2017. Eventually, there would be widespread consensus with respect to the benefits of mandatory Treasury clearing. Using a central counterparty can improve transparency and reduce bilateral exposures. The ability to use netting for offsetting transactions can free up additional cash for market participants, which in turn can reduce liquidity strains. Accordingly, in December 2023, I voted with a majority of SEC Commissioners to adopt standards to mandate central clearing of Treasury securities for transactions in the cash and repo markets.</p>
<p>Recent research by the Office of Financial Research (&ldquo;OFR&rdquo;) reemphasizes these benefits of central clearing in the Treasury repo market. In a back-testing analysis of repo and reverse repo positions reported by six global systemically important banks (&ldquo;G-SIBs&rdquo;) during the first eight months of 2025, OFR calculated that if the Treasury Clearing Rule had been in effect during this period, each U.S. G-SIB could have freed up an average of $34.5 billion in additional balance sheet space.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4">[4]</a></p>
<p>In its 2025 Annual Report released by the Trump Administration, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (&ldquo;FSOC&rdquo;) underscored the potential benefits of central clearing of Treasury transactions and expressed support for the SEC as it continues working towards the implementation of the Treasury Clearing Rule.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5">[5]</a>&nbsp;So, with that momentum, the SEC continues to undertake extensive outreach to mitigate any issues with the upcoming deadlines.</p>
<h2>A. Progress Made</h2>
<p>Despite the potential benefits of clearing Treasury transactions, I recognized at the time the SEC adopted the rule, that it would take extensive time, effort, and resources to develop the workflows and processes to integrate market participants into the clearing infrastructure. Given this significant work, it became apparent that the original implementation timeline was too short.</p>
<p>For that reason, upon becoming SEC Acting Chairman, I pushed for a 12-month extension of those deadlines. I was pleased that both of my then-colleagues, Commissioners Hester Peirce and Caroline Crenshaw, unanimously agreed to the extension.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6">[6]</a></p>
<p>At the time, the February 2025 extension would provide market participants with 22 months to prepare for implementation with respect to cash transactions. Now, that implementation date is less than eleven months away. Thanks to efforts of many, including those who are in this room, we have been able to collectively identify a number of concerns, and the SEC is committed to promptly addressing them.</p>
<p>Our efforts have been focused in three areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, reviewing applications and proposals aimed at expanding access to, and options for, clearing Treasury securities;</li>
<li>Second, providing guidance on the scope of the Treasury Clearing Rule, including consideration for providing additional flexibility to ensure that market participants can access liquidity and manage collateral; and</li>
<li>Third, maintaining a collaborative and transparent approach to implementation.</li>
</ul>
<p>I will address each of these in turn.</p>
<h2>B. Developments in Clearing</h2>
<h3>New Clearing Agencies</h3>
<p>Until recently, there was only a single SEC-registered clearing agency for Treasury securities, the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (&ldquo;FICC&rdquo;). In the last two months, however, the SEC has approved the applications of CME Securities Clearing Inc. and ICE Clear Credit LLC to register as clearing agencies for Treasury securities transactions.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7">[7]</a>&nbsp;These approvals will provide market participants the necessary certainty as to which entities can serve as clearing agencies for Treasury securities and what services they will offer.</p>
<p>Obtaining SEC approval is not an easy process. Section 17A(b)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (&ldquo;Exchange Act&rdquo;) sets forth the requirements that an applicant must meet in order to register as a clearing agency.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8">[8]</a>&nbsp;These requirements include whether the entity is so organized and has the capacity to provide the functions of a clearing agency, whether its rules provide for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions, and whether its rules assure a fair representation of its shareholders or members and participants in the selection of its directors and administration of its affairs. These requirements guide the Commission&rsquo;s consideration of a clearing agency application, and the Commission must find that an applicant can meet these requirements. In the case of the two new clearing agencies, the Commission made those findings.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9">[9]</a></p>
<p>Now, with three clearing agencies approved for Treasury securities, market participants will have expanded options for accessing clearing to implement their obligations under the Treasury Clearing Rule. We encourage market participants, who may have questions about the operations of these clearing agencies in relation to their own regulatory obligations, to engage with the central counterparties. If needed, the SEC staff stands ready to be part of those discussions.</p>
<h3>Rule Changes in Clearing</h3>
<p>Besides reviewing applications from new market entrants, the SEC staff has also been reviewing proposals from FICC to support the Treasury Clearing Rule. On December 22, 2025, the Commission published notice of FICC&rsquo;s proposed rule change to amend its cross-margining agreement with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Inc. (&ldquo;CME&rdquo;) to expand its existing cross-margining arrangement with CME to customers. Currently, the arrangement is limited to the proprietary positions of FICC and CME members.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10">[10]</a>&nbsp;Relatedly, the Commission is considering petitions submitted by FICC and CME for exemptive relief from certain provisions of the Exchange Act that would permit expanded cross-margining for customers.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11">[11]</a></p>
<p>Historically, the Commission has supported and approved cross-margining at clearing agencies and recognized the potential benefits of cross-margining systems. These benefits include freeing up capital through reduced margin requirements, reducing clearing costs by integrating clearing functions, reducing clearing agency risk by centralizing asset management, and harmonizing liquidation procedures. In addition, we understand that certain market participants view an expansion of cross-margining between cash and futures Treasury positions to be an important component of the transition to increased central clearing of Treasury securities. The current proposal from FICC and CME is still outstanding. The Commission must review and consider comments submitted by the public and take them into consideration as it determines whether to approve the proposed rule change.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Commission acted this past December on two proposals from FICC that are aimed at expanding access to clearing ahead of the Treasury Clearing Rule compliance dates. Specifically, the Commission approved a proposed new offering from FICC to establish a &ldquo;collateral-in-lieu&rdquo; service as part of the existing sponsored general collateral service.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12">[12]</a>&nbsp;This service would allow FICC to take a lien on the collateral underlying a repo transaction in lieu of charging margin. In most instances, the lien will obviate FICC&rsquo;s need to collect margin or to obtain a guarantee on the transactions. This service would address what market participants have referred to as &ldquo;double margining&rdquo; that increases the costs, and thereby decreases the ability, of a FICC sponsoring member to provide clearance and settlement services to mutual funds and other cash providers. Second, the Commission issued an order approving expansion of FICC&rsquo;s agent clearing service to include triparty transactions, which should provide an additional option for market participants using that service.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13">[13]</a></p>
<h2>C. Guidance on the Scope of the Treasury Clearing Rule</h2>
<p>The SEC has also been engaging with market participants about the scope of the Treasury Clearing Rule. SEC staff has provided guidance in some areas, such as mixed CUSIP triparty repos,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14">[14]</a>&nbsp;but has yet to resolve some other questions.</p>
<h3>Flexibility for Inter-Affiliate Transactions</h3>
<p>One area where market participants have asked for further regulatory clarity is the application of the Treasury Clearing Rule to inter-affiliate transactions.</p>
<p>When the Commission proposed the Treasury Clearing Rule, the definition of an eligible secondary market transaction provided no exception for inter-affiliate transactions. Commenters, however, asserted that inter-affiliate transactions are important for corporate groups, which use them to achieve efficient risk and capital allocation and to obtain flexibility for addressing customer demands. Further, commenters noted that requiring inter-affiliate transactions to be centrally cleared would impose additional costs but have only limited benefits.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15">[15]</a></p>
<p>Thus, the final rule included an exemption for inter-affiliate transactions. The Commission recognized that inter-affiliate transactions represent an important tool to transfer liquidity and risk within an affiliated group. The Commission also recognized that, in certain circumstances, the counterparty credit risk posed by inter-affiliate transactions may be less than other transactions.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16">[16]</a></p>
<p>The inter-affiliate exemption provides that a direct participant of a central counterparty would not have to clear its inter-affiliate transactions if (i) the affiliate was under common control and was either a bank, broker-dealer or a futures commission merchant, and (ii) the direct participant also submitted for clearing the outward-facing transactions of that affiliate.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17">[17]</a></p>
<p>As the Adopting Release explained, &ldquo;this [outward facing] condition&rdquo; was intended to ensure that a direct participant could not rely upon an inter-affiliate transaction to avoid the requirement to clear eligible secondary market transactions. If there were no such condition, a direct participant could simply use inter-affiliate transactions to move securities and funds to affiliates, and the affiliated counterparty could then enter into external transactions with counterparties which, if entered into as a direct participant of a Treasury securities covered clearing agency, would be eligible secondary market transactions. Because the clearing requirement is conditioned on one of the parties being a direct participant, this would undermine the clearing requirement. Under the outward-facing condition, however, the transfer of Treasury securities between a direct participant and its non-direct participant affiliate would only be exempt from the clearing requirement if the non-direct participant affiliate cleared all of its other Treasury repo transactions.</p>
<p>Because the final inter-affiliate exemption had not been exposed to public review, market participants raised a number of concerns, including with respect to the types of entities that can be affiliates for purposes of the exemption and the requirement to clear the outward-facing transactions of the affiliate. SEC staff has been working with market participants to better understand these concerns and how they can be addressed.</p>
<p>Specifically, SEC staff have been considering whether broadening the contours of that exemption could be workable without creating a significant loophole that undermines the purposes of the rule. For example, could the provision that the affiliate be a bank, broker-dealer, or futures commission merchant be modified to allow for more types of entities as affiliates? SEC staff are also considering other potential relief for the inter-affiliate exemption so that market participants can maintain their current business practices for liquidity, treasury, and collateral management. The Commission has received productive feedback from market participants on the inter-affiliate exemption, and my hope is that any potential modifications can be publicly rolled out in the near future, since the compliance date is fast approaching.</p>
<h3>Extra-Territorial Reach</h3>
<p>The extraterritorial scope of the Treasury Clearing Rule is another area where the SEC staff have engaged in additional outreach efforts. Non-U.S. firms that trade with U.S. counterparties do not typically centrally clear their trades in Treasury securities. Accordingly, it is not surprising that an industry survey on U.S. Treasury central clearing readiness, released last fall, showed lower levels of understanding of the Treasury Clearing Rule amongst non-U.S. firms and lower levels of confidence that these firms would be ready to fulfill their obligations by the extended compliance dates.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn18">[18]</a>&nbsp;The SEC is aware that these firms may have larger burdens than U.S. firms in establishing clearing arrangements with intermediaries or central counterparties.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn19">[19]</a>&nbsp;SEC staff have been engaging with market participants to understand the jurisdictional issues, and I hope we can address such concerns in the near future.</p>
<h2>D. Maintaining a Transparent and Collaborative Approach</h2>
<p>There are other areas where implementing the Treasury Clearing Rule has raised questions for market participants about how they should comply with other existing requirements under the federal securities laws.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn20">[20]</a>&nbsp;We acknowledge the need for guidance and SEC staff continue to engage with market participants on these questions.</p>
<p>To maximize transparency regarding the SEC&rsquo;s efforts, we have provided periodic public updates and maintain a comprehensive list of actions taken on a dedicated&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/securities-topics/treasury-clearing-implementation">Treasury Clearing implementation webpage</a>&nbsp;on sec.gov.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn21">[21]</a>&nbsp;Materials posted to this dedicated website also are intended to keep market participants informed about the additional work that is underway. Thus, if you see no mention of a particular concern on that website, then it is highly likely that we are not actively working on it&mdash;so we strongly encourage firms to identify and raise any remaining challenges or unforeseen issues as we move towards full implementation.</p>
<p>The Commission continues its collaboration with the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve Board, the CFTC, and international regulators to ensure seamless cross-border implementation. It is in all of our interests to see that the U.S. Treasury securities market remains the deepest, most liquid, and most resilient market in the world.</p>
<h1>II. Why Tokenization Matters and Where We Stand</h1>
<p>One of the other issues that the Commission is taking a close look at is tokenization, a development that could change the way securities are issued, traded, and managed. It also raises important questions about liquidity, collateral practices, and clearing models, as well as the legal and regulatory frameworks needed to support these changes.</p>
<p>Technology has long shaped the way our markets operate&mdash;from paper certificates to dematerialized shares, from physical trading floors to electronic order books. Today, we consider the possibility of migrating securities positions from traditional databases to blockchain-based systems, and tokenization representing these rights and obligations on-chain.</p>
<p>Properly implemented, tokenization can enhance security, transparency, and immutability by encoding rights on digital tokens and recording their provenance on distributed ledgers. It can reduce reliance on intermediaries, streamline transaction lifecycles, and lower operational costs&mdash;without sacrificing safeguards that have long protected investors.</p>
<p>Potential technological shifts challenge us to translate existing laws and regulations into new contexts. Today, many of the SEC&rsquo;s rules assume multi-layered intermediation. However, tokenization offers a pathway to more direct issuer&ndash;investor interactions on open, programmable rails. Market demand and confidence should drive whether tokenization becomes reality, and the SEC&rsquo;s rulebook should not impose unnecessary roadblocks.</p>
<h2>A. Innovation with Guardrails</h2>
<p>In that sense, SEC rules should be technology-neutral and be focused on outcomes, not solely processes. Tokenized versions of securities remain subject to securities regulation; the shift does not change the legal and regulatory obligations. The challenge is to adapt the rules&mdash;on issuance, custody, and trading to name a few&mdash;so that those obligations can be met in on-chain environments.</p>
<p>To date, SEC efforts in engagement have been through roundtables, staff statements, and public comment files. Under the Trump Administration, the SEC has ceased using enforcement as the principal method for expressing Commission views on these new technological developments. In that sense, the SEC has returned to its normal approach of providing sub-regulatory guidance and exploring exemptive relief to allow limited-scope pilots to proceed under defined parameters, thereby informing potential future Commission action. This is the same tried-and-true process that gave rise to money market funds and exchange-traded funds in the past.</p>
<p>Tokenization can help modernize capital markets, not only by speeding up the settlement cycle but by making ownership more visible&mdash;addressing current challenges in shareholder identification and corporate actions. Visibility and speed are not merely aesthetic improvements; they are core to fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and the Commission should be continually thinking about how these new developments can be incorporated into the markets.</p>
<h2>B. Looking Ahead: Opportunities and Responsibilities</h2>
<p>Recently, the Commission provided public notice of an exemptive application under the Investment Company Act that demonstrates how tokenization is no longer a theoretical exercise, but is becoming a practical reality.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn22">[22]</a>&nbsp;This milestone reflects the Commission&rsquo;s commitment to innovation without abandoning appropriate guardrails such as ensuring that custody, disclosure, and investor protection standards are in place when assets migrate on-chain. It also exemplifies a pragmatic roadmap&mdash;beginning with scoped efforts, learning from the results, and potentially scaling what works.</p>
<p>By moving forward with such applications, the Commission signals that it is open to modernization, provided that it adheres to achieving the objectives of longstanding laws and regulations that govern the securities markets. I hope that these exemptive order applications are not endpoints, but rather waypoints on a journey toward markets that are more fair, orderly, and efficient due to new innovations.</p>
<h2>C. First Principles, Enduring Mission</h2>
<p>Expectations vary: some predict rapid transformation while others caution that adoption might take years. The Commission&rsquo;s responsibility is to ensure that its regulations evolve as technology evolves&mdash;for the very same reason that the SEC cannot regulate in 2026 in the same manner as in 1934, when the agency was created.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s goal should be neither to bless every new innovation nor to resist change reflexively. Rather, it is to use its regulatory tools&mdash;including definitional authority and exemptive relief&mdash;so that the administration of the federal securities laws can evolve to address new technologies and innovation. Part of this responsibility includes providing transparency as to what is permitted, what requires prior authorization, and what is prohibited.</p>
<p>If financial regulators can carry out this process in an appropriate manner, capital markets will be able to operate in ways that reduce friction, improve price discovery, and serve investors better than ever before. Ultimately, that is the real objective of financial regulation.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, both Treasury clearing and tokenization serve as reminders that modernization is not an abstract goal&mdash;it is a practical necessity for resilient, transparent, and efficient markets. These initiatives demand continued engagement with market participants, robust consideration of benefits and costs, thoughtful evaluation of trade-offs among alternative approaches, and a respect for the legal authority governing the SEC&rsquo;s activities, including the procedural obligations required by the Administrative Procedure Act. These efforts are not simple and may take time, but they are essential. By approaching these changes methodically, the Commission can strengthen market infrastructure, promote responsible innovation, and ensure that America&rsquo;s capital markets continue to serve investors and the broader economy.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Fran&ccedil;ois Villeroy de Galhau, Governor of the Bank of France, today announced his decision to leave the Bank of France at the beginning of June to become President of the Fondation Apprentis d'Auteuil. Accordingly, he will step down from his position as Chair of the BIS Board of Directors.</p>
<p>Mr Villeroy de Galhau became Governor of the Bank of France and a member of the BIS Board of Directors in November 2015. He was appointed Chair of the BIS Board of Directors in January 2022 and previously served as Chair of the Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision (GHOS), the oversight body of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, from November 2019.</p>

<p>Mr Villeroy de Galhau has served the central banking community with distinction and has been a trusted colleague since he became Governor of the Bank of France. On behalf of the BIS, I would like to thank him for his leadership and commitment to our mission. It has been a pleasure to work alongside him to address the challenges facing central banks. His commitment to fostering global monetary and financial stability and to enhance the resilience of the financial system is deeply appreciated.</p>
<br /><br />
<p>On a personal level, I also worked alongside Fran&ccedil;ois in many forums, including during my tenure as Chair of the Basel Committee, and together with him as a member of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank. I am deeply grateful for his strategic leadership as well as his commitment to the public interest and to the pursuit of international cooperation. I will miss his optimism and principled approach to leadership. He has also become a valued friend and I wish him every success.</p>

<title>The EBA Launches Consultation On Simplifying The Credit Risk Framework</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) launched today a public consultation on its Discussion Paper on the simplification and assessment of the credit risk framework.&nbsp;The Paper sets out preliminary ideas to enhance the usability, efficiency and simplicity of the credit risk framework, aiming to stimulate a broader discussion on how to better structure the EBA&rsquo;s future work in this area. Based on the comments received, the EBA will assess potential simplifications as part of its future policy work. The consultation runs until 10 May 2026.</span></p>
<p>The EBA&rsquo;s 2025&nbsp;<a href="https://eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2025-10/b8e0ef8e-2d49-43fc-b917-dbca3423588c/Report%20on%20the%20efficiency%20of%20the%20regulatory%20and%20supervisory%20framework.pdf">Report on the efficiency of the regulatory and supervisory framework</a>&nbsp;introduced a set of principles aimed at enhancing simplicity and efficiency across the regulatory landscape. This Report recommends the EBA launches a review of all the regulatory products it has developed (Level 2 and Level 3) since its establishment in relation to the Single Rulebook, starting with credit risk.&nbsp;As the credit risk area has accumulated a particularly large number of mandates under the EU Banking Package, the Discussion Paper examines how a systematic review of these mandates could be organised so that EBA&rsquo;s future work better supports efficiency and simplicity.</p>
<p>The Discussion Paper sets out concrete proposals to enhance the efficiency and simplicity of the credit risk framework within the remit of EBA&rsquo;s credit risk mandates. Because the framework must balance several key objectives, including risk‑sensitivity, comparability, and cost‑efficiency, assessing simplicity is inherently challenging. In addition to exploring potential policy simplifications, the paper also looks at improving the presentation of the framework by consolidating EBA products and aligning key regulatory definitions, thereby making the EBA&rsquo;s credit risk outputs more coherent and easier to navigate. It further highlights a number of challenges linked to specific mandates in the credit risk area and sets out measures to be applied in future mandated reports assessing the appropriateness of several elements laid down in the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR).</p>
<h4>Consultation process</h4>
<p>Comments to this consultation can be sent to the EBA by clicking on the "Send your comments" button on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/events/discussion-simplification-and-assessment-credit-risk-framework" title="Discussion on the simplification and assessment of the credit risk framework">consultation page</a>. Please note that the deadline for the submission of comments is 10 May 2026. All contributions received will be published following the close of the consultation, unless requested otherwise.</p>
<h4>Legal basis and background</h4>
<p>The EBA published in December 2023 its roadmap on the implementation of the EU Banking Package.&nbsp; In the area of credit risk, the new mandates assigned to the EBA relate in many cases to existing EBA products developed and implemented upon previous CRD-CRR requirements. Hence, the implementation of these mandates provides an opportunity to update those products and ensure greater consistency and efficiency across the framework.</p>
<p>The 2025 EBA Report on the efficiency of the regulatory and supervisory framework includes as one of its recommendations to launch a comprehensive review of both the new flow of mandates (i.e. those not yet consulted on) and the existing stock (current products from the Single Rulebook). This Discussion Paper outlines how such a review should be carried out in the credit risk domain and proposes initial avenues to streamline and enhance the usability of the framework.</p>

<title>CFTC Targets Relationship Investment Scams With National And International Initiatives This Valentine’s Week</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cftc-targets-relationship-investment-scams-with-national-and-international-initi-202629/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cftc-targets-relationship-investment-scams-with-national-and-international-initi-202629/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As Valentine&rsquo;s Day approaches, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission&rsquo;s Office of Customer Education and Outreach is leading&nbsp;national and international awareness efforts to warn the public about relationship investment scams, a form of fraud that costs Americans an estimated $10 billion each year.</p>
<p>The national, interagency&nbsp;<em>DatingOrDefrauding?</em>&nbsp;social media awareness campaign warns Americans to be skeptical of any requests from new online friends or romantic interests. The campaign highlights a common warning sign: requests to send crypto assets, or other forms of payment, to invest in scams through fake crypto websites.</p>
<p>In addition to the CFTC, participating organizations include:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BulletedHyperlink">Federal agencies: Department of Justice Criminal Division, Department of Labor Employee Benefits Security Administration, FBI, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation - Office of Inspector General, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, IRS Criminal Investigation, National Credit Union Administration, Securities and Exchange Commission, Social Security Administration Office of Inspector General, U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and U.S. Secret Service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BulletedHyperlink">State agencies:<span>&nbsp;Minnesota Department of Commerce, Oregon Department of Consumer and Business Services, Virgin Islands Lieutenant Governor&rsquo;s Office, Washington Department of Financial Institutions, and Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BulletedHyperlink">Non-governmental organizations:&nbsp;<span>FINRA, NFA, and North American Association of Securities Administrators.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Warning signs of relationship investment scams include an online friend or love interest who:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BulletedHyperlink">Is unable to meet in person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BulletedHyperlink">Moves conversations off social or dating platforms to encrypted messaging apps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BulletedHyperlink">Claims to be, or know, an expert crypto trader.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BulletedHyperlink">Offers to help the victim trade or invest money.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;Foreign criminals are exploiting dating apps, social media, messaging platforms, and artificial intelligence to steal money from American citizens,&rdquo; CFTC Chairman Michael S. Selig said. &ldquo;Keep your friends and family safe by warning them about this scam and encouraging them to keep their crypto assets safe&nbsp;<span>by using trusted and secure software systems and U.S.-regulated intermediaries</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>OCEO is also collaborating with the International Organization of Securities Commissions on a global initiative to raise public awareness and reduce victimization from the scams. The Valentine&rsquo;s week campaign builds on a similar effort conducted in October 2025, when 16 jurisdictions across five continents carried out coordinated educational outreach.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Initiatives timed around Valentine&rsquo;s Day are particularly effective, as scammers often exploit emotional vulnerability and the desire for companionship. By providing the information needed to recognize and avoid relationship investment scams, the initiatives, which will run from Wednesday through Saturday, aim to reduce victimization and financial loss during a potentially high-risk period.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>About Relationship Investment Scams</strong></p>
<p>Relationship investment scams are a type of romance fraud. Often referred to by the perpetrators as &ldquo;pig butchering,&rdquo; these schemes rely on dating apps, social media platforms, messaging apps, and even random &ldquo;wrong number&rdquo; text messages to target potential victims. The scammers use fake profiles, images, videos, and voices to appear trustworthy, attractive, and professional. After establishing frequent contact and building emotional connections, they claim to earn significant profits trading crypto assets, precious metals, or foreign currency and offer to help victims do the same.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Victims are ultimately directed to fraudulent trading platforms controlled by organized criminal networks, resulting in substantial financial losses.</p>
<p>More information and resources about relationship investment scams are available at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect">CFTC.gov/LearnAndProtect</a>.</p>
<p><span><strong>About the Office of Customer Education and Outreach</strong></span></p>
<p><span>OCEO is responsible for helping people and potential customers spot, avoid, and report fraud. This requires the office to work closely with internal and external stakeholders to monitor and identify current and developing fraud trends, develop timely and effective educational materials, messages, and outreach strategies, and alert the public to products, situations, or behaviors that could make them targets for crime. The CFTC&rsquo;s full repository of customer education materials is available at&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect">CFTC.gov/LearnAndProtect</a><span>.</span></p>

<title>Volumes And Open Interest Rapidly Increasing On The EEX Nordic Power Derivatives Market</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/volumes-and-open-interest-rapidly-increasing-on-the-eex-nordic-power-derivatives-202629/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The European Energy Exchange (EEX) is continuing the strong development in its Nordic power derivatives markets in all of the key indicators for growing a successful market. Volumes in terms of trades and orders in both the system price and zonal contracts are quickly gaining momentum. Market shares are increasing as well as the EEX open interest in the major system price and zonal contracts. Furthermore, the impressive increase in number of active traders has been warmly received by market participants.</p>
<p>In January 2026, a volume of 3.6 TWh was traded in the EEX Nordic Power Futures which has significant growth compared to the previous month and is even +8,162% year-on-year. Market share growth in both the system and zonal contracts has been impressive, which now stands at approximately 10% in months, 20% in quarters and up to 25% in yearly contracts. Standing out in January was the Sweden 3 zone, where the EEX reached almost 20% exchange market share, which is the largest zone by volume, with 1.5 TWh traded on EEX, marking an all-time high.</p>
<p>Liquidity on EEX has increased noticeably since the start of the comprehensive liquidity programmes, which started on 1 September 2025. From September 2025 to January 2026 a volume of 12.9 TWh has been traded, while the total 2025 volume amounted to 11.7 TWh.</p>
<p>The growth in volumes is also reflected by a dynamically increasing Open Interest which is up over 90% compared to last year. EEX has doubled its market open interest share over the last few months to 6% in the System Price Futures, based on exchange data published by ESMA. Open Interest (OI) rate is the total number of unsettled derivatives contracts in a given market, indicating the interest level and liquidity of this market.</p>
<p>The impressive growth in volumes, open interest and market shares in the system and zonal contracts is reflected in the number of active traders, both in terms of the number of trades and orders. Traders have started to notice that EEX&rsquo;s Nordic power offering is growing and this is attracting new participants. EEX has especially been successful in adding new international market participants which are trading Nordic power for the first time. Over the past five months the number of active participants has steadily increased, with a record participation of 45 in January 2026.</p>
<p>Peter Reitz, CEO of EEX, comments:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s great to see liquidity growing and we have good arguments for traders to use our products for hedging. We provide choice for customers by offering system price and zonal products, offering dedicated customer support with our offices in Stockholm and Oslo and bring our larger continental European and US-based market participant base to the Nordics. In close collaboration with both international and local trading participants, we look forward to continued liquidity growth throughout 2026.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>EEX&rsquo;s product offering for the region includes both Nordic System Price contracts, the so-called Zonal Futures with price determination for each Nordic delivery area, and Implied EPADs, a combination of Zonal Futures and the Nordic System Price Futures, which provide the benefit of the location spread effect.

<title>UK VC Funding Activity Faces Challenges In 2025 With Contraction In Both Deal Volume And Value, Finds GlobalData</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span><span>The UK venture capital (VC) landscape faced a challenging environment in 2025, with dealmaking momentum slowing both in terms of volume and value compared to the previous year. The total number of VC deals announced in the country declined by around 17% in 2025 compared to 2024, while the corresponding funding value witnessed a year-on-year (YoY) decline of around 3%, according to&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.gqh-2BaxUzlo7XKIuSly0rC502qyvSaH8suunkkct0v9nAw2i9NVNQPXGQip5nqGg3CtRFeWroc-2BgaLT7uNoevmgBBG2t9SWipjUkpf5vvgOFwTxmzHp0lxy8O85H4dALsaQobEfiowcL1jmrK5VNpfmvURobeTfOXfvlQai6Bp2GK1fh2Au6BODh4NDnIRAJZVSmfPgq3Np5kVcnHyEjCLFgRL-2FzH3pA1rzKt37GS66Q-3DjhZN_awSuR00uK8EZood8su7v4ItMFr0d7S5MNR1CcvAHRb7u8JiSB5Axp3o6-2Brp7TTn9jFAQeaiwuDUNp6ED3yPnAqPtLtA7N0aAz15yM-2Fa7YbLjEsQ0GRAa40BulYCiuXYlZuSNUmUBt77HjIUAMkqEOPMgZk4uOTWzgjLfsxTqPlXnkF6tLNEebE1KbTirMIT6E5PlOg2SEpKs9w5Xd6-2Fj2BRCI7hOv15-2BcG8wVshjpZUhwXvsCvFja-2F82Lgk9jf54zvMz7vdBvcIYUO93DB62YusD97DqlWv6E4jg1wIdDVfD9HnkjjIRdY8R9Rkz7NywOqc1UVHnzo8Nv9ysEgpE8US61oNG-2FCZV0aiHvDbQg5I-3D" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">GlobalData</span></span></span></a><span>, a leading intelligence and productivity platform.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Aurojyoti Bose, Lead Analyst at GlobalData, comments:&nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;Compared with a 3% YoY decline in overall global deal volume and 31% growth in global value, the contraction indicates that the UK saw a sharper pullback than the broader market. Nevertheless, while the steeper decline in deal volume in the UK points to tighter diligence, the comparatively modest drop in value suggests investors are still backing promising companies, particularly those demonstrating clear routes to profitability and scalable unit economics.&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Nexus Global Payments (NGP) appoints Payments Network Malaysia (PayNet) and Network for Electronic Transfers Singapore (NETS) joint venture as the Nexus Technical Operator (NTO). This follows a competitive procurement process involving global bidders and marks a major milestone in building an interoperable global payments infrastructure.</p>
<p>The evaluation of bidders considered technical capability, operational resilience, cost efficiency, and alignment with Nexus&rsquo; vision for global interoperability. PayNet and NETS joint venture emerged as the preferred partner due to the proven track record of the two leading ASEAN payment networks behind it and their commitment to innovation and collaboration.</p>
<p>The newly appointed NTO will work closely with leading global firms Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ &lsquo;AMZN&rsquo;) and Endava (NYSE &lsquo;DAVA&rsquo;) to deliver the technical design and development of the Nexus platform. Amazon Web Services is a global cloud technology leader that has made cloud computing and generative AI accessible to organisations of every size and industry whilst Endava leads the end-to-end design and engineering, applying its AI-native approach and deep industry expertise to build a resilient, future-ready solution. This global delivery capability and collaboration ensures that Nexus is built to meet international standards, scalable from inception and reflects best practices drawn from a wide range of payment system environments. The NTO will be responsible for building, operating, and maintaining the Nexus infrastructure, ensuring compliance with global standards, and delivering robust cybersecurity and operational resilience. It will also coordinate the onboarding of entities that are responsible for managing domestic instant payment schemes that will connect to Nexus to enable the banks and non-bank entities participating in these domestic systems to be part of the network.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Our partnership with PayNet and NETS is a major milestone towards our vision for an interoperable global payments network. With our chosen partners&rsquo; proven expertise and commitment to innovation, we are confident that Nexus will be resilient, aligned with international standards from day one, and ready for future global scale. Nexus is shaping a future where cross-border payments are instant, accessible, and seamlessly connected.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p><b><i>- Andrew McCormack, CEO, NGP</i></b></p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Being selected as the Nexus Technical Operator alongside NETS is a significant honour for Malaysia. It reflects the trust in our domestic capabilities and our growing track record in enabling cross-border payments. Through DuitNow and our regional interoperability efforts, we&rsquo;ve shown what&rsquo;s possible and now we&rsquo;re ready to scale that impact globally through Nexus. We&rsquo;re proud to be part of this next chapter in building a more connected, inclusive, and seamless global payment ecosystem.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p><b><i>- Praveen Rajan, CEO, PayNet</i></b></p>
<p><i>&ldquo;We are deeply honored to be selected as the Nexus Technical Operator, in partnership with PayNet. This appointment reflects a strong vote of confidence in our ability to build and operate payment infrastructure at scale and reinforces Singapore&rsquo;s pivotal role in advancing cross-border payment innovation. The NETS Group was involved in establishing the first bilateral cross-border linkage between Singapore and Thailand for account-to-account transfers in 2021 and we are excited to bring this spirit of innovation to enable seamless cross-border payments through a 'network-to-network' ecosystem. We look forward to advancing the vision of borderless payments, working collaboratively towards a modern, real-time international payment network infrastructure.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p><b><i>- Lawrence Chan, Group CEO, NETS</i></b></p>
<p>PayNet is Malaysia&rsquo;s national payments network and shared infrastructure provider, operating services such as DuitNow Transfer and DuitNow QR. It plays a central role in modernising and innovating Malaysia&rsquo;s digital payment agenda. NETS is Singapore&rsquo;s leading payment solutions provider, backed by over forty years of experience in delivering secure, efficient payment systems in Singapore and expanding in recent years to offer regional connectivity. The joint venture combines PayNet&rsquo;s domestic expertise and NETS&rsquo; technical capabilities to deliver a world-class platform for Nexus. This partnership reflects a shared commitment to innovation and financial inclusion across Asia and beyond.</p>
<p>The selection of the NTO represents pivotal progress toward Nexus&rsquo;s first live deployment across its initial cohort of countries. With technical development scheduled to begin in early 2026 and go-live targeted for 2027, this trajectory reflects NGP&rsquo;s unwavering commitment to delivering a sustainable, scalable, and globally interoperable solution&mdash;one that redefines speed, transparency, and accessibility in international transactions.</p>
<p>Nexus simplifies cross-border payments by connecting domestic real-time payment systems. It reduces reliance on intermediaries, cuts costs, and enables users to send and receive money internationally within seconds, through familiar banking or payment apps.</p>

<title>ICE Mortgage Monitor: Early-January Rate Decline Unlocks Refinance Opportunity For Nearly 5 Million Homeowners - Affordability Reaches Four-Year High But Remains Structurally Stretched As Home Price-To-Income Ratios Remain Elevated</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ice-mortgage-monitor-early-january-rate-decline-unlocks-refinance-opportunity-f-202629/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ice-mortgage-monitor-early-january-rate-decline-unlocks-refinance-opportunity-f-202629/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE: ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today released its February 2026 ICE Mortgage Monitor Report. According to the analysis, early January declines in mortgage rates unlocked refinance opportunities for nearly five million borrowers and helped push affordability to a four-year high.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even small reductions toward 6% rates can significantly boost affordability, particularly for homeowners who could refinance into a lower rate and monthly payments,&rdquo; said Andy Walden, Head of Mortgage and Housing Market Research at ICE. &ldquo;When rates hit 6.04% on January 9, the number of homeowners in the money to refinance jumped by 20% and affordability hit its best level in four years. That said, affordability remains structurally challenged, with home prices still elevated relative to incomes and meaningful differences emerging across regions and borrower segments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Key findings from the February Mortgage Monitor include:</p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li><span>Refinance incentives surged to a nearly four-year high following early-January interest rate declines<br /><br /></span>On January 9, interest rates reached 6.04%, according to the ICE 30-year conforming fixed rate index&nbsp;<span>,</span>&nbsp;which put roughly 4.8 million borrowers &ldquo;in the money&rdquo; for a refinance &mdash; the highest level since early 2022. That drop effectively increased the eligible population by 20% overnight. Although some of that benefit has since receded, the episode underscores how sensitive the market is to rate shifts in the high‑5% to low‑6% range. Nearly 1.3 million recently originated mortgages carry rates between 6.875% and 6.99%, including more than half a million from 2025, making it the most common rate band last year, and the most sensitive to interest rate drops.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li><span>Housing affordability reached its best level since early 2022, but remains stretched by historical standards<br /><br /></span>In early January, the monthly principal and interest payment needed to purchase the average-priced home fell by -$164 (-7%) year over year to $2,091, reducing the share of median household income required to 27.8%. Despite the improvement, the national home price-to-income ratio remains elevated at roughly 4.8:1, well above its long-run average near 4:1. To revert back to pre-pandemic home price-to-income ratios, household incomes would need to rise a little over 15%, assuming home prices remain flat.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li><span>Negative equity is increasing modestly, concentrated in recent vintages and select Southern markets<br /><br /></span>More than 1.1 million borrowers ended 2025 underwater &mdash; the highest level since early 2018 &mdash; with negative equity heavily concentrated among FHA and VA loans originated in 2022 or later. Several Southern markets now have more than one in 10 mortgaged homes underwater, even as national equity levels remain historically strong.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li><span>Home price growth slowed to its weakest pace in more than a decade, with regional divergence widening<br /><br /></span>U.S. home prices rose just 0.6% in 2025, marking the smallest calendar year growth since 2011. The Northeast and Midwest continue to provide stability, while price declines in the South and West are increasingly weighing on national averages.</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s market is full of cross‑currents &mdash; borrowers responding quickly to rate shifts, affordability improving for some but not others, and pockets of rising credit stress,&rdquo; said Bob Hart, President of ICE Mortgage Technology. &ldquo;Our end-to-end mortgage platform helps servicers and lenders make sense of those moving parts and act on opportunity. It gives them a clearer view of who might benefit from refinancing, where portfolio risks are building, and how to engage customers with the right options at the right time &mdash; all while supporting timely follow-through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The full February Mortgage Monitor report contains a deeper analysis of payment performance trends, and housing market trends featuring ICE Home Price Index (HPI) data.</p>

<p>IOSCO published today it&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iosco.org%2Flibrary%2Fpubdocs%2Fpdf%2FIOSCOPD813.pdf&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cmailing-lists%40iosco.org%7C30c1ea71a5ff4157f65208de67bdb30f%7Cbcc6c66cdb3b48328af2cc363a097444%7C0%7C0%7C639062261608243551%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=Xe97tmeZh%2BP%2FTUCDALhxas5DitEfFMEItk2f2nfveEw%3D&amp;reserved=0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">2026 Work Program</a>.</p>
<p>Building on its 2025 Work Program, IOSCO will keep its focus on strengthening capital markets. IOSCO&rsquo;s key strategic priorities for 2026 are:&nbsp;<strong>(i) Strengthening Financial Resilience and Market Effectiveness, (ii) Protecting investors, (iii) The evolution of Public and Private Markets; (iv) Technological transformation,</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>(v) Promoting regulatory cooperation and effectiveness</strong>.</p>
<p>While the work programme showcases IOSCO&rsquo;s initiatives, IOSCO remains committed to&nbsp;<strong>close collaboration</strong>&nbsp;with other international organizations and standard setters such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World Bank and the Financial Stability Board (FSB) to address emerging risks and shared global challenges, promote greater alignment in regulatory approaches, and support initiatives related to&nbsp;<strong>capital markets development</strong>.</p>
<p>Overview of IOSCO's 2026 Work Program</p>
<p><strong>1. Strengthening Financial Resilience and Market Effectiveness</strong></p>
<p>Ensuring the resilience of the global financial system remains a key pillar of IOSCO&rsquo;s mandate. IOSCO will finalize several ongoing work streams, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its review of the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iosco.org%2Flibrary%2Fpubdocs%2Fpdf%2FIOSCOPD811.pdf&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cmailing-lists%40iosco.org%7C30c1ea71a5ff4157f65208de67bdb30f%7Cbcc6c66cdb3b48328af2cc363a097444%7C0%7C0%7C639062261608267634%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=ifWdOBLM87WQR82E%2B3FrsG0nmdGKa%2BGzKhaMc8RArS8%3D&amp;reserved=0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">IOSCO Principles for the Valuation of Collective Investment Schemes.</a></li>

</ul>
<p>New key initiatives in this field for 2026 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Seeking to address issues related to over-the-counter&nbsp;<strong>(OTC) derivatives</strong>&nbsp;reporting fragmentation.</li>
<li>Work on the impact of market microstructures on liquidity and of&nbsp;<strong>extended trading hours</strong>&nbsp;on equity trading venues.</li>
<li>Contributing to FSB&rsquo;s work on issues of&nbsp;<strong>non-bank data</strong>&nbsp;availability, use and quality.</li>
<li>Contributing, as necessary, to follow-up work on the issue of&nbsp;<strong>leverage in non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI)</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>IOSCO will continue to develop work to&nbsp;<strong>strengthen the operational resilience of Financial Market Infrastructures</strong>&nbsp;(FMIs) through the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI)-IOSCO Operational Resilience Group. This work both considers whether there are gaps in the effectiveness of FMIs&rsquo; management of third-party risks and how to address potential gaps in FMI&rsquo;s cyber resilience.</p>
<p><strong>2. Protecting Investors</strong></p>
<p>IOSCO will further strengthen its efforts in investor education by launching its first&nbsp;<strong>TechSprint</strong>, in partnership with the UK Financial Conduct Authority&rsquo;s AI Lab. This initiative aims to leverage technology to develop educational resources that empower retail investors to navigate the novel products available to them, understand the risks and opportunities associated, and identify scams.</p>
<p>IOSCO will also explore these&nbsp;<strong>novel products</strong>, such as crypto-asset funds, private credit vehicles and retail-facing derivatives, which offer greater choice to investors but may also introduce new risks.</p>
<p>IOSCO will continue to engage with platform providers such as social media companies, search engines and internet providers to advocate for the restriction and monitoring of harmful or fraudulent content, and to promote the use of&nbsp;<strong>I-SCAN</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; its Enhanced Investor Alerts Portal. This new system offers a global real-time database of supervisory alerts on unauthorised firms and known scams to improve the protection of clients and investors and fight financial fraud.</p>
<p><strong>3. The Evolution of Public and Private Markets</strong></p>
<p>Capital markets are evolving, with a significant decline in public debt and equity issuance, and a rise in trading fragmentation and growth in private markets, introducing new complexities.</p>
<p>Key initiatives in this field include:</p>
<ul>
<li>An exploration of the growing interconnectedness between&nbsp;<strong>private equity</strong>&nbsp;activities and the&nbsp;<strong>audit sector</strong>.</li>
<li>Contribution to the FSB&rsquo;s deep dive on&nbsp;<strong>private credit</strong>.</li>
<li>Research work on the functioning of&nbsp;<strong>public markets</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Technological transformation</strong></p>
<p>The adoption of&nbsp;<strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong>, the intersection of digital assets with traditional finance and the rise of&nbsp;<strong>tokenization</strong>&nbsp;all present significant opportunities for financial markets and their investors but they can also present risks.</p>
<p>In 2026, IOSCO will advance its&nbsp;<strong>crypto-asset roadmap</strong>&nbsp;by finalizing a formal methodology for crypto and digital assets assessments, initiate regular thematic reviews, and continue to monitor developments arising from financial technology adoption.</p>
<p>IOSCO will also develop&nbsp;<strong>a supervisory tool kit on AI</strong>&nbsp;and guidance for firms on disclosures and governance in relation to AI and will focus on Supervisory Technology (<strong>SupTech</strong>), after the recent creation of a dedicated collaborative forum for members to share knowledge on how technology and in particular AI-powered tools can boost the efficiency of supervision and enforcement.</p>
<p><strong>5. Promoting Regulatory Cooperation and Effectiveness</strong></p>
<p>Promoting regulatory cooperation and effectiveness remains a key strategic priority of IOSCO. A key priority will be to assist members from emerging markets to build sound and robust capital markets, through&nbsp;<strong>enhanced capacity building</strong>, strengthened partnerships with international financial institutions, and direct assistance in addressing identified challenges.</p>
<p>Regulatory cooperation remains central to the effective delivery of these priorities. In particular, the IOSCO Multilateral Memorandum of Understanding (MMoU), with 131 signatories, is the&nbsp;<strong>global gold standard</strong>&nbsp;for international enforcement cooperation for financial markets.</p>
<p>IOSCO will continue to support MMoU signatories, including by encouraging them to upgrade to the Enhanced MMoU (EMMoU) and by conducting training and reviews. IOSCO will also continue to support non-signatories in meeting the requirements for adoption, ensuring that the global safety net against misconduct remains tight.</p>
<p>IOSCO will continue its&nbsp;<strong>regular reviews</strong>, promoting the consistent application of securities regulation worldwide.</p>
<p>IOSCO will also continue to deliver tailored capacity-building initiatives as part of the NEXTGEN program. In that context, a new dedicated&nbsp;<strong>e-learning platform</strong>&nbsp;will be developed during 2026 to expand the reach and value of this key part of IOSCO&rsquo;s mission.</p>

<title>Comment From Hina Sattar Joshi, Director At TP ICAP, Digital Assets - - Bitcoin 'Boom And Bust' Pattern</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><b>Market sentiment</b></p>
<p>The recent sharp swings in crypto prices underscore how the market&rsquo;s infrastructure is still evolving and its impact on volatility. Sentiment is currently very fragile, with investors anchoring themselves to the traditional four-year&nbsp;Bitcoin cycle, in which Bitcoin&rsquo;s price historically follows a recurring pattern of &lsquo;boom and bust&rsquo;. We&rsquo;ve seen over the past couple of weeks BTC ETFs experiencing significant outflows, while Ethereum and XRP products have attracted notable inflows. This trend points to a rotation in risk appetite, rather than a mass exit from the asset class.</p>
<p><b>Policy and market structure</b></p>
<p>Structural forces continue to steer institutional appetite for digital assets.&nbsp; Sentiment toward the recently announced collaboration between the SEC and CFTC on &lsquo;Project Crypto&rsquo;, aiming to unify US regulation, was muted compared to the enthusiasm compared to recent policy milestones like the GENIUS Act. This reaction reflects&nbsp;already fragile market sentiment, combined with concerns that the initiative risks a complex, dual-layered regulatory framework that could stifle growth.</p>
<p>Turning to the UK and Europe, we&rsquo;re seeing cleaner digital asset frameworks being established, as regulatory alignment reduces uncertainty and enables greater institutional participation. Looking at the UK specifically, the HM Treasury&rsquo;s DIGIT (Digital Gilt Instrument) programme, which will issue short-dated native gilts on blockchain infrastructure, marks a meaningful step towards modernising capital markets and is drawing significant interest as engagement shifts from exploratory to operational.</p>
<p>Progressive policies and greater conviction from policymakers outside of the US raise the question of whether USD-backed stablecoins will remain the dominant use case, or whether other stablecoins will&nbsp;be able to capture market share.</p>

<p>Japanese stocks soared to record highs as bonds weakened and the yen hit an all-time low against the Swiss franc after Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi secured a decisive victory in Sunday&rsquo;s snap election.</p>
<p>Takaichi&rsquo;s Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) captured 316 of the 465 seats in the lower house of parliament, granting her the mandate to advance her ambitious spending plans and tax relief initiatives without needing to negotiate with opposition parties. The LDP&rsquo;s supermajority also enables the government to pass legislation without requiring approval from the upper house.</p>
<p>The Nikkei 225 surged 5.7% to an unprecedented 57,337.07 by 0146 GMT, with 197 of its 225 components gaining. The broader Topix index climbed 3.4% to a record-breaking 3,825.67, reflecting widespread market optimism over the election results.</p>

<title>ASIC Action Sees FIIG Securities Ordered To Pay $2.5 Million Over Cyber Security Failures</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Australian&nbsp;fixed-income&nbsp;specialist,&nbsp;FIIG Securities Limited (<strong>FIIG</strong>), has been ordered to pay $2.5 million in pecuniary penalties after ASIC brought a case against the firm for failures to protect thousands of clients from cyber security threats for more than four years.</p>
<p>FIIG&rsquo;s failures worsened a 2023 cyber-attack which saw around 385 gigabytes of confidential information stolen and highly sensitive client data leaked onto the dark web &ndash; including driver&rsquo;s licences, passport information, bank account details and tax file numbers.</p>
<p>FIIG notified some 18,000 clients that their personal information may have been compromised.</p>
<p>FIIG admitted that it failed to comply with its Australian Financial Services (AFS) licence obligations and that adequate cyber security measures &ndash; suited to a firm of its size and the sensitivity of client data held &ndash; would have enabled it to detect and respond to the data breach sooner. It also admitted that complying with its own policies and procedures could have supported earlier detection and prevented some or all of the client information from being downloaded.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Federal Court today ordered FIIG to pay a $2.5 million penalty and pay $500,000 towards ASIC&rsquo;s costs. The Court also ordered FIIG to undertake a compliance programme involving the engagement of an independent expert to ensure its cyber security and cyber resilience systems are reasonably managed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>ASIC&nbsp;Deputy&nbsp;Chair&nbsp;Sarah Court&nbsp;said,&nbsp;&lsquo;Cyber-attacks&nbsp;and&nbsp;data breaches&nbsp;are&nbsp;escalating&nbsp;in both scale and sophistication,&nbsp;and inadequate&nbsp;controls&nbsp;put&nbsp;clients and&nbsp;companies&nbsp;at real risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;ASIC expects financial services licensees to be on the front foot every day to protect their clients. FIIG wasn&rsquo;t &ndash; and they put thousands of clients at risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In this&nbsp;case,&nbsp;the&nbsp;consequences&nbsp;far exceeded&nbsp;what it would have cost&nbsp;FIIG&nbsp;to implement&nbsp;adequate controls&nbsp;in the first place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is the first time the Federal Court has imposed civil penalties for cyber security failures under the general AFS licensee obligations, setting a clear licence-to-operate expectation for robust cyber resilience.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Clients entrust licensees with sensitive and confidential information, and that trust carries clear responsibilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FIIG&rsquo;s&nbsp;cyber security&nbsp;failures between 13 March 2019 to 8 June 2023 included&nbsp;examples where it&nbsp;did not:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>allocate the necessary financial resources to have suitably qualified and experienced people available, or implement adequate technological resources to manage cyber security</li>
<li>implement adequate cyber security measures, including multi-factor authentication for remote access users, strong passwords and access controls for privileged accounts, appropriate configuration of firewalls and security software, regular penetration testing and vulnerability scanning</li>
<li>have a structured plan to ensure key software systems were being updated to address security vulnerabilities</li>
<li>have qualified IT personnel monitoring threat alerts to identify and respond to cyber-attacks</li>
<li>provide mandatory cyber security awareness training to staff, and&nbsp;</li>
<li>have an appropriate cyber incident response plan that was tested at least annually.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&lsquo;Entities that fail to maintain proper cyber security controls risk regulatory action by ASIC and exposure to malicious exploitation,&rsquo; the Deputy Chair said.</p>
<p>ASIC expects AFS licensees to prioritise cyber-resilience and invest in people, systems and governance which are fit-for-purpose for entity size and the sensitivity of client information held.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>FIIG provides retail and wholesale investors with access to fixed income investments and bond financing. As an AFS licensee, FIIG plays an important role in providing custodial and trading services, maintaining records of client investments, and holding funds and fixed income investments on behalf of its clients. At the time of non-compliance, FIIG held approximately $3 billion in client assets under management.</p>
<p>ASIC&nbsp;identified&nbsp;cyber-attacks, data breaches and/or inadequate operational resilience and crisis management within its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/news-items/key-issues-outlook-2026/" title="Key issues outlook 2026">2026 key issues outlook</a>, and expects AFS licensees to prioritise and invest in systems that protect their customers and&nbsp;maintain&nbsp;integrity in the financial system.</p>
<p>This case was ASIC&rsquo;s second cyber security enforcement action. In May 2022, the Federal Court ruled AFS licensee, RI Advice, had breached its license obligations to act efficiently and fairly when it&nbsp;failed to&nbsp;have adequate risk management systems to manage its cyber security risks (<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2022-releases/22-104mr-court-finds-ri-advice-failed-to-adequately-manage-cybersecurity-risks/" title="22-104MR Court finds RI Advice failed to adequately manage cybersecurity risks">22-104MR</a>).</p>
<p>ASIC filed civil proceedings against financial advice business Fortnum Private Wealth Limited in July 2025, alleging it&nbsp;failed to&nbsp;properly manage&nbsp;and mitigate&nbsp;cyber security&nbsp;risks (<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-143mr-asic-sues-fortnum-private-wealth-for-allegedly-failing-to-adequately-manage-cybersecurity-risks/" title="25-143MR ASIC sues Fortnum Private Wealth for allegedly failing to adequately manage cybersecurity risks">25-143MR</a>).</p>
<p>FIIG has admitted it failed to comply with its AFS licence obligations by:</p>
<ul>
<li>failing to take all necessary steps to ensure its financial services were provided efficiently, honestly and fairly, including by not having adequate measures in place to protect clients from the risks and consequences of a cyber incident</li>
<li>failing to&nbsp;have&nbsp;available adequate&nbsp;financial,&nbsp;technological&nbsp;and human resources to&nbsp;comply with&nbsp;its obligations and&nbsp;support adequate&nbsp;cyber security&nbsp;measures, and&nbsp;</li>
<li>failing to have&nbsp;an adequate risk management system&nbsp;manage or&nbsp;mitigate&nbsp;cyber security&nbsp;risks to FIIG and its clients.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
