<title>Shanghai Stock Exchange Introduces New Measures To Facilitate Follow-On Offering</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/shanghai-stock-exchange-introduces-new-measures-to-facilitate-follow-on-offering-2026211/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/shanghai-stock-exchange-introduces-new-measures-to-facilitate-follow-on-offering-2026211/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Fourth Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China calls for enhancing the inclusiveness and adaptability of the capital market and improving the coordinated functions of investment and financing. The 2025 Central Economic Work Conference requests continuous and in-depth reforms to the investment and financing mechanisms of the capital market. Follow-on offering, as one of the crucial investment and financing tools, plays a significant role in the growth of listed companies and efficient resource allocation.</p>
<p>To act on the guidance of the Fourth Plenary Session and the Central Economic Work Conference, Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) introduces new measures to facilitate follow-on offering in line with its core tasks of preventing risks, enhancing regulation, and promoting high-quality development. These measures aim to make follow-on offering more flexible and easy, thereby boosting innovation and fostering new quality productive forces. The measures are centered around the following principles:&nbsp;<span>First</span>, taking measures specific to meeting targets and addressing problems, focusing on issues that undermine the effects of follow-on offering and are widely raised by stakeholders, optimizing follow-on offering mechanisms, and further improving the quality and efficiency of follow-on offering reviews.&nbsp;<span>Second</span>, prioritizing support for high-quality and innovative companies, enhancing policy support for high-quality listed companies in follow-on offering, and guiding market resources to areas of new quality productive forces.&nbsp;<span>Third</span>, adopting a holistic approach, placing risk prevention and enhanced regulation at the forefront, and striving to build a dynamic and orderly market environment.&nbsp;<span>Fourth</span>, maintaining a steady and progressive approach to ensure the smooth and effective implementation of the measures. The specific measures are as follows:</p>
<p><span>First, further support high-quality listed companies in innovation and development.</span>&nbsp;The SSE will optimize the follow-on offering review process and improve efficiency for high-quality listed companies with standardized operation, governance, and information disclosure, as well as high market recognition and representativeness. The principle of selecting the best among the best and prioritizing quality over quantity will be upheld. High-quality listed companies will be supported in using proceeds for developing new industries, business models, and technologies that synergize with their main businesses. Support will also be given to investments in second-growth-engine businesses, but reckless crossover or diversification attempts will be prohibited.</p>
<p><span>Second, better adapt to the follow-on offering needs of high-tech innovative companies.</span>&nbsp;Formulate a "light assets and high R&amp;D investment" criterion for companies listed on the Main Board. Revise the interval requirement between following-on offering activities. For high-tech companies that were loss-making when listing and are still not profitable, if the proceeds raised from the previous offering are substantially used up or if there has been no change in the intended use of the proceeds, they may initiate procedures such as announcing a follow-on offering proposal six months after the funds from the previous offering were received. Listed companies whose stock price has fallen below the issuance price may engage in reasonable fundraising through methods such as competitive-bid private placements and convertible bonds, provided that the raised funds will be used for their main business.</p>
<p><span>Third, make follow-on offering process more flexible and easy.</span>&nbsp;When a listed company discloses a follow-on offering proposal, it should briefly disclose how proceeds from previous offering are used and the plan for remaining funds. At the time of application, the previously raised proceeds should have been substantially used up. Content already disclosed in periodic reports and other documents can be directly referenced in the follow-on offering application materials as long as there has been no change in facts. The negative list for the simplified follow-on offering procedure will be revised.</p>
<p><span>Fourth, strengthen oversight of the entire follow-on offering process.</span>&nbsp;The listed companies and intermediaries shall strictly fulfill their duties as the disclosure obligator and the "gatekeeper". A work mechanism for disclosing follow-on offering proposals on the stock exchange shall be established to rigorously prevent listed companies from seeking follow-on financing amidst unresolved problems. Listed companies shall make timely decisions and promptly submit applications after disclosing their follow-on offering proposals. Requirements for announcing follow-on offering proposals will be adjusted. For fixed-price private placements aimed at obtaining control of a listed company, both the listed company and the target investors are required to make a public commitment to finalize the offering before the approval letter expires. Stricter oversight of raised proceeds will be imposed. Violations such as unauthorized changes to the use of proceeds or unilaterally extend the period for temporarily supplementing working capital will be held accountable. The SSE will intensify both ongoing and ex-post supervision, and take strict actions against any illegal or non-compliant activities in follow-on offering.</p>
<p>Under the guidance of China Securities Regulatory Commission, the SSE will accelerate the rule-making and facilitate exemplary deals, and further improve the flexibility and convenience of follow-on offering, thereby enhancing the market's sense of gain.</p>

<title>Hong Kong Securities And Futures Commission Cautions Against Ramp And Dump Schemes Involving Impersonation Of Stock Commentators</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) urges the public to remain vigilant against investment scams involving fraudsters impersonating well-known stock commentators claiming to offer investment advices that guarantee high returns. In recent cases reported to the SFC, scammers lured victims, through social media platforms and instant messaging apps, into participating in ramp and dump schemes &ndash; a form of stock market manipulation.</p>
<p>In a typical ramp and dump scheme, fraudsters aggressively promote and &ldquo;ramp&rdquo; up the price of small-cap or less liquid stocks, often presenting themselves as reputable market experts. They may offer so-called &ldquo;inside information&rdquo; or investment tips, encouraging investors to buy the shares at artificially inflated prices. Once the price is ramped up, the fraudsters then quickly &ldquo;dump&rdquo; their holdings, selling at an elevated price and leaving the victim investors exposed to significant losses as the share price collapses. There are also cases where victims were lured into trading on fraudulent platforms or apps, on which investors reported difficulties with asset withdrawal. &nbsp;</p>
<p>On some occasions, the fraudsters approached the victims after they suffered losses, claiming that &ldquo;compensation&rdquo; may be arranged upon payment of additional &ldquo;deposits&rdquo; or &ldquo;handling fees&rdquo;. When the victims had transferred funds into the designated accounts, the fraudsters broke off contact with the victims.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of the time, investors do not know the true identities of the people who urge them to buy the stock or the reliability of the information they provide. Scammers may use fake social media profiles, counterfeit documents, or impersonate trusted commentators to gain credibility.</p>
<p>The SFC has reported these cases to the Police, and will continue to join forces with other law enforcement agencies to crack down on investment scams.</p>
<p><span>The SFC strongly advises the investing public to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Be especially wary of offers that seem &ldquo;too good to be true&rdquo; on social media or messaging apps.</li>
<li>Exercise extreme caution against unsolicited investment advice, especially an online &ldquo;friend&rdquo; asks you to send a screenshot of your trading record.</li>
<li>Use only official company payment channels and always verify the recipients&rsquo; identities by confirming their details through trusted sources. Avoid depositing funds to individual bank accounts.</li>
<li>Report any suspicious investment activity, impersonation, or ramp and dump schemes to the SFC or the Police immediately.</li>
</ul>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE:ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today announced the launch of Cryptocurrency futures contracts based on seven CoinDesk Indices including CoinDesk 20 and CoinDesk 5 Indices. The contracts include:</p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li>ICE CoinDesk 20 Index Futures</li>
<li>ICE CoinDesk 5 Index Futures</li>
<li>ICE CoinDesk Bitcoin Futures</li>
<li>ICE CoinDesk Ether Futures</li>
<li>ICE CoinDesk Solana Futures</li>
<li>ICE CoinDesk XRP Futures</li>
<li>ICE CoinDesk BNB Futures</li>
</ul>
<p>The CoinDesk indexed contracts are U.S. dollar denominated and cash-settled. Over $40 billion in assets under management are tied to CoinDesk Indices tracking the price of cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ether and Solana.</p>
<p>The flagship CoinDesk 20 Index tracks the performance of digital assets, including Bitcoin, BNB, Ethereum and Solana using a capped market capitalization-weighted methodology to ensure broad exposure and diversification benefits across all constituents. Over 90% of the digital asset market is captured by the CoinDesk 20 Index and the total volume of linked products is worth over $16 billion. The CoinDesk 5 Index is market capitalization-weighted and tracks the performance of the five largest constituents of the CoinDesk 20.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The digital asset space is evolving rapidly, and we are excited to collaborate with CoinDesk to launch these new futures contracts,&rdquo; said Jennifer Ilkiw, President of ICE Futures U.S. &ldquo;The launch expands ICE&rsquo;s existing relationship with CoinDesk and will bring further transparency to the digital asset market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;CoinDesk Indices were built to serve as trusted benchmarks for the digital asset sector, and this launch with ICE advances that mission into regulated futures markets,&rdquo; said David LaValle, President of CoinDesk Data and Indices. &ldquo;The partnership expands the reach of our benchmarks while offering market participants familiar, transparent, and reliable ways to engage with digital assets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, ICE plans to launch One Month CoinDesk Overnight Rates (CDOR) USDC futures based on CoinDesk&rsquo;s Overnight Rate, subject to regulatory review. CDOR rates are daily benchmarks that reflect the annualized effective interest rate paid by borrowers in decentralized finance markets and are structurally similar to traditional overnight rates like SOFR or &euro;STR.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>Highlights</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Product Expansion Fueled Strong Momentum in 2025 as Robinhood Grew Across Strategic Priorities</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>#1 Platform for Active Traders</strong>&nbsp;- Robinhood accelerated momentum with active traders as it expanded product offerings, led by Prediction Markets, with over 12 billion event contracts traded in 2025. Deepening its investment in Prediction Markets, Robinhood established a joint venture,&nbsp;Rothera, LLC&nbsp;("Rothera"), in partnership with&nbsp;Susquehanna International Group, that acquired MIAXdx in&nbsp;January 2026&nbsp;to advance the build out of an independent, CFTC-licensed exchange and clearinghouse. In December, the Company also hosted Robinhood Presents: YES/NO, announcing new features for the Prediction Markets Hub - such as preset and custom combos and player contracts - and expanded Robinhood Cortex capabilities, including the next generation of its AI-powered investing assistant and portfolio-level Digests. In addition, the Company began rolling out short selling in mid-November, which has already seen billions of notional volume traded by customers.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>#1 in Wallet Share for the&nbsp;Next Generation</strong>&nbsp;- Robinhood drove greater share of wallet across long-term investing by deepening customer adoption of the Company&rsquo;s retirement, advisory and banking offerings. This quarter, Robinhood Gold Subscribers grew to 4.2&nbsp;million, with the adoption rate exceeding 15%, reflecting strong demand for premium features and differentiated benefits. Additionally, Robinhood Retirement AUC more than doubled from a year ago to&nbsp;$26.5&nbsp;billion across approximately 1.8 million funded accounts. To date, customers have received over&nbsp;$500 million&nbsp;in matches on retirement account transfers and contributions. Robinhood Strategies expanded its reach to over 200 thousand Funded Customers and&nbsp;$1.3 billion&nbsp;in assets under management. Robinhood Banking also recently started rolling out to Robinhood Gold Subscribers, with over 20 thousand customers depositing approximately&nbsp;$300 million&nbsp;as of&nbsp;January 31, 2026.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>#1 Global Financial Ecosystem&nbsp;</strong>- Robinhood extended its push for global financial innovation with continued expansion into new markets and new international products. Robinhood strengthened its offering in the&nbsp;UK&nbsp;by launching a stocks and shares ISA, the most requested feature from&nbsp;UK&nbsp;customers, supporting long-term, tax-advantaged investing. Bitstamp institutional volumes continue to scale, more than doubling since the close of the acquisition in&nbsp;June 2025, and in&nbsp;Europe, Robinhood quadrupled its Stock Tokens offering to approximately 2,000. During the fourth quarter, Robinhood also announced agreements to acquire a brokerage and crypto firm in&nbsp;Indonesia, expanding its reach in&nbsp;Asia.</p>

Mr. Warnick&nbsp;is now serving as a strategic advisor until his retirement on&nbsp;September 1, 2026.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Conference Call and Livestream Information</strong></p>
<p align="justify">Robinhood will host a video call to discuss its results at&nbsp;2 p.m. PT&nbsp;/&nbsp;5 p.m. ET&nbsp;today,&nbsp;February&nbsp;10, 2026. The video call can be accessed at&nbsp;<a href="http://investors.robinhood.com/">investors.robinhood.com</a>, along with the earnings press release and accompanying slide presentation. The event will also be live streamed to YouTube and&nbsp;<a href="http://x.com/">X.com</a>&nbsp;via Robinhood&rsquo;s official channels, @RobinhoodApp, on Vlad Tenev&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="http://x.com/">X.com</a>&nbsp;account, @vladtenev, as well as in the Robinhood App. Following the call, a replay and transcript will also be available at&nbsp;<a href="http://investors.robinhood.com/">investors.robinhood.com</a>.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Financial Outlook</strong></p>
<p align="justify">The paragraph below provides information on our 2026 expense plan and outlook. We are not providing a 2026 outlook for total operating expenses and have not reconciled our 2026 outlook for Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, total operating expenses, because we are unable to predict with reasonable certainty the impact of certain items without unreasonable effort. These items include, but are not limited to, provision for credit losses and significant regulatory expenses which may be material and could have a significant impact on total operating expenses for 2026.</p>
<p align="justify">Our 2026 expense plan is designed to accelerate product velocity, drive Net Deposit growth, and grow revenues. This expense outlook includes growth investments in new or recently launched products and features, marketing, international expansion, full year costs related to the 2025 acquisitions of TradePMR and Bitstamp, and rapid growth in existing core products; while also driving rapid growth in existing core products and productivity and efficiency gains in our existing businesses. Our outlook for 2026 Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC is&nbsp;$2.6 billion&nbsp;to&nbsp;$2.725 billion, which represents 18% year-over-year growth at the midpoint relative to 2025 Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC. This expense outlook does not include provision for credit losses, costs related to our pending acquisitions, costs related to the Rothera joint venture, costs from modifications of executive awards in connection with our CFO transition, potential significant regulatory matters, or other significant expenses (such as impairments, restructuring charges, and other business acquisition- or disposition-related expenses) that may arise or accruals we may determine in the future are required, as we are unable to accurately predict the size or timing of such matters, expenses or accruals at this time.</p>
<p align="justify">Actual results might differ materially from our outlook due to several factors, including the rate of growth in Funded Customers and our effectiveness to cross-sell products which affects variable marketing costs, the degree to which we are successful in managing credit losses and preventing fraud, and our ability to manage web-hosting expenses efficiently, among other factors. See &ldquo;Non-GAAP Financial Measures&rdquo; for more information on Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC, including significant items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing expenses that would be adjusted out of total operating expenses (GAAP) to get to Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC (non-GAAP) should they occur.</p>

Factors that contribute to the uncertain nature of our forward-looking statements include, among others: our rapid and continuing expansion, including continuing to introduce new products and services on our platforms as well as geographic expansion; the difficulty of managing our business effectively, including the size of our workforce, and the risk of declining or negative growth; the fluctuations in our financial results and key metrics from quarter to quarter; our reliance on transaction-based revenue, including payment for order flow (&ldquo;PFOF&rdquo;), the risk of new regulation or bans on PFOF and similar practices, and the addition of our new fee-based model for cryptocurrency; our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and rapidly changing interest rate environments; the difficulty of raising additional capital (to provide liquidity needs and support business growth and objectives) on reasonable terms, if at all; the need to maintain capital levels required by regulators and self-regulatory organizations ("SROs"); the risk that we might mishandle the cash, securities, and cryptocurrencies we hold on behalf of customers, and our exposure to liability for processing, operational, or technical errors in clearing functions; the impact of negative publicity on our brand and reputation; the risk that changes in business, economic, or political conditions that impact the global financial markets, or a systemic market event, might harm our business; our dependence on key employees and a skilled workforce; the fact that we do not wholly own or operationally control Rothera, our joint venture with&nbsp;Susquehanna International Group, and its subsidiaries; operational and regulatory risks and expenditures prior to and following closing of our acquisitions and investments; the difficulty of complying with an extensive, complex, and changing regulatory environment, the risk of monetary and other penalties for noncompliance, and the need to adjust our business model in response to new or modified laws and regulations; the possibility of adverse developments in pending litigation and regulatory investigations; the risk that the outcome of currently ongoing and potential future regulatory enforcement actions and litigation, as well as potential changes in federal or state law, could immediately or subsequently prevent us from offering, or continuing to offer, event contracts; the effects of competition; our need to innovate and acquire or invest in new products, services, technologies and geographies in order to attract and retain customers and deepen their engagement with us in order to maintain growth; our reliance on third parties to perform some key functions and the risk that processing, operational or technological failures could impair the availability or stability of our platforms; the risk of cybersecurity incidents, theft, data breaches, and other online attacks; the difficulty of processing customer data in compliance with privacy laws; our need as a regulated financial services company to develop and maintain effective compliance and risk management infrastructures; the risks associated with incorporating artificial intelligence ("AI") technologies into some of our products and processes; the regulation, litigation, contractual, operational, and reputational risks associated with our introduction of products such as Robinhood Stock Tokens in the European Economic Area (the "EEA") and our staking services offered in the&nbsp;U.S.; and the risk that substantial future sales of Class A common stock in the public market, or the perception that they may occur, could cause the price of our stock to fall. Because some of these risks and uncertainties cannot be predicted or quantified and some are beyond our control, you should not rely on our forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. More information about potential risks and uncertainties that could affect our business and financial results can be found in Part II, Item 1A of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended&nbsp;September 30, 2025, as well as in our other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (&ldquo;SEC&rdquo;), all of which are available on the SEC&rsquo;s web site at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sec.gov/">www.sec.gov</a>. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment; new risks and uncertainties may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all risks nor identify all uncertainties. The events and circumstances reflected in our forward-looking statements might not be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Except as otherwise noted, all forward-looking statements in this press release are made as of the date of this press release,&nbsp;February 10, 2026, and are based on information and estimates available to us at this time. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, performance, or achievements. Except as required by law, Robinhood assumes no obligation to update any of the statements in this press release whether as a result of any new information, future events, changed circumstances, or otherwise. You should read this press release with the understanding that our actual future results, performance, events, and circumstances might be materially different from what we expect. All fourth quarter and full year 2025 financial information in this press release is preliminary, based on our estimates and subject to completion of our financial closing procedures. Final results for the full year, which will be reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended&nbsp;December 31, 2025, may vary from the information in this press release. In particular, until our financial statements are issued in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, we may be required to recognize certain subsequent events (such as in connection with contingencies or the realization of assets) which could affect our final results.</p>
<p align="justify">The Select Preliminary&nbsp;January 2026&nbsp;Operating Data in this press release is unaudited and preliminary, based on Robinhood&rsquo;s estimates, and subject to completion of financial closing procedures. Final operating data for&nbsp;January 2026&nbsp;and results for the first quarter of 2026, as reported in our upcoming monthly metrics release and in Robinhood&rsquo;s quarterly and annual filings with the&nbsp;SEC, respectively, might vary from the information in this press release.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Non-GAAP Financial Measures</strong></p>
<p align="justify">We collect and analyze operating and financial data to evaluate the health of our business, allocate our resources and assess our performance. In addition to total net revenues, net income, and other results under GAAP, we utilize non-GAAP calculations of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (&ldquo;Adjusted EBITDA&rdquo;), Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Operating Expenses, and Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC. This non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. We believe each of these non-GAAP measures provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations, as well as providing a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business performance and cost structure, as applicable. These non-GAAP measures are used by our management internally to make operating decisions, including those related to operating expenses, evaluate performance, and perform strategic planning and annual budgeting. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are provided in the financial tables included in this press release.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Adjusted EBITDA</em></p>
<p align="justify">Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income, excluding (i) interest expenses related to credit facilities, (ii) provision for (benefit from) income taxes, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) SBC, (v) significant legal and tax settlements and reserves, and (vi) other significant gains, losses, and expenses (such as impairments, restructuring charges, and business acquisition- or disposition-related expenses) that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing results.</p>
<p align="justify">The above items are excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA measure because these items are non-cash in nature, or because the amount and timing of these items are unpredictable, are not driven by core results of operations, and render comparisons with prior periods and competitors less meaningful. Adjusted EBITDA is a key measurement used by our management internally to make operating decisions, including those related to operating expenses, evaluate performance, and perform strategic planning and annual budgeting.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Adjusted EBITDA Margin</em></p>
<p align="justify">Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by total net revenues. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is net margin (calculated as net income divided by total net revenues).</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Adjusted Operating Expenses</em></p>
<p align="justify">Adjusted Operating Expenses is defined as GAAP total operating expenses minus (i) SBC, (ii) provision for credit losses, (iii) significant legal and tax settlements and reserves, and (iv) other significant expenses (such as impairments, restructuring charges, and business acquisition- or disposition-related expenses) that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing expenses. The amount and timing of the excluded items are unpredictable, are not driven by core results of operations, and render comparisons with prior periods less meaningful. Starting in Q1 2025, Adjusted Operating Expenses no longer includes provision for credit losses.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC</em></p>
<p align="justify">Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC is defined as GAAP total operating expenses minus (i) provision for credit losses, (ii) significant legal and tax settlements and reserves, and (iii) other significant expenses (such as impairments, restructuring charges, and business acquisition- or disposition-related expenses), that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing expenses. The amount and timing of the excluded items are unpredictable, are not driven by core results of operations, and render comparisons with prior periods less meaningful. Unlike Adjusted Operating Expenses, Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC does not adjust for SBC except for in 2026 as it relates to modification of executive awards related to our CFO transition. Starting in Q1 2025, Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC no longer includes provision for credit losses.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Q4 2024 Tax Benefit and Regulatory Accrual Reversal</em></p>
<p align="justify">In Q4 2024, the Company recorded a&nbsp;$369 million&nbsp;deferred tax benefit ($0.41&nbsp;of diluted EPS), primarily from the release of the Company's valuation allowance on most of its net deferred tax assets, as well as a&nbsp;$55 million&nbsp;benefit ($0.06&nbsp;of diluted EPS) due to a reversal of an accrual as part of a regulatory settlement. Together, these items represented a&nbsp;$424 million&nbsp;benefit ($0.47&nbsp;of diluted EPS) in Q4 2024.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Key Performance Metrics</strong></p>
<p align="justify">In addition to the measures presented in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, we use the following key performance metrics to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Funded Customers</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define a Funded Customer as a unique person who has at least one account with a Robinhood entity and, within the past 45 calendar days (a) had an account balance that was greater than zero (excluding amounts that are deposited into a Funded Customer account by the Company with no action taken by the unique person) or (b) completed a transaction using any such account. Individuals who share a funded joint investing account (which launched in&nbsp;July 2024) are each considered to be a Funded Customer. Starting in Q1 2025, individuals who are customers of Registered Investment Advisors ("RIAs") that use the TradePMR platform, and, starting in&nbsp;June 2025, customers of Bitstamp, are also considered Funded Customers.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Total Platform Assets</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define Total Platform Assets as the sum of the fair value of all equities, options, cryptocurrency, futures (including options on futures and swaps, including event contracts), cash held by users in their accounts, net of receivables from users (previously reported as Assets Under Custody), and any such assets managed by RIAs using TradePMR&rsquo;s platform that are not custodied by Robinhood, as of a stated date or period end on a trade date basis. Net Deposits and net market gains (losses) drive the change in Total Platform Assets in any given period. Starting in&nbsp;June 2025, the fair value of all cryptocurrency includes cryptocurrency on Bitstamp.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Assets Under Custody</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define Assets Under Custody as Total Platform Assets, excluding assets managed by RIAs using TradePMR's platform that are not custodied by Robinhood, as of a stated date or period end on a trade date basis.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Net Deposits</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define Net Deposits as all cash deposits and asset transfers from customers, as well as dividends, interest, staking rewards, and cash or assets earned in connection with Company promotions (such as account transfer and retirement match incentives, free stock bonuses) received by customers, net of reversals, customer cash withdrawals, margin and lending interest, Robinhood Gold subscription fees, and assets transferred off of our platforms for a stated period. Starting in&nbsp;June 2025, Net Deposits include results from Bitstamp. Due to data limitations, we have not included TradePMR client figures in our Net Deposits key performance metric.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Average Revenue Per User (&ldquo;ARPU&rdquo;)</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define ARPU as total revenue for a given period divided by the average number of Funded Customers on the last day of that period and the last day of the immediately preceding period. Figures in this press release represent ARPU annualized for each three-month period presented.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Robinhood Gold Subscribers</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define a Robinhood Gold Subscriber as a unique person who has at least one account with a Robinhood entity and who, as of the end of the relevant period (a) is subscribed to Robinhood Gold and (b) has made at least one Robinhood Gold subscription fee payment.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Additional Operating Metrics</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><em>Robinhood Retirement AUC</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define Robinhood Retirement AUC as the total Assets Under Custody in traditional individual retirement accounts (&ldquo;IRAs") and&nbsp;
Roth IRAs. This does not include accounts with an RIA using TradePMR&rsquo;s platform.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Cash Sweep</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define Cash Sweep as the period-end total amount of participating users&rsquo; uninvested brokerage and banking cash that has been automatically &ldquo;swept&rdquo; or moved from their accounts into deposits for their benefit at a network of program banks. This is an off-balance-sheet amount. Robinhood earns a net interest spread on Cash Sweep balances based on the interest rate offered by the banks less the interest rate given to users as stated in our program terms. This includes balances from customers of RIAs using TradePMR&rsquo;s platform.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Margin Book</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define Margin Book as our period-end aggregate outstanding margin loan balances receivable (i.e., the period-end total amount we are owed by customers on loans made for the purchase of securities, supported by a pledge of assets in their margin-enabled brokerage accounts). This includes margin loan balances from customers of RIAs using TradePMR&rsquo;s platform.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Notional Trading Volume</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define Notional Trading Volume, or Notional Volume, for any specified asset class as the aggregate dollar value (purchase price or sale price as applicable) of trades executed in that asset class on our platforms over a specified period of time. Crypto Notional Volume includes both Robinhood App Notional Volume and, starting in&nbsp;June 2025, Bitstamp Notional Volume. Robinhood App Notional Volume represents the dollar value of executed crypto trades on the Robinhood platform over a specified period of time. Bitstamp Notional Volume represents the dollar value of executed crypto trades on the Bitstamp platform over a specified period of time. For example, each&nbsp;$1&nbsp;of transaction value executed between a buyer and seller is counted as&nbsp;$1&nbsp;of transaction value in the relevant period, rather than&nbsp;$2&nbsp;if counted for each of the buyer and seller.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Options Contracts Traded</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define Options Contracts Traded as the total number of options contracts bought or sold over a specified period of time. Each contract generally entitles the holder to trade 100 shares of the underlying stock.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Event Contracts Traded</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define Event Contracts Traded as the total number of event contracts bought or sold over a specified period of time through our Prediction Markets Hub. Each contract can be traded at&nbsp;$0.01&nbsp;increments up to&nbsp;$1&nbsp;and is worth&nbsp;$1&nbsp;upon settlement.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Glossary Terms</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><em>Investment Accounts</em><br /><br />We define an Investment Account as a funded individual brokerage account, a funded joint investing account, a funded IRA, or an account with an RIA using TradePMR&rsquo;s platform. Starting in&nbsp;September 2025, a Funded Customer can have multiple Investment Accounts - one or more individual brokerage accounts, a joint investing account, a traditional IRA, a Roth IRA, and/or an RIA custody account using TradePMR&rsquo;s platform. Investment Accounts do not include Bitstamp as such accounts are not brokerage or other Investment Accounts.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Robinhood Gold Adoption Rate</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define the Robinhood Gold adoption rate as end of period Robinhood Gold Subscribers divided by end of period Funded Customers.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Growth Rate and Annualized Growth Rate with respect to Net Deposits</em></p>
<p align="justify">Growth rate is calculated as aggregate Net Deposits over a specified 12-month period, divided by Total Platform Assets for the fiscal quarter that immediately precedes such 12-month period. Annualized growth rate is calculated as Net Deposits for a specified quarter multiplied by 4 and divided by Total Platform Assets for the immediately preceding quarter.</p>

<title>SIFMA Statement On The Financial Stability Oversight Council Improvement Act Of 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>SIFMA today issued the following statement from president and CEO Kenneth E. Bentsen, Jr. on H.R. 3682, the Financial Stability Oversight Council Improvement Act of 2025, which will be considered on the House floor later today:</p>
<p>&ldquo;SIFMA supports passage of H.R. 3682, the Financial Stability Oversight Council Improvement Act of 2025, sponsored by Rep. Bill Foster (D-IL) and Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-MI). Congress charged the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) with identifying and addressing risks to U.S. financial stability, but over time the Council&rsquo;s varying approaches to designating nonbank financial companies as systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) have created uncertainty in the markets. H.R. 3682 would provide needed clarity and consistency by establishing clear statutory guardrails for FSOC&rsquo;s process and ensuring that SIFI designations are used only as a last resort. SIFMA urges Congress to advance this bipartisan legislation to promote stability and predictability in FSOC&rsquo;s oversight of nonbank financial companies.&rdquo;</p>

<title>ISDA derivatiViews: Maintaining Focus On Basel III Endgame Recalibration</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-derivativiews-maintaining-focus-on-basel-iii-endgame-recalibration-2026210/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-derivativiews-maintaining-focus-on-basel-iii-endgame-recalibration-2026210/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In its original form, the US Basel III endgame proposal would have resulted in disproportionate increases in capital for trading book activities, forcing banks to make difficult choices about their participation in certain businesses. After two-and-a-half years, a revised proposal is expected to be published soon, paving the way towards finalization and implementation of the rules. At ISDA, we&rsquo;ve advocated relentlessly for calibration changes to achieve a robust, more risk-sensitive framework, and we hope this will be a turning point effectively balances the need for safety and soundness with market vibrancy.</p>
<p>ISDA&rsquo;s commitment to risk-appropriate capital rules isn&rsquo;t confined to the US &ndash; it&rsquo;s critical in every jurisdiction around the world. If capital requirements are disproportionate to the underlying risk, companies and governments that rely on banks for financing would face reduced support, as well as a lack of hedging solutions and increased vulnerability to external shocks. In turn, this would undermine economic growth and stability &ndash; outcomes we can&rsquo;t afford to risk. To avoid this happening in the US, changes need to be made in certain key areas.</p>
<p>First, we need to ensure internal models have a viable future for the calculation of market risk capital. While the Basel III market risk framework &ndash; the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB) &ndash; deliberately raises the bar for the use of internal models, the proposed rules are so complex and operationally challenging that they threaten to choke off the use of internal models altogether. This would be a major change that we don&rsquo;t think is in line with the Basel Committee&rsquo;s intentions. We&rsquo;ve proposed certain adjustments, including reducing the stringency of the profit-and-loss attribution test and addressing long-standing issues in the treatment of non-modellable risk factors, which would ensure the continued viability of internal models under the FRTB.</p>
<p>Second, we believe the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk should be amended to recognize the risk-reducing benefits of netting across products, including repos and futures. With mandatory clearing of certain cash US Treasury securities set to begin at the end of this year, and repos following in the middle of next year, the lack of recognition of cross-product netting would constrain banks&rsquo; balance sheets and limit their ability to offer client clearing. This issue must be addressed to enable the smooth implementation of the Treasury clearing rule.</p>
<p>Third, the combined effect of the proposed Basel III endgame and the capital surcharge for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) would increase capital for US G-SIB client clearing businesses by more than 80%. That&rsquo;s completely at odds with the policy objective to promote and incentivize clearing and would negatively affect market stability. By including the client-facing leg of a cleared derivatives transaction in the Basel III credit valuation adjustment framework and adjusting the G-SIB surcharge, policymakers can reduce this disproportionate tax on clearing.</p>
<p>These are just three of the important issues we&rsquo;ve been focusing on as US policymakers have weighed up industry feedback and redrafted the original endgame proposal. Once the revisions are published, focus will shift to finalization and implementation of the rules. We&rsquo;ll test the recalibrated framework to make sure it delivers the risk sensitivity that is so crucial. We&rsquo;ll then work with our members to address any challenges on the road to implementation and pursue the end result that is needed &ndash; a robust, risk-sensitive trading book capital framework that stands the test of time.</p>

<title>The Bermuda Stock Exchange Reports 2025 Listing Results - Strengthens Position As Leading Exchange For Global ILS As Number Of Listings Increases 34%</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Bermuda Stock Exchange (BSX), a wholly owned subsidiary of Miami International Holding, Inc. (NYSE: MIAX), today reported its 2025 year-end results, highlighting a record year for insurance-linked securities (ILS) listings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>BSX reported 209 new ILS listings in 2025, a 34.0% increase from 2024, bringing its total number of listings to 746 and accounting for 93.2% of global ILS issuances in 2025. The growth reflects the depth and resilience of Bermuda's regulatory framework and BSX&rsquo;s deliberate commercial strategy designed to support sophisticated risk-transfer products.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2025, BSX continued to attract catastrophe bond listings from global issuers covering climate-related risks across Europe, Asia and the Americas while also listing new cyber catastrophe bonds, reflecting the growing importance of this emerging asset class. Together, these vehicles enable the global insurance and reinsurance industry to deploy capital efficiently, innovate responsibly, and address the challenge of narrowing the world's insurance protection gap.</p>
<p>2025 also marked a major technology advancement for BSX with the March launch of a new, state-of-theart trading, clearing, settlement, and depository platform built on MIAX&rsquo;s proprietary technology. The fullyintegrated system enables BSX to respond to evolving market demand, expand the range of products it can offer customers, and align with MIAX&rsquo;s strategy to operate all its exchanges on its proprietary technology.</p>
<p>"BSX has led the way in listing ILS vehicles for more than a decade, and we are proud to have not only maintained but strengthened our leadership position in 2025," said Greg Wojciechowski, President and Chief Executive Officer of BSX. "Our strong results and technology launch in 2025 demonstrate our capacity to innovate while supporting global reinsurance needs. Our ongoing success is driven by well-established expertise in securities listings paired with an efficient listing process, all within a jurisdiction engineered for insurance innovation."&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>&nbsp;Nasdaq (Nasdaq: NDAQ) today announced the launch of the Nasdaq Private Capital&trade; Indexes, a new suite of benchmarks designed to deliver transparency, representativeness, and robustness to private markets. Built to help institutional investors and consultants benchmark performance, analyze exposures, and navigate private capital markets with precision, the indexes introduce rules‑based rigor and consistent measurement to segments that have historically lacked reliable, objective standards.</p>
<p>The launch of the index suite marks the next phase in the evolution of Nasdaq Private Capital Solutions, designed to deliver transparent benchmarking, institutional‑quality data, and robust analytics to help investors navigate an increasingly complex private markets landscape. Drawing on decades of private market expertise, the solutions‑based platform unifies Nasdaq Private Capital Indexes, Nasdaq eVestment Fund and Deal Benchmarking, the Nasdaq eVestment Private Fund Universe and the Nasdaq eVestment TopQ+ Analytics platform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Private markets are at a pivotal moment, growing rapidly in both importance and complexity. Yet the ecosystem remains highly fragmented, with data trapped in silos, inconsistent benchmarks, and limited interoperability,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Oliver Albers</span>, Executive Vice President and Chief Product Officer, Capital Access Platforms at Nasdaq. &ldquo;The Nasdaq Private Capital&trade; Indexes change that. Built on LP‑reported fund performance, they give institutions a comprehensive and representative view of private markets. By combining this trusted data foundation with transparent methodologies and workflow‑ready tools, we&rsquo;re providing the clarity and connectivity investors need to navigate private markets with confidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Constructed from more than 14,000 institutional private market funds that represent over&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$11.4 trillion</span>&nbsp;in global AUM sourced from Nasdaq eVestment&rsquo;s LP reported dataset, the Nasdaq Private Capital&trade; Indexes are designed to deliver robust and transparent coverage. The indexes employ a documented, rules‑based methodology featuring Modified Dietz quarterly performance measurement, NAV‑weighted aggregation, and a standardized two‑quarter restatement process designed to align with institutional governance expectations. The suite spans aggregate private capital as well as private equity, buyout, venture capital, private debt, fund of funds and real estate strategies.</p>

<div>
<p class="p--heading-1">Ahead of Eurex's Derivatives Forum in Frankfurt, taking place on 25 and 26 February, we spoke to Ladi Williams, Head of Thematics and Alternative Strategies Product Management at STOXX, to discuss the latest trends in thematic indexes and the future shape of innovation.</p>
</div>

<div class="dbx-row">
<div class="dbx-col-sm-12 dbx-col-md-12 dbx-col-xl-10">
<div>
<p class="p--heading-3">As an index provider, how do you approach index construction for a task as broad and far-reaching as thematic indexes?</p>
<p><strong>Ladi Williams:</strong>&nbsp;Our STOXX thematic framework allows us to capture themes in a systematic and transparent way. Our approach recognizes four different phases in how a theme permeates through society and is based on the diffusion of innovation theory. Those comprise ideation, innovation, commercialization and maturity.</p>
<p>The various themes that we cover can be at different stages of progress. That means we adapt the data set or group of indicators we use to effectively capture companies in the index.</p>
<p>In the ideation stage, companies are mainly talking about their technology. They haven't actually started any significant product development. When they move away from the ideation stage to the innovation stage is when we might see activity such as intellectual property creation. This is when companies start filing patents and we really begin to see some significant progress.</p>
<p>Once those patterns are being used in the R&amp;D stage, it translates into products and services that you can commercialize. That's when you start to see these companies generate revenues and become well established &ndash; demonstrating the sort of trends which can be traditionally captured through sector investing.</p>
<p class="p--heading-3">Once a theme grows to become significant to the broader economy, how do you capture its nuances?</p>
<p>You can address themes by looking at different parts of the value chain. AI is a good example. There are different areas in the AI value chain, and we target those with different indexes. For some other themes though, it might make sense to only launch one index.</p>
<p>As well as the method of targeting multiple sub-themes and launching an index family from those, we are seeing greater specialization in the index itself. Over the years, thematic indices have shifted away from having 150-plus constituents to being more targeted in their exposure. We are seeing a lot of demand for those more specialized indexes from our end clients.</p>
<p class="p--heading-3">Given the level of awareness of some of these themes, such as AI, how do you differentiate your product against other index providers?</p>
<p>At STOXX, we prioritize a collaborative approach and don't work in a silo. That means engaging with clients throughout the process and taking their feedback on board continuously.</p>
<p>There are then many ways in which you can differentiate on product. As an index provider you must decide whether to focus on a specific segment of the market, or to look across the whole supply and value chain.</p>
<p>The way that we look at AI, for instance, is that you have the &lsquo;picks and shovels&rsquo; companies that are responsible for building the required infrastructure. Then, on the other side of the value chain, you have companies that are leveraging AI technology or pursuing value integration. They are AI adopters and could include companies that are using AI in healthcare, finance or mobility. We have AI indexes that target those two different areas. We also use a complementary approach, which looks at both.</p>
<p>For the theme of defense, we can distinguish on a regional basis. For example, designing a global defense product or a European one, which was a very popular theme in 2025. Drilling further down, differentiation can be achieved by screens, weighting approaches right down to security level caps and counts.</p>
<p class="p--heading-3">How do you see client demand for these products evolving in the coming years?</p>
<p>We see thematic indexes being used by a variety of client segments. You have ETF issuers that will use thematic indexes as the investment strategy for their fund. We also work with sell-side institutions that take thematic indexes and wrap them into structured products that have different types of payoffs and where they can embed some principal protection.</p>
<p>That shows the level of variation on the product side. Beyond special screens and overlays, and flexible methodologies, a big part of customization and how you differentiate as a provider is data.</p>
<p>AI is going to start opening a lot of doors and allow us to create and scale more data sets that we will be able to incorporate into rules-based, systematic and transparent indexes. Only a few years ago, if you wanted to use earnings calls transcripts, or text from company websites or filings, it was very difficult to do that manually.</p>
<p>Now, AI tools can scrape these various data points and create data sets from this information. We can then embed those in index strategies. It allows you to push the envelope for what was previously the remit of an active equity analyst doing a lot of research. That is an area where we are going to be seeing a lot more innovation.</p>
<p class="p--heading-1"><br />Visit the panel at Derivatives Forum Frankfurt on 25 February from 15:05-15:50 CET</p>
<p class="p--heading-3">Europe's Defense, AI &amp; Quantum Computing &ndash; Forces Shaping Markets</p>
<p>This session explores three of 2025's most influential thematic trends: European defense, artificial intelligence (AI), and the emerging role of quantum computing. Defense spending and AI have already delivered exceptional performance, driven by structural shifts and transformative innovation. Quantum computing, while still early-stage, is increasingly seen as a strategic enabler &ndash;&nbsp;without requiring a complete overhaul of existing systems. The discussion shall highlight strategies, valuation frameworks, and long-term growth drivers for these themes.</p>
<p><strong>How is European defense investment impacting European markets?</strong></p>
<ul class="rte--list">
<li>Is there an AI bubble and how are valuations likely to evolve in 2026 and beyond?</li>
<li>How are firms thinking about capital allocations in 2026 considering the key trends?</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>HM Treasury hosted representatives from U.S. Treasury and regulatory agencies in London on January 26, 2026, to conduct joint senior-level industry engagement for the Transatlantic Taskforce for Markets of the Future established last September.  The discussions explored opportunities to improve links between our capital markets and to collaborate on digital assets.</p>
<p>This engagement is part of the Taskforce&rsquo;s efforts to seek input from industry partners to ensure that its work is informed by what matters most to industry on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
<p>We thank all participants for the dynamic discussions and insights.</p>
<p>In September 2025, as part of President Trump&rsquo;s state visit to the UK, Secretary of the Treasury, Scott Bessent, and Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves, established the Taskforce to enhance the deep and historic connection between the world&rsquo;s leading financial hubs in the UK and the United States.</p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury and HM Treasury will continue to work closely together with additional joint engagements in the United States anticipated this month. The Taskforce aims to report back to both finance ministries on its recommendations via the UK-U.S. Financial Regulatory Working Group in summer 2026.</p>

<p align="left"><span>Use of&nbsp;</span><span>Non-GAAP</span><span>&nbsp;Financial Measures</span></p>
<p align="left">In this news release, the company supplements its reporting of information determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (&ldquo;GAAP&rdquo;), such as revenue, operating income, operating margin, net income attributable to Fiserv, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, with &ldquo;adjusted revenue,&rdquo; &ldquo;adjusted revenue growth,&rdquo; &ldquo;organic revenue,&rdquo; &ldquo;organic revenue growth,&rdquo; &ldquo;adjusted operating income,&rdquo; &ldquo;adjusted operating margin,&rdquo; &ldquo;adjusted net income,&rdquo; &ldquo;adjusted earnings per share,&rdquo; &ldquo;adjusted earnings per share change,&rdquo; and &ldquo;free cash flow.&rdquo; Management believes that adjustments for certain non-cash or other items and the exclusion of certain pass-through revenue and expenses should enhance shareholders&rsquo; ability to evaluate the company&rsquo;s performance, as such measures provide additional insights into the factors and trends affecting its business. Therefore, the company excludes these items from its GAAP financial measures to calculate these unaudited non-GAAP measures. The corresponding reconciliations of these unaudited non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in this news release, except for forward-looking measures where a reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available due to the variability, complexity, and limited visibility of the non-cash and other items described below that are excluded from the non-GAAP outlook measures. See page 15 for additional information regarding the company&rsquo;s forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures.</p>
<p align="left">Examples of non-cash or other items may include, but are not limited to, non-cash intangible asset amortization expense associated with acquisitions; non-cash impairment and terminated pension plan settlement charges; merger and integration costs; severance costs; certain transformation related expenses associated with the company&rsquo;s One Fiserv action plan; gains or losses from the sale of businesses, certain assets or investments; and certain discrete tax benefits and expenses. The company excludes these items to more clearly focus on the factors management believes are pertinent to the company&rsquo;s operations, and management uses this information to make operating decisions, including the allocation of resources to the company&rsquo;s various businesses.</p>
<p align="left">The company adjusts its non-GAAP results to exclude amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets as such amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and/or size of acquisitions. Management believes that the adjustment of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization supplements GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the comparability of operating performance. Although the company excludes amortization from acquisition-related intangible assets from its non-GAAP expenses, management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting and contribute to revenue generation.</p>
<p align="left">Management believes organic revenue growth is useful because it presents revenue growth excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, acquisitions, dispositions and the impact of the company&rsquo;s postage reimbursements. Management believes free cash flow is useful to measure the funds generated in a given period that are available for debt service requirements and strategic capital decisions. Management believes this supplemental information enhances shareholders&rsquo; ability to evaluate and understand the company&rsquo;s core business performance.</p>
<p align="left">These unaudited non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, revenue, operating income, operating margin, net income attributable to Fiserv, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities or any other amount determined in accordance with GAAP.</p>
<p align="left"><span>Forward-Looking</span><span>&nbsp;Statements</span></p>
<p align="left"><em>This news release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding anticipated organic</em><em>&nbsp;revenue growth</em><em>, adjusted earnings per share and other statements regarding our future financial performance.

<ol>
<li>Represents acquisition and related integration costs incurred in connection with acquisitions. Merger and integration costs associated with integration activities in the fourth quarter and full year 2025 include $9 million and $21 million of third-party professional service fees, respectively, as well as $25 million related to legal and other settlements for the full year 2025. Merger and integration costs associated with integration activities for the full year 2024 primarily include $23 million of third-party professional service fees, $22 million of share-based compensation, and $14 million related to a legal settlement.</li>
<li>Represents third-party consulting and professional service fees associated with a multi-year transformation initiative focused on operational excellence enabled by artificial intelligence, including process reengineering and technology infrastructure modernization.</li>
<li>Represents amortization of intangible assets acquired through acquisition, including customer relationships, software/technology and trade names. This adjustment does not exclude the amortization of other intangible assets such as contract costs (sales commissions and deferred conversion costs), capitalized and purchased software, financing costs and debt discounts. See additional information on page 14 for an analysis of the company&rsquo;s amortization expense.</li>
<li>Represents the company&rsquo;s share of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets at its unconsolidated affiliates, as well as the minority interest share of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets at its subsidiaries in which the company holds a controlling financial interest. This adjustment in the fourth quarter and full year 2025 also includes a $51 million gain related to the sale of an equity method investment, recorded within income (loss) from investments in unconsolidated affiliates in the consolidated statements of income.</li>
<li>Represents a non-cash impairment of certain equity method investments during 2024, primarily related to the company&rsquo;s Wells Fargo Merchant Services joint venture, recorded within income (loss) from investments in unconsolidated affiliates in the consolidated statements of income.</li>
<li>Represents a non-cash settlement charge associated with the terminations of the company&rsquo;s defined benefit pension plans in the United Kingdom and United States. Settlements of the terminated plans were completed in the fourth quarter of 2024.</li>
<li>Represents a gain associated with the sale of an equity security in the fourth quarter of 2025, recorded within other expense, net in the consolidated statements of income.</li>
<li>The tax impact of adjustments is calculated using a tax rate of 19.5% and 20% for the full year 2025 and 2024, respectively, which approximates the company&rsquo;s annual effective tax rate, exclusive of actual tax impacts of an aggregate $30 million provision associated with the gain on certain investments during 2025 and an aggregate $196 million benefit associated with the impairment of certain equity method investments and the settlement charge for terminated pension plans during 2024.</li>
<li>Represents incremental compensation expense associated with the transition of the company&rsquo;s Chief Executive Officer (&ldquo;CEO&rdquo;), comprised of $40 million of former CEO non-cash share-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes, and a $12 million cash replacement award paid to the company&rsquo;s new CEO appointed in 2025.</li>
<li>The Argentine government announced economic policy changes, including the removal of certain currency controls, resulting in a significant devaluation of the Argentine Peso on April 14, 2025. This adjustment represents the corresponding one-day foreign currency exchange loss from the remeasurement of the company&rsquo;s Argentina subsidiary&rsquo;s monetary assets and liabilities in Argentina&rsquo;s highly inflationary economy.</li>

<li>The company adjusts its non-GAAP results to exclude amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets as such amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and/or size of acquisitions. Management believes that the adjustment of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization supplements the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the comparability of operating performance. Although the company excludes amortization from acquisition-related intangible assets from its non-GAAP expenses, management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting and contribute to revenue generation. Amortization of intangible assets that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Any future acquisitions may result in the amortization of additional intangible assets.</li>

<title>Energy Exchange ElectronX Launches First Direct-Access U.S. Power Derivatives For Intraday Volatility - Energy Exchange ElectronX Launches First Direct-Access U.S. Power Derivatives For Intraday Volatility</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4613052-1&amp;h=2522133493&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Felectronx.com%2F&amp;a=ElectronX" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ElectronX</a></span>, the energy exchange built to enable precision risk management in electricity markets, today announced it has launched its first product suite of U.S.-regulated power contracts designed for trading and managing intraday price volatility.</p>
<p>Hourly bounded futures and binary options for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) market are now available in 1 MWh sizes on ElectronX's direct-access platform, enabling new financial hedging strategies to limit losses and control costs in times of short-term price stress.</p>
<p>ElectronX's fully collateralized and small-sized contracts&mdash;cash-settled in near real-time through its regulated clearinghouse&mdash;are the first derivatives tailored for the specific risk transfer and price discovery profiles of distributed energy resources, large load consumers, and energy sector innovators in the rapidly evolving U.S. electricity ecosystem.</p>
<p>"In recent years, volatility in intraday power prices has sharply increased in an environment of growing power demand, intermittent renewable energy generation, and adverse weather, including extreme temperature events," said Sam Tegel, CEO of ElectronX. "An outdated financial market dynamic of fractured and shallow short-term liquidity has exacerbated this phenomenon, leading to a severely underhedged power sector when compared with other mature commodities markets.</p>
<p>"Marketplace solutions must include broader access to derivatives for an increasingly&nbsp;<span>decentralized</span>&nbsp;industry with newer business models and innovative technologies&mdash;and our direct-access platform, small-sized contracts, and lower capital requirements are designed for these participants looking to hedge risk specific to their varied physical assets," continued Tegel. "By expanding participation and deepening liquidity in power hedging overall, ElectronX can help usher in an era of improved efficiency, reliability and cost optimization for all U.S. electricity markets."</p>
<p>After&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4613052-1&amp;h=887138357&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prnewswire.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fenergy-exchange-electronx-earns-cftc-designated-market-and-clearing-approvals-302542250.html&amp;a=earning+exchange+and+clearinghouse+regulatory+approvals" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">earning exchange and clearinghouse regulatory approvals</a></span>&nbsp;from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in August 2025, ElectronX opened in a limited soft launch capacity in December, listing select ERCOT North Hub contracts for a group of early adopter participants. The ERCOT suite in its entirety launched last week. Five ERCOT hubs and two hub averages are tradeable for the 120 hours following the current hour. Each contract represents the real-time market value of 1 MWh of power for a specific hub and hourly period, allowing traders to observe, capture and trade precise views on forecasted weather, power demand, and curtailment risks.</p>
<p>ElectronX's market structure, trading interface, and product design were developed with valuable input from leaders and innovators in the U.S. power industry. Exchange members of ElectronX include:</p>

<p>In the coming months, ElectronX plans to list contract suites for PJM Interconnection LLC (PJM), California Independent System Operator (CAISO), and other regional transmission organizations (RTOs) and independent system operators (ISOs).</p>
<p>"We look forward to expanding into PJM and CAISO as energy market participants in both regions&mdash;including power generators, utilities, and data center developers&mdash;consider emerging solutions like ElectronX to address rising prices and acute grid stress," noted Sam Tegel.</p>

<title>ICE Benchmark Administration Receives Recognition Under The EU Benchmarks Regulation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE:ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today announced that the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) has granted recognition to ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (IBA) as a third-country benchmark administrator under Article 32 of the EU Benchmarks Regulation (EU BMR).</p>
<p>ESMA&rsquo;s recognition decision means that IBA&rsquo;s &lsquo;significant&rsquo; EU benchmarks &ndash; the ICE Swap Rate&reg; and the LBMA Gold Price &ndash; remain available for use by &lsquo;supervised entities&rsquo; in the European Union under the EU BMR.</p>
<p>&ldquo;IBA is pleased to have been granted recognition by ESMA,&rdquo; said Clive de Ruig, President of ICE Benchmark Administration. &ldquo;This decision ensures IBA&rsquo;s EU-based clients can continue to use the ICE Swap Rate&reg; and the LBMA Gold Price without disruption and demonstrates our ability to apply robust governance and best-in-class technology to give market participants confidence in the information they depend upon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition to being recognised by ESMA, ICE Benchmark Administration is authorised and regulated by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority for the regulated activity of administering a benchmark. ICE Benchmark Administration administers a number of other benchmarks pursuant to this authorisation, including the LBMA Silver Price, the ICE Term Reference Rates, and the ICE RFR Indexes. These benchmarks are not currently in scope of the EU BMR and, accordingly, are not currently subject to any EU-usage restrictions.</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Takes Action Against HTX To Stop Illegal Financial Promotions</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The FCA has begun legal proceedings against global crypto exchange HTX (formerly Huobi) for illegally promoting cryptoasset services to UK consumers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/htx-huobi-legal-proceedings" title="Access documents on this clame on the FCA website">Access documents on this claim on the FCA website</a></p>
<p>Firms providing crypto products to UK consumers need to comply with rules which protect consumers from unfair and misleading marketing. Advertising cryptoassets on social media or websites without complying with these rules is a criminal offence.</p>
<p>Since the rules came into force in October 2023, the FCA has engaged extensively with firms, and the majority have reacted positively in complying with the new regime.</p>
<p>The FCA previously warned about HTX&rsquo;s illegal promotion of crypto services to UK consumers. However, it has continued to publish financial promotions in breach of these rules on its website and on social media platforms, including TikTok, X, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube.</p>
<p>HTX operates an opaque organisational structure, hiding the identities of its owners and the operators of its website. Repeated attempts by the FCA to engage with HTX have been ignored. Since issue of the proceedings, HTX has taken steps to restrict new UK customers from registering an account. However, existing UK users can still log in and access unlawful financial promotions, and HTX has given no assurance that the changes will be permanent. The FCA therefore remains concerned that the risk of ongoing breaches continues.</p>
<p>Steve Smart, joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said: 'Our rules are designed to support a sustainable and competitive crypto market in the UK, ensuring that consumers have what they need to make informed decisions.</p>
<p>'HTX&rsquo;s conduct stands in stark contrast to the majority of firms working to comply with the FCA&rsquo;s regime. This is the first time we&rsquo;ve taken enforcement action against a crypto firm illegally marketing their products to UK consumers. We&rsquo;ll continue to act against firms who ignore our rules.'</p>
<p>To protect consumers, the FCA requested social media companies block HTX&rsquo;s social media accounts to UK-based consumers and requested the removal of HTX applications from the Google Play and Apple stores in the UK.</p>
<p>HTX is currently on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/warnings/huobicom-htxcom-htx-and-or-huobi-global-and-or-huobi" title="FCA&rsquo;s Warning List">FCA&rsquo;s Warning List</a>. Consumers dealing with this firm will not have access to the&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Financial Ombudsman Service (opens in a new window)">Financial Ombudsman Service<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;if they have a complaint.</p>
<p>Consumers are unlikely to get their money back if it goes out of business and should avoid dealing with this, or similar unauthorised firms.</p>
<p>Individuals can check the FCA&rsquo;s Warning List to see if a firm is operating illegally and visit the FCA&rsquo;s cryptoasset promotions page for more information on how to protect themselves.</p>

<title>ICE Introduces New MSP User Experience, Launches Next Phase Of Enhanced Servicing Automation - New UX Marks Milestone In MSP Modernization While Introducing Enhanced Escrow And Investor Reporting Automations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE: ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today announced a significant milestone in the modernization of its MSP&reg; mortgage servicing system with the launch of an enhanced user experience (UX). The new UX completes the first phase of a broader modernization initiative, establishing the groundwork for second-phase enhanced workflow automations and productivity agents already being introduced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This new UX is a foundational step in modernizing MSP,&rdquo; said Bob Hart, President of ICE Mortgage Technology. &ldquo;Phase one is not just about improving platform navigability; it is already allowing us to roll out second-phase enhanced automation and AI-driven productivity agents that reduce manual effort and help servicers scale more efficiently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While MSP has supported exception-based automation for decades, the new UX enhancements make it possible to further reduce the volume of exceptions that require human review by consolidating remaining reviews into more efficient, single-screen workflows. ICE has prioritized enhanced automation for servicing processes that require the greatest manual intervention, with some early capabilities already available.</p>
<p>As part of this announcement, ICE has introduced phase two enhanced escrow and investor reporting automations, which are made possible by the updated UX. The enhanced escrow automation reduces manual touchpoints by as much as 87% and shortens cycle times from ten days to as few as two, while enhanced automation for Freddie Mac loan-level investor reporting cuts manual steps by as much as 68% for this high-frequency process.</p>
<p>ICE plans to continue to systematically deliver enhanced automations and productivity agents across the most manually intensive servicing tasks. These efforts are supported by the long-term modernization of MSP&rsquo;s underlying architecture, which is expected to facilitate faster feature development, broader use of emerging technologies, improved data accessibility and more efficient system management &mdash; ultimately helping servicers reduce system administration, shorten user training and improve margins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are deeply focused on delivering tangible ROI for our customers through continuous innovation,&rdquo; Hart added. &ldquo;MSP is already the most comprehensive mortgage servicing system on the market, and these enhancements not only support our customers today, but lay the groundwork for greater interoperability and faster feature development in the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The new UX can be easily adopted without reimplementation or disruption to current integrations. It builds on a series of recent servicing solution updates, including AI-based call prediction and account summarization capabilities, as well as deeper integration between ICE&rsquo;s servicing and origination solutions that allows homeowners to apply for home equity and refinance loans directly through their servicing portal.</p>
<p>Demos of the new MSP experience can be viewed at the MBA Servicing Solutions Conference and Expo, held February 16-19, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://mortgagetech.ice.com/experience/index" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">ICE Experience 2026</a>&nbsp;(X26) annual mortgage technology user conference, held March 16-18.</p>

<title>LSEG And Apex Group Collaborate To Connect Private Funds With LSEG’s Digital Markets Infrastructure</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>LSEG and&nbsp;Apex Group today announce&nbsp;a&nbsp;collaboration&nbsp;to connect&nbsp;private&nbsp;funds&nbsp;with&nbsp;LSEG&rsquo;s Digital Markets Infrastructure (DMI), creating a transformative&nbsp;end-to-end digital distribution network for private funds. This&nbsp;collaboration&nbsp;will redefine how fund managers access capital and how investors discover and invest in private funds globally.</p>
<p>Digital&nbsp;Markets&nbsp;Infrastructure, which is powered by Microsoft Azure, delivers&nbsp;blockchain-powered scale and efficiencies for the full asset lifecycle - from issuance,&nbsp;tokenisation&nbsp;and distribution to post trade asset settlement and servicing, across multiple asset classes.</p>
<p>Apex Group&nbsp;brings&nbsp;$3.5tn in&nbsp;assets under administration&nbsp;and its global fund servicing infrastructure&nbsp;is&nbsp;the first service provider to connect with DMI.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fund managers&nbsp;serviced by Apex&nbsp;Group&nbsp;can access DMI through&nbsp;Apex Group&rsquo;s Apex Digital Liquidity &amp; Distribution Service (Apex&nbsp;Digital&nbsp;3.0),&nbsp;a next-generation digital custody and distribution platform&nbsp;giving fund managers a single&nbsp;gateway to manage&nbsp;investors at&nbsp;scale.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apex&nbsp;Digital&nbsp;3.0&nbsp;links directly into&nbsp;LSEG&rsquo;s Digital&nbsp;Markets&nbsp;Infrastructure&nbsp;which is fully integrated into LSEG&rsquo;s Workspace, giving access to over&nbsp;400,000 users&nbsp;and enabling funds to be visible to this global investor universe while&nbsp;maintaining&nbsp;privacy and investor suitability.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Funds, whether long‑established&nbsp;or digitally native&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;are invited to join us on this journey as we open a new, more efficient path for global private‑markets distribution. We are increasingly indifferent if a company or fund is private or public, or if it is traditional or digital finance. By connecting through LSEG&rsquo;s Digital Markets Infrastructure, managers can seamlessly access a broader investor universe while&nbsp;benefiting&nbsp;from a secure, scalable, and future‑ready ecosystem.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;service will&nbsp;go live in H1 2026.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr&nbsp;Darko Hajdukovic, Head of Digital Markets Infrastructure, LSEG, said: &ldquo;Our partnership with Apex&nbsp;Group&nbsp;represents&nbsp;a significant step toward digitising private markets&nbsp;and&nbsp;funds in&nbsp;particular.&nbsp;By&nbsp;working closely with&nbsp;Apex&nbsp;Group&rsquo;s global fund servicing capabilities with DMI, we are creating a secure, efficient, and scalable ecosystem that connects fund managers and investors. This collaboration&nbsp;will&nbsp;unlock&nbsp;new opportunities for innovation in private&nbsp;markets&nbsp;and&nbsp;enable&nbsp;participants to engage with private assets in a way that is faster, safer, and more connected than ever before."</p>
<p>Peter Hughes, Founder and CEO, Apex Group,&nbsp;said:&nbsp;"Private markets have lacked&nbsp;the direct&nbsp;connectivity and efficient investor aggregation needed to access global pools of capital efficiently. Together with LSEG,&nbsp;we're&nbsp;changing that. Apex Digital 3.0 utilises our Apex Invest platform to&nbsp;establish&nbsp;a seamless, many-to-one connection between fund managers and hard-to-reach capital sources, all linked directly through LSEG's distribution network via its global Workspace community.&nbsp;This&nbsp;initial&nbsp;phase automates the full investor lifecycle, while&nbsp;establishing&nbsp;the digital foundation for future blockchain- and AI-enabled connectivity across managers, institutions, and wealth platforms, paving the way for the next generation of private-market infrastructure.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Financial Markets Tribunal Upholds The Dubai Financial Services Authority’s Decision To Impose A Fine On Al Ramz Capital LLC Of USD 25,000 For Failing To Immediately Report Suspicious Transactions On NASDAQ Dubai</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/financial-markets-tribunal-upholds-the-dubai-financial-services-authoritys-deci-2026210/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA), the independent banking, financial services, and markets regulator of the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) has today announced that the Financial Markets Tribunal has dismissed a reference by Al Ramz Capital LLC (Al Ramz) of a&nbsp;<a href="https://365343652932-web-server-storage.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/files/3917/7071/2788/Decision_Notice_Al_Ramz_Capital_LLC_Feb_2026_Redacted.pdf">DFSA Decision Notice</a>&nbsp;dated 13 June 2024.</p>
<p>On 3 February 2026, the Financial Markets Tribunal upheld the DFSA&rsquo;s decision to impose a USD 25,000 (AED 91,813) fine on Al Ramz for its failure to immediately report suspicious transactions that it had executed on Nasdaq Dubai on behalf of a Client in April 2022.<span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Alan Linning, Managing Director of Enforcement at the DFSA, said:</span>&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;This case is a firm reminder to Authorised Firms and Recognised Members that they must notify the DFSA immediately if they reasonably suspect that a client&rsquo;s order or transaction may constitute Market Abuse under the Markets Law, including market manipulation.</i></p>
<p><i>When a firm submits a notification by way of a Suspicious Transaction and Order Report (STOR), it should explain to the DFSA its reasons for suspecting that the order or transaction may constitute Market Abuse, and provide full details including the date, time, the name of the client and other parties involved and the nature of the investment (e.g. on-exchange or over-the-counter (OTC).</i></p>
<p><i>These reports are vital in assisting the DFSA in detecting and preventing Market Abuse. As a result, they are fundamental to maintaining market integrity and protecting investors and potential participants of DFSA administered markets. The DFSA will continue to hold Authorised Firms and Recognised Members to the high standards expected of them. We will not hesitate to take action where those high standards are not met.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>The DFSA&rsquo;s case was that as a Recognised Member of Nasdaq Dubai, Al Ramz had reasonable grounds to suspect that the transactions in question may have constituted Market Abuse. In terms of the relevant DFSA rule, Al Ramz was therefore obliged to make a report to the DFSA immediately, but failed to do so.</p>
<p>Before the Financial Markets Tribunal, Al Ramz argued unsuccessfully that it had not breached the Rule because it did not actually suspect Market Abuse in relation to the transactions in question.</p>
<p>In its decision, the Financial Markets Tribunal rejected Al Ramz&rsquo;s interpretation of the Rule stating:</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;In our view, the proper construction of the REC 3.4.5&nbsp;</i>[<i>the relevant rule</i>]<i>&nbsp;leads to the conclusion that the obligation to notify the DFSA of potential Market Abuse arises where there are reasonable grounds for suspecting Market Abuse in a purely objective sense irrespective of whether the Recognised Member actually suspects Market Abuse.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>The Financial Markets Tribunal confirmed the DFSA&rsquo;s decision that on the information known to Al Ramz at the relevant time, there existed, objectively, reasonable grounds to suspect the trades may constitute Market Abuse. On this basis, the Financial Markets Tribunal upheld the DFSA&rsquo;s decision to impose the USD 25,000 fine on Al Ramz.</p>
<p>The DFSA remains committed to developing, administering, and enforcing world-class regulations of financial services within the DIFC. As part of its strategy and ongoing mission, the Authority will continue to implement stringent enforcement measures and provide clear regulatory guidance to ensure that all entities operating within the Centre adhere to the highest standards of regulation and ethical conduct.</p>
<p>The DFSA's Decision Notice is accessible in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dfsa.ae/what-we-do/enforcement/regulatory-actions" target="_blank">Regulatory Actions section</a>&nbsp;of the DFSA website. Al Ramz Capital LLC (Al Ramz) has 28 days after the date of the Financial Markets Tribunal&rsquo;s decision to appeal the decision. The Financial Markets Tribunal&rsquo;s decision is available in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dfsa.ae/about-dfsa/our-structure/financial-markets-tribunal" target="_blank">FMT section</a>&nbsp;of the DFSA&rsquo;s website. ​​​​​</p>

<title>FIX Recommends Regulatory Approaches To AI In Trading: Monetary Authority Of Singapore Consultation</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/fix-recommends-regulatory-approaches-to-ai-in-trading-monetary-authority-of-sin-2026210/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/fix-recommends-regulatory-approaches-to-ai-in-trading-monetary-authority-of-sin-2026210/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The FIX Trading Community, the industry association that manages the world&rsquo;s trading language, the FIX Protocol, has proposed ten key recommendations for regulating AI in trading, in response to the Monetary Authority of Singapore&rsquo;s (MAS) consultation,&nbsp;<i>Consultation Paper on Guidelines on Artificial Intelligence Risk Management</i>, which closed on January 31.</p>
<p>Executive Director Jim Kaye said the consultation was both valuable and timely, enabling FIX and its member firms to come together to address the complex issue of AI, with which all firms around the world are currently grappling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was an immensely useful exercise in teasing out both overarching themes and technical challenges,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s allowed us to propose some practical measures that will be very helpful to firms as we, as an industry, meet the risks and opportunities that AI presents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Machine learning has been the backbone of algorithmic trading for decades, but the advent of large language models, and high-profile examples of their failings, have thrown AI into the spotlight. The interconnected nature of global markets means that one AI catastrophe could potentially have far-reaching consequences, and the speed at which the AI industry is moving means both regulators and participants are highly focused on this topic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This consultation allowed us to think about AI from all angles &ndash; from Board accountability (critical) to existing frameworks that could be used to help manage AI risks,&rdquo; Kaye said. &ldquo;The MAS proposals are an excellent start &ndash; we think that with some additional depth, they will be a good framework for firms to manage risk as AI adoption moves ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>FIX&rsquo;s recommendations include ten key points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Agreeing a globally recognised definition and taxonomy for what &ldquo;AI&rdquo; means in a trading context. Without this, and particularly if firms are left to define AI for themselves, there will be inconsistency between both firms and markets, and regulatory arbitrage. Standards and publications that can be referenced include Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) and ISO 24030.</li>
<li>Making Boards accountable for AI governance effectiveness &ndash; not just AI governance existence.</li>
<li>Anchoring AI regulatory guidelines to existing constructs for operational resilience and market integrity, such as MiFID RTS 6 which requires firms to both annually self-assess and validate their algo trading systems as well as to certify non-contribution to market disorder on every significant change; and the EU&rsquo;s Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) ICT risk management frameworks.</li>
<li>Specifically considering the way large language models (LLMs) are integrated into algorithms and calculators, including potential downstream workflow and decision-making impacts.</li>
<li>Establishing cross-functional committees to ensure risk management across the organisation, and ensuring these committees also have oversight of third-party AI-related suppliers.</li>
<li>Creating internal and regulator-facing disclosure patterns analogous to food labelling: what data was used, training approach, evaluation results, mitigations, limitations, intended use, and user-data protection.</li>
<li>Supporting the creation and maintenance of AI inventories, the granularity of which will necessarily be well beyond typical algo inventories.</li>
<li>Imposing the proposed risk dimensions of impact, complexity and reliance with the addition of a further two dimension: interconnectedness/contagion potential; and change sensitivity/nonlinearity &ndash; ie the butterfly effect, where small changes can lead to material&nbsp;differences in AI behaviour.</li>
<li>Strengthening the proposed standards, processes and controls through the AI lifecycle. FIX Trading Community&rsquo;s significant work on algorithm testing and certification could be referenced here.</li>
<li>Revising the definition of &ldquo;significant/material change&rdquo; so that retraining, data refreshes, fine-tuning, prompt/policy-layer changes, and infrastructure/latency changes are each evaluated under a clear, risk-based materiality test, that may require re-approval and re-testing.</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;There is no doubt that Silicon Valley&rsquo;s &lsquo;move fast and break things&rsquo; approach is at odds with the conservative approach that must be taken to protect the integrity of our global capital markets,&rdquo; Kaye said. &ldquo;When it comes to AI, it&rsquo;s critical that the entire capital markets industry works together to ensure we protect our financial system as well as we possibly can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<p>The FIX Trading Community is the only independent global community where capital markets firms come together to solve common issues and shape the evolution of capital markets. FIX groups in over 60 countries are working on a range of global issues including digital assets; reference data; carbon trading; AI; algo trading; FICC and ETFs, while country and regional committees work together to manage local regulation and market structure matters.

<title>ASX Announces CEO Transition</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asx-announces-ceo-transition-2026210/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asx-announces-ceo-transition-2026210/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASX Limited (ASX) announces today that Managing Director and CEO Helen Lofthouse will step down in May 2026, following an 11 year career at ASX.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Appointed CEO in 2022, the announcement of Ms Lofthouse&rsquo;s planned departure comes as ASX makes final preparations to deliver the first phase of the CHESS project which is targeting go-live in April 2026.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having overseen a new transformation agenda and technology modernisation program, and with the CHESS project on firm footing, the Board and Ms Lofthouse have determined it is the right time for new leadership to take the Group into its next phase of transformation.</p>
<p><b>ASX Chair David Clarke said:</b> &ldquo;Helen took the CEO role at an exceptionally challenging time for ASX. She took the difficult decision to stop the previous CHESS project and reset it, and she has driven a significant uplift in our technology investment and delivery, and risk focus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After careful consideration, and as we approach go-live for CHESS Release 1, the Board and Helen have agreed this marks an appropriate turning point to commence the transition to a new CEO.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will be looking for a new leader to extend the foundations built in recent years and drive the business forward while keeping customers and the market at the heart of our purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Ms Lofthouse said:</b> &ldquo;It has been a privilege to serve at ASX for more than a decade and to spend four years leading an organisation that is at centre of Australia&rsquo;s financial markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since becoming CEO we have reset the CHESS project, refreshed our strategy, expanded technology investment and delivered a series of technology and resilience upgrades. While the pace of change has been intense in recent years, I&rsquo;m very proud of our achievements in modernising technology, enhancing customer engagement, developing Group capabilities, and shifting our culture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been a rewarding but demanding journey with enormous personal growth. Having reflected on what ASX needs for its next phase, together with the Board we have agreed that this is the right time for a new person to bring fresh energy to the work ahead. We&rsquo;ve made great strides even as we&rsquo;ve faced challenges and I want to thank everyone at ASX for their dedication and support&nbsp; and our customers for their partnership.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Succession</h2>
<p>The Board has engaged Korn Ferry to support a comprehensive process to identify our next CEO. The global search will also consider internal candidates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr Clarke said: &ldquo;Our search process is underway and we will assess leaders who have strong credentials in financial markets, transformation and risk management. The Board has confidence in the capability and experience of ASX&rsquo;s executive leadership team, and internal candidates will be considered alongside external candidates as part of a robust process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;While the search process will be comprehensive, it will not slow our momentum to deliver strategic priorities and the Board maintains ongoing and active oversight. Our Executive team remain fully accountable for execution of key deliverables and there is no change to our major initiatives and programs.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">&ldquo;The Board&rsquo;s focus is on operating reliable, resilient critical market infrastructure and ensuring we play an active stewardship role to deliver a future-focused exchange.&rdquo;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li>Investor demand exceeded USD 1.3 billion, representing a 2.6x oversubscription from regional and international investors.</li>
<li>Total outstanding value of debt securities listed on Nasdaq Dubai now exceeds USD 147.3 billion.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nasdaq Dubai has welcomed the listing of a USD 500 million bond issued by Arab Bank for Investment and Foreign Trade PJSC (Al Masraf), marking the Bank&rsquo;s debut in the international debt capital markets and reinforcing Dubai&rsquo;s position as a leading hub for global fixed-income issuances.</p>
<p>Issued under Al Masraf&rsquo;s USD 5 billion Medium Term Note (EMTN) Programme, the five-year bond matures on 29 January 2031 and carries a coupon of 5.113% per annum, equivalent to a credit spread of 125 basis points over U.S. Treasuries. The issuance attracted strong investor demand, with the order book peaking at over USD 1.3 billion, representing an oversubscription rate of 2.6 times.</p>
<p>The transaction drew participation from a diversified base of regional and international investors, including some of the world&rsquo;s largest fund managers, banks, private banks, pension funds, and insurance companies. The mandate for the issuance was announced on 16 January, with pricing completed on 22 January following a series of investor meetings held across Hong Kong, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the UAE.</p>
<p>Rated &lsquo;A&rsquo; by Fitch, the bond is listed on both the London Stock Exchange&rsquo;s International Securities Market and Nasdaq Dubai.</p>
<p>To mark the listing, Fuad Mohamed, CEO, Al Masraf, rang the market-opening bell at Nasdaq Dubai, alongside Hamed Ali, CEO of Nasdaq Dubai and Dubai Financial Market (DFM), and senior representatives from both organizations.</p>
<p><b>Fuad Mohamed, CEO of Al Masraf,</b> stated: &ldquo;The strong investor demand, reflects the investors&rsquo; belief in Al Masraf&rsquo;s renewed strategic direction, reinforced management, and the positive strides on financial metrics over the last 12 months. Our capital market debut in the Bank&rsquo;s Golden Jubilee year allows us to penetrate the international markets and reach out to a diverse investor base while at the same time reinvigorates the relations with our esteemed regional partners.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Hamed Ali, CEO of Nasdaq Dubai and DFM, </b>said<b>: </b>&ldquo;Al Masraf&rsquo;s debut bond listing reflects strong and sustained investor confidence in high-quality regional issuers and underscores the continued development of the UAE&rsquo;s debt capital markets. The strong response to this issuance reflects the quality of the credit and the continued appeal of Dubai as a venue for international debt listings, reinforcing the role of Dubai&rsquo;s markets in supporting regional issuers&rsquo; access to global capital.&rdquo;<b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>The total outstanding value of debt securities listed on Nasdaq Dubai exceeds USD <b>147.3</b> billion. This reflects the depth and diversity of issuers accessing Dubai&rsquo;s international debt markets across sovereign, financial institution, and corporate segments.</p>

<p>SGX Group (Singapore Exchange) today reported robust trading activity for January, with record exchange-traded fund (ETF) turnover and stronger participation from both retail and institutional investors driving growth in its stock market.

<p>Key highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Growing interest in stocks beyond benchmark index:&nbsp;</strong>Stock market momentum<strong>&nbsp;</strong>in January was broad based across all client segments, with demand extending beyond index names as more stocks achieved at least S$1 million in daily turnover. Institutions net purchased into index as well as small- and mid-cap stocks. The Monetary Authority of Singapore and SGX Stock Exchange also launched the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sgx.com/value-unlock">Value Unlock</a>&nbsp;programme during the month.

The contract is the most liquid Taiwan index futures approved by the U.S. CFTC for global investors to manage their Taiwan exposures. Similarly, the SGX Micro FTSE Taiwan Index Futures capped a strong month with DAV of 6,430 lots (US$67 million notional), a record high.</li>
<li><strong>FX futures set new records:&nbsp;</strong>SGX USD/CNH FX Futures traded volume gained 30% y-o-y in January to a new monthly record of 4.5 million contracts (US$448 billion notional) as the RMB continued to strengthen against the dollar, while SGX INR/USD FX Futures volume rose 56% y-o-y to 3.0 million contracts amid heightened volatility &ndash; lifting total FX futures volume to an all-time high of 8.3 million contracts.&nbsp;With the shifting rate environment in Japan, SGX Derivatives broadened its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sgx.com/derivatives/interest-rate-derivatives">interest rate derivatives</a>&nbsp;offering with the launch of SGX Mini 20-Year Japanese Government Bond Futures on 26 January.</li>
<li><strong>Broad-based commodities volume growth:</strong>&nbsp;Commodities traded volume expanded 54% y-o-y in January to 6.8 million contracts, with gains across bellwether iron ore, petrochemicals, freight and rubber derivatives. SGX SICOM rubber futures and options volume rose 51% m-o-m to 359,115 contracts, the highest since April 2025.

<p>(Excerpt)</p>
<p>(Tuesday, February&nbsp;３, 2026, ８:51&nbsp;am to ９:05&nbsp;am)</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><dl class="qanda"><dt>Q.</dt><dd>
<p>Press reports indicate that the FSA initiated an on-site inspection of The Prudential Life Insurance Company, Ltd. on January 29 over suspected improper handling of funds and other misconduct. The reports also state that the inspection, previously scheduled for February 5, was moved forward. Could you confirm whether this is accurate? In addition, please share your views on the case and the FSA&rsquo;s policy response.</p>
</dd><dt class="ans">A.</dt><dd>
<p>We are aware of the reports in question. In light of multiple instances at the company involving inappropriate handling of funds by employees and former employees with respect to policyholders and others, the FSA is also examining the company&rsquo;s handling of customer information and the actual state of its sales practices. At this stage, it would be premature to comment on factual matters, including the company&rsquo;s handling of customer information, and we will therefore refrain from doing so. In any event, based on our findings, we will take strict and appropriate supervisory action.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Following the successful launch of the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/12789353/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><b>Women in Clearing Network</b></a>,<b>&nbsp;</b>in March 2024 the&nbsp;<b>EACH&rsquo;s Women in Clearing Series&nbsp;</b>was inaugurated. This is an initiative with the objective of featuring a key female leader on a regular basis to inspire other professionals in the industry.</p>
<p>We begin the New Year with inspiration from&nbsp;Mar&iacute;a Jos&eacute;. Mar&iacute;a Jos&eacute; is a financial regulator at the Spanish National Securities Market Commission (CNMV), where she works on financial stability, resolution and market infrastructures, with a particular focus on central counterparties (CCPs). She has extensive experience in supervision, investor protection, financial stability, and international cooperation, and actively contributes to global discussions on clearing, resolution and financial market resilience.</p>
<p>She is committed to modern, effective and citizen-oriented supervision, aligned with the principles of market integrity, transparency and investor protection, which form part of her professional DNA. Alongside her regulatory work, she is engaged in academic research and teaching in financial regulation, and is passionate about reading, culture and lifelong learning. Her leadership style is collaborative, inclusive and results-oriented, with a strong focus on teamwork, trust and continuous improvement.</p>
<p>Mar&iacute;a Jos&eacute;&nbsp;has volunteered to share with us her personal and professional journey by responding to three questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>What was the aspect of yourself that you had to work on the most to get to where you are now?</b></li>
</ul>
<p>One of the key aspects I had to work on was my own confidence. Early in my career, especially in highly technical and traditionally male-dominated environments, I had to learn not to underestimate myself or hesitate to step forward. Experience taught me that competence grows through&nbsp;<i>learning by doing</i>, and that credibility and authority are built by leading by example, consistency and hard work, by striving for excellence and genuinely enjoying what you do, whatever your role may be. Over time, I also learned the importance of trusting my own judgement while remaining open to learning from others through active listening, as well as the value of a strong humanistic education in broadening perspective and enriching professional growth.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>What key tip would you give for professionals to successfully develop in their careers?</b></li>
</ul>
<p>My main advice would be to invest continuously in learning, not only technical skills but also broader knowledge and human skills. Keeping an open mind, listening carefully, and understanding the perspectives of different stakeholders is essential, particularly in complex sectors such as clearing. I would also stress the value of mentoring, intergenerational and multidisciplinary teamwork, and building strong, cohesive teams. Finally, never feel inferior or afraid of new challenges. Commitment, curiosity and teamwork make a real difference over time.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>How do you see the future of clearing in 10 years?</b></li>
</ul>
<p>In the next decade, clearing will become even more central to financial stability, while undergoing a profound technological and structural transformation. Central counterparties will operate in a more digital, interconnected and accelerated environment, marked by shorter settlement cycles, the move towards continuous trading, greater automation, and the gradual integration of technologies such as distributed ledger technology and artificial intelligence, with the potential medium-term application of quantum computing. These innovations will enhance efficiency and transparency, but will also shift risks towards operational resilience, cyber security, liquidity management and governance, requiring crisis management and resolution frameworks to evolve accordingly, and authorities, infrastructures and market participants to remain continuously prepared for stress scenarios.</p>
<p>At the same time, the future of clearing in Europe will depend less on the degree of concentration of infrastructures and more on effective interoperability, coordinated supervision and strong institutional cooperation. A diversified but well-connected clearing ecosystem, supported by robust regulatory frameworks, will be key to combining innovation, competitiveness and systemic resilience in an increasingly global and digital financial system.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>Good morning and thank you, Lindsey [Keljo], for the introduction.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;I appreciate the turnout&mdash;early on a Monday morning&mdash;the day after the Super Bowl. For those folks in this room, I know that you find topics like Treasury clearing and tokenizing the securities markets as important as slot formations and nickel coverages. Thus, my remarks will focus on the current status of the SEC&rsquo;s efforts to implement the Treasury Clearing Rule<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2">[2]</a>&nbsp;and facilitate tokenization of the securities markets.</p>
<h1>I. Treasury Clearing Update</h1>
<p>The U.S. Treasury market remains the cornerstone of global financial stability, supporting everything from mortgage pricing to corporate financing to central bank reserves. With nearly $29 trillion in marketable Treasury debt,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3">[3]</a>&nbsp;it is the deepest and most liquid capital market in the world. Its smooth functioning depends on the coordinated efforts of countless stakeholders&mdash;including market participants, clearing agencies, infrastructure providers, and other regulators.</p>
<p>I first became involved in discussions regarding the potential mandatory clearing of Treasuries when I served on detail to the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2017. Eventually, there would be widespread consensus with respect to the benefits of mandatory Treasury clearing. Using a central counterparty can improve transparency and reduce bilateral exposures. The ability to use netting for offsetting transactions can free up additional cash for market participants, which in turn can reduce liquidity strains. Accordingly, in December 2023, I voted with a majority of SEC Commissioners to adopt standards to mandate central clearing of Treasury securities for transactions in the cash and repo markets.</p>
<p>Recent research by the Office of Financial Research (&ldquo;OFR&rdquo;) reemphasizes these benefits of central clearing in the Treasury repo market. In a back-testing analysis of repo and reverse repo positions reported by six global systemically important banks (&ldquo;G-SIBs&rdquo;) during the first eight months of 2025, OFR calculated that if the Treasury Clearing Rule had been in effect during this period, each U.S. G-SIB could have freed up an average of $34.5 billion in additional balance sheet space.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4">[4]</a></p>
<p>In its 2025 Annual Report released by the Trump Administration, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (&ldquo;FSOC&rdquo;) underscored the potential benefits of central clearing of Treasury transactions and expressed support for the SEC as it continues working towards the implementation of the Treasury Clearing Rule.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5">[5]</a>&nbsp;So, with that momentum, the SEC continues to undertake extensive outreach to mitigate any issues with the upcoming deadlines.</p>
<h2>A. Progress Made</h2>
<p>Despite the potential benefits of clearing Treasury transactions, I recognized at the time the SEC adopted the rule, that it would take extensive time, effort, and resources to develop the workflows and processes to integrate market participants into the clearing infrastructure. Given this significant work, it became apparent that the original implementation timeline was too short.</p>
<p>For that reason, upon becoming SEC Acting Chairman, I pushed for a 12-month extension of those deadlines. I was pleased that both of my then-colleagues, Commissioners Hester Peirce and Caroline Crenshaw, unanimously agreed to the extension.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6">[6]</a></p>
<p>At the time, the February 2025 extension would provide market participants with 22 months to prepare for implementation with respect to cash transactions. Now, that implementation date is less than eleven months away. Thanks to efforts of many, including those who are in this room, we have been able to collectively identify a number of concerns, and the SEC is committed to promptly addressing them.</p>
<p>Our efforts have been focused in three areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, reviewing applications and proposals aimed at expanding access to, and options for, clearing Treasury securities;</li>
<li>Second, providing guidance on the scope of the Treasury Clearing Rule, including consideration for providing additional flexibility to ensure that market participants can access liquidity and manage collateral; and</li>
<li>Third, maintaining a collaborative and transparent approach to implementation.</li>
</ul>
<p>I will address each of these in turn.</p>
<h2>B. Developments in Clearing</h2>
<h3>New Clearing Agencies</h3>
<p>Until recently, there was only a single SEC-registered clearing agency for Treasury securities, the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (&ldquo;FICC&rdquo;). In the last two months, however, the SEC has approved the applications of CME Securities Clearing Inc. and ICE Clear Credit LLC to register as clearing agencies for Treasury securities transactions.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7">[7]</a>&nbsp;These approvals will provide market participants the necessary certainty as to which entities can serve as clearing agencies for Treasury securities and what services they will offer.</p>
<p>Obtaining SEC approval is not an easy process. Section 17A(b)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (&ldquo;Exchange Act&rdquo;) sets forth the requirements that an applicant must meet in order to register as a clearing agency.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8">[8]</a>&nbsp;These requirements include whether the entity is so organized and has the capacity to provide the functions of a clearing agency, whether its rules provide for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions, and whether its rules assure a fair representation of its shareholders or members and participants in the selection of its directors and administration of its affairs. These requirements guide the Commission&rsquo;s consideration of a clearing agency application, and the Commission must find that an applicant can meet these requirements. In the case of the two new clearing agencies, the Commission made those findings.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9">[9]</a></p>
<p>Now, with three clearing agencies approved for Treasury securities, market participants will have expanded options for accessing clearing to implement their obligations under the Treasury Clearing Rule. We encourage market participants, who may have questions about the operations of these clearing agencies in relation to their own regulatory obligations, to engage with the central counterparties. If needed, the SEC staff stands ready to be part of those discussions.</p>
<h3>Rule Changes in Clearing</h3>
<p>Besides reviewing applications from new market entrants, the SEC staff has also been reviewing proposals from FICC to support the Treasury Clearing Rule. On December 22, 2025, the Commission published notice of FICC&rsquo;s proposed rule change to amend its cross-margining agreement with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Inc. (&ldquo;CME&rdquo;) to expand its existing cross-margining arrangement with CME to customers. Currently, the arrangement is limited to the proprietary positions of FICC and CME members.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10">[10]</a>&nbsp;Relatedly, the Commission is considering petitions submitted by FICC and CME for exemptive relief from certain provisions of the Exchange Act that would permit expanded cross-margining for customers.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11">[11]</a></p>
<p>Historically, the Commission has supported and approved cross-margining at clearing agencies and recognized the potential benefits of cross-margining systems. These benefits include freeing up capital through reduced margin requirements, reducing clearing costs by integrating clearing functions, reducing clearing agency risk by centralizing asset management, and harmonizing liquidation procedures. In addition, we understand that certain market participants view an expansion of cross-margining between cash and futures Treasury positions to be an important component of the transition to increased central clearing of Treasury securities. The current proposal from FICC and CME is still outstanding. The Commission must review and consider comments submitted by the public and take them into consideration as it determines whether to approve the proposed rule change.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Commission acted this past December on two proposals from FICC that are aimed at expanding access to clearing ahead of the Treasury Clearing Rule compliance dates. Specifically, the Commission approved a proposed new offering from FICC to establish a &ldquo;collateral-in-lieu&rdquo; service as part of the existing sponsored general collateral service.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12">[12]</a>&nbsp;This service would allow FICC to take a lien on the collateral underlying a repo transaction in lieu of charging margin. In most instances, the lien will obviate FICC&rsquo;s need to collect margin or to obtain a guarantee on the transactions. This service would address what market participants have referred to as &ldquo;double margining&rdquo; that increases the costs, and thereby decreases the ability, of a FICC sponsoring member to provide clearance and settlement services to mutual funds and other cash providers. Second, the Commission issued an order approving expansion of FICC&rsquo;s agent clearing service to include triparty transactions, which should provide an additional option for market participants using that service.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13">[13]</a></p>
<h2>C. Guidance on the Scope of the Treasury Clearing Rule</h2>
<p>The SEC has also been engaging with market participants about the scope of the Treasury Clearing Rule. SEC staff has provided guidance in some areas, such as mixed CUSIP triparty repos,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14">[14]</a>&nbsp;but has yet to resolve some other questions.</p>
<h3>Flexibility for Inter-Affiliate Transactions</h3>
<p>One area where market participants have asked for further regulatory clarity is the application of the Treasury Clearing Rule to inter-affiliate transactions.</p>
<p>When the Commission proposed the Treasury Clearing Rule, the definition of an eligible secondary market transaction provided no exception for inter-affiliate transactions. Commenters, however, asserted that inter-affiliate transactions are important for corporate groups, which use them to achieve efficient risk and capital allocation and to obtain flexibility for addressing customer demands. Further, commenters noted that requiring inter-affiliate transactions to be centrally cleared would impose additional costs but have only limited benefits.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15">[15]</a></p>
<p>Thus, the final rule included an exemption for inter-affiliate transactions. The Commission recognized that inter-affiliate transactions represent an important tool to transfer liquidity and risk within an affiliated group. The Commission also recognized that, in certain circumstances, the counterparty credit risk posed by inter-affiliate transactions may be less than other transactions.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16">[16]</a></p>
<p>The inter-affiliate exemption provides that a direct participant of a central counterparty would not have to clear its inter-affiliate transactions if (i) the affiliate was under common control and was either a bank, broker-dealer or a futures commission merchant, and (ii) the direct participant also submitted for clearing the outward-facing transactions of that affiliate.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17">[17]</a></p>
<p>As the Adopting Release explained, &ldquo;this [outward facing] condition&rdquo; was intended to ensure that a direct participant could not rely upon an inter-affiliate transaction to avoid the requirement to clear eligible secondary market transactions. If there were no such condition, a direct participant could simply use inter-affiliate transactions to move securities and funds to affiliates, and the affiliated counterparty could then enter into external transactions with counterparties which, if entered into as a direct participant of a Treasury securities covered clearing agency, would be eligible secondary market transactions. Because the clearing requirement is conditioned on one of the parties being a direct participant, this would undermine the clearing requirement. Under the outward-facing condition, however, the transfer of Treasury securities between a direct participant and its non-direct participant affiliate would only be exempt from the clearing requirement if the non-direct participant affiliate cleared all of its other Treasury repo transactions.</p>
<p>Because the final inter-affiliate exemption had not been exposed to public review, market participants raised a number of concerns, including with respect to the types of entities that can be affiliates for purposes of the exemption and the requirement to clear the outward-facing transactions of the affiliate. SEC staff has been working with market participants to better understand these concerns and how they can be addressed.</p>
<p>Specifically, SEC staff have been considering whether broadening the contours of that exemption could be workable without creating a significant loophole that undermines the purposes of the rule. For example, could the provision that the affiliate be a bank, broker-dealer, or futures commission merchant be modified to allow for more types of entities as affiliates? SEC staff are also considering other potential relief for the inter-affiliate exemption so that market participants can maintain their current business practices for liquidity, treasury, and collateral management. The Commission has received productive feedback from market participants on the inter-affiliate exemption, and my hope is that any potential modifications can be publicly rolled out in the near future, since the compliance date is fast approaching.</p>
<h3>Extra-Territorial Reach</h3>
<p>The extraterritorial scope of the Treasury Clearing Rule is another area where the SEC staff have engaged in additional outreach efforts. Non-U.S. firms that trade with U.S. counterparties do not typically centrally clear their trades in Treasury securities. Accordingly, it is not surprising that an industry survey on U.S. Treasury central clearing readiness, released last fall, showed lower levels of understanding of the Treasury Clearing Rule amongst non-U.S. firms and lower levels of confidence that these firms would be ready to fulfill their obligations by the extended compliance dates.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn18">[18]</a>&nbsp;The SEC is aware that these firms may have larger burdens than U.S. firms in establishing clearing arrangements with intermediaries or central counterparties.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn19">[19]</a>&nbsp;SEC staff have been engaging with market participants to understand the jurisdictional issues, and I hope we can address such concerns in the near future.</p>
<h2>D. Maintaining a Transparent and Collaborative Approach</h2>
<p>There are other areas where implementing the Treasury Clearing Rule has raised questions for market participants about how they should comply with other existing requirements under the federal securities laws.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn20">[20]</a>&nbsp;We acknowledge the need for guidance and SEC staff continue to engage with market participants on these questions.</p>
<p>To maximize transparency regarding the SEC&rsquo;s efforts, we have provided periodic public updates and maintain a comprehensive list of actions taken on a dedicated&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/securities-topics/treasury-clearing-implementation">Treasury Clearing implementation webpage</a>&nbsp;on sec.gov.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn21">[21]</a>&nbsp;Materials posted to this dedicated website also are intended to keep market participants informed about the additional work that is underway. Thus, if you see no mention of a particular concern on that website, then it is highly likely that we are not actively working on it&mdash;so we strongly encourage firms to identify and raise any remaining challenges or unforeseen issues as we move towards full implementation.</p>
<p>The Commission continues its collaboration with the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve Board, the CFTC, and international regulators to ensure seamless cross-border implementation. It is in all of our interests to see that the U.S. Treasury securities market remains the deepest, most liquid, and most resilient market in the world.</p>
<h1>II. Why Tokenization Matters and Where We Stand</h1>
<p>One of the other issues that the Commission is taking a close look at is tokenization, a development that could change the way securities are issued, traded, and managed. It also raises important questions about liquidity, collateral practices, and clearing models, as well as the legal and regulatory frameworks needed to support these changes.</p>
<p>Technology has long shaped the way our markets operate&mdash;from paper certificates to dematerialized shares, from physical trading floors to electronic order books. Today, we consider the possibility of migrating securities positions from traditional databases to blockchain-based systems, and tokenization representing these rights and obligations on-chain.</p>
<p>Properly implemented, tokenization can enhance security, transparency, and immutability by encoding rights on digital tokens and recording their provenance on distributed ledgers. It can reduce reliance on intermediaries, streamline transaction lifecycles, and lower operational costs&mdash;without sacrificing safeguards that have long protected investors.</p>
<p>Potential technological shifts challenge us to translate existing laws and regulations into new contexts. Today, many of the SEC&rsquo;s rules assume multi-layered intermediation. However, tokenization offers a pathway to more direct issuer&ndash;investor interactions on open, programmable rails. Market demand and confidence should drive whether tokenization becomes reality, and the SEC&rsquo;s rulebook should not impose unnecessary roadblocks.</p>
<h2>A. Innovation with Guardrails</h2>
<p>In that sense, SEC rules should be technology-neutral and be focused on outcomes, not solely processes. Tokenized versions of securities remain subject to securities regulation; the shift does not change the legal and regulatory obligations. The challenge is to adapt the rules&mdash;on issuance, custody, and trading to name a few&mdash;so that those obligations can be met in on-chain environments.</p>
<p>To date, SEC efforts in engagement have been through roundtables, staff statements, and public comment files. Under the Trump Administration, the SEC has ceased using enforcement as the principal method for expressing Commission views on these new technological developments. In that sense, the SEC has returned to its normal approach of providing sub-regulatory guidance and exploring exemptive relief to allow limited-scope pilots to proceed under defined parameters, thereby informing potential future Commission action. This is the same tried-and-true process that gave rise to money market funds and exchange-traded funds in the past.</p>
<p>Tokenization can help modernize capital markets, not only by speeding up the settlement cycle but by making ownership more visible&mdash;addressing current challenges in shareholder identification and corporate actions. Visibility and speed are not merely aesthetic improvements; they are core to fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and the Commission should be continually thinking about how these new developments can be incorporated into the markets.</p>
<h2>B. Looking Ahead: Opportunities and Responsibilities</h2>
<p>Recently, the Commission provided public notice of an exemptive application under the Investment Company Act that demonstrates how tokenization is no longer a theoretical exercise, but is becoming a practical reality.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn22">[22]</a>&nbsp;This milestone reflects the Commission&rsquo;s commitment to innovation without abandoning appropriate guardrails such as ensuring that custody, disclosure, and investor protection standards are in place when assets migrate on-chain. It also exemplifies a pragmatic roadmap&mdash;beginning with scoped efforts, learning from the results, and potentially scaling what works.</p>
<p>By moving forward with such applications, the Commission signals that it is open to modernization, provided that it adheres to achieving the objectives of longstanding laws and regulations that govern the securities markets. I hope that these exemptive order applications are not endpoints, but rather waypoints on a journey toward markets that are more fair, orderly, and efficient due to new innovations.</p>
<h2>C. First Principles, Enduring Mission</h2>
<p>Expectations vary: some predict rapid transformation while others caution that adoption might take years. The Commission&rsquo;s responsibility is to ensure that its regulations evolve as technology evolves&mdash;for the very same reason that the SEC cannot regulate in 2026 in the same manner as in 1934, when the agency was created.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s goal should be neither to bless every new innovation nor to resist change reflexively. Rather, it is to use its regulatory tools&mdash;including definitional authority and exemptive relief&mdash;so that the administration of the federal securities laws can evolve to address new technologies and innovation. Part of this responsibility includes providing transparency as to what is permitted, what requires prior authorization, and what is prohibited.</p>
<p>If financial regulators can carry out this process in an appropriate manner, capital markets will be able to operate in ways that reduce friction, improve price discovery, and serve investors better than ever before. Ultimately, that is the real objective of financial regulation.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, both Treasury clearing and tokenization serve as reminders that modernization is not an abstract goal&mdash;it is a practical necessity for resilient, transparent, and efficient markets. These initiatives demand continued engagement with market participants, robust consideration of benefits and costs, thoughtful evaluation of trade-offs among alternative approaches, and a respect for the legal authority governing the SEC&rsquo;s activities, including the procedural obligations required by the Administrative Procedure Act. These efforts are not simple and may take time, but they are essential. By approaching these changes methodically, the Commission can strengthen market infrastructure, promote responsible innovation, and ensure that America&rsquo;s capital markets continue to serve investors and the broader economy.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Fran&ccedil;ois Villeroy de Galhau, Governor of the Bank of France, today announced his decision to leave the Bank of France at the beginning of June to become President of the Fondation Apprentis d'Auteuil. Accordingly, he will step down from his position as Chair of the BIS Board of Directors.</p>
<p>Mr Villeroy de Galhau became Governor of the Bank of France and a member of the BIS Board of Directors in November 2015. He was appointed Chair of the BIS Board of Directors in January 2022 and previously served as Chair of the Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision (GHOS), the oversight body of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, from November 2019.</p>

<div class="pbtxtcontent">
<p>Mr Villeroy de Galhau has served the central banking community with distinction and has been a trusted colleague since he became Governor of the Bank of France. On behalf of the BIS, I would like to thank him for his leadership and commitment to our mission. It has been a pleasure to work alongside him to address the challenges facing central banks. His commitment to fostering global monetary and financial stability and to enhance the resilience of the financial system is deeply appreciated.</p>
<br /><br />
<p>On a personal level, I also worked alongside Fran&ccedil;ois in many forums, including during my tenure as Chair of the Basel Committee, and together with him as a member of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank. I am deeply grateful for his strategic leadership as well as his commitment to the public interest and to the pursuit of international cooperation. I will miss his optimism and principled approach to leadership. He has also become a valued friend and I wish him every success.</p>

<p>The Board will shortly begin the process of appointing a new Chair.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>Background:</em></p>
<p><em>The Board of Directors is responsible for determining the strategic and policy direction of the BIS, supervising BIS Management and fulfilling the specific tasks given to it by the Bank's Statutes. It meets at least six times a year.</em></p>
<p><em>The Board may have up to 18 members, including six ex officio Directors, comprising the central bank Governors of Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States. They may jointly appoint one other member of the nationality of one of their central banks. Eleven Governors of other member central banks may be elected to the Board.</em></p>
<p><em>The Board elects a Chair and may elect a Vice-Chair from among its members, each for a three-year term.</em></p>
<p><em>The GHOS is the oversight body of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS). The BCBS reports to the GHOS and seeks its endorsement for major decisions.</em></p>

<title>The EBA Launches Consultation On Simplifying The Credit Risk Framework</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-eba-launches-consultation-on-simplifying-the-credit-risk-framework-202629/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-eba-launches-consultation-on-simplifying-the-credit-risk-framework-202629/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) launched today a public consultation on its Discussion Paper on the simplification and assessment of the credit risk framework.&nbsp;The Paper sets out preliminary ideas to enhance the usability, efficiency and simplicity of the credit risk framework, aiming to stimulate a broader discussion on how to better structure the EBA&rsquo;s future work in this area. Based on the comments received, the EBA will assess potential simplifications as part of its future policy work. The consultation runs until 10 May 2026.</span></p>
<p>The EBA&rsquo;s 2025&nbsp;<a href="https://eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2025-10/b8e0ef8e-2d49-43fc-b917-dbca3423588c/Report%20on%20the%20efficiency%20of%20the%20regulatory%20and%20supervisory%20framework.pdf">Report on the efficiency of the regulatory and supervisory framework</a>&nbsp;introduced a set of principles aimed at enhancing simplicity and efficiency across the regulatory landscape. This Report recommends the EBA launches a review of all the regulatory products it has developed (Level 2 and Level 3) since its establishment in relation to the Single Rulebook, starting with credit risk.&nbsp;As the credit risk area has accumulated a particularly large number of mandates under the EU Banking Package, the Discussion Paper examines how a systematic review of these mandates could be organised so that EBA&rsquo;s future work better supports efficiency and simplicity.</p>
<p>The Discussion Paper sets out concrete proposals to enhance the efficiency and simplicity of the credit risk framework within the remit of EBA&rsquo;s credit risk mandates. Because the framework must balance several key objectives, including risk‑sensitivity, comparability, and cost‑efficiency, assessing simplicity is inherently challenging. In addition to exploring potential policy simplifications, the paper also looks at improving the presentation of the framework by consolidating EBA products and aligning key regulatory definitions, thereby making the EBA&rsquo;s credit risk outputs more coherent and easier to navigate. It further highlights a number of challenges linked to specific mandates in the credit risk area and sets out measures to be applied in future mandated reports assessing the appropriateness of several elements laid down in the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR).</p>
<h4>Consultation process</h4>
<p>Comments to this consultation can be sent to the EBA by clicking on the "Send your comments" button on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/events/discussion-simplification-and-assessment-credit-risk-framework" title="Discussion on the simplification and assessment of the credit risk framework">consultation page</a>. Please note that the deadline for the submission of comments is 10 May 2026. All contributions received will be published following the close of the consultation, unless requested otherwise.</p>
<h4>Legal basis and background</h4>
<p>The EBA published in December 2023 its roadmap on the implementation of the EU Banking Package.&nbsp; In the area of credit risk, the new mandates assigned to the EBA relate in many cases to existing EBA products developed and implemented upon previous CRD-CRR requirements. Hence, the implementation of these mandates provides an opportunity to update those products and ensure greater consistency and efficiency across the framework.</p>
<p>The 2025 EBA Report on the efficiency of the regulatory and supervisory framework includes as one of its recommendations to launch a comprehensive review of both the new flow of mandates (i.e. those not yet consulted on) and the existing stock (current products from the Single Rulebook). This Discussion Paper outlines how such a review should be carried out in the credit risk domain and proposes initial avenues to streamline and enhance the usability of the framework.</p>

<title>CFTC Targets Relationship Investment Scams With National And International Initiatives This Valentine’s Week</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As Valentine&rsquo;s Day approaches, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission&rsquo;s Office of Customer Education and Outreach is leading&nbsp;national and international awareness efforts to warn the public about relationship investment scams, a form of fraud that costs Americans an estimated $10 billion each year.</p>
<p>The national, interagency&nbsp;<em>DatingOrDefrauding?</em>&nbsp;social media awareness campaign warns Americans to be skeptical of any requests from new online friends or romantic interests. The campaign highlights a common warning sign: requests to send crypto assets, or other forms of payment, to invest in scams through fake crypto websites.</p>
<p>In addition to the CFTC, participating organizations include:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BulletedHyperlink">Federal agencies: Department of Justice Criminal Division, Department of Labor Employee Benefits Security Administration, FBI, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation - Office of Inspector General, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, IRS Criminal Investigation, National Credit Union Administration, Securities and Exchange Commission, Social Security Administration Office of Inspector General, U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and U.S. Secret Service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BulletedHyperlink">State agencies:<span>&nbsp;Minnesota Department of Commerce, Oregon Department of Consumer and Business Services, Virgin Islands Lieutenant Governor&rsquo;s Office, Washington Department of Financial Institutions, and Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BulletedHyperlink">Non-governmental organizations:&nbsp;<span>FINRA, NFA, and North American Association of Securities Administrators.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Warning signs of relationship investment scams include an online friend or love interest who:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BulletedHyperlink">Is unable to meet in person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BulletedHyperlink">Moves conversations off social or dating platforms to encrypted messaging apps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BulletedHyperlink">Claims to be, or know, an expert crypto trader.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BulletedHyperlink">Offers to help the victim trade or invest money.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;Foreign criminals are exploiting dating apps, social media, messaging platforms, and artificial intelligence to steal money from American citizens,&rdquo; CFTC Chairman Michael S. Selig said. &ldquo;Keep your friends and family safe by warning them about this scam and encouraging them to keep their crypto assets safe&nbsp;<span>by using trusted and secure software systems and U.S.-regulated intermediaries</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>OCEO is also collaborating with the International Organization of Securities Commissions on a global initiative to raise public awareness and reduce victimization from the scams. The Valentine&rsquo;s week campaign builds on a similar effort conducted in October 2025, when 16 jurisdictions across five continents carried out coordinated educational outreach.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Initiatives timed around Valentine&rsquo;s Day are particularly effective, as scammers often exploit emotional vulnerability and the desire for companionship. By providing the information needed to recognize and avoid relationship investment scams, the initiatives, which will run from Wednesday through Saturday, aim to reduce victimization and financial loss during a potentially high-risk period.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>About Relationship Investment Scams</strong></p>
<p>Relationship investment scams are a type of romance fraud. Often referred to by the perpetrators as &ldquo;pig butchering,&rdquo; these schemes rely on dating apps, social media platforms, messaging apps, and even random &ldquo;wrong number&rdquo; text messages to target potential victims. The scammers use fake profiles, images, videos, and voices to appear trustworthy, attractive, and professional. After establishing frequent contact and building emotional connections, they claim to earn significant profits trading crypto assets, precious metals, or foreign currency and offer to help victims do the same.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Victims are ultimately directed to fraudulent trading platforms controlled by organized criminal networks, resulting in substantial financial losses.</p>

<p><span><strong>About the Office of Customer Education and Outreach</strong></span></p>
<p><span>OCEO is responsible for helping people and potential customers spot, avoid, and report fraud. This requires the office to work closely with internal and external stakeholders to monitor and identify current and developing fraud trends, develop timely and effective educational materials, messages, and outreach strategies, and alert the public to products, situations, or behaviors that could make them targets for crime.

<ul>
<li>
<h5>Access to innovative exchange-traded products (ETPs) within a transparent, competitive and regulated framework, ensuring efficiency and investor protection</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Professional investors on ETFplus will have the possibility to trade crypto-linked products covered by exchange-grade post trade services</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>A significant step in building a robust European market for digital assets to support growing institutional demand</h5>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Euronext, the leading European market infrastructure, today announces the launch of a new professional segment on ETFplus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new segment on ETFplus enables professional investors active in the Italian market to easily access exchange-traded crypto instruments, offering them the ability to build crypto exposure within a transparent, competitive and regulated market environment.</p>
<p>Euronext has confirmed expertise in this field and already offers a wide range of crypto-linked exchange-traded instruments on its Euronext Paris and Euronext Amsterdam venues, providing investors with access to over 100 products linked to a broad range of cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>All instruments admitted to the new professional segment on ETFplus will be traded in euro, cleared by Euronext Clearing and settled through Euronext Securities Milan. This reflects last year&rsquo;s expansion of Euronext Clearing&rsquo;s services to include cryptocurrency exchange-traded products and supports the integration of digital assets into the regulated financial ecosystem.</p>
<p>The initiative contributes to the development of a strong European market for digital assets by making these innovative financial instruments accessible within a robust regulatory framework. It ensures both efficiency and investor protection, aligns with supervisory authorities&rsquo; recommendations, and addresses the growing adoption of digital assets in international capital markets.</p>
<p>Instruments admitted to the professional segment are reserved exclusively for professional clients. Access is provided through authorised members directly connected to the ETFplus market, who are responsible for ensuring that these products are made available exclusively to professional clients.</p>
<p><span>Aurelien Narminio, Head of Indices, ETFs and Securitised Derivatives at Euronext, said:</span><em>&nbsp;&ldquo;The launch of the professional segment on ETFplus marks a significant milestone in our efforts to broaden access to crypto-linked instruments within Euronext&rsquo;s regulated market infrastructure. It underscores our determination to foster a robust European market for digital assets. Building on our strong footprint and track record in crypto-linked assets, this new segment lays a solid foundation for further innovation and supports the growing demand for these assets in a transparent, competitive and regulated framework.&rdquo;</em></p>

<title>Volumes And Open Interest Rapidly Increasing On The EEX Nordic Power Derivatives Market</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The European Energy Exchange (EEX) is continuing the strong development in its Nordic power derivatives markets in all of the key indicators for growing a successful market. Volumes in terms of trades and orders in both the system price and zonal contracts are quickly gaining momentum. Market shares are increasing as well as the EEX open interest in the major system price and zonal contracts. Furthermore, the impressive increase in number of active traders has been warmly received by market participants.</p>
<p>In January 2026, a volume of 3.6 TWh was traded in the EEX Nordic Power Futures which has significant growth compared to the previous month and is even +8,162% year-on-year. Market share growth in both the system and zonal contracts has been impressive, which now stands at approximately 10% in months, 20% in quarters and up to 25% in yearly contracts. Standing out in January was the Sweden 3 zone, where the EEX reached almost 20% exchange market share, which is the largest zone by volume, with 1.5 TWh traded on EEX, marking an all-time high.</p>
<p>Liquidity on EEX has increased noticeably since the start of the comprehensive liquidity programmes, which started on 1 September 2025. From September 2025 to January 2026 a volume of 12.9 TWh has been traded, while the total 2025 volume amounted to 11.7 TWh.</p>
<p>The growth in volumes is also reflected by a dynamically increasing Open Interest which is up over 90% compared to last year. EEX has doubled its market open interest share over the last few months to 6% in the System Price Futures, based on exchange data published by ESMA. Open Interest (OI) rate is the total number of unsettled derivatives contracts in a given market, indicating the interest level and liquidity of this market.</p>
<p>The impressive growth in volumes, open interest and market shares in the system and zonal contracts is reflected in the number of active traders, both in terms of the number of trades and orders. Traders have started to notice that EEX&rsquo;s Nordic power offering is growing and this is attracting new participants. EEX has especially been successful in adding new international market participants which are trading Nordic power for the first time. Over the past five months the number of active participants has steadily increased, with a record participation of 45 in January 2026.</p>
<p>Peter Reitz, CEO of EEX, comments:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s great to see liquidity growing and we have good arguments for traders to use our products for hedging. We provide choice for customers by offering system price and zonal products, offering dedicated customer support with our offices in Stockholm and Oslo and bring our larger continental European and US-based market participant base to the Nordics. In close collaboration with both international and local trading participants, we look forward to continued liquidity growth throughout 2026.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>EEX&rsquo;s product offering for the region includes both Nordic System Price contracts, the so-called Zonal Futures with price determination for each Nordic delivery area, and Implied EPADs, a combination of Zonal Futures and the Nordic System Price Futures, which provide the benefit of the location spread effect. This setup reduces capital requirements through cross-margining effects.</p>

<title>UK VC Funding Activity Faces Challenges In 2025 With Contraction In Both Deal Volume And Value, Finds GlobalData</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span><span>The UK venture capital (VC) landscape faced a challenging environment in 2025, with dealmaking momentum slowing both in terms of volume and value compared to the previous year. The total number of VC deals announced in the country declined by around 17% in 2025 compared to 2024, while the corresponding funding value witnessed a year-on-year (YoY) decline of around 3%, according to&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.gqh-2BaxUzlo7XKIuSly0rC502qyvSaH8suunkkct0v9nAw2i9NVNQPXGQip5nqGg3CtRFeWroc-2BgaLT7uNoevmgBBG2t9SWipjUkpf5vvgOFwTxmzHp0lxy8O85H4dALsaQobEfiowcL1jmrK5VNpfmvURobeTfOXfvlQai6Bp2GK1fh2Au6BODh4NDnIRAJZVSmfPgq3Np5kVcnHyEjCLFgRL-2FzH3pA1rzKt37GS66Q-3DjhZN_awSuR00uK8EZood8su7v4ItMFr0d7S5MNR1CcvAHRb7u8JiSB5Axp3o6-2Brp7TTn9jFAQeaiwuDUNp6ED3yPnAqPtLtA7N0aAz15yM-2Fa7YbLjEsQ0GRAa40BulYCiuXYlZuSNUmUBt77HjIUAMkqEOPMgZk4uOTWzgjLfsxTqPlXnkF6tLNEebE1KbTirMIT6E5PlOg2SEpKs9w5Xd6-2Fj2BRCI7hOv15-2BcG8wVshjpZUhwXvsCvFja-2F82Lgk9jf54zvMz7vdBvcIYUO93DB62YusD97DqlWv6E4jg1wIdDVfD9HnkjjIRdY8R9Rkz7NywOqc1UVHnzo8Nv9ysEgpE8US61oNG-2FCZV0aiHvDbQg5I-3D" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">GlobalData</span></span></span></a><span>, a leading intelligence and productivity platform.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Aurojyoti Bose, Lead Analyst at GlobalData, comments:&nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;Compared with a 3% YoY decline in overall global deal volume and 31% growth in global value, the contraction indicates that the UK saw a sharper pullback than the broader market. Nevertheless, while the steeper decline in deal volume in the UK points to tighter diligence, the comparatively modest drop in value suggests investors are still backing promising companies, particularly those demonstrating clear routes to profitability and scalable unit economics.&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Nexus Global Payments (NGP) appoints Payments Network Malaysia (PayNet) and Network for Electronic Transfers Singapore (NETS) joint venture as the Nexus Technical Operator (NTO). This follows a competitive procurement process involving global bidders and marks a major milestone in building an interoperable global payments infrastructure.</p>
<p>The evaluation of bidders considered technical capability, operational resilience, cost efficiency, and alignment with Nexus&rsquo; vision for global interoperability. PayNet and NETS joint venture emerged as the preferred partner due to the proven track record of the two leading ASEAN payment networks behind it and their commitment to innovation and collaboration.</p>
<p>The newly appointed NTO will work closely with leading global firms Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ &lsquo;AMZN&rsquo;) and Endava (NYSE &lsquo;DAVA&rsquo;) to deliver the technical design and development of the Nexus platform. Amazon Web Services is a global cloud technology leader that has made cloud computing and generative AI accessible to organisations of every size and industry whilst Endava leads the end-to-end design and engineering, applying its AI-native approach and deep industry expertise to build a resilient, future-ready solution. This global delivery capability and collaboration ensures that Nexus is built to meet international standards, scalable from inception and reflects best practices drawn from a wide range of payment system environments. The NTO will be responsible for building, operating, and maintaining the Nexus infrastructure, ensuring compliance with global standards, and delivering robust cybersecurity and operational resilience. It will also coordinate the onboarding of entities that are responsible for managing domestic instant payment schemes that will connect to Nexus to enable the banks and non-bank entities participating in these domestic systems to be part of the network.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Our partnership with PayNet and NETS is a major milestone towards our vision for an interoperable global payments network. With our chosen partners&rsquo; proven expertise and commitment to innovation, we are confident that Nexus will be resilient, aligned with international standards from day one, and ready for future global scale. Nexus is shaping a future where cross-border payments are instant, accessible, and seamlessly connected.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p><b><i>- Andrew McCormack, CEO, NGP</i></b></p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Being selected as the Nexus Technical Operator alongside NETS is a significant honour for Malaysia. It reflects the trust in our domestic capabilities and our growing track record in enabling cross-border payments. Through DuitNow and our regional interoperability efforts, we&rsquo;ve shown what&rsquo;s possible and now we&rsquo;re ready to scale that impact globally through Nexus. We&rsquo;re proud to be part of this next chapter in building a more connected, inclusive, and seamless global payment ecosystem.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p><b><i>- Praveen Rajan, CEO, PayNet</i></b></p>
<p><i>&ldquo;We are deeply honored to be selected as the Nexus Technical Operator, in partnership with PayNet. This appointment reflects a strong vote of confidence in our ability to build and operate payment infrastructure at scale and reinforces Singapore&rsquo;s pivotal role in advancing cross-border payment innovation. The NETS Group was involved in establishing the first bilateral cross-border linkage between Singapore and Thailand for account-to-account transfers in 2021 and we are excited to bring this spirit of innovation to enable seamless cross-border payments through a 'network-to-network' ecosystem. We look forward to advancing the vision of borderless payments, working collaboratively towards a modern, real-time international payment network infrastructure.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p><b><i>- Lawrence Chan, Group CEO, NETS</i></b></p>
<p>PayNet is Malaysia&rsquo;s national payments network and shared infrastructure provider, operating services such as DuitNow Transfer and DuitNow QR. It plays a central role in modernising and innovating Malaysia&rsquo;s digital payment agenda. NETS is Singapore&rsquo;s leading payment solutions provider, backed by over forty years of experience in delivering secure, efficient payment systems in Singapore and expanding in recent years to offer regional connectivity. The joint venture combines PayNet&rsquo;s domestic expertise and NETS&rsquo; technical capabilities to deliver a world-class platform for Nexus. This partnership reflects a shared commitment to innovation and financial inclusion across Asia and beyond.</p>
<p>The selection of the NTO represents pivotal progress toward Nexus&rsquo;s first live deployment across its initial cohort of countries. With technical development scheduled to begin in early 2026 and go-live targeted for 2027, this trajectory reflects NGP&rsquo;s unwavering commitment to delivering a sustainable, scalable, and globally interoperable solution&mdash;one that redefines speed, transparency, and accessibility in international transactions.</p>
<p>Nexus simplifies cross-border payments by connecting domestic real-time payment systems. It reduces reliance on intermediaries, cuts costs, and enables users to send and receive money internationally within seconds, through familiar banking or payment apps.</p>

<title>ICE Mortgage Monitor: Early-January Rate Decline Unlocks Refinance Opportunity For Nearly 5 Million Homeowners - Affordability Reaches Four-Year High But Remains Structurally Stretched As Home Price-To-Income Ratios Remain Elevated</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ice-mortgage-monitor-early-january-rate-decline-unlocks-refinance-opportunity-f-202629/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ice-mortgage-monitor-early-january-rate-decline-unlocks-refinance-opportunity-f-202629/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE: ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today released its February 2026 ICE Mortgage Monitor Report. According to the analysis, early January declines in mortgage rates unlocked refinance opportunities for nearly five million borrowers and helped push affordability to a four-year high.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even small reductions toward 6% rates can significantly boost affordability, particularly for homeowners who could refinance into a lower rate and monthly payments,&rdquo; said Andy Walden, Head of Mortgage and Housing Market Research at ICE. &ldquo;When rates hit 6.04% on January 9, the number of homeowners in the money to refinance jumped by 20% and affordability hit its best level in four years. That said, affordability remains structurally challenged, with home prices still elevated relative to incomes and meaningful differences emerging across regions and borrower segments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Key findings from the February Mortgage Monitor include:</p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li><span>Refinance incentives surged to a nearly four-year high following early-January interest rate declines<br /><br /></span>On January 9, interest rates reached 6.04%, according to the ICE 30-year conforming fixed rate index&nbsp;<span>,</span>&nbsp;which put roughly 4.8 million borrowers &ldquo;in the money&rdquo; for a refinance &mdash; the highest level since early 2022. That drop effectively increased the eligible population by 20% overnight. Although some of that benefit has since receded, the episode underscores how sensitive the market is to rate shifts in the high‑5% to low‑6% range. Nearly 1.3 million recently originated mortgages carry rates between 6.875% and 6.99%, including more than half a million from 2025, making it the most common rate band last year, and the most sensitive to interest rate drops.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li><span>Housing affordability reached its best level since early 2022, but remains stretched by historical standards<br /><br /></span>In early January, the monthly principal and interest payment needed to purchase the average-priced home fell by -$164 (-7%) year over year to $2,091, reducing the share of median household income required to 27.8%. Despite the improvement, the national home price-to-income ratio remains elevated at roughly 4.8:1, well above its long-run average near 4:1. To revert back to pre-pandemic home price-to-income ratios, household incomes would need to rise a little over 15%, assuming home prices remain flat.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li><span>Negative equity is increasing modestly, concentrated in recent vintages and select Southern markets<br /><br /></span>More than 1.1 million borrowers ended 2025 underwater &mdash; the highest level since early 2018 &mdash; with negative equity heavily concentrated among FHA and VA loans originated in 2022 or later. Several Southern markets now have more than one in 10 mortgaged homes underwater, even as national equity levels remain historically strong.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li><span>Home price growth slowed to its weakest pace in more than a decade, with regional divergence widening<br /><br /></span>U.S. home prices rose just 0.6% in 2025, marking the smallest calendar year growth since 2011. The Northeast and Midwest continue to provide stability, while price declines in the South and West are increasingly weighing on national averages.</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s market is full of cross‑currents &mdash; borrowers responding quickly to rate shifts, affordability improving for some but not others, and pockets of rising credit stress,&rdquo; said Bob Hart, President of ICE Mortgage Technology. &ldquo;Our end-to-end mortgage platform helps servicers and lenders make sense of those moving parts and act on opportunity. It gives them a clearer view of who might benefit from refinancing, where portfolio risks are building, and how to engage customers with the right options at the right time &mdash; all while supporting timely follow-through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The full February Mortgage Monitor report contains a deeper analysis of payment performance trends, and housing market trends featuring ICE Home Price Index (HPI) data.</p>

<p>IOSCO published today it&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iosco.org%2Flibrary%2Fpubdocs%2Fpdf%2FIOSCOPD813.pdf&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cmailing-lists%40iosco.org%7C30c1ea71a5ff4157f65208de67bdb30f%7Cbcc6c66cdb3b48328af2cc363a097444%7C0%7C0%7C639062261608243551%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=Xe97tmeZh%2BP%2FTUCDALhxas5DitEfFMEItk2f2nfveEw%3D&amp;reserved=0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">2026 Work Program</a>.</p>
<p>Building on its 2025 Work Program, IOSCO will keep its focus on strengthening capital markets. IOSCO&rsquo;s key strategic priorities for 2026 are:&nbsp;<strong>(i) Strengthening Financial Resilience and Market Effectiveness, (ii) Protecting investors, (iii) The evolution of Public and Private Markets; (iv) Technological transformation,</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>(v) Promoting regulatory cooperation and effectiveness</strong>.</p>
<p>While the work programme showcases IOSCO&rsquo;s initiatives, IOSCO remains committed to&nbsp;<strong>close collaboration</strong>&nbsp;with other international organizations and standard setters such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World Bank and the Financial Stability Board (FSB) to address emerging risks and shared global challenges, promote greater alignment in regulatory approaches, and support initiatives related to&nbsp;<strong>capital markets development</strong>.</p>
<p>Overview of IOSCO's 2026 Work Program</p>
<p><strong>1. Strengthening Financial Resilience and Market Effectiveness</strong></p>
<p>Ensuring the resilience of the global financial system remains a key pillar of IOSCO&rsquo;s mandate. IOSCO will finalize several ongoing work streams, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its review of the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iosco.org%2Flibrary%2Fpubdocs%2Fpdf%2FIOSCOPD811.pdf&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cmailing-lists%40iosco.org%7C30c1ea71a5ff4157f65208de67bdb30f%7Cbcc6c66cdb3b48328af2cc363a097444%7C0%7C0%7C639062261608267634%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=ifWdOBLM87WQR82E%2B3FrsG0nmdGKa%2BGzKhaMc8RArS8%3D&amp;reserved=0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">IOSCO Principles for the Valuation of Collective Investment Schemes.</a></li>

</ul>
<p>New key initiatives in this field for 2026 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Seeking to address issues related to over-the-counter&nbsp;<strong>(OTC) derivatives</strong>&nbsp;reporting fragmentation.</li>
<li>Work on the impact of market microstructures on liquidity and of&nbsp;<strong>extended trading hours</strong>&nbsp;on equity trading venues.</li>
<li>Contributing to FSB&rsquo;s work on issues of&nbsp;<strong>non-bank data</strong>&nbsp;availability, use and quality.</li>
<li>Contributing, as necessary, to follow-up work on the issue of&nbsp;<strong>leverage in non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI)</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>IOSCO will continue to develop work to&nbsp;<strong>strengthen the operational resilience of Financial Market Infrastructures</strong>&nbsp;(FMIs) through the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI)-IOSCO Operational Resilience Group. This work both considers whether there are gaps in the effectiveness of FMIs&rsquo; management of third-party risks and how to address potential gaps in FMI&rsquo;s cyber resilience.</p>
<p><strong>2. Protecting Investors</strong></p>
<p>IOSCO will further strengthen its efforts in investor education by launching its first&nbsp;<strong>TechSprint</strong>, in partnership with the UK Financial Conduct Authority&rsquo;s AI Lab. This initiative aims to leverage technology to develop educational resources that empower retail investors to navigate the novel products available to them, understand the risks and opportunities associated, and identify scams.</p>
<p>IOSCO will also explore these&nbsp;<strong>novel products</strong>, such as crypto-asset funds, private credit vehicles and retail-facing derivatives, which offer greater choice to investors but may also introduce new risks.</p>
<p>IOSCO will continue to engage with platform providers such as social media companies, search engines and internet providers to advocate for the restriction and monitoring of harmful or fraudulent content, and to promote the use of&nbsp;<strong>I-SCAN</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; its Enhanced Investor Alerts Portal. This new system offers a global real-time database of supervisory alerts on unauthorised firms and known scams to improve the protection of clients and investors and fight financial fraud.</p>
<p><strong>3. The Evolution of Public and Private Markets</strong></p>
<p>Capital markets are evolving, with a significant decline in public debt and equity issuance, and a rise in trading fragmentation and growth in private markets, introducing new complexities.</p>
<p>Key initiatives in this field include:</p>
<ul>
<li>An exploration of the growing interconnectedness between&nbsp;<strong>private equity</strong>&nbsp;activities and the&nbsp;<strong>audit sector</strong>.</li>
<li>Contribution to the FSB&rsquo;s deep dive on&nbsp;<strong>private credit</strong>.</li>
<li>Research work on the functioning of&nbsp;<strong>public markets</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Technological transformation</strong></p>
<p>The adoption of&nbsp;<strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong>, the intersection of digital assets with traditional finance and the rise of&nbsp;<strong>tokenization</strong>&nbsp;all present significant opportunities for financial markets and their investors but they can also present risks.</p>
<p>In 2026, IOSCO will advance its&nbsp;<strong>crypto-asset roadmap</strong>&nbsp;by finalizing a formal methodology for crypto and digital assets assessments, initiate regular thematic reviews, and continue to monitor developments arising from financial technology adoption.</p>
<p>IOSCO will also develop&nbsp;<strong>a supervisory tool kit on AI</strong>&nbsp;and guidance for firms on disclosures and governance in relation to AI and will focus on Supervisory Technology (<strong>SupTech</strong>), after the recent creation of a dedicated collaborative forum for members to share knowledge on how technology and in particular AI-powered tools can boost the efficiency of supervision and enforcement.</p>
<p><strong>5. Promoting Regulatory Cooperation and Effectiveness</strong></p>
<p>Promoting regulatory cooperation and effectiveness remains a key strategic priority of IOSCO. A key priority will be to assist members from emerging markets to build sound and robust capital markets, through&nbsp;<strong>enhanced capacity building</strong>, strengthened partnerships with international financial institutions, and direct assistance in addressing identified challenges.</p>
<p>Regulatory cooperation remains central to the effective delivery of these priorities. In particular, the IOSCO Multilateral Memorandum of Understanding (MMoU), with 131 signatories, is the&nbsp;<strong>global gold standard</strong>&nbsp;for international enforcement cooperation for financial markets.</p>
<p>IOSCO will continue to support MMoU signatories, including by encouraging them to upgrade to the Enhanced MMoU (EMMoU) and by conducting training and reviews. IOSCO will also continue to support non-signatories in meeting the requirements for adoption, ensuring that the global safety net against misconduct remains tight.</p>
<p>IOSCO will continue its&nbsp;<strong>regular reviews</strong>, promoting the consistent application of securities regulation worldwide.</p>
<p>IOSCO will also continue to deliver tailored capacity-building initiatives as part of the NEXTGEN program. In that context, a new dedicated&nbsp;<strong>e-learning platform</strong>&nbsp;will be developed during 2026 to expand the reach and value of this key part of IOSCO&rsquo;s mission.</p>

<title>Comment From Hina Sattar Joshi, Director At TP ICAP, Digital Assets - - Bitcoin 'Boom And Bust' Pattern</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><b>Market sentiment</b></p>
<p>The recent sharp swings in crypto prices underscore how the market&rsquo;s infrastructure is still evolving and its impact on volatility. Sentiment is currently very fragile, with investors anchoring themselves to the traditional four-year&nbsp;Bitcoin cycle, in which Bitcoin&rsquo;s price historically follows a recurring pattern of &lsquo;boom and bust&rsquo;. We&rsquo;ve seen over the past couple of weeks BTC ETFs experiencing significant outflows, while Ethereum and XRP products have attracted notable inflows. This trend points to a rotation in risk appetite, rather than a mass exit from the asset class.</p>
<p><b>Policy and market structure</b></p>
<p>Structural forces continue to steer institutional appetite for digital assets.&nbsp; Sentiment toward the recently announced collaboration between the SEC and CFTC on &lsquo;Project Crypto&rsquo;, aiming to unify US regulation, was muted compared to the enthusiasm compared to recent policy milestones like the GENIUS Act. This reaction reflects&nbsp;already fragile market sentiment, combined with concerns that the initiative risks a complex, dual-layered regulatory framework that could stifle growth.</p>
<p>Turning to the UK and Europe, we&rsquo;re seeing cleaner digital asset frameworks being established, as regulatory alignment reduces uncertainty and enables greater institutional participation. Looking at the UK specifically, the HM Treasury&rsquo;s DIGIT (Digital Gilt Instrument) programme, which will issue short-dated native gilts on blockchain infrastructure, marks a meaningful step towards modernising capital markets and is drawing significant interest as engagement shifts from exploratory to operational.</p>
<p>Progressive policies and greater conviction from policymakers outside of the US raise the question of whether USD-backed stablecoins will remain the dominant use case, or whether other stablecoins will&nbsp;be able to capture market share.</p>

<p>Japanese stocks soared to record highs as bonds weakened and the yen hit an all-time low against the Swiss franc after Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi secured a decisive victory in Sunday&rsquo;s snap election.</p>
<p>Takaichi&rsquo;s Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) captured 316 of the 465 seats in the lower house of parliament, granting her the mandate to advance her ambitious spending plans and tax relief initiatives without needing to negotiate with opposition parties. The LDP&rsquo;s supermajority also enables the government to pass legislation without requiring approval from the upper house.</p>
<p>The Nikkei 225 surged 5.7% to an unprecedented 57,337.07 by 0146 GMT, with 197 of its 225 components gaining. The broader Topix index climbed 3.4% to a record-breaking 3,825.67, reflecting widespread market optimism over the election results.</p>

<title>ASIC Action Sees FIIG Securities Ordered To Pay $2.5 Million Over Cyber Security Failures</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Australian&nbsp;fixed-income&nbsp;specialist,&nbsp;FIIG Securities Limited (<strong>FIIG</strong>), has been ordered to pay $2.5 million in pecuniary penalties after ASIC brought a case against the firm for failures to protect thousands of clients from cyber security threats for more than four years.</p>
<p>FIIG&rsquo;s failures worsened a 2023 cyber-attack which saw around 385 gigabytes of confidential information stolen and highly sensitive client data leaked onto the dark web &ndash; including driver&rsquo;s licences, passport information, bank account details and tax file numbers.</p>
<p>FIIG notified some 18,000 clients that their personal information may have been compromised.</p>
<p>FIIG admitted that it failed to comply with its Australian Financial Services (AFS) licence obligations and that adequate cyber security measures &ndash; suited to a firm of its size and the sensitivity of client data held &ndash; would have enabled it to detect and respond to the data breach sooner. It also admitted that complying with its own policies and procedures could have supported earlier detection and prevented some or all of the client information from being downloaded.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Federal Court today ordered FIIG to pay a $2.5 million penalty and pay $500,000 towards ASIC&rsquo;s costs. The Court also ordered FIIG to undertake a compliance programme involving the engagement of an independent expert to ensure its cyber security and cyber resilience systems are reasonably managed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>ASIC&nbsp;Deputy&nbsp;Chair&nbsp;Sarah Court&nbsp;said,&nbsp;&lsquo;Cyber-attacks&nbsp;and&nbsp;data breaches&nbsp;are&nbsp;escalating&nbsp;in both scale and sophistication,&nbsp;and inadequate&nbsp;controls&nbsp;put&nbsp;clients and&nbsp;companies&nbsp;at real risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;ASIC expects financial services licensees to be on the front foot every day to protect their clients. FIIG wasn&rsquo;t &ndash; and they put thousands of clients at risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In this&nbsp;case,&nbsp;the&nbsp;consequences&nbsp;far exceeded&nbsp;what it would have cost&nbsp;FIIG&nbsp;to implement&nbsp;adequate controls&nbsp;in the first place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is the first time the Federal Court has imposed civil penalties for cyber security failures under the general AFS licensee obligations, setting a clear licence-to-operate expectation for robust cyber resilience.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Clients entrust licensees with sensitive and confidential information, and that trust carries clear responsibilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FIIG&rsquo;s&nbsp;cyber security&nbsp;failures between 13 March 2019 to 8 June 2023 included&nbsp;examples where it&nbsp;did not:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>allocate the necessary financial resources to have suitably qualified and experienced people available, or implement adequate technological resources to manage cyber security</li>
<li>implement adequate cyber security measures, including multi-factor authentication for remote access users, strong passwords and access controls for privileged accounts, appropriate configuration of firewalls and security software, regular penetration testing and vulnerability scanning</li>
<li>have a structured plan to ensure key software systems were being updated to address security vulnerabilities</li>
<li>have qualified IT personnel monitoring threat alerts to identify and respond to cyber-attacks</li>
<li>provide mandatory cyber security awareness training to staff, and&nbsp;</li>
<li>have an appropriate cyber incident response plan that was tested at least annually.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&lsquo;Entities that fail to maintain proper cyber security controls risk regulatory action by ASIC and exposure to malicious exploitation,&rsquo; the Deputy Chair said.</p>
<p>ASIC expects AFS licensees to prioritise cyber-resilience and invest in people, systems and governance which are fit-for-purpose for entity size and the sensitivity of client information held.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>FIIG provides retail and wholesale investors with access to fixed income investments and bond financing. As an AFS licensee, FIIG plays an important role in providing custodial and trading services, maintaining records of client investments, and holding funds and fixed income investments on behalf of its clients. At the time of non-compliance, FIIG held approximately $3 billion in client assets under management.</p>
<p>ASIC&nbsp;identified&nbsp;cyber-attacks, data breaches and/or inadequate operational resilience and crisis management within its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/news-items/key-issues-outlook-2026/" title="Key issues outlook 2026">2026 key issues outlook</a>, and expects AFS licensees to prioritise and invest in systems that protect their customers and&nbsp;maintain&nbsp;integrity in the financial system.</p>
<p>This case was ASIC&rsquo;s second cyber security enforcement action. In May 2022, the Federal Court ruled AFS licensee, RI Advice, had breached its license obligations to act efficiently and fairly when it&nbsp;failed to&nbsp;have adequate risk management systems to manage its cyber security risks (<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2022-releases/22-104mr-court-finds-ri-advice-failed-to-adequately-manage-cybersecurity-risks/" title="22-104MR Court finds RI Advice failed to adequately manage cybersecurity risks">22-104MR</a>).</p>
<p>ASIC filed civil proceedings against financial advice business Fortnum Private Wealth Limited in July 2025, alleging it&nbsp;failed to&nbsp;properly manage&nbsp;and mitigate&nbsp;cyber security&nbsp;risks (<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-143mr-asic-sues-fortnum-private-wealth-for-allegedly-failing-to-adequately-manage-cybersecurity-risks/" title="25-143MR ASIC sues Fortnum Private Wealth for allegedly failing to adequately manage cybersecurity risks">25-143MR</a>).</p>
<p>FIIG has admitted it failed to comply with its AFS licence obligations by:</p>
<ul>
<li>failing to take all necessary steps to ensure its financial services were provided efficiently, honestly and fairly, including by not having adequate measures in place to protect clients from the risks and consequences of a cyber incident</li>
<li>failing to&nbsp;have&nbsp;available adequate&nbsp;financial,&nbsp;technological&nbsp;and human resources to&nbsp;comply with&nbsp;its obligations and&nbsp;support adequate&nbsp;cyber security&nbsp;measures, and&nbsp;</li>
<li>failing to have&nbsp;an adequate risk management system&nbsp;manage or&nbsp;mitigate&nbsp;cyber security&nbsp;risks to FIIG and its clients.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
